Through the succession of lifeterms kamma holds sway over the individual evolutionary current
Acts of will once completed recede into the forward moving mental stream out of which they emerged and remaining in the form of psychic potencies pilot the future course of evolution to be taken by that particular current of experience called an individual being Just as the kamma rises up out of the stream of consciousness so does the stream of consciousness again flow forth from the germinative kamma which thus serves to link into a single chain the series of separated lives
The kammic force drives the current of consciousness onward into new modes of existence conformable to its nature it determines the specific form of life in which the individual will take remanifestation the set of faculties with which the new being will be endowed and a substantial portion of the happiness and suffering that being will meet during the course of its life
It is therefore not God or chance in the Buddhist picture but the differentiation in volitional action functioning across the succession of lives that accounts for the differentiation in the animate order and the differentiation in action again that divides beings into the high and low the happy and the miserable the gifted and the deprived
As the Buddha declares Beings are the owners of their actions heirs of their actions
Their action is the source from which they spring their kinsman and their refuge
Action divides beings into the inferior and the superior
Since the effective determinant of destiny is kamma and kamma is essentially volition this means that the operative factor in the formation of future becoming is lodged in the individual will
The will from the Buddhist perspective is no accidental offshoot of the machinery of nature compelled to its course by the conspiracy of cosmic forces it is rather in the deepest sense the artisan behind the entire process of animate evolution
Here will is primary and the material factors secondary the plastic substance with which the will works and by which it gives tangible expression to its store of dispositional tendencies
The varied landscape of sentient existence for Buddhism represents but an outward register of the inward transactions of the will and the hierarchy of living forms  the great chain of being  but a congellation of its functional modalities in the world of spatiotemporal extension
Differentiation in the biological sphere is thus preceded and paralleled by a set of transformations in the mental sphere which finds in animate nature the channel for actualizing its own potentialities throughout the series of successive becomings comprising the individual continuum
Through the exercise of our will therefore we build for ourselves our own world independent of coercion by extrinsic forces and mould the destiny that awaits us in time to come whether for happiness or misery for bondage or liberation
For the spiritual aspirant however it is not sufficient merely to understand the theoretical ground for the differentiation of living beings
For us it is of the utmost importance to know what we can do to further our own progress along the scale of spiritual evolution  to advance to higher levels of attainment during the course of our earthly life to secure a rebirth conducive to spiritual growth in the life to come and ultimately to transcend this repetitive cycle of birth and death and attain Nibbana the supreme and irreversible deliverance
The answer to this problem begins with the fact that kamma divides itself according to its moral quality into two types  the unwholesome and the wholesome
Unwholesome kamma is action  physical verbal or mental  that springs from the three unwholesome roots of action greed hatred and delusion
Any action grounded in these roots is spiritually detrimental and morally defective
It destroys the higher faculties entails suffering as its consequence and causes a plunge into lower states of existence in short it brings decline along the scale of spiritual evolution and deeper immersion in the mire of phenomenal existence
Wholesome kamma on the other hand is action springing from the three contrary wholesome roots  nongreed nonhatred and nondelusion finding positive expression in the qualities of charity lovingkindness and wisdom respectively
Wholesome action functions in a way diametrically opposite to its dark counterpart
It is spiritually beneficial and morally commendable stimulates the unfolding of the higher faculties and entails happiness both in the present and in time to come
Consistently practiced it promotes progress along the evolutionary scale leading to higher states of existence in successive lifespans and finally to the realization of deliverance
On ultimate analysis life is a selfregenerating sequence of occasions of experience comprising occasions of action and occasions of reception
Action is volition and volition inevitably involves decision or choice  a selection from the welter of possibilities open to the will of that alternative most conformable to the individual's purpose a selection even at a higher level of the purposes themselves
Every moment of morally significant action therefore confronts us with the call for a decision with the necessity for choice
Choice must work within the gamut of options open to the will and these options despite their great differences of qualitative character necessarily fall into one of two classes according to their ethical nature  into the wholesome or the unwholesome
The one leads to progress the other to decline
Thence progress or decline depends entirely upon our choice and not upon any external agency whether conceived in spiritualistic or materialistic garb
Through our fleeting momentary decisions accumulated over long periods we model our fortune and chisel out of the unshaped block of futurity the destiny that will befall us in the span of time to come
Each call for a decision may be depicted as a ladder one end leading upward to unknown heights and the other extending downward into forbidding depths while our successive decisions may be taken as the steps that lead us up or down the ladder's graded rungs
Or again each moment of action may be compared to a crossroad at which we stand a forked road one side of which leads to a city of bliss and the other to a swampland of misery and despair
The two roads stand fixed and silent awaiting our choice and only our decision determines whether we shall reach the one destination or the other
In sum then it is our kamma that precipitates our destiny for it is kamma that brings about manifestation of all the destinations or realms of sentient existence and kamma ultimately that fashions the entire variegated landscape of sentient existence itself according to the ethical tone of its associated moral roots
As the Exalted One explains speaking not through speculation but through his own direct penetration of the paths leading to all destinations
It is not creatures of the hells of the animal kingdom of the ghostly realm or any others of a miserable form of existence that appear through action born of nongreed born of nonhate born of nondelusion it is rather celestial beings humans or any other creatures belonging to a happy form of existence that make their appearance through action born of nongreed nonhate and nondelusion
Anguttara Nikaya
The performance of deeds of merit forms one of the most essential elements of Buddhist practice
Its various modes provide in their totality a compendium of applied Buddhism showing Buddhism not as a system of ideas but as a complete way of life
Buddhist popular belief has often emphasized merit as a productive source of worldly blessings  of health wealth long life beauty and friends
As a result of this emphasis meritorious activity has come to be conceived rather in terms of a financial investment as a religious business venture yielding returns to the satisfaction of the agent's mundane desires
While such a conception no doubt contains an element of truth its popularization has tended to eclipse the more important function merit plays in the context of Buddhist practice
Seen in correct perspective merit is an essential ingredient in the harmony and completeness of the spiritual life a means of selfcultivation and an indispensable steppingstone to spiritual progress
The accumulation of a stock of merit is a primary requisite for acquiring all the fruits of the Buddhist religious life from a pleasant abiding here and now to a favorable rebirth in the life to come from the initial stages of meditative progress to the realization of the states of sanctity that come as the fruits of entering upon the noble path
The highest fruition of merit is identical with the culmination of the Buddhist holy life itself  that is emancipation from the shackles of samsaric existence and the realization of Nibbana the unconditioned state beyond the insubstantial phenomena of the world
The mere piling up of merit to be sure is not in itself sufficient to guarantee the attainment of this goal
Merit is only one requisite and it must be balanced by its counterpart to secure the breakthrough from bondage to final freedom
The counterpart of merit is knowledge the direct confrontation with the basic truths of existence through the eye of intuitive wisdom
Merit and knowledge together constitute the two sets of equipment the spiritual aspirant requires in the quest for deliverance the equipment of merit and the equipment of knowledge respectively
Each set of equipment has its own contribution to make to the fulfillment of the spiritual life
The equipment of merit facilitates progress in the course of samsaric wandering it brings a favorable rebirth the encounter with good friends to guide one's footsteps along the path the meeting with opportunities for spiritual growth the flowering of the lofty qualities of character and the maturation of the spiritual faculties required for the higher attainments
The equipment of knowledge brings the factor directly necessary for cutting the bonds of samsaric existence the penetration of truth enlightenment the undistorted comprehension of the nature of actuality
Either set of equipment functioning in isolation is insufficient to the attainment of the goal either pursued alone leads to a deviant onesided development that departs from the straight path to deliverance taught by the Buddha
Merit without knowledge produces pleasant fruit and a blissful rebirth but cannot issue in the transcendence of the mundane order and entrance upon the supramundane path
And knowledge without the factors of merit deteriorates into dry intellectualism mere erudition or scholasticism impotent when confronted with the task of grasping a truth outside the pale of intellection
But when they function together in unison in the life of the aspirant the two sets of equipment acquire a potency capable of propelling him to the heights of realization
When each set of equipment complements the other polishes the other and perfects the other then they undergo a graduated course of mutual purification culminating at the crest in the twin endowments of the Emancipated One  in that clear knowledge and flawless conduct which make him in the words of the Buddha supreme among gods and humans
But while merit and knowledge thus occupy coordinate positions it is merit that claims priority from the standpoint of spiritual dynamics
The reason is that works of merit come first in the process of inner growth
If knowledge be the flower that gives birth to the fruit of liberation and faith the seed out of which the flower unfolds then merit is the soil water and fertilizer all in one  the indispensable nutriment for every stage of growth
Merit paves the way for knowledge and finds in knowledge the sanction for its own claim to a place in the system of Buddhist training
The reason for this particular sequential structure is closely linked to the Buddhist conception of noetic realization
From the Buddhist standpoint the comprehension of spiritual truth is not a matter of mere intellectual cogitation but of existential actualization
That is it is a matter of grasping with our whole being the truth towards which we aspire and of inwardly appropriating that truth in a manner so total and complete that our being becomes transformed into a very reflex and effusion of the truth upon which we stand
The understanding of truth in the context of the spiritual life in other words is no affair of accumulating bits and pieces of information publicly accessible and subjectively indifferent it is rather a process of uncovering the deepest truths about ourselves and about the world and of working the understanding that emerges into the entire complex of the inner life
Hence the use of the words actualization and realization which bring into the open the ontological backdrop underlying the noetic process
In order to grasp truth in this totalistic manner at any particular stage of spiritual development the tenor of our inner being must be raised to a pitch where it is fit for the reception of some new disclosure of the truth
Wisdom and character though not identical are at any rate parallel terms which in most cases mature in a delicately balanced ratio
We can grasp only what we are fit to grasp and our fitness is largely a function of our character
The existential comprehension of truth thus becomes a matter of inward worth of deservingness or of merit
The way to effect this inward worthiness is by the performance of works of merit not merely outwardly but backed by the proper attitudes and disposition of mind
For the capacity to comprehend truths pertaining to the spiritual order is always proportional to the store and quality of accumulated merit
The greater and finer the merit the larger and deeper the capacity for understanding
This principle holds at each level of maturation in the ascent towards full realization and applies with special force to the comprehension of ultimate truth
Ultimate truth in the Buddha's Teaching is Nibbana the unconditioned element and realization of ultimate truth the realization of Nibbana
Nibbana is the perfection of purity the destruction of all passions the eradication of clinging the abolition of every impulse towards selfaffirmation
The final thrust to the realization of Nibbana is the special province of wisdom since wisdom alone is adequate to the task of comprehending all conditioned phenomena in their essential nature as impermanent suffering and notself and of turning away from them to penetrate the unconditioned where alone permanent freedom from suffering is to be found
But that this penetration may take place our interior must be made commensurate in purity with the truth it would grasp and this requires in the first instance that it be purged of all those elements obstructive to the florescence of a higher light and knowledge
The apprehension of Nibbana this perfect purity secluded from the dust of passion is only possible when a corresponding purity has been set up within ourselves
For only a pure mind can discern through the dark mist of ignorance and defilement the spotless purity of Nibbana abiding in absolute solitude beyond the turmoil of the phenomenal procession
The achievement of such a purification of our inward being is the work of merit
Merit scours the mind of the coarser defilements attenuates the grip of the unwholesome roots and fortifies the productive power of the wholesome beneficial states
Through its cumulative force it provides the foundation for wisdom's final breakthrough to the unconditioned
It is the fuel so to speak for the ascent of wisdom from the mundane to the supramundane
Just as the initial stages of a lunar rocket work up the momentum that enables the uppermost stage to break the gravitational pull of the earth and reach the moon so does merit give to the spiritual life that forward thrust that will propel the wisdomfaculty past the gravitational pull of the mundane order and permit it to penetrate the transcendental truth
The classical Buddhist commentators underscore this preparatory purgative function of merit when they define merit etymologically as that which purges and purifies the mental continuum
Merit performs its purgative function in the context of a complex process involving an agent and object of purification and a mode of operation by which the purification takes place
The agent of purification is the mind itself in its creative formative role as the source and matrix of action
Deeds of merit are as we have already seen instances of wholesome kamma and kamma ultimately reduces to volition
Therefore at the fundamental level of analysis a deed of merit consists in a volition a determinative act of will belonging to the righteous order
Since volition is a mode of mental activity this means that merit turns out under scrutiny to be a mode of mental activity
It is at the core of the behaviorpattern which serves as its vehicle a particular application of thought by which the mind marshalls its components for the achievement of a chosen end
This discovery cautions us against misconstruing the Buddhist stress on the practice of merit as a call for blind subjection to rules and rites
The primary instrument behind any act of merit from the Buddhist point of view is the mind
The deed itself in its physical or vocal dimension serves mainly as an expression of a corresponding state of consciousness and without a keen awareness of the nature and significance of the meritorious deed the bare outward act is devoid of purgative value
Even when rules of conduct are observed or rituals and worship performed with a view to the acquisition of merit the spiritual potency of these structures derives not from any intrinsic sanctity they might possess in themselves but from their effectiveness in channelizing the current of mental activity in a spiritual beneficial direction
They function in effect as skillful means or expedient devices for inducing wholesome states of consciousness
Mechanical conformity to moral rules or the performance of religious duties through unquestioning obedience to established forms far from serving as a means to salvation in the Buddhist outlook actually constitute obstacles
They are instances of clinging to rules and rituals the third of the fetters binding beings to the wheel of becoming which must be abandoned in order to enter upon the path to final deliverance
Even in such relatively external forms of meritmaking as the undertaking of moral precepts and ceremonial worship mindfulness and clear comprehension are essential much more then are they necessary to the predominantly internal modes of meritorious activity such as meditation or the study of the Dhamma
The object of the purifying process of merit is again the mind only here considered not from the standpoint of its immediacy as a creative source of action but from the standpoint of its duration as a continuum
For looked at from the temporal point of view the mind is no stable entity enduring selfidentical through its changing activities it is rather a serial continuity composed of discrete acts of mentation bound to one another by exact laws of causal interconnection
Each thoughtunit flashes into being persists for an extremely brief moment and then perishes passing on to its immediate successor its storage of recorded impressions
Each individual member of the series inherits preserves and transmits along with its own novel modifications the entire content of the series as a whole which thus underlies every one of its components
Thence the series maintains despite its discontinuous composition an element of uniformity that gives to the flow of separate thoughtmoments the character of a continuum
This sequential current of mentation has been going on according to Buddhism without discernible beginning
Driven forward from life to life by ignorance and craving it appears now in one mode of manifestation now in another
Embedded in the mental continuum throughout its beginningless journey is a host of particularly afflictive and disruptive mental forces known as kilesas defilements Foremost among them are the three unwholesome roots  greed hatred and delusion from this triad spring the remaining members of the set such as pride opinion selfishness envy sloth and restlessness
During moments of passivity the defilements lie dormant at the base of the mental continuum as anusaya or latent tendencies
But when either through the impact of outer sensory stimuli or their own subliminal process of growth they acquire sufficient force they surge to the surface of consciousness in the form of obsessions
The obsessions pollute the mind with their toxic flow and rebound upon the deeper levels of consciousness reinforcing their roots at the base of the continuum
If they should gather still additional charge the defilements may reach the even more dangerous stage of transgression when they erupt as bodily or verbal actions that violate the fundamental laws of morality and lead to pain and suffering as their retributive consequence
When merit is said to purge and purify the mental continuum it is so described in reference to its capacity to arrest the surging tide of the defilements which threatens to sweep the mind towards the perilous deep of transgressional action
Only wisdom  the supramundane wisdom of the noble paths  can eradicate the defilements at the level of latency which is necessary if the bonds of existence are to be broken and deliverance attained
But the practice of merit can contribute much towards attenuating their obsessive force and establishing a foothold for wisdom to exercise its liberating function
Wisdom can operate only upon the base of a purified mind the accumulation of merit purifies the mind hence merit provides the supporting condition for wisdom
When the mind is allowed to flow according to its own momentum without restraint or control like a turbulent river it casts up to the surface  ie to the level of active consciousness  the store of pollutants it harbors at its base lust hatred delusion and their derivative defilements
If the defilements are then given further scope to grow by indulging them they will wither the potential for good darken the beam of awareness and strangle the faculty of wisdom until it is reduced to a mere vestige
The performance of meritorious deeds serves as a means of resisting the upsurge of defiling states of replacing them with their wholesome opposites and of thereby purifying the mental continuum to an extent sufficient to supply wisdom with the storage of strength it requires in the work of abolishing the defilements
The effectiveness of merit in purifying the mental continuum stems from the concordance of a number of psychological laws
These laws which can only be indicated briefly here together function as the silent groundwork for the efficacy of the entire corpus of Buddhist spiritual practice
The first is the law that only one state of consciousness can occur at a time though seemingly trivial this law leads to important consequences when taken in conjunction with the rest
The second holds that states of consciousness with mutually opposed ethical qualities cannot coexist
The third stipulates that all the factors of consciousness  feeling perception volition and the remaining states included in the aggregate of mental formations  must partake of the same ethical quality as the consciousness itself
A kammically active state of consciousness is either entirely wholesome or entirely unwholesome it cannot be both
Therefore if a wholesome state is occurring no unwholesome state can simultaneously occur
A wholesome spiritually beneficial state of consciousness necessarily shuts out every unwholesome detrimental state as well as all unwholesome concomitant factors of consciousness
So at the moment one is performing an act of merit the consciousness and volition behind that meritorious deed will automatically preclude an unwholesome consciousness volition and the associated defilements
At that moment at least the consciousness will be pure
And the frequent performance of meritorious acts will on every occasion bar out the opportunity for the defilements to arise at the time of their performance
Thus the performance of deeds of merit always induces a momentary purification while the frequent performance of such deeds induces many occasions of momentary purification
But that some more durable result might be achieved an additional principle is necessary
This principle is supplied by the fourth law
The fourth law holds that repetition confers strength
Just as the exercise of a particular muscle can transform that muscle from a frail ineffectual strip of flesh into a dynamo of power and strength so the repeated exercise of individual mental qualities can remodel them from sleeping soldiers into invincible warriors in the spiritual quest
Repetition is the key to the entire process of selftransformation which constitutes the essence of the spiritual life
It is the very grounding that makes selftransformation possible
By force of repetition the fragile tender shoots of the pure and wholesome qualities  faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom  can blossom into sovereign faculties in the struggle for enlightenment or into indomitable powers in the battle against the defilements
By repeated resistance to the upsurge of evil and repeated application to the cultivation of the good the demon can become a god and the criminal a saint
If repetition provides the key to selftransformation then volition provides the instrument through which repetition works
Volition acts as a vector force upon the mental continuum out of which it emerges reorienting the continuum according to its own moral tone
Each act of will recedes with its passing into the onward rushing current of mentation and drives the current in its own direction
Wholesome volitions direct the continuum towards the good  towards purity wisdom and ultimate liberation unwholesome volitions drive it towards the evil  towards defilement ignorance and inevitable bondage
Every occasion of volition modifies the mental life in some way and to some degree however slight so that the overall character of an individual at any one time stands as a reflex and revelation of the volitions accumulated in the continuum
Since the will propels the entire current of mental life in its own direction it is the will which must be strengthened by force of repetition
The restructuring of mental life can only take place through the reformation of the will by leading it unto wholesome channels
The effective channel for reorientation of the will is the practice of merit
When the will is directed towards the cultivation of merit it will spontaneously hamper the stream of defilements and bolster the company of noble qualities in the storage of the continuum
Under its gentle tutelage the factors of purity will awaken from their dormant condition and take their place as regular propensities in the personality
A will devoted to the practice of charity will generate kindness and compassion a will devoted to the observance of the precepts will generate harmlessness honesty restraint truthfulness and sobriety a will devoted to mental culture will generate calm and insight
Faith reverence humility sympathy courage and equanimity will come to growth
Consciousness will gain in tranquillity buoyancy pliancy agility and proficiency
And a consciousness made pure by these factors will advance without hindrance through the higher attainments in meditation and wisdom to the realization of Nibbana the consummation of spiritual endeavor
Prince Siddhattha renounced the life of the palace and entered the forest as a hermit seeking a solution to the problem of suffering
Six years after entering he came out a Buddha ready to show others the path he had found so that they too could work out their deliverance
It was the experience of being bound to the perishable and unsatisfying that gave the impetus to the Buddha's original quest and it was the certainty of having found the unperishing and perfectly complete that inspired the execution of his mission
Thence the Buddha could sum up his Teaching in the single phrase I teach only suffering and the cessation of suffering But though the Buddha's Teaching might be simple in its statement the meaning behind the verbal formulation is profound and precise
The Buddha envisages suffering in its full range and essence rather than in its mere manifest forms
It is not just physical or mental pain that he means by suffering but the recurrent revolution of the wheel of becoming with its spokes of birth aging and death
Taking our immersion in a condition intrinsically inadequate as the starting point of his doctrine he devotes the remainder to showing the way out of this condition
The solution the Buddha offers to the problem of suffering draws its cogency from the strict logic of causality
Suffering is neither an accident nor an imposition from without but a contingent phenomenon arising through the force of conditions
It hangs upon a specific set of supports and is therefore susceptible to treatment by tackling the genetic structure which maintains it in being
By removing the conditions out of which it arises it is possible to bring the whole phenomenon of suffering to an end
In order to reach the state of emancipation it is of the first importance that the causal chain which originates suffering be snapped in the right place
Any proposed solution which does not remedy the problem of suffering at its source will eventually prove to be only a palliative not a final cure
That the chain be broken in the right place requires an accurate determination of the interconnection of its links
The chain must be traced back to its most fundamental factor and cut off at that very point
Then suffering will no longer be able to arise
According to the Buddha's Teaching the primary link in the sequence of conditions generating suffering is ignorance
Ignorance is a primordial blindness to the true nature of phenomena it is a lack of understanding of things as they really are
It functions as a mental obscuration cloaking our normal process of cognition and permeating our thought patterns with distortion and error
Among the various misconceptions produced by ignorance the most basic is the apprehension of phenomena through the category of substantial existence
Phenomena are not isolated units locked up in themselves but participants in an interconnected field of events
Their being derives from the entire system of relata to which they belong not from some immutable core of identity intrinsic to themselves
Thence they are devoid of an abiding essence their mode of being is insubstantial relational and interdependent
However under the influence of ignorance this essenceless nature of phenomena is not understood
It is blotted out by the basic unawareness and as a consequence phenomena present themselves to cognition in a mode different from their actual mode of being
They appear substantial selfsubsistent and exclusivistic
The sphere where this illusion is most immediately felt is the sphere where it is most accessible to us  namely our own experience
The experiential domain is reflectively divisible into two sectors  a cognizing or subjective sector made up of consciousness and its adjuncts and a cognized or objective sector made up of the cognitive data
Though the two sectors are interlocking and mutually dependent through the operation of ignorance they are conceptually bifurcated and reduced to an adventitious subjectobject confrontation
On the one side the cognizing sector is split off from the experiential complex and conceived as a subject distinct from the cognitive act itself the objective sector in turn congeals into a world of external things pointing to the subject as its field of action and concern
Consciousness awakens to itself as a persisting ego standing up against the world as an other perpetually estranged from itself
Thence it commences its long career of conquest control and domination in order to justify its own suspect claim to a selfsubsistent mode of being
This cognitive error with its consequent solidification of the ego is the source of the afflictions which hold us in subjection to suffering
The lurking suspicion that the mode of being we credit to ourselves may be unfounded arouses an inner disquietude a chronic anxiety compelling a drive to fortify the sense of egoity and give it solid ground on which to stand
We need to establish our existence to ourselves to give inner confirmation to our conception of personal substantiality and this need occasions the ordering of the psychic life around the focal point of ego
The bid for selfconfirmation makes its impact felt on both the emotional and intellectual fronts
The dominion of the ego in the emotional sphere appears most conspicuously in the weight of the unwholesome roots  greed hatred and delusion  as determinants of conduct
Because the ego is essentially a vacuum the illusion of egohood generates a nagging sense of insufficiency
We feel oppressed by an aching incompleteness an inner lack requiring constantly to be filled
The result is greed a relentless drive to reach out and devour whatever we can  of pleasure wealth power and fame  in a never successful attempt to bring the discomfort fully to an end
When our drive to satisfaction meets with frustration we react with hatred the urge to destroy the obstacle between our desire and its satisfaction
If the obstructions to our satisfaction prove too powerful for the tactics of aggression a third strategy will be used dullness or delusion an attitude of deliberate unawareness adopted as a shell to hide our vulnerability to pain
On the intellectual front the egoillusion engenders a move by reason to establish on logical grounds the existence of a substantial self
The idea I am is a spontaneous notion born of ignorance the basic unawareness of the egoless nature of phenomena
By accepting this idea at its face value as pointing to a real I and by attempting to fill in the reference we develop a view of self a belief confirming the existence of a self and giving it an identity in the framework of our psychophysical constitution
The theories which emerge invariably fall into one or another of the two metaphysical extremes  either eternalism when we assume the self to enjoy eternal existence after death or annihilationism when we assume the self to be extinguished at death
Neither doctrine can be established on absolutely compelling grounds for both are rounded on a common error the assumption of a self as an enduring substantial entity
Because the pivot of our cognitive adherences and their emotional ramifications is the notion of an ego a powerful current of psychic energy comes to be invested in our interpretive schemes
And because the notion of an ego is in actuality groundless the product of a fundamental misconception this investment of energy brings only disappointment in the end
We cling to things in the hope that they will be permanent satisfying and substantial and they turn out to be impermanent unsatisfying and insubstantial
We seek to impose our will upon the order of events and we find that events obey a law of their own insubordinate to our urge towards control
The result of our clinging is eventual suffering
Yet this suffering which arises from the breakdown of our egocentric attempts at dominance and manipulation is not entirely negative in value
It contains a tremendous positive value a vast potential for by shattering our presumptions it serves to awaken our basic intelligence and set us on the quest for liberation
It forces us to discover the ultimate futility of our drive to structure the world from the standpoint of the ego and makes us recognize the need to acquire a new perspective free from the compulsive patterns which keep us tied to suffering
Since the most fundamental factor in the bondage of the ego is ignorance to reach this new perspective ignorance must be eliminated
To eliminate ignorance it is not sufficient merely to observe rules of conduct to generate faith devotion and virtue or even to develop a calm and concentrated mind
All these are requisites to be sure essential and powerful aids along the path but even in unison they are not enough
Something more is required some other element that alone can ensure the complete severing of the conditional nexus sustaining the round of samsaric suffering
That something more is understanding
The path to liberation is essentially a path of understanding
Its core is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are It is for one who knows and sees that the destruction of the defilements takes place not for one who does not know and does not see The objective domain where understanding is to be aroused is our own experience
Since our distorted interpretations of our experience provide the food which nourishes the process of ego it is here in experience that the egoillusion must be dispelled
Our own experience is of all things that which is closest to ourselves for it is through this that everything else is registered and known
And yet though so close our own experience is at the same time shrouded in darkness its true characteristics hidden from our awareness by the screen of ignorance
The Buddha's Teaching is the key which helps us to correct our understanding enabling us to see things as they are
It is the light which dispels the darkness of ignorance so that we can understand our own understanding of things just as a man with eyes might see forms illuminated by a lamp
The correct understanding of experience takes place in the context of meditation
It requires the development of insight based on a foundation of meditative calm
No amount of merely intellectual knowledge can replace the need for personal realization
Because our tendency to misconceive phenomena persists through a blindness to their true nature only the elimination of this blindness through direct vision can rectify our erroneous patterns of cognition
The practice of Buddhist meditation is not a way of dissolving our sense of individual identity in some undifferentiated absolute or of withdrawing into the bliss of a selfcontained interiority
It is rather a way of understanding the nature of things through the portal where that nature is most accessible to ourselves namely our own processes of body and of mind
The practice of meditation has profound effects upon our sense of identity the alterations it produces however do not come about by subordinating the intelligence to some uncritically accepted generalization but through a detached sober and exhaustive scrutiny of the experiential field that provides the locus for our sense of identity
The focal method of the practice of meditation is reflective awareness a bending back of the beam of awareness upon itself in order to illuminate the true characteristics of existence implicated in each occasion of cognition
The path of understanding unfolds in three successive stages called the three full understandings In the first stage the full understanding of the known the domain of experience is broken down by meditative analysis into its constituting factors which are then carefully defined in terms of their salient qualities and functions
The categories employed in this operation are the key terms in the Buddhist analysis of personality  the aggregates sense bases and elements
The purpose of this dissection is to dispel the illusion of substantiality that hovers over our gross perception of our experience
By revealing that what common sense takes to be a solid monolithic whole is in reality a conglomeration of discrete factors the contemplation deprives the sense of selfidentification of its chief support the notion of the ego as a simple unity
The factors which emerge from this analytical investigation are then correlated with their causes and conditions disclosing their contingency and lack of independence
The second stage of understanding is the full understanding of scrutinization
At this stage the experiential field is examined not as before in terms of its individuating features but by way of its universal marks
These universal marks are three impermanence suffering and nonself
Under the limitations of ordinary cognition phenomena are apprehended as permanent pleasurable and self
In the contemplative situation these assumptions must be corrected replaced by the perception of phenomena as impermanent unpleasurable and nonself
The task of the meditative process at this level is to ascribe these qualities to the material and mental processes and to attempt to view all phenomena in their light
When the second stage is fully mature it gives way gradually to the third type of comprehension the full understanding of abandonment
Here the momentary insights achieved at the previous level blossom into full penetrations
Impermanence suffering and selflessness are no longer merely understood as qualities of phenomena but are seen with complete clarity as the nature of phenomena themselves
These realizations bring about the final abandonment of the deluded perceptions as well as the destruction of the egotainted emotions which cluster around them
To walk the path of understanding is to begin to see through the deceptions which have held our imaginations captive through the long stretch of beginningless time
It is to outgrow our passions and prejudices and to cast off the mask of false identities we are accustomed to assume the vast array of identities that constitute our wandering in samsaric existence
The path is not an easy one but calls for great effort and personal integrity
Its reward lies in the happiness of growing freedom which accompanies each courageous step and the ultimate emancipation which lies at the end
Bhikkhu Bodhi is a Buddhist monk of American nationality born in New York City in
After completing a doctorate in philosophy at Claremont Graduate School he came to Sri Lanka in for the purpose of entering the Sangha
He received pabbajja in and upasampada in both under the eminent scholarmonk the Venerable Balangoda Ananda Maitreya with whom he studied Pall and Dhamma
He is the author of several works on Theravada Buddhism including four translations of major Pali suttas along with their commentaries
Since he has been the Editor for the Buddhist Publication Society and its President since
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
As a skilled and versatile teacher with mastery over pedagogic technique the Buddha adopted different styles of presentation to communicate the Dhamma to his disciples
Often he would explain a teaching in detail
Having introduced his topic with a short statement technically called the uddesa or synopsis he would then embark on the detailed exposition the niddesa also called the analysis the vibhanga
In this stage of the discourse he would break the subject introduced by the synopsis down into its component strands define each strand in turn and draw out its implications sometimes attaching a simile to illustrate the message of the discourse
Finally he would restate the introductory declaration as a conclusion now supported by the entire weight of the foregoing analysis
On other occasions however the Buddha would not teach in detail
Instead he would present the Dhamma briefly offering only a short sometimes even cryptic statement charged with a profound but highly concentrated meaning
The Buddha did not teach the Doctrine in this way in order to conceal an esoteric message or because he delighted in obscurantism
He used this technique because it sometimes proved a more effective means of shaking and transforming the minds of his auditors than would have been possible by a full elaboration
Although direct explanation of the meaning might have transmitted information more quickly such a method might not have produced the lasting and edifying effect the Dhamma is intended to instil
But by requiring the disciples to reflect upon the meaning and to tease it out by sustained inquiry as well as by mutual discussion the Buddha ensured that when the disciples did come to understand his utterance its message would penetrate deep into the silent recesses of the mind
While such brief teachings would escape the understanding of the great majority of the monks the mature disciples with sharp faculties of wisdom could readily fathom their meaning
Under such circumstances the ordinary monks reluctant to trouble their Master with requests for explanation would turn for clarification to the senior disciples whose comprehension of the Dhamma had already been confirmed by the Blessed One
So important did this function become in the early Buddhist Sangha that the Buddha himself established in the ranks of his most eminent disciples a separate category called the foremost of those who analyze in detail the meaning of what was stated in brief
The bhikkhu who was assigned to this position by the Master was the Venerable Maha Kaccana  Kaccana the Great so called to distinguish him from others who bore the common brahmanical clan name of Kaccayana
After his ordination as a bhikkhu the Venerable Maha Kaccana usually resided in his homeland of Avanti a remote region to the southwest of the Middle Country where the Buddha dwelt and thus he did not spend as much time in the Blessed One's presence as some of the other great disciples did such as Sariputta Maha Moggallana and Ananda
For this reason we do not find in the records of the Sutta Pitaka that the Venerable Maha Kaccana figured as prominently in Sangha affairs and in the Buddha's ministry as the aforementioned elders
Nevertheless on account of the astuteness of his intellect the profundity of his insight into the Dhamma and his skill as a speaker whenever Maha Kaccana did join the Buddha for extended periods the other monks frequently turned to him for help in illuminating the meaning of brief statements of the Buddha that had been causing them bafflement
As a result we find in the Pali canon a sheaf of discourses spoken by the Venerable Maha Kaccana that occupy a place of primary importance
These texts always methodically refined and analytically precise demonstrate with astounding lucidity the farranging implications and practical bearings of several brief statements of the Buddha that would otherwise without his explication of them escape our understanding
As in the case of all the Buddha's chief disciples the Venerable Maha Kaccana's elevation to a position of preeminence in the Sangha was the flowering of a seed that had been planted long ago in the rolling cycles of samsara the round of rebirths and had been brought to gradual maturity over countless lives
The biographical sketch of Maha Kaccana relates the story of the future disciple's original aspiration to a leading role in the Sangha
According to this account the aspiration was formed aeons in the past during the Dispensation of the Buddha Padumuttara
At that time Kaccana had been reborn into a wealthy householder family
One day he went to hear the Buddha preach and on that occasion during his sermon the Buddha appointed a certain bhikkhu as the foremost of those who can analyze in detail what had been stated by him in brief
The young householder was deeply impressed by the monk on whom this honor was bestowed and the thought occurred to him Great indeed is that bhikkhu in that the Teacher praises him so
I ought to attain such a position in the Dispensation of some future Buddha
But to attain such a lofty status in the Dispensation the generation of a wish is by no means sufficient
The aspiration must be supported by a base of meritorious deeds
Thus the young householder invited the Teacher to receive alms at his home and for a full week he bestowed lavish offerings on the Buddha and his company of monks
At the week's end he prostrated himself at the Blessed One's feet and voiced his heart's desire Venerable sir as the fruit of this offering I do not wish for any other achievement but this that in the future in the Dispensation of a Buddha I might obtain the same position as the bhikkhu you appointed to that position last week
Then Lord Padumuttara looking into the future with his unimpeded knowledge of a Fully Enlightened One saw that the youth's aspiration would be fulfilled
He told him Young man in the future after aeons have elapsed a Buddha named Gotama will arise
In his Dispensation you will be the foremost of those who can analyze in detail the meaning of what the Buddha has stated in brief
The Apadana relates that in this same past life Kaccana had built for the Buddha Padumuttara a stupa with a stone seat which he had covered with gold he had the stupa embellished with a jewelled parasol and an ornamental fan
According to the above text it was after he made this offering that the Lord Padumuttara predicted his future attainment to the position of a great disciple in the Dispensation of the Buddha Gotama
In this prediction the Blessed One also makes other prophecies concerning Kaccana's future sojourn in samsara which from our temporal perspective would now constitute his past history
The Buddha foretold that as the fruit of his meritorious gifts the householder would become a lord of the gods for thirty aeons exercising rulership over the gods
Having returned to the human world he would become a world monarch named Pabhassara whose body would emit rays of light all around
He would spend his next to last existence in the Tusita heaven and passing away from there he would be reborn in a brahman family with the clan name Kaccana
In that life he would attain arahantship and be appointed a great disciple by the Buddha
A later section of the Apadana gives a somewhat different account of Maha Kaccana's original aspiration to great discipleship
In this version at the time of the Buddha Padumuttara the future disciple was an ascetic living in seclusion in the Himalayas
One day while traveling through the sky by supernormal power he passed over a populated area and saw the Victorious One down below
He descended approached the Master to listen to the Dhamma and heard him praise a certain bhikkhu as the chief among those who can elaborate on brief statements
Thereupon the ascetic amazed by this unexpected encounter went to the Himalayas collected a bouquet of flowers and quickly returning to the assembly presented them to the Buddha
At that point he formed the aspiration to become the chief expositor of the Dhamma in the Dispensation of some future Buddha
The Lord Padumuttara then prophesied that his aspiration would be fulfilled aeons later when the Buddha Gotama arises in the world
In this same series of verses Maha Kaccana states that as a result of his offering to the Buddha he never took rebirth thereafter in the nether world  in the hells the animal realm or the sphere of ghosts  but was always reborn either in the world of gods or in the human realm
Also when he took rebirth as a human being he was always reborn into the upper two social classes  among nobles or brahmans  and never into lowclass families
One important incident which determined a particular feature of the great disciple's physical appearance during his final existence took place during the Dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa the immediate predecessor of Gotama in the lineage of Enlightened Ones
At the time of the Buddha Kassapa Kaccana had taken rebirth in a family of Benares
After the Lord Kassapa's Parinibbana he offered a precious golden brick for the construction of a golden stupa for the Buddha
On presenting it he made the wish Whenever I am reborn may my body always have a golden hue As a result of this when he was reborn during the time of our Buddha his body was endowed with a beautiful golden hue which deeply impressed those who beheld it
In one case which we will discuss below this physical attribute of the elder led to a bizarre series of events
In his last existence when the Buddha Gotama appeared in the world Kaccana was born as the son of the chaplain in the city of Ujjeni the capital of Avanti to the southwest of the Middle Country
His father's personal name was Tiritivaccha his mother's Candima and they were of the Kaccayana clan one of the oldest and most highly respected lines of brahmans
Since he was born with a golden colored body his parents exclaimed that he had brought his name along with him at birth and they named him Kañcana which means golden As a brahman and the son of the court chaplain when Kañcana grew up he studied the Three Vedas the traditional sacred scriptures of the brahmans and after his father's death he succeeded him in the position of court chaplain
The king of Avanti at the time that Kaccana became chaplain was Candappajjota Pajjota the Violent
He was known by this epithet because of his explosive and unpredictable temper
When King Candappajjota heard that the Buddha had arisen in the world he assembled his ministers and asked those who were so capable to go and invite the Blessed One to visit Ujjeni
The ministers all agreed that the only one who was truly capable of bringing the Buddha to Avanti was the chaplain Kaccana
The king therefore assigned him to go on this mission but Kaccana laid down a condition before he would accede to the king's request he would go only if he would be permitted to become a monk after meeting the Enlightened One
The king ready to accept any condition in exchange for a meeting with the Tathagata gave his consent
Kaccana set out accompanied by seven other courtiers
When they met the Master he taught them the Dhamma and at the end of the discourse Kaccana and his seven companions all attained arahantship together with the four analytical knowledges
The Buddha granted them ordination simply by welcoming them into the Sangha with the words Come bhikkhus
The new bhikkhu now the Venerable Maha Kaccana then began to praise the splendors of Ujjeni to the Buddha
The Master realized that his new disciple wanted him to travel to his native land but he replied that it would be sufficient for Kaccana to go himself as he was already capable of teaching the Dhamma and of inspiring confidence in King Candappajjota
In the course of their return journey the party of monks arrived at a town named Telapanali where they stopped to gather alms
In that town lived two maidens merchants' daughters of different families
One girl was beautiful with lovely long hair but both her parents had expired and she lived in poverty looked after by her governess
The other girl was wealthy but was afflicted with an illness that had caused her to lose her hair
Repeatedly she had tried to persuade the poor girl to sell her hair so she could make a wig but the poor girl had consistently refused
Now when the poor girl saw the Venerable Maha Kaccana and his fellow monks walking for alms their bowls as empty as if they had just been washed she felt a sudden surge of faith and devotion arise in her towards the elder and she decided to offer alms to the party of bhikkhus
However as she had no wealth the only way she could obtain money to buy provisions was to sell her hair to the rich girl
This time as the hair came to the rich girl already cut she paid only eight coins for it
With these eight coins the poor girl had almsfood prepared for the eight bhikkhus using one coin for each portion
After she had presented the alms as an immediate fruit of the meritorious deed her full head of hair instantly grew back to its original length
When the Venerable Maha Kaccana arrived back in Ujjeni he reported this incident to King Candappajjota
The king had the girl conveyed to his palace and at once appointed her his chief queen
From that time onwards the king greatly honored Maha Kaccana
Many people of Ujjeni who heard the elder preach gained faith in the Dhamma and went forth under him as monks
Thus the entire city became a single blaze of saffron robes a blowing back and forth of the banner of sages The queen who was exceedingly devoted to the elder built for him a dwelling in the Golden Grove Park
So says the Anguttara Commentary but the Pali canon itself suggests that the Sangha was not as well established in Avanti as the commentator would lead us to believe
This fact can be discerned from a story involving the Venerable Maha Kaccana that is reported in the Mahavagga of the Vinaya Pitaka
When this story unfolds the elder was dwelling in Avanti at his favorite residence the Osprey's Haunt on Precipice Mountain
A lay disciple of his named Sona Kutikanna came to him and expressed the wish to go forth under him as a monk
But Kaccana seeing perhaps that the householder was not yet ready to take such a big step discouraged him with the words Difficult Sona is it to sleep alone to eat one meal a day and to observe celibacy for as long as life lasts
While remaining a householder you should apply yourself to the Buddha's teaching and at the proper times you may sleep alone eat one meal a day and observe celibacy
With these words Sona's enthusiasm for ordination subsided
Some time later however the urge was rekindled and he approached the Venerable Maha Kaccana with the same request
A second time the elder discouraged him and a second time Sona's desire for ordination abated
When Sona approached him for the third time and asked for ordination Maha Kaccana gave him the going forth that is the initial ordination as a novice
During the Buddha's time it seems to have been customary to grant mature men already endowed with faith in the Dhamma and well acquainted with its tenets both ordinations in immediate succession
The novice ordination would be given first and then right afterwards the ceremony of higher ordination would be performed making the postulant a bhikkhu a full member of the Sangha
But at the time that the above incident took place Avanti was short of monks being a region quite far from the Buddha's own missionary rounds and from the other centers of Buddhist activity
According to the disciplinary regulations that were still in effect the higher ordination had to be performed by a chapter of at least ten bhikkhus
But such was the situation in Avanti that the Venerable Maha Kaccana could not easily find even nine other bhikkhus to confer the higher ordination on Sona
It was only three years later that the elder could with trouble and difficulty convene an assembly of ten bhikkhus from different places in the region to give Sona the higher ordination
When the Venerable Sona had completed his first rains retreat as a bhikkhu the wish arose in him to pay a visit to the Buddha
He had heard many times the highest praise of the Blessed One his lord and refuge yet he had never seen the Master face to face and now the desire to do so had become irresistible
He went to his preceptor to ask for his permission to make the long journey to Savatthi where the Buddha was residing
Not only did the Venerable Maha Kaccana applaud his disciple's desire to see the Buddha but he asked Sona to convey to the Lord an appeal that certain monastic regulations be relaxed to suit the different social and geographical conditions that prevailed in Avanti and in other border regions
When the Venerable Sona came to the Buddha and explained his preceptor's request the Master readily agreed
First to determine what districts should count as border regions the Buddha defined the boundaries of the Middle Country wherein the original regulations were to remain binding
Then he announced the revised versions of the rules that would apply in the border regions though not in the Middle Country
These revised rules are the following The higher ordination would not require ten bhikkhus but could now be given by a chapter of five one of whom must be a master of the Vinaya the monastic discipline
Monks are allowed to use sandals with thick linings as the ground in those regions is rough and hard on the feet
Monks are permitted to bathe frequently as the people of Avanti attach great importance to bathing
Sheepskins and goatskins etc could be used as coverlets
Robes could be accepted on behalf of a monk who has left the district and the ten days' period during which an extra robe could be kept would begin only when the robe actually reaches his hands
Neither the suttas nor the commentaries offer us abundant biographical information about the Venerable Maha Kaccana's life in the Sangha
They focus rather on his role as teacher especially on his detailed expositions of the Buddha's brief statements
From the settings to the suttas in which Maha Kaccana appears we can infer that after his ordination he spent most of his time in Avanti
Usually it seems he dwelt quietly in seclusion though when occasion arose he gave instruction to others
Periodically he would go to visit the Buddha at his main places of residence and it seems likely that he also sometimes accompanied him on his preaching tours
The three suttas of the Majjhima Nikaya in which Maha Kaccana appears in the role of expositor open at three different locales  in Kapilavatthu Rajagaha and Savatthi
As these cities were relative to the geographical extent of the Ganges Valley widely separated from each other and as all were far from Avanti this suggests either that the Venerable Maha Kaccana spent long periods accompanying the Buddha on his journeys or that he would travel to the different monastic centers where the Buddha resided when he heard that the Master intended to stay there for some time
We do not find in the texts indications that Maha Kaccana entered into close friendships with the other leading monks as for instance Sariputta Maha Moggallana and Ananda did with one another
He seems to be one who generally lived aloof though he did not place a strict emphasis on seclusion in the manner of one like the Venerable Maha Kassapa nor did he seem especially stern in his asceticism
He was ready to assume teaching duties on request as we shall see but we find that he always appears in the suttas in the role of expositor and elucidator of the Dhamma to others
We do not see the Venerable Maha Kaccana engage in persontoperson dialogues with other monks as we see in the case of all the abovementioned elders neither do we see him address inquiries to the Buddha as even the wisest of the bhikkhus the Venerable Sariputta often did
His absence is conspicuous in the Mahagosinga Sutta wherein the other outstanding disciples gather on a fullmoon night to discuss the ideal bhikkhu who could illuminate the forest
On that occasion six great elders  Sariputta Moggallana Ananda Maha Kassapa Anuruddha and Revata  each describe the ideal bhikkhu according to their particular dispositions and at the end the Buddha offers his own picture of the most worthy monk
Surely if Maha Kaccana was present on that occasion he would have described such a monk as one skilled in the detailed exposition of brief sayings
Maha Kaccana did grant ordination as we saw above in the case of Sona though his pupils were probably not very numerous despite the words of the Anguttara Commentary
One of his pupils was the bhikkhu Isidatta who even while very young had impressed many of the older monks with his incisive replies to difficult questions on the Dhamma
There can be little doubt that Isidatta's adroitness in tackling subtle points of doctrine reflects the rigorous training he must have received from the Venerable Maha Kaccana
On one occasion when the Venerable Maha Kaccana visited the Buddha he received special homage from Sakka the king of the gods
This occurred when the Buddha was dwelling at the Eastern Park at Savatthi in the Mansion of Migara's Mother
The Lord was sitting surrounded by a company of great disciples on the occasion of the pavarana the ceremony of mutual criticism among the monks which ends the annual rains retreat
Because Maha Kaccana regularly used to visit the Buddha in order to hear the Dhamma coming even from a long distance the other chief elders would always reserve a seat for him in case he should unexpectedly turn up
On this occasion Sakka along with his celestial retinue drew near to the holy assembly and prostrated himself before the Blessed One
Since he did not see the Venerable Maha Kaccana he thought to himself It would be good indeed if the noble elder would arrive Just at that moment Maha Kaccana approached and took his seat
When Sakka beheld him he grasped him firmly by the ankles expressed his joy over the elder's arrival and honored him with gifts of scents and flowers
Some of the younger monks were upset and complained that Sakka was being partial in his display of reverence but the Buddha reproved them with the words Monks those monks who like my son Maha Kaccana guard the doors of the senses are beloved both among gods and humans He then pronounced the following stanza of the Dhammapada
That the Venerable Maha Kaccana was actually one who devoted much attention to the mastery of the sense faculties is borne out by his discourses which often emphasize the need for guarding the doors of the senses
The commentaries record two curious series of events both of which stemmed from the impression that the elder's physical form made on the minds of others
One of these reported in the Dhammapada Commentary involved a young man named Soreyya who was the son of the treasurer in the city of the same name
One day the youth Soreyya was driving out of the city in a carriage en route to a bathing spot together with an intimate friend and a merry band of companions
Just as they were leaving the city the Venerable Maha Kaccana was standing at the city gate putting on his outer robe before entering to walk on alms round
When the youth Soreyya beheld the goldenhued body of the elder he thought to himself Oh that this elder might become my wife
Or may the hue of my wife's body become like the hue of his body
At the very moment this thought passed through his mind Soreyya was instantly transformed from a man into a woman
Startled by this inexplicable change of sex he jumped out of the carriage and fled before the others could notice what had occurred
Gradually he made his way to the city of Takkasila
His companions searched for him in vain and reported his strange disappearance to his parents
When all attempts to trace him proved futile his parents concluded that he had died and they had the funeral rites performed
Meanwhile the woman Soreyya on reaching Takkasila met the son of the city's treasurer who fell in love with her and took her as his wife
In the first years of their marriage she gave birth to two sons
Previously while a man Soreyya had fathered two sons through his wife in his native city
Thus he was the parent of four children two as a father and two as a mother
One day the former intimate friend of Soreyya came to Takkasila on some personal business
Lady Soreyya saw him in the street and recognized him
She called him into her house and revealed to him the secret of her mysterious metamorphosis from a man into a woman
The friend proposed that Soreyya should offer alms to the Venerable Maha Kaccana who was living close by and then beg pardon from him for having given rise to such a lewd thought
The friend then went to the elder and invited him to come to the lady's house for alms on the following day
When the Venerable Maha Kaccana arrived the friend brought Lady Soreyya into his presence informed him of what had happened long ago and asked him to pardon her for that transgression
As soon as the elder uttered the words I pardon you Lady Soreyya was transformed back into a man
Shaken out of all worldly complacency by this double metamorphosis Soreyya determined that he could never again lead the household life
He took ordination as a bhikkhu under Maha Kaccana and after a short time attained arahantship together with the supernormal powers
Vassakara the chief minister of Magadha under the parricide King Ajatasattu was less fortunate though his misfortune sprang entirely from his own pride and obstinacy and not from some force outside his control
The commentary to the Majjhima Nikaya reports that one day when Vassakara saw the Venerable Maha Kaccana coming down from the mountain Vulture Peak he exclaimed He looks just like a monkey Such an exclamation seems strange particularly as Maha Kaccana is described in the texts as being especially handsome and graceful in his physical presence
Whatever the reason for the remark news of the incident spread and eventually reached the Buddha
The Blessed One said that if Vassakara should go to the elder and beg his pardon all would be well but if he does not ask pardon he would be reborn as a monkey in the Bamboo Grove in Rajagaha
This was reported back to Vassakara
As the chief minister of the kingdom he must have been too proud to beg forgiveness from a mendicant monk
Thus reflecting that whatever the Buddha says must turn out to be true he resigned himself to his future fate and made preparations for his next existence by planting trees in the Bamboo Grove and setting up a guard to protect the wild life there
It is said that some time after his death a monkey was born in the Bamboo Grove who would draw near when one called out Vassakara
The circumstances of the Venerable Maha Kaccana's death are not recorded in the texts but at the end of the Madhura Sutta Maha Kaccana declares that the Buddha has attained Parinibbana so it is evident from this that he himself outlived his Master
The Buddha honored the Venerable Maha Kaccana by naming him his foremost disciple in the ability to provide detailed expositions of his own brief statements
Maha Kaccana earned this distinguished title principally because of eight suttas found in the Nikayas three in the Majjhima three in the Samyutta and two in the Anguttara
Besides these we find in the Nikayas several other discourses that the Venerable Maha Kaccana spoke without basing himself upon a brief utterance of the Buddha as his text
All these discourses taken together have a uniform and distinctive flavor revealing the qualities of the mind from which they sprang
They are thorough balanced careful and cautious substantial in content meticulous in expression incisive well conceived and well rounded
They are also admittedly a little dry  unemotional and unsentimental  but with no wastage of words they never fail to lead us straight to the heart of the Dhamma
The discourses of Maha Kaccana are bare of the rhetorical devices utilized by other renowned exponents of the Dhamma we find in them no similes parables or stories their language is plain but impeccably precise
In this respect his sermons contrast with those of the Buddha the Venerable Sariputta and the Venerable Ananda all of whom were skilled in devising striking similes that impress the formal message of the discourse indelibly on the auditor's mind
The Venerable Maha Kaccana's discourses it seems owe their effectiveness entirely to their content and analytical exactitude rather than to literary embellishment
As an analyst of the Dhamma the Venerable Maha Kaccana most closely approximates to the Venerable Sariputta and indeed the discourses of both exhibit similar traits
The difference between them is principally a matter of emphasis rather than of substance
Sariputta's analytic disquisitions as seen for example in the Sammaditthi Sutta and the Mahahatthipadopama Sutta begin with a specified topic and then develop by dissecting that topic into its component strands and exploring each component in turn
Within his own specialized sphere Maha Kaccana starts not with a general topic but with a short utterance of the Buddha often one that is intuitive poetic or exhortatory in character
His exposition then unfolds by reformulating the gnomic or inspirational phrasing of the Buddha's statement in ways that link it up with established more familiar frameworks of doctrine usually with the six spheres of sense and the practice of sense restraint
Yet despite their differences in emphasis both these great disciples share a predilection for systematic analysis and both display the same concern for razorsharp precision in their thinking
For this reason no doubt within the Theravada tradition each has come to be regarded as the father of a particular methodology for interpreting the Dhamma exegetical systems that rose to prominence in the early centuries of Buddhist intellectual history
Sariputta is of course viewed as the original systematizer of the Abhidhamma which he elaborated in detail based on the outlines that the Buddha taught him during his periodic visits to the human realm while expounding the Abhidhamma to the devas in the Tavatimsa heaven
Maha Kaccana is regarded as the author of a method of exposition embedded in two postcanonical works that exerted an important influence on the early Buddhist commentators
About these two works  the Petakopadesa and the Nettippakarana  we shall have more to say below
The first sutta in the Majjhima Nikaya in which the Venerable Maha Kaccana plays a prominent role is the Madhupindika Sutta the Honeyball Discourse a title assigned to it by the Buddha himself  perhaps a unique instance of the Buddha's conferring a title upon a sutta spoken by a disciple
The sutta opens on an occasion when the Buddha is dwelling at the city of Kapilavatthu in his native land the Sakyan republic
One day while the Buddha is sitting in meditation in Nigrodha's Park an arrogant Sakyan named Dandapani approaches him and asks him in a deliberately discourteous tone What does the recluse assert what does he proclaim The Buddha replies with an answer intended to underscore his own refusal to be dragged into the type of contention that his questioner wants to provoke
The reply is utterly incomprehensible to Dandapani who raises his eyebrows in bewilderment and departs
Later in the evening the Buddha informs the bhikkhus what had transpired
One monk inquires What exactly is the teaching that the Blessed One proclaims whereby one can avoid all quarrels and at the same time be free from the pernicious influence of craving The Buddha answers with the following pithy statement
Having said this before the monks even have time to ask for an explanation the Lord rises from his seat and enters his dwelling
After the Buddha has retired the bhikkhus ponder his statement and realizing that they cannot understand it on their own they consider The Venerable Maha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life
He is capable of expounding the detailed meaning
Suppose we went to him and asked him the meaning of this
When they approach Maha Kaccana and make their request he first chides them for coming to him rather than asking the Buddha to clarify it
To come to him when the Blessed One is present he says is like seeking heartwood among the branches and leaves of a great tree after passing over the trunk
The Blessed One is the one who knows and sees he is vision he is knowledge he has become the Dhamma become the holy one he is the sayer the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the giver of the Deathless the Lord of the Dhamma the Tathagata
The bhikkhus however while admitting that the elder's reproach is warranted still insist that he himself is able to explain the meaning
Finally the elder consents and then gives the following explanation of the Buddha's brief statement
The same pattern is repeated for each of the other sense bases
The elder then connects the entire exposition with the principle of conditionality showing how each term in the series arises in dependence on the preceding term and ceases with the cessation of its predecessor
This passage rich in implications offers a penetrative account of the process by which the deluded mind becomes overwhelmed by its own imaginary creations  its distorted perceptions and mental constructs
The sequence begins as a straightforward description of the conditioned genesis of cognition each type of consciousness arises in dependence on its respective sense faculty and object
The process unfolds in the natural order through contact feeling and perception as far as the stage of thinking
But in the unenlightened worldling who lacks correct insight into the true nature of things at the stage of thought cognition is vitiated by the influence of papañca a difficult Pali word best rendered as conceptual proliferation Instead of correctly comprehending the objects of perception the deluded mind infiltrated by papañca spins out a complex mental commentary which embellishes things with the erroneous notions of mine I and my self Thereby the person is overrun by perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation
The underlying springs of this conceptual proliferation are three defilements craving conceit and wrong view
When these three gain control of the thought process cognition runs wild churning up a host of delusive ideas obsessions and passions which overpower the subject and reduce him to their hapless victim
This process of sense perception as Maha Kaccana shows is the source through which perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation beset a person referred to by the Buddha in his brief statement
When there is no delighting in the process of perception by way of craving which elaborates upon experience in terms of the notion mine when there is no welcoming it by way of conceit which introduces the notion I am when there is no holding to it by way of wrong view which proliferates in notions of a self then all the underlying tendencies to the defilements will be uprooted and one can dwell in the world as a liberated sage holy and wise without quarrels conflicts and disputes
Such was the explanation of the Buddha's words that the Venerable Maha Kaccana offered to the monks
Afterwards the monks approached the Blessed One and told him what Maha Kaccana had said
The Buddha replied with words of the highest praise for his disciple Maha Kaccana is wise bhikkhus Maha Kaccana has great wisdom
If you had asked me the meaning of this I would have explained it to you in the same way that Maha Kaccana has explained it
Such is the meaning of this and so you should remember it
Just then the Venerable Ananda standing nearby added a memorable simile to highlight the beauty of Maha Kaccana's exposition Just as if a man exhausted by hunger and weakness came upon a honeyball in the course of eating it he would find a sweet delectable flavor so too venerable sir any able bhikkhu in the course of scrutinizing with wisdom the meaning of this discourse on the Dhamma would find satisfaction and confidence of mind On the basis of this simile the Buddha named the discourse the Madhupindika Sutta The Honeyball Discourse
The other two Majjhima Nikaya suttas featuring Maha Kaccana and one in the Anguttara Nikaya conform to this same stereotyped pattern the Buddha makes a brief statement gets up and enters his dwelling the monks approach the Venerable Maha Kaccana to ask for an explanation of the meaning he reprimands them for coming to him rather than asking the Lord himself but finally he complies with their request and elucidates the Buddha's utterance the monks return to the Buddha and repeat his analysis which the Master applauds with words of praise for the elder
The Maha Kaccana Bhaddekaratta Sutta centers around the famous Bhaddekaratta poem a set of verses spoken by the Buddha that had been circulating within the Sangha
The poem stresses the need to abandon longing for the past and anticipation of the future it calls instead for urgent effort to marshal one's energies for penetrating with insight the present reality itself
Many of the monks had learned the poem by heart along with the Buddha's own exegesis of it and had been using it as an inspiration for their meditation practice and as a theme for sermons
One bhikkhu named Samiddhi however did not know even the poem let alone its exegesis
One day a benevolent deity taking compassion on him came to him in the early morning and urged him to learn the Bhaddekaratta poem and exposition
The Venerable Samiddhi went to the Buddha and asked him to teach him the Bhaddekaratta summary and its analysis
The Buddha recited the poem
Then the Blessed One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling
Samiddhi and the other monks present at the time went to the Venerable Maha Kaccana in search of an explanation
As in the prelude to the Madhupindika Sutta Maha Kaccana at first remonstrates with them but then agrees to share his understanding of the poem
Taking up the first two lines as the theme of his exposition he explicates each by way of the six sense bases
One revives the past when one recollects the eye and forms seen in the past dwelling upon them with desire and lust so too with the other five sense faculties and their objects
One builds up hope upon the future when one sets one's heart on experiencing in the future sense objects one has not yet encountered
One who does not bind himself by desire and lust to memories of past sensory experience and yearnings for future sensory experience is one who does not revive the past or build up hope upon the future Similarly one whose mind is shackled by lust to the present sense faculties and their objects is called one vanquished in regard to presently arisen states while one whose mind is not bound to them by lust is called one invincible in regard to presently arisen states
Again the monks return to the Buddha who says if you had asked me the meaning of this I would have explained it to you in the same way that Maha Kaccana has explained it
The third Majjhima sutta the Uddesavibhanga Sutta opens with the Buddha announcing to the monks that he will teach them a summary and an exposition
He recites the summary thus
Then as on prior occasions he rises from his seat and retires without giving the exposition  a strange omission as he had announced that he would teach the exposition
But the monks do not feel lost for the Venerable Maha Kaccana is in their midst and after his usual protest he begins his analysis
He proceeds by taking up each phrase in the Buddha's summary and dissecting it in minute detail
How is consciousness distracted and scattered externally
When a monk has seen a form with the eye if his consciousness follows after the sign of form is tied and shackled by gratification in the sign of form is fettered by the fetter of gratification in the sign of form then his consciousness is called 'distracted and scattered externally'  But if on seeing a form with the eye etc the monk does not follow after the sign of form does not become tied and shackled to the sign of form then his consciousness is called 'not distracted and scattered externally' 
His mind is stuck internally if he attains any of the four jhanas the meditative absorptions and his mind becomes tied and shackled by gratification in the superior rapture bliss peace and equanimity of the jhana
If he can attain the jhanas without becoming attached to them his mind is not stuck internally
There is agitation due to clinging in the uninstructed worldling who regards his five aggregates as self
When his form or feeling or perception or volitional formations or consciousness undergoes change and deterioration his mind becomes preoccupied with the change and he becomes anxious distressed and concerned
Thus there is agitation due to clinging
But the instructed noble disciple does not regard the five aggregates as his self
Therefore when the aggregates undergo change and transformation his mind is not preoccupied with the change and he dwells free from anxiety agitation and concern
This the elder states is how he understands in detail the summary stated in brief by the Blessed One and when the monks report to the Master he endorses his disciple's explanation
The Samyutta Nikaya contains three suttas in which the Venerable Maha Kaccana displays his ingenuity in elaborating upon brief utterances of the Buddha SN SN and SN
These suttas are different both in setting and character from the three analytical discourses of the Majjhima Nikaya
In all three Maha Kaccana is not dwelling in the midst of the Sangha in close proximity to the Buddha but in Avanti at the Osprey's Haunt on Precipice Mountain presumably a remote place difficult of access
Then a lay devotee named Haliddikani evidently quite learned in the Dhamma comes to him and asks him to explain in detail a short discourse of the Buddha
Maha Kaccana's reply is addressed to the householder Haliddikani alone not to a group of monks and there is no subsequent confirmation of his exposition by the Buddha at the end of the discourse
It seems impossible to determine whether these exchanges took place during the Buddha's life or after his demise but obviously to have been incorporated into the Canon reports of the discussions must have reached the main centers of the Buddhist community
In SN Haliddikani asks the elder to explain in detail the meaning of a verse from The Questions of Magandiya included in the Atthakavagga of the Sutta Nipata
In responding to the lay devotee's request the Venerable Maha Kaccana introduces a methodology that is strikingly different from his approach to interpretation in the three suttas of the Majjhima Nikaya
Here he does not simply elaborate upon the literal meaning of the Buddha's statement drawing out its philosophical and practical implications as he did in those suttas
Instead he transposes the key expressions of the verse to a different level of discourse treating these expressions not merely as obscure terms in need of clarification and exemplification but as metaphors or figures of speech that to be properly understood must be redefined in terms of their nonfigurative meanings
He does this as we shall see just below by first eliciting from the selected figurative terms their implicit literal meanings and then mapping those meanings on to other more systematic frames of doctrine
This technique was to become characteristic of the Pali commentaries in later centuries and we might even regard Maha Kaccana's style of exegesis here as being in certain respects at least the original prototype of the commentarial method
Taking up first the expression having left home Maha Kaccana treats the word home not as bearing the literal meaning of a place where people live but as an elliptical reference to the home of consciousness
He explains that the home of consciousness is the other four aggregates  material form feeling perception and volitional formations  which are here referred to as elements elsewhere these are described as the four stations of consciousness
If consciousness is bound by lust to these four elements one is said to move about in a home
If one has abandoned all desire lust delight and craving for these four homes of consciousness one is said to roam about homeless
It should be noted that this last term does not itself occur in the verse but Maha Kaccana has introduced it into his exegesis as a description of one who has abandoned home
Next the elder explicates the phrase to roam without abode
He first defines the counterpart roaming about in an abode which also does not appear in the verse
As before Maha Kaccana treats this expression as a metaphor to be reformulated in terms of systematic doctrine
In this instance rather than using the five aggregates as his scaffold he draws in the six external sense bases
By being shackled to the sign of forms by moving about in the abode of forms etc one is called one who roams about in an abode When one has abandoned all bondage to the sign of forms etc cut them off at the root then one is said to roam without abode
The remaining sections of the exposition proceed more literally and simply explicate with straightforward definition the meaning of the phrases used in the verse always in terms of contrasting pairs
One who is intimate with none in the village is defined as a bhikkhu who keeps aloof from lay people and their worldly concerns
One rid of sensual pleasures is one devoid of lust and craving for sensual pleasures
One without preferences is one who does not yearn for the future
And one who would not engage people in dispute is one who does not become embroiled in quarrels and disputes over the interpretation of the Dhamma
In the next sutta Haliddikani asks how one should understand in detail the following brief statement of the Buddha found in The Questions of Sakka Those recluses and brahmans who are liberated by the full destruction of craving are those who have reached the ultimate end the ultimate security from bondage the ultimate holy life the ultimate goal and are best among devas and humans Maha Kaccana explains
Thus householder it is in such a way that the meaning of what was stated in brief by the Blessed One should be understood in detail
In a third sutta Haliddikani begins a query with a quotation from the Buddha but this time he does not ask how should the meaning of this brief statement be understood in detail Rather he simply requests the Venerable Maha Kaccana to explain the following excerpt from the Dhatusamyutta Bhikkhus it is in dependence on the diversity of elements that there arises the diversity of contacts in dependence on the diversity of contacts that there arises the diversity of feelings
The Buddha himself had explained this assertion by showing how the different kinds of elements condition their corresponding kinds of contact and feeling In dependence on the eye element there arises eyecontact in dependence on eyecontact there arises feeling born of eyecontact And so for the other sense faculties
The Venerable Maha Kaccana however does not merely parrot the Buddha's analysis but carries the divisions down to a finer level
The same analysis is applied to each of the other sense faculties
Thus while the Buddha merely differentiates the contact and feeling by way of the sense faculty the Venerable Maha Kaccana distinguishes within each sense sphere three qualities of the object  agreeable disagreeable and indifferent three qualities of the contact  to be felt as pleasant to be felt as painful and to be felt as neither and three qualities of the feeling  pleasant painful and neitherpainfulnorpleasant
These triads are then collated and shown to originate in a conditional relationship the quality of the object conditions the quality of the contact the quality of the contact conditions the quality of the feeling
As the entire process is said to be contemplated by a bhikkhu endowed with understanding this also implies that he has the capacity for overcoming the bondage to feelings by means of insight into their conditioned origination
The Anguttara Nikaya offers two further examples of Maha Kaccana's exegetical skills
In one short sutta in this collection we see how the elder interprets a verse the meaning of which seems completely explicit as it stands by transposing it into a figurative mode and then extracting the implicit meaning by mapping it on to a framework of systematic doctrine
Here a woman lay disciple named Kali comes to the elder and asks him to explain in detail a verse from The Girl's Questions The reference is to the account of the Buddha's encounter with Mara's daughters when they tried to seduce him in the first year after his Enlightenment
The daughter Tanha had asked him why instead of forming intimate relationships in the village he squanders his time meditating alone in the woods
To this the Buddha replied
It is this verse that Kali asks the Venerable Maha Kaccana to elucidate
The elder explicates the verse in a way that does not appear to be derivable from the words themselves
His interpretation contrasts the Buddha's attitude to the kasinas  the meditations on special devices for inducing concentration  with that of other recluses and brahmans
He explains that some contemplatives regarding the attainment of the earth kasina as the supreme goal thereby generate this attainment
Others may take one of the other kasinas as supreme  the water kasina the fire kasina etc
 and reach the corresponding meditative state
But for each kasina the Blessed One has directly understood to what extent it is supreme and having understood this he saw its origin he saw the danger he saw the escape and he saw the knowledge and vision of the true path and the wrong path
Having seen all this he understood the attainment of the goal and the peace of the heart
It is in this way the elder concludes that the meaning of the above verse should be understood in detail
Interpreted by way of its apparent meaning the verse seems to be extolling the bliss of secluded meditation above the pleasures of sensual and social contact  the very enjoyments with which Mara's daughters have been trying to tempt the Enlightened One
But the Venerable Maha Kaccana gives a different twist to the meaning
For him the contrast is not merely between sensual pleasure and meditative bliss but between two different attitudes to advanced stages of meditative absorption
The ordinary recluses and brahmans understand the jhanas and other extraordinary states of consciousness attainable through the kasina meditations to be the final goal of spiritual endeavor
By doing so they remain caught in the trap of craving for becoming and thus fail to find the way to final deliverance
Because they become attached to the exalted bliss and quiet serenity of the jhanas they cannot see that these states too are conditioned and transient and thus they cannot relinquish their attachment to them
They therefore remain within Mara's domain vanquished by his army of agreeable and pleasant forms however sublime such may be
But the Buddha has seen the origin of these attainments ie craving as the origin of suffering he has seen the danger ie that they are impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change he has seen the escape from them ie Nibbana and he has obtained the knowledge and vision by which he can distinguish the true path from the false ie the Noble Eightfold Path from the wrong eightfold path
By means of this fourfold knowledge which in effect is knowledge of the Four Noble Truths he has attained the goal Nibbana experienced as the peace of heart that can arise only when all defilements have been extinguished without residue
Finally towards the end of the massive Anguttara Nikaya we find one more sutta constructed on the same pattern as the three Majjhima Nikaya suttas
This sutta opens with a short statement of the Buddha
Having said this the Blessed One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling
The monks then approach the Venerable Maha Kaccana to request an explanation
Following the stock formulas of protest and insistence Maha Kaccana interprets the Buddha's injunction by way of the ten unwholesome and ten wholesome courses of kamma taking life is nondhamma abstaining from taking life is dhamma the numerous evil unwholesome states that arise on account of taking life  this is harm the numerous wholesome states that arise conditioned by abstinence from taking life and that go to fulfillment by development  this is benefit
The same pattern is applied to stealing sexual misconduct lying slander harsh speech and gossip
Finally covetousness ill will and wrong view are nondhamma and the evil states that arise from them are harm noncovetousness goodwill and right view are dhamma and the wholesome states conditioned by them that go to fulfillment by development are benefit
Not all the discourses spoken by the Venerable Maha Kaccana take the form of commentaries on brief statements by the Buddha
He also delivered Dhamma talks that unfold along independent lines and he was skilled too in resolving the doubts of inquirers and fellow monks with his own original insights into the Teaching
The Majjhima Nikaya contains a fulllength dialogue between the great elder and King Avantiputta of Madhura who was the grandson of King Candappajjota of Avanti
Once when the Venerable Maha Kaccana was dwelling at Madhura the king heard the favorable report that was circulating about him He is wise discerning sagacious learned articulate and perspicacious he is aged and he is an arahant Desiring to converse with such a worthy monk the king drove out to his hermitage to meet him and the conversation that resulted has been recorded as the Madhura Sutta
The question with which the king opened this dialogue did not concern a profound problem about the nature of reality or the deeper realizations of insight meditation
It revolved around a practical issue that must have been weighing heavily on the minds of many of the noblecaste rulers of the time the attempts of the brahmans to establish their own hegemony over the entire Indian social system
The brahmans tried to justify this drive for power by appeal to their divinely ordained status
King Avantiputta relates to Maha Kaccana the claim that they had been putting forth The brahmans are the highest caste those of any other caste are inferior brahmans are the fairest caste those of any other caste are dark only brahmans are purified not nonbrahmans brahmans alone are the sons of Brahma the offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahma
The Venerable Maha Kaccana though of pedigree brahman stock himself is well aware of the presumption and arrogance that lay behind this proclamation
He replies that the claim of the brahmans is just a saying in the world one with no divine sanction at all to support it
To prove his point Maha Kaccana brings forth a powerful array of arguments in its favor one of any social class who gains wealth can command the labor of those in the other castes even a menial could enrol a brahman in his service
One of any caste who violates the principles of morality would be reborn in hell while one of any caste who observes the moral precepts would be reborn in a happy realm
One of any caste who breaks the law would be punished
One of any caste who renounces the world and becomes an ascetic would receive homage and respect
As each argument draws to a close the king proclaims These four castes are all the same there is no difference between them at all
At the end of the discussion after expressing his appreciation of Master Kaccana's replies King Avantiputta declares I go to Master Kaccana for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus But Maha Kaccana corrects him Do not go to me for refuge great king
Go for refuge to that same Blessed One to whom I have gone for refuge  the Fully Enlightened Buddha
When the king asks where the Blessed One is now living the elder explains that he has attained Parinibbana
This reply indicates that Maha Kaccana's own demise must have taken place at some date after that of the Buddha
The Samyutta Nikaya includes a sutta that shows how the Venerable Maha Kaccana's skill in handling a group of rowdy young brahman boys helped to transform the attitude of a learned old brahman and his entourage of pupils
On one occasion the elder was living in Avanti in a forest hut
Then a number of young brahmans boys pupils of the renowned brahman teacher Lohicca drew near to the hut while collecting firewood
As the brahmans of that period often harbored hostile feelings towards the renunciant Buddhist monks these boys behaving as boys typically do when on a group outing trampled around the hut deliberately making a racket to disturb the meditating monk
They also shouted the words which the brahmans used to taunt the nonbrahman ascetics These baldpated ascetic rascals menials swarthy offspring of the Lord's feet are honored respected esteemed worshipped and venerated by their servile devotees
The Venerable Maha Kaccana came out from the hut and addressed the boys with verses in which he reminded them of the ancient brahmanical ideals so badly neglected by the brahmans of that day
On hearing this the brahman boys were angry and displeased
On returning to their teacher the brahman Lohicca they reported that the recluse Maha Kaccana was denigrating and scorning the sacred brahman hymns
After his first flush of anger had subsided Lohicca being a man of sense realized that he should not rush to conclusions merely on the basis of hearsay reported by youngsters but should first inquire from Maha Kaccana himself whether there was any truth in their accusation
When Lohicca went to the Venerable Maha Kaccana and asked him about the conversation he had with the boys Maha Kaccana reported everything as it occurred
Lohicca was deeply impressed by Maha Kaccana's poem on the proper brahman way of life and even more so by the elder's following discourse on how to guard the doors of the senses
At the end of the discussion not only did he go for refuge to the Triple Gem but he invited the elder to visit his household assuring him that the brahman boys and maidens there will pay homage to Master Kaccana they will stand up for him out of respect they will offer him a seat and water and that will lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time
The Venerable Maha Kaccana seems to have had a particularly deep insight into the causal basis of human quarrels and disputes
We have already seen how he traces out the causal roots of conflict in his exposition in the Madhupindika Sutta and his skill in transforming Lohicca's retinue of disciples
On another occasion a brahman named Aramadanda came to him and asked Why is society rent by such bitter conflicts  conflicts that pit nobles against nobles brahmans against brahmans householders against householders To this the elder replies It is because of sensual lust attachment greed and obsession with sensual pleasures that nobles fight with nobles brahmans with brahmans householders with householders Next Aramadanda asked Why is it that recluses fight with recluses And Maha Kaccana replies It is because of lust for views attachment greed and obsession with views that recluses fight with recluses Finally the brahman asked whether there was anyone in the world who had transcended both sensual lust and lust for views
Although Maha Kaccana as an arahant could have put himself forth as an example of such a one with characteristic modesty and selfeffacement he named instead the Blessed One who was dwelling at Savatthi at the time
When this was said the brahman Aramadanda knelt down on the ground held out his hands in reverential salutation and exclaimed three times Homage to the Blessed One the Arahant the Fully Enlightened One
In the next sutta a brahman named Kandarayana reproaches Maha Kaccana for not showing proper respect towards aged brahmans
The elder defends himself by distinguishing the conventional usage of the words aged and young from their proper meaning within the Discipline of the Noble One
On this latter criterion even if a person is eighty ninety or a hundred years from birth if he is still addicted to sensual pleasures he is reckoned as a fool not an elder
But even if a person is young with jet black hair endowed with the blessing of youth if he has broken free from sensual desires he is then reckoned as an elder
Once the Venerable Maha Kaccana gave the monks a discourse on the six recollections  the contemplations of the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha virtue generosity and the devas
He declared that it is wonderful and marvellous how the Blessed One has discovered these six recollections as the way to freedom for those still trapped in the confines of the world
He describes the six recollections in exactly the same terms that the Buddha himself has used to describe the four foundations of mindfulness
They are the means for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation for the passing away of pain and grief for the arrival at the right method and for the realization of Nibbana
On another occasion some elder bhikkhus were holding a discussion about the right time to approach a monk worthy of esteem
One said he should be approached after he has finished his meal another said he should he approached in the evening while still another contended that the early morning was the most fitting time to speak with him
Unable to reach accord they came to Maha Kaccana with their problem
The elder replied that there were six proper times for approaching a worthy monk
The first five are when the mind is overcome and obsessed by the five mental hindrances  sensual desire ill will sloth and torpor restlessness and remorse and doubt  and one cannot find an outlet from them on one's own
The sixth occasion to approach is when one does not know a suitable object to attend to in order to reach the destruction of the cankers
It was not always with words that the Venerable Maha Kaccana taught but also by silent example
On one such occasion the Buddha was moved to extol Maha Kaccana in an udana  an inspired utterance  preserved for us in the canonical collection of that name
One evening the Buddha was seated in his cottage at Jeta's Grove in Savatthi when he saw the Venerable Maha Kaccana nearby sitting crosslegged holding his body erect having mindfulness with regard to the body set up and well established within him On realizing the significance of this the Blessed One uttered this inspired utterance
In its explanation of this sutta the Udana Commentary helps shed light on the approach that the Venerable Maha Kaccana adopted to reach arahantship
While this explanation conflicts with the account of the elder's instantaneous enlightenment found in the biographical sketch of the Anguttara Commentary it appears more realistic
The Udana Commentary explains that in his endeavor to attain arahantship Maha Kaccana first developed jhana using mindfulness of the body as his subject of meditation
Utilizing that jhana as his foundation of calm concentration he then redirected mindfulness of the body on to the track of insight meditation
With the wisdom of insight that arose from the contemplation of the body he reached the supramundane paths and fruits culminating in the final fruit of arahantship
Thereafter he would regularly resort to this same approach in order to enter upon the fruition attainment of arahantship the special meditative absorption unique to the arahant in which the bliss of Nibbana is experienced even in this very life
It was just on such an occasion when the elder was sitting absorbed in fruition attainment that the Buddha caught sight of him and extolled him in this inspirational verse
The couplet by which the Buddha expresses the theme of contemplation is taken by the commentary to signify fourcornered emptiness the absence of I and mine in the past and present and the absence of I and mine in the future
By applauding the Venerable Maha Kaccana with this inspired utterance the Buddha has held him up as a model for others to emulate in their own quest to overcome attachment to the world
The Theragatha the verses of the ancient elders includes eight verses ascribed to the Venerable Maha Kaccana
These verses are in no way exceptional and merely express in verse form injunctions to proper discipline for monks and practical advice for householders
Although Maha Kaccana's verses addressed to the brahman Lohicca did serve effectively as a didactic tool he does not seem to have been as amply endowed with the gift of poetic expression as several of the other great disciples such as Maha Kassapa Sariputta and Vangisa
His sphere of excellence was analysis and exegesis not inspirational eloquence or artistic creativity
The first two verses according to the commentary were spoken as an exhortation to the bhikkhus
One day the elder had noticed that a number of monks had laid aside their meditation practice in order to delight in work and in company
They were also growing too fond of the delicious food provided by their devoted lay supporters
He therefore admonished them thus
The other six verses again according to the commentary were spoken as exhortations to King Candappajjota
The king it is said placed faith in the brahmans and at their behest performed animal sacrifices he also would impose penalties and confer favors arbitrarily presumably on account of that impulsive temperament of his that earned him the title the Violent Therefore to dissuade the king from such reckless behavior the elder recited the next four verses
The last two stanzas were spoken by the elder when the king came to him one day and informed him of a disturbing dream he had seen the previous night
The commentary explains the purport of the verses thus A wise person should not reject everything but should first investigate virtues and faults and then should reject whatever should be rejected and accept whatever is acceptable
Therefore in regard to what should be rejected though one possesses vision one should be as if blind and though able to hear one should be as if deaf
One who is intelligent able to speak well should be as if dumb when tempted to speak what is unfit to be uttered and one who is strong should be as if feeble in regard to what should not be done
The last line is ambiguous in the Pali as well and is interpreted in two different ways by the commentary When a task that should be done has arisen one should investigate it and not neglect it even if one is lying on one's death bed
Or alternatively if a task that one should not do has arisen one should prefer to die  to lie down on one's death bed  rather than do it
Neither explanation sounds convincing and the sense consonant with the spirit of the Theragatha as a whole would seem to be One should die as one who has attained the goal ie as an arahant
Before concluding this survey of the Venerable Maha Kaccana's contribution to the Buddha's Dispensation we should briefly take note that the Theravada tradition ascribes to him two exegetical treatises  the Petakopadesa and the Nettippakarana  and an influential grammar of the Pali language called the KaccayanaVyakarana
The two treatises are not included in the Pali canon but have exerted a major influence on the evolution of exegetical method
Bhikkhu anamoli who translated both treatises into English holds that the Netti is a later more refined version of the Petakopadesa
Both deal with essentially the same method of exegesis which in the Netti is clearer and more concise
The method described there is designed to elicit from the Buddha's discourses the unifying principles that underlie the variegated expressions of the Dhamma
It is founded on the assumption that beneath the many diverse utterances of the Master adapted according to the temperament and situation of the auditors there runs a single consistent system which with the right exegetical techniques can be extracted from the particular statement under investigation and displayed in its unadorned essence
The Netti as Ven
anamoli has explained is not itself a commentary but a guide for commentators
It explicates not so much the teachings themselves but the tools that are to be used to elicit the structural elements that underlie and shape the expression of the teachings
The Netti sets up its methodology under two main headings the phrasing and the meaning
The phrasing is handled by sixteen modes of conveyance techniques of verbal and logical analysis that can be applied to any specified passage in order to extract the principles that lie behind the verbal formulation and logical organization of its content
The meaning is handled by three methods or guidelines
These take the meaning to be the aim or goal of the doctrine which is the attainment of Nibbana and they then disclose how the teaching in question points to the attainment of that goal as its underlying purport
Two additional methods are then proposed for correlating the sutta's terminology with the methods for explicating the meaning
The method is applied by the subcommentaries to the first sutta of each of the four Nikayas in special supplements to the main portion of the subcommentary
A commentary on the Netti attributed to Acariya Dhammapala also exists
The colophons of both exegetical treatises  the Petakopadesa and the Nettippakarana  attribute them to the Buddha's disciple Maha Kaccana
The Netti colophon states further that it was approved by the Blessed One and chanted at the original Buddhist Council
Western scholars have been inclined to dismiss the ascription of authorship to Maha Kaccana as fanciful
Ven
anamoli however in the Introduction to his translation of the Nettippakarana offers an explanation that preserves at least a grain of credibility in the traditional Buddhist view without falling into the opposite extreme of credulity
Ven
anamoli proposes that we distinguish between the authorship of the exegetical method on the one hand and the authorship of the treatises on the other
He suggests as a hypothesis  possible though neither provable nor refutable  that the Elder Maha Kaccana and his lineage of pupils in Avanti may have formulated a compendious method for interpreting the Buddha's discourses and that this method  or at least its elements  may have been discussed at the early Councils and transmitted orally in skeletal form
At a later date the method could have given birth to a treatise which attempts to coordinate its elements and to illustrate their application to specific texts
This treatise eventually became the Petakopadesa
Some time later perhaps even centuries later a more polished and perspicuous version of the same work was made this being the Nettippakarana
As the original methodology embedded in these treatises was derived from the Venerable Maha Kaccana or at any rate was believed to have been derived from him out of reverence for its architect  and also to boost the prestige of the treatises  their compilers ascribed authorship to the elder
GP
Malalasekera offers a parallel hypothesis to explain the imputed authorship of the Pali grammar the KaccayanaVyakarana to the Buddha's great disciple
While such propositions must remain conjectural as both Ven
anamoli and Malalasekera themselves acknowledge the type of detailed analysis of textual statements found in the Nettippakarana is consonant with the approach that the historical Maha Kaccana brought to bear on the interpretation of the Buddha's brief utterances
Thus it would seem that even if no direct connection actually exists between the great elder and the ancient Pali treatises ascribed to him the fact remains that they embody the spirit that he represented
This spirit so evident in the suttas that record his elucidations of the Buddha Word couples acuity of insight with terseness of expression precision of formulation with profundity of meaning
It was on the basis of such skills that the Enlightened One named him the foremost master of doctrinal exposition and it is this that constitutes his outstanding contribution to the Buddha's Dispensation
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Just as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid and unsullied  where a man with good eyes standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting and it would occur to him 'This pool of water is clear limpid and unsullied
Here are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting' so too the monk discerns as it actually is that 'This is stress This is the origin of stress This is the stopping of stress This is the way leading to the stopping of stress These are mental effluents This is the origin of mental effluents This is the stopping of mental effluents This is the way leading to the stopping of mental effluents' His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the effluent of sensuality released from the effluent of becoming released from the effluent of unawareness
With release there is the knowledge 'Released' He discerns that 'Birth is no more the holy life is fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
This great king is a reward of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime
And as for another visible reward of the contemplative life higher and more sublime than this there is none
 Samaññaphala Sutta Digha Nikaya
These talks  except for the first  were originally given extemporaneously to the monks at Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa's monastery Wat Pa Baan Taad in Udorn Thani Province Thailand
As might be expected they deal in part with issues particular to the life of Buddist monks but they also contain much that is of more general interest
Since the monks who had assembled to listen to these talks were at different stages in their practice each talk deals with a number of issues on a wide variety of levels
Thus there should be something of use in these pages for every reader interested in the training of the mind
The title of this collection is taken from a Pali term that directly or indirectly forms the theme of a number of the talks yathabhutañanadassana  knowledge and vision of things as they are
My hope is that these talks will aid and encourage the reader in his or her own efforts to taste the liberation that comes with the reality to which this term refers
Thanissaro BhikkhuRayongJanuary 
In these talks as in Thai usage in general the words 'heart' and 'mind' are used interchangebly
Today I'd like to take the opportunity to tell you some of my own ignorance and doubts with the thought that we all come from the land of ignorance and doubt inasmuch as our parents and their ancestors before them were people with the defilements that led them to ignorance as well
Even all of us here There's probably not a one of us who slipped through to be born in the land of intelligence and freedom from doubt
This being the case we all must be subject to doubts
So today I'd like to take the opportunity to resolve some of the issues that are on your minds by giving a talk instead of answering the questions you have asked from the standpoint of your various doubts ranging from the most basic to the highest levels  which I'm not sure I can answer or not
But the questions you have asked seem to follow so well on one another that they can provide the framework for a talk instead of a questionandanswer session
Each of us before starting the practice and in the beginning stages of the practice is sure to suffer from ignorance and doubt as these are the qualities that lead to the states of becoming and birth into which all living beings are born
When we lay the groundwork for the beginning of the practice we don't have enough starting capital for intelligence to take the lead in every situation and so ignorance is sure to find an opening to take the lead
And as for this ignorance If we have never trained our intelligence to show us the way the ignorance that holds the upper hand in the heart is sure to drag us in the wrong direction as a matter of course
In the beginning of my own training I felt doubts about whether the teachings of the Buddha  both the practices to be followed and the results to be obtained  were as complete as he said they were
This was an uncertainty that ran deep in my heart during the period in which I was debating whether or not to practice for the really high levels of Dhamma  or to put it bluntly for the sake of nibbana
Before I had considered practicing for the sake of nibbana these doubts hardly ever occurred to me probably because I hadn't yet aimed my compass in this direction
But after I had ordained and studied the Dhamma  and especially the life of the Buddha which was the story of his great renunciation leading to his Awakening to the paths fruitions and nibbana and then the lives of the Noble Disciples who having heard the Dhamma from the Buddha went off to practice in various places until they too gained Awakening becoming witnesses to the truth of the Buddha and his teachings  when I had studied to this point I felt a sense of faith and conviction and wanted to train myself to be like them
But the training that would make me be like them How was I to follow it
The Dhamma  in other words the practice that would lead the heart to awaken to the higher levels of Dhamma like the Buddha and his disciples Would it still produce the same sorts of results or would it be fruitless and simply lead to pointless hardship for those who practiced it
Or would it still give the full results in line with the welltaught teachings
This was my primary doubt
But as for believing in the Buddha's Awakening and that of his disciples of this I was fully convinced in my way as an ordinary runofthemill person
The thing that formed a stumbling block to me in the beginning stages was the doubt as to whether or not the path of practice I would take following the Buddha and his disciples would lead to the same point they had reached
Was it now all overgrown with brambles and thorns
Had it changed into something other than the Dhamma that leads away from suffering even though the Buddha and his disciples had all followed this very same path to the land of peace and security
This was my doubt concerning the causes in the practice
As for the results of the practice I wondered whether the paths fruitions and nibbana still existed as they had in the time of the Buddha
These doubts which ran deep in my heart I couldn't tell to anyone else because I felt there was no one who could resolve them for me and dispel them from my heart
This is why I had my hopes constantly set on meeting Ven
Acariya Mun
Even though I had never met him before I had heard his reputation which had been spreading from Chieng Mai for quite some time that he was a monk of distinction
By and large the people who would tell me about him wouldn't speak of him in terms of the ordinary levels of noble attainments
They'd all speak of his arahantship
This had me convinced that when I had finished my studies in line with the vow I had made I'd have to make the effort to go out to practice and live under his guidance so as to cut away the doubts running deep in my heart at that time
The vow I had made to myself was that I would complete the third grade of Pali studies
As for Dhamma studies whether or not I would pass the examinations was of no concern to me
As soon as I had passed the thirdlevel Pali exams I'd go out to do nothing but practice
I'd absolutely refuse to study or take the exams for the higher levels
This was the vow I had made
So the aim of my education was the third level of Pali studies
Whether it was my good or bad fortune though I can't say but I failed the Pali exams for two years and passed only on the third year
As for the three levels of Dhamma studies I ended up passing them all because I was studying and taking the examinations for both subjects together
When I went up to Chieng Mai it so happened that Ven
Acariya Mun had been invited by Ven
Chao Khun Dhammachedi of Udorn Thani to spend the Rains Retreat in Udorn and so he had left his seclusion and come to stay at Wat Chedi Luang in Chieng Mai at just about the time of my arrival
As soon as I learned that he was staying there I was overwhelmed with joy
The next morning when I returned from my alms round I learned from one of the other monks that earlier that morning Ven
Acariya Mun had left for alms on that path and had returned by the very same path
This made me even more eager to see him
Even if I couldn't meet him face to face I'd be content just to have a glimpse of him before he left for Udorn Thani
The next morning before Ven
Acariya Mun went on his alms round I hurried out early for alms and then returned to my quarters
There I kept watch along the path by which he would return as I had been told by the other monks and before long I saw him coming
I hurried to my quarters and peeked out of my hiding to catch a glimpse of him with the hunger that had come from having wanted to see him for such a long time
And then I actually saw him
The moment I saw him a feeling of complete faith in him arose within me
I hadn't wasted my birth as a human being I thought because I now had seen an arahant
Even though no one had told me that he was an arahant my heart became firmly convinced the moment I saw him that that was what he was
At the same time a feeling of sudden ecstasy hard to describe came over me making my hair stand on end  even though he hadn't yet seen me with his physical eyes
Not too many days after that he left Wat Chedi Luang to head for Udorn Thani together with his students
As for me I stayed on to study there at Wat Chedi Luang
When I had passed my Pali exams I returned to Bangkok with the intention of heading out to practice meditation in line with my vow but when I reached Bangkok a senior monk who out of his kindness wanted to help me further my Pali studies told me to stay on
I tried to find some way to slip away in keeping with my intentions and my vow because I felt that the conditions of my vow had been met the moment I had passed my Pali exams
Under no terms could I study for or take the next level of Pali exams
It's a trait with me to value truthfulness
Once I've made a vow I won't break it
Even life I don't value as much as a vow
So now I had to try to find some way or another to go out to practice
It so happened during that period that the senior monk who was my teacher was invited out to the provinces so I got the chance to leave Bangkok
Had he been there it would have been difficult for me to get away because I was indebted to him in many ways and probably would have felt such deference for him that I would have had difficulty leaving
But as soon as I saw my chance I decided to make a vow that night asking for an omen from the Dhamma that would reinforce my determination in going out this time
After I had finished my chants I made my vow the gist of which was that if my going out to meditate in line with my earlier vow would go smoothly and fulfill my aspirations I wanted an unusual vision to appear to me either in my meditation or in a dream
But if I wouldn't get to go out to practice or if having gone out I'd meet with disappointment I asked that the vision show the reason why I'd be disappointed and dissatisfied
But if my going out was to fulfill my aspirations I asked that the vision be extraordinarily strange and amazing
With that I sat in meditation but no visions appeared during the long period I sat meditating so I stopped to rest
As soon as I fell asleep though I dreamed that I was floating high in the sky above a large metropolis
It wasn't Bangkok but I don't know what metropolis it was
It stretched as far as the eye could see and was very impressive
I floated three times around the metropolis and then returned to earth
As soon as I returned to earth I woke up
It was four am
I quickly got up with a feeling of fullness and contentment in my heart because while I had been floating around the metropolis I had seen many strange and amazing things that I can't describe to you in detail
When I woke up I felt happy cheerful and very pleased with my vision at the same time thinking to myself that my hopes were sure to be fulfilled because never before had I seen such an amazing vision  and at the same time it had coincided with my vow
So that night I really marveled at my vision
The next morning after my meal I went to take leave of the senior monk who was in charge of the monastery and he willingly gave permission for me to go
From there I set out for Nakhorn Ratchasima Province where I spent the rains in Cakkaraad District
I started practicing concentration and was amazed at how my mind developed stillness and calm step by step
I could clearly see my heart settle down in peace
After that the senior monk who was my Pali teacher asked me to return to Bangkok to continue my studies
He even had the kindness to come after me and then continued further out into the provinces
On the way back he was going to have me accompany him to Bangkok
I really felt in a bind so I headed for Udorn Thani in order to find Ven
Acariya Mun
The progress I had been making in concentration practice though disappeared at my home village of Baan Taad
The reason it disappeared was simply because I made a single klod
I hadn't even spent a full month at Baan Taad when I began to feel that my mind wasn't settling down in concentration as snugly as it had before
Sometimes I could get it to settle down sometimes not
Seeing that things didn't look promising and that I could only lose by staying on I quickly left
In coming from Nakhorn Ratchasima to Udorn Thani my purpose had been to catch up with Ven
Acariya Mun who had spent the rains at Wat Noan Nives Udorn Thani
I didn't reach him in time though because he had been invited to Sakon Nakhorn before my arrival so I went on to stay at Wat Thung Sawaang in Nong Khai for a little more than three months
In May of that year I left Nong Khai for the town of Sakon Nakhorn and from there went on to the monastery where Ven
Acariya Mun was staying in Baan Khoak Tong Khoam Township Muang District Sakon Nakhorn Province
When I reached the monastery I found him doing walking meditation in the late evening dusk
'Who's that' he asked so I told him who I was
He then left his meditation path and went to the meeting hall  he was staying in a room there in the meeting hall  and conversed with me showing a great deal of kindness and compassion for the incredibly ignorant person who had come to seek him out
He gave me a sermon that first evening the gist of which I'll relate to you as far as I can remember it
It's a message that remains close to my heart to this day
'You've already studied a good deal' he told me 'at least enough to earn the title of Maha Now I'm going to tell you something that I want you take and think over
Don't go thinking that I underrate the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha but at the present moment no matter how much of the Dhamma you've studied it will serve no purpose in keeping with your status as a scholar other than simply being an obstacle to your meditation because you won't be able to resist dwelling on it and using it to take the measure of things when you're trying to calm your heart
So for the sake of convenience when fostering stillness in your heart I want you to take the Dhamma you've studied and put it away for the time being
When the time comes for it to benefit you it will all come streaming in to blend perfectly with your practice
At the same time it will serve as a standard to which you should make the heart conform
But for the time being I don't want you to concern yourself with the Dhamma you've studied at all
Whatever way you make the mind still or use discernment to investigate the khandhas I want you first to restrict yourself to the sphere of the body because all of the Dhamma in the texts points to the body and mind but the mind doesn't yet have any firm evidence and so can't take the Dhamma learned from the texts and put it to good use
The Dhamma will simply become allusions and labels leading you to speculate elsewhere to the point where you become a person with no foundations because the mind is fixated on theory in a manner that isn't the way of the Lord Buddha
So I want you to take what I've said and think it over
If you set your mind on the practice without retreating the day will come when these words of mine will impress themselves on your heart' Of what I can remember him saying that day this is all I'll ask to tell for now
I felt an immediate sense of faith and conviction in him as soon as I saw him face to face that night both because of my conviction in the Dhamma he was so kind to teach me and because of the assistance he gave in letting me stay under his guidance
I stayed with him with a sense of contentment hard to describe  but also with a stupidity on my own part hard to describe as well
He himself was very kind helping me with the Dhamma every time I went to see him
My practice when I first went to stay with him was a matter of progress and regress within the heart
My heart hardly ever settled down firmly for a long period of time
The first rains I spent with him was my ninth rains in as much as I had spent my first seven rains in study and one rains in Nakhorn Ratchasima after starting to practice
During that first rains with Ven
Acariya Mun there was nothing but progress and regress in the area of my concentration
After the rains I went up to stay on a mountain for more than two months and then returned to be with him my mind still progressing and regressing in the same way
I couldn't figure out why it kept regressing even though I was intent on practicing to the full extent of my ability
Some nights I was unable to sleep all night long out of fear that the mind would regress and yet it would still manage to regress
And especially when the mind was beginning to settle down in stillness I'd accelerate my efforts even more out of fear that it would regress as it had before  and even then it would regress on me
After a while it would progress again and then regress again
When it had progressed it would stay at that level for only three days and then regress right before my eyes
This disturbed me and made me wonder Why was it able to regress
Was it because I had let go of my meditation word
Perhaps my mindfulness had lapsed at that point
So I made a note of this and promised myself that no matter what I would have to keep the meditation word in charge of my mind at all times
Regardless of where I would go and regardless of whether I was in our out of concentration  even when I was sweeping the monastery compound or doing any of my chores  I wouldn't allow my mind to slip away from buddho the word I liked to repeat in my meditation
At this point when the mind would settle down into stillness if it could continue to think of the meditation word buddho in that stillness I wouldn't let go of it
If the mind was going to regress in any way this was where I would have to know
As soon as I had taken note of this point and had made my promise I started repeating the word buddho
As I was repeating it the mind was able to settle down quickly much more quickly than it had before
It would let go of its meditation word only when it had settled snugly into stillness
At that moment whether or not I would think buddho the awareness of that stillness was already solidly 'buddho' in and of itself
It wouldn't be forming any thoughts at all
At that point I'd stop my repetition
As soon as the mind made a move to withdraw  in other words as soon as it rippled slightly  I'd immediately start pumping the meditation word back in again as a means of keeping the mind in place
At the same time I'd keep watch to see at what point the mind would regress
I abandoned my concern for the progress or regress of the mind
No matter how far the mind might progress or regress I wasn't willing to let go of my meditation word
Even if the mind was going to regress I'd let it regress because when I had been determined that it not regress it had still regressed in spite of my determination
Now though I felt no more concern for whether the mind would progress or regress
I'd simply force it to be conscious of buddho
I'd try to be aware of progress and regress only in terms of the heart that had buddho in charge
This was where I would know
This was where I would clearly see
This was the one spot in which I'd place my confidence
I wouldn't have to concern myself with progress or regress
As time passed the mind that had once progressed and regressed didn't regress
This was what made me realize The fact that the mind had kept regressing so often was because of a lapse in its meditation word mindfulness must have slipped away at that moment for sure
So from that point on I kept my meditation word continually in place
No matter where I'd go or where I'd stay I wouldn't let mindfulness lapse
Even if I was to be on the verge of death I wouldn't let mindfulness slip away from buddho
If the mind was going to regress this was the only place where I'd try to know it
I wouldn't concern myself with the matter in any other way
As a result the mind was able to establish a foundation for itself because of the meditation word buddho
After that came my second Rains Retreat with Ven
Acariya Mun
Before the rains began my mind felt still and firm in its concentration with no regressing at all
Even then I refused to let go of my meditation word
This kept up to the point where I was able to sit in meditation without changing to any other position from early night until dawn
During my second rains with Ven
Acariya Mun I held to sitting in meditation until dawn as more important than any other method in my practice
After that I gradually eased back as I came to see the body as a tool that could wear out if I had no sense of moderation in using it
Still I found that accelerating my efforts by means of sitting all night until dawn gave more energy to the heart than any other method
The period in which I was sitting up all night until dawn was when I gained clear comprehension of the feelings of pain that arise from sitting in meditation for long periods of time because the pain that arose at that time was strange and exceptional in many ways
The discernment that investigated so as to contend with the pain kept at its work without flagging until it was able to understand the affairs of every sort of pain in the body  which was a solid mass of pain
At the same time discernment was able to penetrate in to know the feelings of the heart
This did a great deal to strengthen my mindfulness my discernment and my courage in the effort of the practice
At the same time it made me courageous and confident with regard to the future in that the pains that would appear at the approach of death would be no different from the pains I was experiencing and investigating in the present
There would be nothing about those pains that would be so different or exceptional as to have me deceived or confused at the time of death
This was a further realization
The pain as soon as discernment had fully comprehended it disappeared instantaneously and the mind settled down into total stillness
Now at a point like this if you wanted to you could say that the mind is empty but it's empty in concentration
When it withdraws from that concentration the emptiness disappears
From there the mind resumes its investigations and continues with them until it gains expertise in its concentration
Once concentration is strong discernment steps up its investigation of the various aspects of the body until it sees them all clearly and is able to remove its attachments concerning the body once and for all
At that point the mind begins to be empty but it doesn't yet display a complete emptiness
There are still images appearing as pictures within it until it gains proficiency from its relentless training
The images within the heart then begin to fade day by day until finally they are gone
No mental images appear either inside or outside the heart
This is also called an empty mind
This kind of emptiness is the inherent emptiness of the mind that has reached its own level
It's not the emptiness of concentration or of sitting and practicing concentration
When we sit in concentration that's the emptiness of concentration
But when the mind has let go of the body because of the thorough comprehension that comes when its internal images are all gone and because of the power of its mindfulness and discernment that are fully alert to these things this is called the emptiness of the mind on its own level
When this stage is reached the mind is truly empty
Even though the body appears there's simply a sense that the body is there
No image of the body appears in the mind at all
Emptiness of this sort is said to be empty on the level of the mind  and it's constantly empty like this at all times
If this emptiness is nibbana it's the nibbana of that particular meditator or of that stage of the mind but it's not yet the nibbana of the Buddha
If someone were to take the emptiness of concentration for nibbana when the mind settles down in concentration it would simply be the nibbana of that particular meditator's concentration
Why is it that these two sorts of emptiness aren't the emptiness of the Buddha's nibbana
Because the mind empty in concentration is unavoidably satisfied with and attached to its concentration
The mind empty in line with its own level as a mind is unavoidably absorbed in and attached to that sort of emptiness
It has to take that emptiness as its object or preoccupation until it can pass beyond it
Anyone who calls this emptiness nibbana can be said to be attached to the nibbana in this emptiness without realizing it
When this is the case how can this sort of emptiness be nibbana
If we don't want this level of nibbana we have to spread out feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance for a thorough look until we see them clearly and in full detail  because the emptiness we're referring to is the emptiness of feeling in that a feeling of pleasure fills this emptiness
The mind's labels brand it as empty
Thoughtformations take this emptiness as their preoccupation
Cognizance helps be aware of it within and isn't simply aware of things outside  and so this emptiness is the emptiness of the mind's preoccupation
If we investigate these things and this emptiness clearly as sankharadhammas or fabrications this will open the way by which we are sure some day of passing beyond them
When we investigate in this way these four khandhas and this emptiness  which obscure the truth  will gradually unravel and reveal themselves bit by bit until they are fully apparent
The mind is then sure to find a way to shake itself free
Even the underlying basis for sankharadhammas that's full of these fabricated things will not be able to withstand mindfulness and discernment because it is interrelated with these things
Mindfulness and discernment of a radical sort will slash their way in  just like a fire that burns without stopping when it meets with fuel  until they have dug up the root of these fabricated things
Only then will they stop their advance
On this level what are the adversaries to the nibbana of the Buddha
The things to which the mind is attached the sense that 'My heart is empty' 'My heart is at ease' 'My heart is clean and clear' Even though we may see the heart as empty it's paired with an unemptiness
The heart may seem to be at ease but it depends on stress
The heart may seem clean and clear but it dwells with defilement  without our being aware of it
Thus emptiness ease and clarity are the qualities that obscure the heart because they are the signs of becoming and birth
Whoever wants to cut off becoming and birth should thus investigate so as to be wise to these things and to let them go
Don't be possessive of them or they will turn into a fire to burn you
If your discernment digs down into these three lords of becoming as they appear you will come to the central hub of becoming and birth and it will be scattered from the heart the moment discernment reaches the foundation on which it is based
When these things are ended through the power of discernment that too is a form of emptiness
No signs of any conventional reality will appear in this emptiness at all
This is an emptiness different from the forms of emptiness we have passed through
Whether this emptiness can be called the emptiness of the Buddha or whose emptiness it is I'm afraid I can't say other than that it's an emptiness that each meditator can know directly only for him or herself alone
This emptiness has no time or season
It's akaliko  timeless  throughout time
The emptiness of concentration can change in terms of progress and regress
The emptiness on the formless or imageless level which serves as our path can change or be transcended
But this emptiness exclusively within oneself doesn't change  because there is no self within this emptiness and no sense that this emptiness is oneself
There is simply the knowledge and vision of things as they are  seeing this emptiness in line with its natural principles as they actually are and seeing all phenomena as they actually are as they pass by and exist in general
Even virtue concentration and discernment  the qualities we use to straighten out the heart  are realized for what they are and let go in line with their actuality
Nothing at all remains lurking in the nature of this final stage of emptiness
I ask that we all reflect on these three kinds of emptiness and try to develop ourselves to attain them  and especially the last form of emptiness which is an emptiness in the principles of nature beyond the range where any other person or any conventional reality can become involved with us ever again
Our doubts ranging from the beginning levels of the Dhamma to this ultimate emptiness will find resolution with our own knowledge and vision acting as judge
So now at the end of this talk  which started out with my telling you of my own ignorance step by step and then strayed off to this final emptiness which is a quality somewhat beyond my powers to explain any further  I'll ask to stop as the proper time seems to have come
May happiness and contentment be with each and every one of you
Whichever theme you focus on be earnest with it keeping mindfulness in constant touch with the work you are doing
For example if you're focusing on the repetition of buddho keep constantly aware of the word buddho buddho as if there were nothing else left in the world for you to become two with this or three with that
There is only one thing the word buddho blending step by step with your awareness
As the mind becomes more and more still the buddho you are repeating will more and more blend into one with your awareness
Then the word buddho buddho will fall silent leaving only an awareness that's more conspicuous than before
This means that you've reached the mind
To put it in terms of following the tracks of an ox you've reached the ox and can let go of its tracks
Here you've reached the inner buddha which is like the ox so now you can let go of the meditation word
The same holds true if you focus on keeping the breath in mind
Whether the breath is heavy or refined simply be aware of it as it normally is
Don't set up any expectations
Don't force the breath to be like this or that
Keep your awareness with the breath because in meditating by taking the breath as your preoccupation you're not after the breath
The breath is simply something for the mind to hold to so that you can reach the real thing just as when you follow the tracks of an ox You're not after the tracks of the ox
You follow its tracks because you want to reach the ox
Here you're keeping track of the breath so as to reach the real thing awareness
If you were to start out just by holding on to awareness you wouldn't get any results just as you wouldn't be sure of finding the ox if you simply went around looking for it
But if you follow its tracks you're going to find it for sure
Your meditation word has to keep moving in
This is called following the tracks of the ox step by step until you reach the ox or what knows namely the mind
The same holds true with focusing on the breath
If it's heavy know that it's heavy
Don't get worried or upset about it and don't be afraid that you'll die because the breath is heavy or because you feel suffocated
When you do heavy work you feel suffocated  don't think that you feel suffocated only when focusing on the breath
There are a lot of other things more suffocating than this
If you carry a post or lift something heavy you feel suffocated to death all over the body not just in the chest or in the breath
The whole body is ready to burst because of the heaviness and great pain and yet you can take it
You even know that it's because of the heavy object and that's the way it has to be
While you focus on keeping the breath in mind when the breath is coarse it's as if you were lifting something heavy
It's naturally bound to feel suffocating so don't worry about it
Even if it's suffocating the important point is to keep track of the breath coming in and out
Eventually the breath will become more and more refined because mindfulness is focused on the breath and doesn't go anywhere else
When the breath goes in be aware of it
When it goes out be aware of it but there's no need to follow it in and out
That would simply be creating a greater burden for yourself and your attention might slip away
So focus right on the entry point where the breath goes in and out
In most cases the tip of the nose is the place to focus on the breath
Keep watch right there
Keep aware right there
Don't waste your time speculating or planning on how the results will appear or else your mind will wander away from the principle of the cause that will give rise to those results
Keep close watch on the cause  what you are doing  and the breath will become more and more refined
When the breath becomes more refined that shows that the mind is refined
Even if the breath becomes so refined that it disappears  at the same time that you're aware that it's disappearing  don't be afraid
The breath disappears but your awareness doesn't disappear
You're meditating not for the sake of the breath but for the sake of awareness so stay with that awareness
You don't have to worry or be afraid that you'll faint or die
As long as the mind is still in charge of the body then even if the breath disappears you won't die
The mind will dwell with freedom with no agitation no worries no fears at all
This is how you focus on the breath
We have gone forth from the household life and are abstainers from all things that are our own enemies and enemies of the common good
That's why we're said to have gone forth It means that we abstain
'Abstaining' here means refraining from the things that work to our detriment
Once we have gone forth our duty is to abstain from things that are unwise and to develop wisdom  intelligence  as much as we can until it is enough to carry us past our obstacles the entire mass of suffering
At present we all know that we have gone forth
The world calls us 'people who have gone forth' so be conscious of your status at all times and in your every movement in thought word and deed
You are ordained in the Buddha's religion and have his teachings as your guide
His teachings have both a fence and an open way
The fence is the Vinaya which prescribes penalties for our errors  major intermediate and minor
This is the fence that blocks the wrong paths so that we won't stray down them and that opens the right path  the Dhamma  so that we can follow it to the goal to which we aspire
The Vinaya is a fence on both sides of the path
If we go astray it means we've gone wrong
If we go just a little astray we've gone just a little bit wrong
If we go far astray we've gone far wrong
If we go so far astray that we can't get back on the path we've gone absolutely wrong
This is like a person who loses his way If he gets just a little lost he can quickly get back on the path
If he gets more lost it wastes a lot of his time
If he gets really lost he has no chance of reaching his goal
Thus the Vinaya is like a fence to prevent those who have gone forth from going wrong
This fence has various levels  in line with the differing levels of lay people and those who have ordained  for us to observe in line with our moral duties beginning with the five precepts and going up to the eight the ten and the precepts
As for the Dhamma which is the path to follow as taught by the Buddha it has conviction as its basis  in other words conviction in the path to be followed for good results  and persistence in making the effort to follow the path unflaggingly
Mindfulness is what guides our efforts as we follow the path
Concentration is firmness of the heart in following the path in addition to being food for the journey  in other words mental peace and ease along the way before we reach the goal
And discernment is circumspection in following the path step by step from beginning to end
These qualities support and encourage us to stay on the right path
When we have these five qualities  conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment  constantly with us there's no need to doubt that the results will appear as our reward clear to the heart in line with our strength and abilities
If we develop these five qualities so that they are powerful within our hearts the results that the Buddha proclaimed as lying at the end of the path  release and nibbana  won't be able to elude us because all of these qualities aim at these results
So I ask that you as meditators nourish your conviction in the Dhamma and in your own capabilities
Make your persistence adequate to the task
Concentration will then appear as a result so try to make it adequate and take mindfulness and discernment as your guardians
The results will then appear to your full satisfaction
You don't have to worry about where the paths fruitions and nibbana lie
Try to nourish the causes I have explained here and make them adequate
Nothing will then be able to prevent the results that will arise from those causes
These five qualities  principles in following the path  are called the five indriya or five bala
'Indriya' means dominant factor
'Bala' means strength
As for the Vinaya it's a fence guarding both sides of the path to keep us from straying from the way to the paths fruitions and nibbana
The Buddha closed off both sides and then opened the way  the five strengths  for us to follow as much as we like
Kayaviveka physical seclusion in your dwelling place
The place where we are staying now is fairly conducive in this respect
Cittaviveka mental seclusion
Those of you aiming for inner seclusion in line with the levels of your concentration have already attained a fair amount
Those of you who are just beginning who don't have any mental seclusion in your hearts should try to nourish the five strengths to make them solid
Inner seclusion will gradually appear step by step
Those of you who have attained an adequate amount of inner seclusion should try to make it more and more refined at the same time developing discernment or circumspection with regard to your seclusion
As for those of you at the higher stages of the practice you should urgently gather up persistence with discernment so as to make it adequate and it will bear fruit as upadhiviveka  absolute seclusion from the defilements  appearing clearly to your hearts
Physical seclusion means finding peace in solitary places
You don't get embroiled in external matters you don't latch on to work to disturb the body to the point where you turn your temporary dwelling place into a factory viewing physical work as the basis of the religion and as your occupation as a monk  as we see happening everywhere  to the point where you no longer have any interest in the inner effort of the practice that is a monk's true duty
Mental seclusion refers to the peace of mind endowed with the inner effort of the practice to keep it from running wild with the things that make contact
You rein it in so as to keep it still with watchfulness and restraint at all times
The nature of this level of mental peace is that even though external things may not be making any disturbance there are still some enemy preoccupations lurking within the mind
This is why this level is termed simply mental seclusion seclusion from the disturbance of external objects
As for seclusion from the defilements this refers to peace with regard to such external things as sights sounds smells and tastes as well as to peace with regard to internal preoccupations that are the particular enemies of the mind
In other words you are free both from external enemies and from internal enemies
This is absolute seclusion from the defilements without even the least thing infiltrating the heart
The heart is in this state at all times
Even though various things may come and make contact or the khandhas may do their work in line with their duties these things can't permeate into the heart to cause it any difficulties
These are the results that come from the basis of physical and mental seclusion
These three qualities  physical seclusion mental seclusion and seclusion with regard to the defilements  are qualities that all of you as meditators should be capable of developing fully within yourselves
There should be nothing blocking your way
All I ask is that you don't abandon your efforts
Be courageous and enthusiastic in searching out lonely isolated places places where you can shed your foolishness with regard to yourselves once and for all
This is the way through which the Buddha and all his Noble Disciples passed before reaching the land of nibbana  so how could these places turn into the enemies of those of us who are following the Buddha's example
Don't be worried that you'll lose your lives in such places
If that were to be the case the Buddha would have had to change his preliminary instructions to us after our ordination from rukkhamulasenasanam  living in the forest  to something else in keeping with his compassion for all living beings human and divine
If living in lonely solitary places making the effort in line with the Buddha's example were to give results other than those corresponding to the Dhamma he taught he would have had to modify his various teachings to be in keeping with the demands of time and place
The wings to Awakening  which are like the Buddha's very heart that he gave to us so rightly  would have had to be completely altered
But these truths are constant and unwavering
The Buddha never changed them
We as meditators should thus modify our thoughts words and deeds to fit in with this Dhamma
It would be highly inappropriate for us to modify the Dhamma to conform with the influence of our hearts with their defilements
If we were to do such a thing we would become Devadatta's in our thoughts words and deeds and our Teacher  the Buddha's right teachings  would be lost to us without our even realizing it
So try to be persistent in line with the teachings given by the Buddha
Be brave in contending with the enemies of the heart  both those that come from within and those that come from without  together with the results they bring
Always take an interest in seeing where suffering and stress come from and how they arise
Don't abandon this work or get bored with it
Try to know the causes and effects of the things that come into contact or become involved with the heart to see how they give rise to stress until you can ultimately see the causes clearly  and in that same moment you will clearly understand the results
The most important points no matter when I teach you  and they are teachings that lie close to my heart  are mindfulness and discernment
These qualities are very important
If you lack mindfulness and discernment the results of your practice will be erratic
The progress of your efforts will be interrupted and uneven
The techniques of your intelligence for curing defilement will be lacking and the results  peace and ease  will be sporadic
If mindfulness and discernment are interrupted you should know that all the efforts of your practice have been interrupted in the same instant
So I ask that each of you realize this
Every time I've given a talk I've never omitted the topics of mindfulness and discernment
You could almost say that I give them the limelight more than any other topic for I've considered the matter to the best of my ability from the time I first started the practice until today and I have never seen any qualities superior to mindfulness and discernment in being able to unravel things within or without so as to make them clear to the heart
For this reason I teach you these two qualities so that you'll know To put them in terms of wood they're the heartwood or the tap root of the tree
In terms of the Dhamma they're the root the crucial tools for eliminating all defilements and mental effluents from the blatant to the most extremely refined levels once and for all
If you lack mindfulness you can't even give rise to concentration
If you lack discernment your concentration might turn into wrong concentration  for the word 'concentration' is a neutral term
There's no assurance as to what sort of concentration it may be
If it lacks discernment as its guardian it's sure to turn into concentration that deviates from the principles of the Dhamma without your realizing it
There are many levels of wrong concentration  those that appear blatantly to the world as well as intermediate and subtle levels  but here I'll discuss only those forms of wrong concentration that can occur to us in the area of the practice without our realizing it
For example when we enter concentration the mind may gather and rest for a long or a short time but when we withdraw we're still attached to that concentration and not at all interested in developing discernment
We may feel that the concentration will turn into the paths fruitions or nibbana or else we are addicted to the concentration and want the mind to stay gathered that way for long periods of time or forever
Sometimes after the mind gathers into its resting place it then withdraws a bit going out to know the various things that make contact becoming attached and engrossed with its visions
Sometimes it may float out of the body to travel to the Brahma worlds heaven hell or the world of the hungry shades without a thought for what's right or wrong as we become engrossed in our visions and abilities taking them as our amazing paths fruitions and nibbana and those of the religion as well
When this happens then even if someone skilled and experienced in this area comes to warn us we won't be willing to listen at all
All of these things are termed wrong concentration that we don't realize to be wrong
So what is right concentration like and how should you practice for the sake of rightness
This is where a few differences lie
When you sit in concentration and the mind gathers to rest  no matter what the level of concentration  how long it stays there depends on the particular strength of that level of concentration
Let the mind rest in line with its level of concentration
There's no need to force it to withdraw
Let it rest as long as it wants and then it will withdraw on its own
Once it withdraws try to train yourself to explore with your discernment
Whatever level of discernment corresponds to that level of concentration use it to investigate and contemplate the physical properties and khandhas
Whether you investigate these things within or without is not an issue
All that is asked is that you investigate for the sake of knowing cause and effect for the sake of curing or extricating yourself Just this much is what's right
Use your discernment to investigate conditions of nature both within and without or else exclusively within or exclusively without
Contemplate them in terms of any one of the three characteristics until you are experienced and astute until you can find the openings by which you can extricate yourself step by step
When you have investigated to the point where you feel tired and the mind wants to rest in its home of concentration let it rest as much as it wants
Whether it rests for a long or a short time is not an issue
Let it rest until it withdraws on its own
As soon as it withdraws continue with your investigation of such phenomena as the body as before
This is right concentration
Be aware of the fact that concentration is simply a temporary resting place
When you have investigated a great deal in the area of discernment and feel mentally tired rest in concentration
Once the mind is strong again it'll withdraw
If it's in shape to investigate then continue investigating
Keep practicing this way constantly
Your concentration will go smoothly and your discernment will always be astute
Things will go evenly both in the area of concentration and in the area of discernment because concentration is beneficial in one way and discernment in another
If you let yourself follow only the path of discernment you'll go wrong because you won't have concentration as a support
If you let yourself follow only the path of concentration you'll go even more wrong than by simply following the path of discernment
To summarize These two qualities are like a right arm and a left arm a right leg and a left leg
Wherever a person walks or whatever he does he needs both arms and both legs
Concentration and discernment are necessary in just the same way
If you feel that concentration is better than discernment or discernment better than concentration then you should have only one arm or one leg not two arms and two legs like everyone else
In other words you don't fit in with the rest of the world
Whoever doesn't fit in with the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha  criticizing discernment and praising concentration or criticizing concentration and praising discernment  is the same sort of person
What's right is that when you are developing concentration you have to do your duties in terms of concentration and really see the value of concentration
When you are contemplating with discernment you have to do your duties in terms of discernment and really see the value of discernment
Let each side rest at the right time
Don't get them mixed up together
It's the same as when you walk When your right foot takes a step your left foot has to stop
When your left foot takes a step your right foot has to stop
They don't both step at the same time
Thus both concentration and discernment have their benefits
But when mindfulness and discernment develop enough strength from being trained together concentration and discernment will then step together  it's not the case that they'll always take turns  in the same way that your right arm and left arm work together
Here we've discussed the relationship between concentration and discernment for those who tend to develop concentration first who are usually in danger of their concentration's going out of bounds without seeing discernment as the other side of the practice
If it's a necessary quality you should use it at the appropriate times
As for those who tend to have discernment fostering their concentration their minds can't settle down into stillness simply through the power of concentration practice alone
They need to use discernment to put brakes on the mind  which is restless and running wild with its various preoccupations  by keeping track of the restlessness of the heart so as to see why it is restless and what there is that encourages it to be that way
Discernment has to go ferreting out the various things the mind is labeling and interpreting until the mind surrenders to its discernment and is able to enter stillness
This sort of stillness of mind is said to be still through discernment
Some people even when their minds have entered stillness can at the same time use discernment to investigate and form thoughts without these things being an enemy to that stillness
Perhaps you may think 'If the mind is concentrated how can it form thoughts' and then become doubtful about your concentration
This is called not understanding your own tendencies
These doubts are normal for those who aren't experienced and don't know  since no one has given them any directions that they can hold to as authoritative  so they may become uncertain about their practice when this sort of thing happens to them
So here I'd like to take the opportunity to explain The mind that attains stillness through the method of using discernment as its guardian can continue having thought processes occurring on one level of concentration but when we reach a fully refined level no matter which way our concentration is fostered all thoughtformations will cease
No labeling of things will be left in that refined concentration no thoughtformations or cognizance of various things will appear
To summarize The intermediate level of concentration for those whose minds gather quickly  namely those who start out with concentration  won't have any thought processes because the moment thoughts forms their minds will begin to withdraw from concentration
The concentration attained through the guardian power of discernment though can still form thoughts without the mind's withdrawing from concentration  and both types of concentration must have mindfulness alert as they gather inward
Today I've explained the differences between wrong and right concentration  enough so that you as meditators will understand and take this as a guide
I've stressed that mindfulness and discernment are very important factors
Those of you who are training mindfulness shouldn't wait to train it only when you are meditating
You must train it at all times
Wherever you go whatever you do be mindful
Always take your stance in the effort of the practice
Once there is mindfulness there also has to be selfawareness because selfawareness comes from established mindfulness
If mindfulness is lacking no selfawareness appears
So try to develop your basic mindfulness until it is capable and strong enough to be the sort of mindfulness suitable for the effort of the practice within the heart
From that point it will become supermindfulness because you have continually fostered it and kept it established
The same holds true with discernment
Try to contemplate the things that make contact with the mind sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and the thoughts that occur exclusively within
You have to explore these things ferreting out their causes until you find it habitual to contemplate and think
When this level of discernment gains strength it will advance to a higher level and you will be able to use this higher level of discernment to investigate your doubts about the situation exclusively within the heart
You will be able to see things clearly and cut away your various doubts through the power of discernment the discernment you have trained in this way so that it becomes superdiscernment just like supermindfulness
I've never seen it happen anywhere that anyone who hasn't started out by training discernment in this way has suddenly gained full results through superlative discernment
Even those who are termed khippabhiñña  who have attained Awakening quickly  started out from crude discernment advancing quickly step by step and gained Awakening in the Buddha's presence as we all know from the texts
So when we train our mindfulness and discernment to follow our every movement without any thought for whether we're meditating or not but simply keeping this hidden sort of meditation going at all times then no matter what our minds will have to enter stillness and discernment will begin to appear
In particular  for those of us who are monks or who are singlemindedly intent on practicing for the sake of mental peace and release from suffering and stress  mindfulness and discernment are even more necessary
Once we have trained mindfulness and discernment to become so habitual that we're constantly circumspect then when we focus outside we'll be intelligent
When we focus inside  on the body feelings mind and phenomena  we'll become more and more astute
When we investigate body feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance we'll develop techniques for removing defilement without break
Mindfulness is especially important
If you lack mindfulness as a protective barrier at any time discernment will simply turn into labels without your realizing it
Thus mindfulness is the quality with a solidity that helps discernment become astute in a smooth and even way
The power of mindfulness acts like the bank of a river keeping discernment from going out of bounds
Discernment that goes out of bounds turns into labels
If it's true discernment it doesn't go out of bounds because it has mindfulness in charge
If you use discernment to focus within the body things will catch your attention at every step
Inconstancy stress and notselfness One or another of these three characteristics is sure to appear because all of them are always there in the nature of the body
When mindfulness and discernment reach this level the mind and its objects will come into the present
You should know that no Dhamma has ever appeared because of past or future affairs
It appears only because of the present
Even if you contemplate matters of the past of future you have to bring them into the scope of the present if you hope to gain any benefit from them
For example if you see someone die refer it to yourself 'I'll have to die as well' As soon as the word 'I' appears things come running back to you and appear in the present
Matters of past and future if you want them to be useful must always be brought into the present
For example 'Yesterday that person died
Today or tomorrow I may die in the same way' With the 'I' you immediately come into the present
External matters have to be brought inward matters ahead and behind have to be brought into the present if they are to serve any benefit
If you always use mindfulness and discernment to contemplate the conditions of nature  such as the body  all around you then no matter what things won't lie beyond your grasp
You'll have to understand them clearly
In investigating phenomena such as the body analyze them into their parts and aspects and use your discernment to contemplate them until they are clear
Don't let thoughts or allusions drag you away from the phenomenon you are investigating unless you are using thoughts as a standard for your discernment to follow when it doesn't yet have enough strength for the investigation
Keep mindfulness firmly in place as a protective fence  and you will come to understand clearly things you never understood before because the conditions of nature are already there in full measure
You don't have to go looking anywhere for inconstancy stress and notselfness
They are qualities filling your body and mind at all times
The only problem is that mindfulness and discernment haven't been able to ferret them out to make them your own wealth
But if you are set on investigating observantly day and night  thinking not about how many times you do it in a day or night but taking the skill and agility of your discernment as your standard  keeping mindfulness as a steady flow in the present and radiating discernment all around you then whatever makes a move in any direction mindfulness and discernment will follow right after it
When we have trained mindfulness and discernment to be sufficient to the task like this how will their foes be able to withstand them
After all we haven't made it our purpose to encourage such things as restlessness and distraction
We're trying at all times to practice the Dhamma  the means for stopping such things  so as to keep abreast of the movements of the bandits always lying in wait to rob us at any moment
We must thus force the mind to investigate in the way we've mentioned
Ferret out each part of the body so as to see it clearly from the outside into the inside or take just the inside and bring it out for a look
Look forwards and backwards up and down separating the body into pieces
You can imagine fire burning it into ashes and dust or whatever other ways you can imagine it scattered into pieces depending on what comes easiest to you
All count as ways in which your discernment is making itself ingenious and astute
When it's sufficiently developed you'll be wise to all of these things and they'll be clear to your heart without your having to ask anyone else about them at all
The more you investigate the body until you understand it clearly the more clearly you will understand the affairs of feelings mind and phenomena or feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance because all these things are whetstones for sharpening discernment step by step
It's the same as when we bail water out of a fish pond The more water we bail out the more clearly we'll see the fish
Or as when clearing a forest The more vegetation we cut away the more space we'll see
The things I've just mentioned are the factors that conceal the mind so that we can't clearly see the mental currents that flow out from the heart to its various preoccupations
When you use discernment to contemplate in this way the currents of the heart will become plain
You'll see the rippling of the mind clearly every moment it occurs  and the heart itself will become plain because mindfulness is strong and discernment quick
As soon as the mind ripples mindfulness and discernment  which are there in the same place  will be able to keep track of it and resolve it in time
But be aware that in investigating the five khandhas or the four frames of reference we aren't trying to take hold of these things as our paths fruitions and nibbana
We're trying to strip them away so as to see exactly what is the nature of the fish  namely the heart containing all sorts of defilements
The more you investigate You needn't count how many times you do it in a day
Focus instead on how expert and agile you can make your mind at investigating
The more you investigate  and the more skillful you get at investigating  the more the astuteness of your discernment which is sharp and flashing as it deals with you yourself and with conditions of nature in general will develop until it has no limit
You'll eventually have the knowledge and ability to realize that the conditions of nature you have been investigating in stages  beginning with sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations throughout the cosmos and turning inward to your own body feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance  are not defilements cravings or mental effluents in any way
The heart alone is what has defilements cravings and mental effluents with which it binds itself
Nothing else has the power to reach into the heart so as to bind it
Aside from the heart that is ignorant about itself  searching for shackles for its neck and setting the fires of delusion to burn itself to no purpose  there are no traces of enemies to the heart anywhere at all
We can compare this to a knife which is a tool made to benefit intelligent people but which a foolish person grabs hold of to kill himself and then accuses the knife of being his enemy
What precedent is there for making such a charge
All conditions of nature in general are like useful tools but a stupid person grabs hold of them to bind himself and then claims that the conditions of nature throughout the world have put their heads together to abuse him
Who can decide such a case
 for the plaintiff has already killed himself
If we decide that the instrument of death loses the case to the dead plaintiff what sort of vindication is the plaintiff going to gain to give him any satisfaction
The heart that's deluded about itself and about its own affairs is in the same sort of predicament
Thus when discernment begins to penetrate in to know the conditions of nature  beginning with the body  it will also have to penetrate into the causal point
It will know clearly with its discernment the objects to which the mind tends to send its mental currents and how strong or weak many or few those currents are
It will come to see that the things that it used to see as enemies aren't really enemies at all
This is because of the power of discernment that has contemplated things carefully and correctly
At the same time it will turn around to perceive the awareness inside itself as being its own enemy
This is because of the power of the discernment that sees clearly and comes in letting go stage by stage the things it can no longer hold to
This is why clear understanding through discernment  once it has realized that sights sounds and so forth on into the body feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance are not enemies  must let them go stage by stage until they no longer remain in the heart
And as for this knowing nature Before we weren't able to tell whether it was harmful or beneficial which is why we went about branding things all over the cosmos as being good or bad beautiful or ugly lovable or hateful so amazing as to make us feel like floating or so dreary as to make us miserable and unable to sleep because of the dreariness in short making ourselves pleased displeased and endlessly miserable without our realizing it
What is the cause that makes the mind like a wheel turning in cycles around itself generating the fires of passion aversion and delusion to burn itself at all times
When discernment has contemplated things until they are clear all conditions of nature within and without will be seen to have the same characteristics
None of them are enemies to anyone at all
You will see  the moment discernment removes all the things concealing it  that the only fault lies with this knowing nature
At this point when the knower moves or ripples  blip
 you'll know immediately that the inner wheel is getting into the act
This is the troublemaker heaping up misery
It's the direct cause of suffering and stress
Aside from this knowing nature there is no cause of suffering and stress anywhere in the world
When we reach this level only this awareness  this entire awareness  is the cause of suffering
When this fact becomes this clear to the heart through discernment who would be willing to hold to this knower  this wheel  as his or her self
This is the subtle discernment the automatic discernment in the principles of nature that was trained by our forcing it in the beginning stages
The results now appear as an ingenuity and intelligence sufficient to the task
There's nothing wrong with calling it superdiscernment
In addition to knowing the revolving mind that is the cause of stress this discernment turns inward to know why that mind is a cause of stress and how
Intent on knowing it probes in after the reasons that reveal themselves
But for the most part when we reach this level if our discernment hasn't really considered things with precision and thoroughness we're sure to get stuck on this revolving awareness because it's the supreme cause of the cycle  so deceptive and attractive that we as meditators don't realize our attachment to it
In addition to being deluded and attached without our realizing it we may even spread this subtle form of delusion through our misunderstanding to delude many other people as well
So to let you know This knowing nature in terms of it marvelousness is more marvelous than anything else
In terms of its radiance it's more radiant than anything else which is why we should call it a pit of burning embers secretly lying in wait for us
But no matter what this knowing nature can't withstand the discernment that is its match in subtlety
We are sure to learn the truth from our discernment that this knowing nature is the foremost cause of suffering and stress
When we know this this nature won't be able to stand
It will have to disintegrate immediately just as when people smash a solid object to pieces with an iron bar
When this nature disintegrates after having been destroyed by discernment a nature marvelous far above and beyond any conventional reality will appear in full measure
At the same moment we will see the harm of what is harmful and the benefits of what is beneficial
The awareness of release will appear as dhammo padipo  the brightness of the Dhamma  in full radiance like the sun that when unobscured by clouds lets the world receive the full radiance of its light
The result is that the awareness of release appears plainly to the heart of the meditator the moment unawareness has disbanded
This is the result
What the causes are I've already explained to you conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment
This is the path to follow leading right to this point
It doesn't lead anywhere else
Whether you live at home in a monastery or in a forest whether you're a woman or a man ordained or not If you have these five qualities always with you you're heading toward this point
In other words we all have the same full rights in the practice and in the results we'll receive
So I ask that all of you as meditators  and you know clearly that you are meditators and abstainers as well  I ask that you practice so as to develop your thoughts words and deeds and that you fully abstain from things that are your enemies until you reach the goal  the release of nibbana  as I've already explained
None of these qualities lie beyond your mindfulness discernment and relentless effort
These are the teachings the Buddha gave to us as svakkhatadhamma  the welltaught Dhamma
In other words he rightly taught us the path to follow
He taught that the wrong path was really wrong and the right path really right
And the results  release and nibbana  that come from following the right path were also rightly taught
The only problem is with those of us following the path Will we really follow it rightly or not
If we follow it rightly in line with what the Buddha taught the results are sure to appear as sammadeva asavehi vimuccati  right release from all defilements and mental effluents
So for this reason you should make an effort to train your mindfulness and discernment at every moment and not just in any one particular position
Don't think that this is making too much of an effort
The more you understand the more ingenious you become the more you can cure defilement the more you gain release from suffering and stress These are the results we all want step by step until we really gain release with nothing left
In other words we gain release while we're conscious and aware in this lifetime while overseeing these five khandhas
This is the most certain Dhamma  because the word svakkhatadhamma the Dhamma rightly taught by the Buddha doesn't mean that it's right only after we die
It's also right while we are practicing it and the results that come in line with our efforts appear clearly to the hearts of meditators while they are alive
As for the methods or techniques you use to train your hearts I ask to leave them up to each person's intelligence and ingenuity in the course of making the effort in the practice
You have to notice which positions are most helpful in your practice
Don't simply sit and keep on sitting or walk and keep on walking
You have to remember to notice what results and benefits you get from your efforts as well because different people may find themselves more or less suited to the four different positions of sitting standing walking and lying down
Today I've explained the Dhamma to all of you from the beginning to the final point of my ability so I feel that this should be enough for now
I ask that each of you take the Dhamma that I've explained today and that you have encountered in your practice and make it food for thought or a companion to your practice
The results you will receive can in no way deviate from today's explanation
So I'll ask to stop here
The mind constantly coerced or oppressed at all times and the mind absolutely released from that coercion and oppression are two very different things  so different that there is no conventional reality that can be compared to the mind released
This sort of mind doesn't lie in the realm of conventional reality in such a way that anything may rightly be compared to it in keeping with the reality of its nature
Even though some comparisons can be made they're simply a manner of speaking
They aren't really in line with the truth of that nature as it exists
We have to make comparisons simply because the world has its conventions and analogies
We see prisoners in jail who are coerced and oppressed who are deprived of their freedom at all times beginning from the day of their imprisonment to the day of their release
What sort of happiness do they have
Even though they may have their laughter in line with the things that may make them laugh it's still the laughter of prisoners
Just hearing the word 'prisoner' is enough to tell us that happiness isn't what produces their laughter
Their penalty is what produces their laughter
It keeps coercing and oppressing them
So where can we find any happiness and pleasure among them
We can take this and compare it inwardly to the state of affairs between the mind and the defilements that coerce and oppress it
These things control and coerce it with every mental moment
Even when the mind isn't forming any thoughts it's still controlled and coerced in this way in line with its nature
When this is the case where can it find any true happiness
The happiness it does have is happiness like the food fed to prisoners
And what sort of food is that
Even though we may never have been imprisoned we know what sort of food is fed to prisoners
Is there anything satisfying about it the food they feed prisoners
The foods  the temptations  with which the defilements feed the mind if we were to speak in the way of the world are simply to keep it from dying in the same way that prisoners are fed
The defilements feed the mind so that it can be put to work in the same way that prisoners are fed so that they can be put to work so that we can get the fruits of their labor
The food for the mind that the defilements bring to sustain us is thus like the food fed to prisoners
There's no difference at all
If we compare them that's the way they are
But if we look from a different angle we can see that prisoners are still better off than we are because they know that they eat their food out of necessity
They don't eat it out of satisfaction with it or its taste or anything because there's nothing at all gratifying about the food they are fed
But we meditators are still content to be attached to the flavor of worldly pleasures so we're said to be stuck
When we're attached to visual objects it's because we find flavor in them
When we're attached to sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations it's simply because we find flavor in them
It's not the case that the only flavor is the flavor we taste with the tongue
All forms of contact  with the eye ear nose tongue body and mind  have their flavor and we've been attached to them in such a way that we haven't even realized our attachment for aeons and aeons
The mind is attached bound and feels love for these things without knowing that they are flavors that tie us down that they are all matters of defilement the flavors of defilement
So we are attached to the point where we will never know the harm of these flavors at all if we don't use mindfulness and discernment to investigate them wisely
Regardless of how many aeons may pass we will have to be attached to these flavors engrossed in these flavors without ever coming to our senses
This is the ingenuity the cleverness of the defilements
How ingenious and clever are they
If you want to know then set your heart on the practice
And don't forget what I'm saying here
Someday it's sure to become clear to your heart as a result of your earnest practice
There's no escaping it
Listen carefully to the Buddha's words 'The flavor of the Dhamma surpasses all other flavors' What sort of flavor is the flavor of the Dhamma that it has to surpass all other flavors
Those other flavors are the flavors of the food of prisoners imprisoned in the wheel of death and rebirth through the power of defilement
They aren't food or flavors that can keep the heart satisfied
They aren't true flavors
They aren't the flavors of the truth
They're the flavors of the counterfeits that the defilements whip up into being for us to touch or to eat
They aren't the flavors of the true Dhamma
The flavor of the Dhamma will begin to appear when the mind is centered in concentration
As soon as the mind begins to be still pleasure will begin to appear as its flavor depending on the amount of stillness in line with the levels of its tranquillity
When we say 'levels of tranquillity' don't go thinking that they're separate steps like those of a ladder
It's simply a way of speaking
Actually they're all connected from the pleasure of basic concentration progressively up to the levels of refined concentration
The pleasure that arises will become correspondingly more and more refined
This counts as one of the flavors of the Dhamma  the Dhamma of concentration the Dhamma of peace  in the levels of the stillness of the mind
As soon as the mind has stillness for its food it lets go of its concerns for the various flavors of sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations step by step because the flavor of this stillness begins to excel them
Even this is enough to begin excelling all other flavors
Even more so when the mind begins to investigate things with its discernment analyzing them in terms of the three characteristics or the meditation theme of unattractiveness  because in the beginning we tend to develop the theme of unattractiveness contemplating every part of our own body and the bodies of others inside and out as seems most appropriate and natural for us to investigate because they all share the same conditions for us to see clearly step by step The flavor of the Dhamma will then intensify becoming an ingenious flavor
And in addition to being an ingenious flavor it's a flavor that comes from being able to let go
The nature of the mind is such that once it investigates anything to the point of seeing it clearly it lets go
When it hasn't let go when it grasps with attachment these are the chains and fetters with which defilement keeps it bound
The defilements confer titles telling us 'This is good
That's pretty
This is beautiful' They never tell us that the body is filthy ugly inconstant stressful and notself  not belonging to us or to anyone else
These are things the defilements never tell us never mention never suggest in line with the principles of the truth
Instead they bring their own principles in to interfere with the Dhamma telling us just the opposite  that this or that is beautiful lasting valuable  denying the truth every step of the way because they are very powerful
For this reason we need to keep track of their deceits counteracting and removing them by using such qualities as mindfulness and discernment
Our world is entirely stuck in the deceits of defilement
When discernment has investigated inward in line with the principles of unattractiveness as we have already mentioned and in line with the three characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself probing and analyzing back and forth time and again the truths that the defilements have kept concealed will be revealed in line with these principles of truth  because these principles are truth pure and simple
There's nothing counterfeit about them
What's counterfeit  our false views  are an affair of defilement not an affair of the Dhamma
We will be able truly to see things as they are  without a doubt  once we can remove the counterfeit things that conceal them
For example beauty Where exactly is the body beautiful
What is there about it that you can claim to be beautiful
If you speak in terms of the principles of the truth how can you even look at the human body
It's entirely filled with filthiness both within and without which is why we have to keep washing it all the time
Even the clothing and other articles on which the body depends have to be dirty because the main part  the body  is a well of filth within and without
Whatever it comes into contact with  robes clothing dwelling bedding  has to become dirty as well
Wherever human beings live becomes dirty but we don't see the truth mainly because we aren't interested in looking
As meditators we should investigate so as to see this truth
Don't run away from it
This is the genuine truth
The things that fool us into seeing the body as beautiful are counterfeit and false
So
Look into your body
Which part can you claim to be beautiful to contend with the truth of the Dhamma
Look for it
Is there any part that dares claim to be above the Dhamma and more true than the Dhamma  unless it's simply more false than the Dhamma
The fact that the Dhamma isn't appearing in our heart is because at the moment falseness is more powerful more established and conceals things completely
Even though there's filth throughout the body both within and without we're still able to regard it as beautiful and lasting
The issues between truth and falsity lie within our body and mind because the defilements themselves lie within the mind and spread their power out throughout the various parts of the body and then splash out beyond throughout the world of rebirth saying that this is us that's ours everything is us ours beautiful lasting enjoyable  depending on the song with which the defilements the deceivers fool the mind into jumping bouncing and spinning much more than a soccer ball
And what happiness can we find in jumping along with all the deceits we've mentioned here
If we haven't yet awakened and come to our senses when will we and where
If the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha hasn't awakened us meditators who in the world will be able to awaken us
As they say 'svakkhato bhagavata dhammo' 'The Dhamma of the Buddha is rightly taught'  rightly taught in a way clear to see with nothing hidden or esoteric
What's hidden about it
If we look with our eyes we'll see in line with what I've said here
So
Look on in from the skin on in
Skinscum and sweatscum Is there anything good about them
Anything clean and beautiful
If they were clean how could we call them scum
Then look on inside
What is there inside that can contend with the Dhamma and claim to be pretty and beautiful
The Dhamma tells us that there's nothing pretty or beautiful in there that it's all filthy
So which part is going to contend with the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha
If the Dhamma is false if the Buddha didn't teach it rightly then find something to prove it wrong
All of the things that the Dhamma criticizes When you penetrate into them with discernment you'll find that that's just how they are
There's no point with which you can argue
All of these things have been true ever since before we investigated them but the defilements have closed our eyes to them
Even though we see them we don't see them for what they are
Even though filth fills the body the defilements deny it entirely and turn it into something beautiful  and we believe them without looking at the Dhamma that's waving its arms at us ready to help us at all times as if it were calling to us 'Hold on
Hold on to the Dhamma
Hurry up and you'll escape from danger
Hurry and let go of the defilements
They're a fire burning you'
See what happens when you smash the defilements to bits
Fight with them until you have no more breath to breathe
That's when the Dhamma will fully reveal itself in every facet for you to see clearly
This is the way of digging into the things that conceal so as to uncover the truth the genuine Dhamma
If we see the truth we begin to see the genuine Dhamma step by step
Even on the level of stillness we're already not embroiled with anything because we have the savor of the Dhamma
The heart can drink of the Dhamma mental peace and calm
The heart doesn't jump or run isn't vain or proud restless or distracted flying out after various preoccupations because it has found a satisfying food to sustain it
When we use discernment to investigate  to prepare our food so to speak  to make it even more exquisite than the food of tranquillity turning it into the food of discernment this has a flavor even more exquisite and refined without limit which comes from investigating and analyzing the body the theme of our meditation
The basic principle on which we depend to counteract and remove the defilements lies right here which is why the Buddha focuses his teachings right here
It wouldn't work to focus anywhere else because this is the primary place where living beings are attached
Attachments outside come second to this
When we have investigated so as to see in line with this truth step by step without retreating in our investigation or letting it lapse until we have clearly understood then the point of 'enough' in our investigation together with the point where we let go of our attachments will appear of its own accord through the power of the discernment that has removed all things concealing has dismantled all things counterfeit so as to see the truth clearly in the heart
Discernment on this level will then stop of its own accord
As for the affairs of attachment we needn't say anything because they are simply the results of delusion
Wherever knowledge penetrates delusion will immediately retreat so how can attachment remain
It will have to retreat without a doubt
The more we investigate in preparing our food  the flavor of the Dhamma  through the power of mindfulness and discernment unraveling things to see them clearly for what they are the more the mind becomes light and airy
Disenchanted and dismayed
'How long have I been attached this way
Why have I dared to make things up in such a bullheaded way' This is the exclamation with which we reproach ourselves  because things actually haven't been what we've made them up to be
So why have we made them up that way
We then immediately see through the makebelieve that has led to this state of affairs because discernment is what penetrates and makes its choices
How will it not know what's true and what's not
If we analyze the body to pieces we can clearly see that it's a living cemetery
When it dies it's a dead cemetery
How can we stand to look at it
Look all over the world Is there any place where there are no cemeteries
There are cemeteries wherever living beings dwell
Investigate on down to the truth
Is our discernment for us to make into food
It's for us to cure our bankruptcy so that we can escape from being prisoners held in custody by the defilements
Why shouldn't we be able to escape
The Dhamma of the Lord Buddha is perfectly suited to us human beings which is why he taught it to the human world
He saw this as the central point of existence the most appropriate place
There's no one more intelligent than the Buddha the foremost Teacher who taught the Dhamma to the most appropriate place our human world
At the moment what are we
We're human beings
Of this we're certain
In addition we're monks  meditating monks at that so why shouldn't we be able to seize the excellence of the flavor of the Dhamma to taste as our own treasure through our own practice
If we aren't capable who in the world is capable
To whom should we hand over this capability
At the moment whose hearts are being squeezed by suffering and stress
Aren't these things squeezing our own hearts
So to whom are we going to hand over this capability
To whom are we going to hand over all the duties and responsibilities involved in attaining freedom
Should we hand them over to suffering
We already have suffering in our hearts
The only thing to do is to remove suffering and stress through persistent effort
We're fighters
We have to be defiant
We can't let ourselves say retreat
So
Whatever the pain however great it may be we're ready for it
The pain and suffering that come with the effort won't lead us to bankruptcy
They're better than the pain and suffering that are already putting a squeeze on us at all times and serve no purpose at all
So dig on down meditators
This is one step in the investigation
The Buddha teaches us to visit cemeteries because we don't yet see the cemetery within
We first have to visit external cemeteries to open the way for bringing the mind into our own internal cemetery
It's full of corpses
Aside from the fact that the body itself is a cemetery the corpses of all sorts of animals fill our belly
What sorts of things have been stuffed in there
For how long
Why don't we look at this cemetery
Look so as to see it clearly
Unattractiveness inconstancy stress and notself are all heaped right here
We don't have to go looking for them anywhere else
When we look in terms of changeability  inconstancy  we can see it clearly
The body keeps changing all the time from the day it's born to the day it dies
Even feelings keep changing in their way pleasure pain and indifference both in body and mind
They keep spinning around in this way
When do they ever stop
If we have any mindfulness and discernment why don't we see these things as they do their work in line with their natural principles
If we use our mindfulness and discernment we have to see we have to know
These things can't be kept hidden
They can't be kept hidden from mindfulness and discernment
We have to see right through them
There's no doubt about this
Stress
Which part of the body gives us any pleasure or ease
There's nothing but stress and pain filling the body
We've constantly had to tend and care for the body so that it has been able to survive this far so are we still going to be attracted to this mass of fire
Notself
The Buddha has already proclaimed it
'It's not the self
Don't mess with it' As if he were slapping our wrists 'Don't reach for it
Don't touch
It's dangerous' Whenever you say that it's you or yours your attachment is like grabbing fire so extricate yourself using discernment
See these things as being truly inconstant stressful and notself
The mind then won't dare to reach for them or touch them
Step by step it will let go of its burdens  its attachments which are a heavy weight
When the mind extricates itself from its attachments it becomes lighter and lighter more and more at ease
The savor of the Dhamma will appear step by step even more exquisite than on the level of concentration
When the flavor of the Dhamma surpasses the flavor of these various defilements they have to be discarded and trampled underfoot
The physical khandha  the body  is important
It has a really great impact on the mind
To love it is to suffer
To hate it is to suffer
To be angry with it is to suffer
The affairs connected with the body are more prominent than any others
If the mind has no stillness there's nowhere it can find any relief
There's nowhere we as monks can retreat to find any pleasure
For this reason we must try to still our minds and make use of the Dhamma to attack our defilements
Don't feel any regret for the time it takes
Don't feel any regret for the cycles of rebirth for the prison for our wardens and torturers the various kinds of defilement
These have been our greatest torturers from time immemorial
Even though we may not remember for how long simply hold to the principle of the present as your primary guide and they'll all be scattered
The past no matter how long is simply a matter of this same mass of suffering
If we can't shed it these things will have to continue this way forever
Don't be interested in any other matters
Keep watch of the truth  which is within you proclaiming itself at all times  by using mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence
Don't let up or retreat
Don't see anything as having greater value than the effort of extricating yourself from these things that coerce and oppress you
You'll then be able to make something extraordinary of yourself
Whether or not you give yourself titles make sure at least that you aren't burdened or attached right here
This is where the Buddha says the highest savor is found
Uproot the things that involve and entangle you each step along the way
Keep cutting your way in beginning with the physical heap  the body  which is one wall or one thick covering
Once you've passed the physical heap ransacked this physical heap and known it clearly with understanding without any remaining ties it's as if you have amassed a large pile of capital clear to your heart
You can be certain of progressing to release at one point or another in this present lifetime with no need to anticipate it as happening in this year or that
Once the mind has attained this level you can be sure of yourself
Persistence comes on its own
The pain and difficulties that come from making the effort are completely erased of their own accord because the flavor of the Dhamma appearing clearly to the heart has a power far overriding the pains that come from the persistent effort
The heart becomes motivated through the principles of its nature
Persistence keeps spinning in the person who used to be lazy
Laziness is a matter of the defilements resisting and fighting the Dhamma
When we start out making the effort then laziness weakness discouragement pain and difficulty all come thronging in oppressing us so that we can't take a step and we finally fall down with a crash
That shows we've been shot
They don't have to shoot us a second time
One shot and we're down  down on the pillow snoring away
We keep getting shot by the defilements again and again till we're thoroughly mangled
Our efforts don't amount to anything
If this is the way things are then we'll be sunk in the round of rebirth sunk in the prison of the wheel of rebirth forever with never a day when we'll gain release never a day when we'll be free
So slash away at the defilements using the principles of the Dhamma that the Buddha taught and aren't otherwise
You'll then have to gain release from these things that coerce and oppress you without a doubt
The important points are persistence mindfulness discernment and endurance
So
Keep enduring
What's wrong with endurance for the sake of making your way
Other things you can endure
Physical pain to the brink of death No one else can endure it for you
You have to endure it for yourself
Haven't you already endured it before
So why can't you endure the pains and deprivations that come with the effort of the practice
After all you endure them for the sake of the effort to extricate yourself from suffering
So why can't you endure them
Make it strong your heart as a monk your heart as a meditator
Once you've seen the dangers pointed out by the Dhamma you'll see the benefits arising through your efforts
In the beginning you have to grapple a great deal with the body as your meditation theme
Once you've opened your way and seen causes and results as your starting capital then the four mental khandhas  vedana sañña sankhara and viññana  have already gotten into the act
There are feelings in the body as well as in the mind so when you're investigating the body how can these things not rush in to connect
They're related phenomena
It's not the case that you finish investigating the body before you start investigating vedana sañña sankhara and viññana
Don't plan on things being that way because it's wrong
In the truth of the practice that's not the way things are
Once your work is focused on any one point it has an impact on everything else but these things become prominent only after the body has lost its meaning and value for us through the Dhamma
Before we saw it as having a great deal of meaning and value but once the Dhamma  the truth  has demolished the falsity of this sort of defilement and craving these things lose their meaning and worth
The Dhamma now clearly has a value above and beyond them
This is when vedana sañña sankhara and viññana become prominent because they've already opened the way from the stage of the physical body
What is there to feelings
For the most part they converge in on feelings of the mind
As for physical feelings I've already explained them to you before
If you analyze them when you're sick or have been sitting in meditation for a long time you'll know them
If you want to know them focus on them today using mindfulness and discernment and you'll understand them
You're sure to understand them clearly if you use discernment
Don't simply endure them
To contend with pain you have to use discernment
Simply fighting it simply enduring it doesn't count as the path
The path is mindfulness and discernment
The greater the pain the more these things spin into work
You can't let mindfulness and discernment leave the point of the pain
As for the body each part will be seen clearly as a reality in line with its nature within the mind because in accordance with the principles of nature that's what they already are
No matter how much pain arises in the body it's its own separate reality
Only the mind is what labels and interprets it
Once the mind has used discernment to investigate the pain to the point of being abreast of it it will extricate itself from the pain to be its own separate reality on this level so that each is a separate reality
When each is a separate reality what harm can they do to each other
What impact can they have on each other
None at all
The body is the body the pain is a pain the heart is the heart ie the mind is the mind
Each is a separate reality with no impact on the others
Even if the pain doesn't subside it has no impact
It has no impact on the mind at all
This is called seeing the truth
After you've done this many times you'll be able to uproot your attachments to the body and the pain in the body will be passed by as well
The only issue remaining will be feelings in the mind
Sañña and sankhara are important
Once the body the physical heap is passed sañña and sankhara  thoughtformations  become prominent because there are no more problems involving the body
The mind isn't willing to investigate the body again just as when we've eaten enough of this sort of food we put it aside and continue eating whatever else still attracts us
When we're completely full we put it all aside no matter what kind of food it is meat dishes or desserts
Our investigation is similar to this
It tells us on its own
When the mind has had enough of anything it lets go and no longer investigates that thing
It then continues with other things in the same way that when we've eaten enough of this sort of food we go on to other sorts until we're completely full
Then we put it all aside
Our investigation is so that we will have enough and then let go
Sankhara refers to the thoughtformations in the mind  good thoughts bad thoughts this issue and that
They keep forming all the time
Each of us falls for his or her own issues
Even if other people don't become involved with us the mind has to paint pictures and form thoughts past and future a big turmoil within the heart
We get infatuated with this preoccupation saddened by that one
Matters that passed months and years ago we warm up and serve to torment the mind to oppress and coerce it because of our delusion because of the fact that we aren't up on the tricks and deceits of this sort of defilement
This is why we have to investigate them
Whatever issues the mind forms if they're good they vanish if they're bad they vanish  so what sense or substance can we gain from them
Wherever they arise probe on down right there
Sañña labels and interpretations They come labeling out of the mind
This is how the mind appears when it reaches a refined level
This is the way the natural principles of the investigation are of their own accord
Even if no one tells us we come to understand on our own
Wherever anything makes contact mindfulness and discernment spin around right there until they understand and let go
Once discernment has cut the bridge to the body it has also cut the bridges to external sights sounds smells and tastes
The only things left in the mind are feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance
These deal entirely with the mind itself
We investigate at that point with discernment without becoming intimate with any of these four conditions
For example feeling Pleasure arises and vanishes
Pain arises and vanishes there in the heart
The Buddha thus calls them inconstant and notself
Inconstant and notself
They arise and vanish
Labels are also inconstant stressful and notself
What is there to become attached to
They're just like the body
In other words they're all a heap of the three characteristics
When we have investigated them time and again these four conditions shrink into the mind
This is called giving chase to defilement
Probe into that point with discernment until you know and see it clearly
When the defilements can't find any place to hide they'll go running into the mind
Mindfulness and discernment then come spinning into mano the mind
This too the Buddha tells us not to hold onto
Listen
The mind too is inconstant stressful and notself
Listen to that
How can the mind not share in the three characteristics when the defilements are in there
How can we hold to the mind as being us or ours when the entire army of defilement is in there
If we hold to the mind as being us or ours it's the same as holding to defilement as being us or ours so how can we gain release
Very profound this point of Dhamma here on the level of investigation
The mind too is inconstant stressful and notself because the defilements are in there
So strike on down with your investigation
Whatever gets smashed  even if ultimately the mind itself is demolished along with everything else  at least know it clearly with your discernment
The defilement that forms the essence of the cycle  which in Pali is termed 'avijjapaccaya sankhara' 'With unawareness as condition there occur mental formations' This is the seed of becoming and birth buried here in this mind
When its bridges are cut it can't find any way out to go looking for food
The bridges out the eyes have been cut
The bridges out the ears nose tongue and body have all been cut by discernment
The defilements can't find any way out to develop love for sights smells tastes or tactile sensations because all their bridges have been cut
We're abreast of things as they actually occur so the defilements go running inside
If they try to become attached to the body that's something we've already investigated and known with discernment something we've already let go
Feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance have all been investigated and seen to have the three characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself so where do the defilements lie
They have to be hiding in the Big Cave the mind
So discernment goes slashing in
So now is the mind us
Is it ours
Slash on down
Whatever is going to be destroyed let it be destroyed
We feel no regrets
We want only the truth
Even if the mind is going to be smashed and destroyed along with everything else let's at least know with our practice
Strike on down
Ultimately everything counterfeit gets smashed while the nature of pure truth of supreme truth  the pure mind  doesn't die and isn't destroyed
See
So now whether you call it inconstant stressful and notself or not at least make the mind pure and it will gain release from all conventional realities
Inconstancy stress and notself lie within the realm of convention
Once the mind has gained release from these things there's nothing more that can be said  even though we are completely aware
So what is there now to doubt
This is release from the prison from the cycle that imprisons living beings and us in particular  our mind in particular now extricated right here
Freed right here
All that is needed is for the defilements to be shed entirely from the heart There is nothing else to pose the heart any problems
This is thus called the timeless heart the timeless Dhamma freed from time
It's a pure nature always fully 'buddho' like that
At this point how can we not clearly see the harm of defilement
When such things as mindfulness and discernment have trampled defilement to bits how can we not see its harm with our whole heart
How can we not see through the happiness that the defilements bring to feed us when we're ready to die simply to keep us going
'That's the sugarcoated happiness concocted by the defilements simply to keep us going
That's the flavor of defilement
But the flavor the Dhamma is like this something else entirely' How can we help but know
To summarize the mind that lies under the power of the cycle with the defilements coercing and oppressing it is not at all different from a convict in prison
When it has gained utter release from its prison of defilement there's no comparison for it
Even so we praise it as being supreme  a convention which doesn't really correspond to that reality
But even though it doesn't correspond you can be assured that the difference is just like that between the mind imprisoned and the mind released from all coercion completely free and independent
They're different in just the way that we've said
So be earnest and intent
You've come here for the purpose of learning and finding things of substance and value for yourselves
Investigate so as to see clearly in line with the principles of inconstancy stress and notself as I have mentioned because they underlie the way everything is throughout the three levels of the cosmos
There's nothing splendid enough for us to feel regret at leaving it
The only thing splendid is release
It's a nature truly splendid
We don't have to confer titles on it because it's its own nature
It has had enough of everything of every sort
This is what is meant when we say that the flavor of the Dhamma excels all other flavors
Whatever kinds of flavors we may have experienced the flavor of the Dhamma excels them all lets them all go because no other flavor can match it
Even this flavor it isn't attached to
This flavor we say is supreme isn't attached to itself
It's simply a principle of truth and that's all
So
Be earnest meditators
Don't get discouraged
Give your life to the Buddha
Even though we may have never said that we've given our life to defilement that's what we've done for an infinitely long time to the point where we can't count the times
Even in the single lifetime of an individual we can't count the times
Take the realm of the present that's visible to us and work back to infinity It's all come from the avijjapaccaya sankhara embedded here in the heart for countless lifetimes
Nothing else in the cosmos has caused us to experience becoming and birth and to carry the mass of all sufferings other than this avijjapaccaya sankhara
For this reason when they say the mind of a person who dies is annihilated just where is it annihilated
Use the practice to get a hold on the matter
Don't speak simply in line with the tricks and deceits of defilement that close off our ears and eyes
Defilement says that death is followed by annihilation
See
It's blinded us completely
As for the defilement that causes people to take birth and die where is it annihilated
If we want to see through its tricks and deceits why don't we take its arrows to shoot it in return
It causes living beings to lie buried in the cycle so where is defilement annihilated
And what does it coerce if it doesn't coerce the mind
If the mind is annihilated how can defilement coerce it
The mind isn't annihilated which is why defilement has been able to coerce it into birth aging illness and death all along without ceasing
So why do we fall for the deceits of defilement when it says that death is followed by annihilation without having the sense to see the harm of its deceits
This sneaky defilement has fooled living beings into falling for it and grabbing at suffering for a long infinitely long time
So investigate down to the truth
Find out what is and isn't annihilated
That's when you can be called skilled at the Dhamma skilled at exploring and investigating down to the truth
That's how the Buddha proclaimed and taught the Dhamma
He taught the Dhamma using the truth he had already practiced by making the causes absolutely complete and attaining results satisfactory to his heart and then taking that Dhamma to teach the world
So where did he ever say that death is followed by annihilation just where
He taught nothing but birth aging illness and death birth aging illness and death over and over
All of the Buddhas taught like this
They never differed because they all knew and saw the same sort of truth in line with the principles of that truth
So how can you make the mind be annihilated when it's already utterly true
Birth and death birth and death without ceasing What is the cause
The Buddha has taught us beginning with avijjapaccaya sankhara sankharapaccaya viññana  'With unawareness as condition there are formations
With formations as condition there is cognizance' These are the causes
They're buried in the mind which is why they cause us to take birth without ceasing
As soon as we destroy avijjapaccaya sankhara what happens
Avijjayatveva asesaviraganirodha sankhara nirodho  'All that is needed is for unawareness to be completely disbanded from the heart then nirodho hoti  everything else is disbanded' What do you say to that
Evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa nirodho hoti  'All that is needed is for unawareness to be utterly disbanded and everything  the entire mass of suffering and stress  is disbanded' And that which knows that unawareness is disbanded that's the pure one
How can that pure one disband or be annihilated
It's an utter truth
So look
Listen
We Buddhists take the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha as our refuge you know
We don't take the defilements as our refuge
We're meditators so we have to probe and explore so as to see the truth
Whoever may bring the entire cosmos to intimidate or take issue with us we won't bat an eye
Once we've seen and known the truth with our full hearts how can anyone intimidate us
Think for a minute The Buddha was a single solitary person
Why was he able to be the Teacher of all three levels of existence
If he didn't teach the truth that he had known and seen with his full heart what did he teach
He taught with courage
There has never been anyone who has excelled him in being thoroughly trained and bringing the pure truth to teach the world
He didn't teach anything counterfeit or guessed at
To speak out of guesswork scratching at fleas That's the science of unawareness  the science of unawareness that lulls the world into bankruptcy
The principles of the genuine truth don't teach us to be bankrupt which is why we say that those other things are counterfeit
The Dhamma is a truth on which we can stake our life without question
Defilements are false the whole lot of them
out of are counterfeit
The Dhamma is true  percent all true
The Dhamma and defilement pass each other going in opposite directions which is why they are adversaries
In the effort of the practice if we don't fight with the defilements what will we fight with
These are our adversaries
If we don't fight with them what will we fight with
At the moment the defilements are the adversaries of the Dhamma
They're our adversaries
If we don't fight with the defilements that are our adversaries and the Dhamma's what will we fight with
Once we know all about the affairs of the defilements what doubts will we have about the Dhamma
In particular what doubts will the mind have about the matter of death and rebirth or death and annihilation
Find out just where things get annihilated meditators
Whatever we hear is the voice of those filthy defilements
Aren't we tired of washing our ears
Listen to the voice of the foremost Teacher's Dhamma
Our ears will then be clean and our hearts pure
So be earnest
Shillyshallying around thinking of sleep thinking of our stomachs These are habits long embedded in our hearts
They're all an affair of defilement
So flip over a new leaf making the heart an affair of the Dhamma in keeping with the fact that we're disciples of the Tathagata who have given ourselves to be ordained in his religion and to follow the principles of his Dhamma
That's when we'll attain a great treasure of infinite worth to rule our hearts
When the Dhamma rules the heart how is it different from defilement ruling the heart
As I've said before the Dhamma ruling the heart is something supreme and magnificent We're fully free with our full heart  not grasping not hungry not searching not hoping to depend on anything  for the Dhamma has filled the heart and that's plenty enough
I can tell a resolute person when I see him  like our Ven
Acariya Mun
It was intimidating just to look at him
How could the defilements not be intimidated by him
Even we were intimidated by him and the defilements are smarter than we are so how could they not be intimidated
They had to be intimidated
That's the way things have to be
A teacher who possesses the Dhamma who possesses virtue has to be resolute so as to eliminate evil
He has to be resolute
He can't not be resolute
The stronger the evil then the more resolute the stronger his goodness has to be
It can't not be resolute and strong
Otherwise it'll get knocked out
Suppose this place were dirty However dirty it might be we couldn't clean it just by splashing it with a glass of water could we
So how would we make it clean
We'd have to use a lot of water
If this place were filled with a pile of excrement we'd have to splash it with a whole bucket  and not just an ordinary bucket
A great big one
A single splash and all the excrement would be scattered
The place would become clean because the water was stronger
Being resolute is thus different from being severe because it means being earnest toward everything of every sort in keeping with reason
Take this and think it over
If you act weakly in training yourself you're not on the path
You have to be strong in fighting with defilement
Don't let the strong defilements step all over you
If we don't have any way of fighting defilement  if we're weak and irresolute  we're good for nothing at all
Those who want what is clean and good from the Dhamma What is the Dhamma like
What did the Buddha teach
What sort of defilements are eliminated by what sort of Dhamma so that it deserves to be called the middle way
The Buddha taught 'The middle way realized by the Tathagata  producing vision producing realization  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to nibbana' This is in the Discourse on Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion
The middle way is what can cause all these forms of knowledge to arise
Realization This is penetrative knowledge that's very subtle and sharp
Even discernment is less penetrating and sharp than it is
Selfawakening
Nibbana This path leads to nibbana
All of these things without exception come from this middle way
They don't lie beyond range of this middle way at all
What does it mean the word 'middle'
Middleness as it is in reality and the middleness we hear about study memorize and speculate about Are they different
Very different
I'll give you an example
Suppose there are two soldiers both of whom have studied the full course of military science
One of them has never been in the battle lines while the other has had a lot of experience in the battle lines to point where he has just barely escaped with his life
Which of the two can speak more accurately and fluently about the reality of fighting in a war
We have to agree without hesitation that the soldier who has been in battle can speak of every facet in line with the events he has seen and encountered to the extent that he could come out alive
If he were stupid he would have had to die
He had to have been ingenious in order to survive
So the middle way How is it 'middle'
We've been taught that following the middle way means not being too lax not being too extreme
So what way do we follow so that it's not too lax or too extreme so that we're in line with the principle of middleness aimed at by the genuine Dhamma
When we've sat a little while in meditation we get afraid that we'll ache that we'll faint we'll die our body will be crippled or we'll go crazy so we tell ourselves 'We're being too extreme' See
Understand
If we think of making a donation we say 'No
That'd be a waste
We'd do better to use it for this or that' So what is this
Do you understand whose 'middleness' this is
If we're going to follow the way of the Dhamma we say it's too extreme but if we're going to follow the way of defilement then we're ready for anything without a thought for middleness at all
So whose middleness is this
It's just the middleness of the defilements because the defilements have their middleness just like we do
When people do good want to go to heaven want to attain nibbana they're afraid that it's craving
But when they want to go to hell in this very life you know they don't worry about whether it's craving or not
They don't even think about it
When they go into a bar Is this craving
They don't stop to think about it
When they drink liquor or fool around with the ways to deprivation Is this the middle way or not
Is this craving
Is this defilement or not
They don't bother to think
But when they think of turning to the area of the Dhamma then it becomes too extreme
Everything becomes too extreme
What is this
Doesn't the thought ever occur to us that these are the opinions of the defilements dragging us along
The defilements dress things up just fine
Their real middleness is in the middle of the pillow the middle of the sleeping mat
As soon as we do a little walking meditation and think buddho dhammo sangho it's as if we were being taken to our death as if we were tied to a leash like a monkey squirming and jumping so that we'll let go of the buddho that will lead us beyond their power
Whether we're going to give alms observe the precepts or practice meditation we're afraid that we're going to faint and die
There's nothing but defilement putting up obstacles and blocking our way
We don't realize what the middleness of defilement is like because it's been lulling us to sleep all along
Just now I mentioned the two soldiers who had studied military science one of whom had gone into battle while the other one hadn't
We can compare this to studying the texts
Those who have gone into battle  who have had experience dealing with defilement and fighting with defilement  are the ones who can describe the middle way correctly and accurately
If you simply study and memorize Here I'm not belittling study
Study all you can
Memorize all you can
I'm not criticizing memorization
But if you simply memorize the names of the defilements  even if you memorize their ancestry  it doesn't mean a thing if you aren't intent on the practice
If you don't practice it's just like memorizing the names of different criminals
What this or that gang of criminals does how it makes its money what it likes to do what their names are We can memorize these things
Not to mention just their names we can even memorize their ancestry but if we don't get into action and deal with them those criminals whose names we can remember will keep on harming the world
So simply memorizing names doesn't serve any purpose
We have to get into action and lay down a strategy
Where do those criminals rob and steal
We then take our strategy and put it into practice lying in wait for them this place and that until we can catch them
Society can then live in peace
This is the area of the practice
The same holds true with defilements and mental effluents
We have to practice
Once we know we put our knowledge into practice
What is it like to give alms
We've already given them
What is it like to observe the precepts
We've already observed them
What is it like to meditate
We've already done it
This is called practice
It's not that we simply memorize that giving alms has results like that observing the precepts has results like this meditation has results like that heaven is like this nibbana is like that
If we simply say these things and memorize them without being interested in the practice we won't get to go there we won't get any of the results
So now to focus down on the practice of fighting with defilement The defilements have been the enemies of the Dhamma from time immemorial
The Buddha has already taught that the defilements are the enemies of the Dhamma
Where do they lie
Right here  in the human heart
Where does the Dhamma lie
In the human heart
This is why human beings have to fight defilement
In fighting the defilements there has to be some suffering and pain as a matter of course
Whatever weapons they use whatever their attack whatever their tactics the Dhamma has to go spinning on in
The ways of sidestepping fighting jabbing attacking the ways of eliminating defilement all have to be in line with the policies of the Dhamma  such as Right Views and Right Attitudes  spinning back and forth
Gradually the defilements collapse through our practice
This is what is meant by the middle way
So
Go ahead and want
Want to gain release from suffering
Want to gain merit
Want to go to heaven
Want to go to nibbana
Go ahead and want as much as you like because it's all part of the path
It's not the case that all wanting is craving
If we think that all wanting is craving then if we don't let there be craving it's as if we were dead
No wanting no anything Is that what it means not to have defilement or craving
Is that kind of person anything special
It's nothing special at all because it's a dead person
They're all over the place
A person who isn't dead has to want this and that  just be careful that you don't go wanting in the wrong direction that's all
If you want in the wrong direction it's craving and defilement
If you want in the right direction it's the path so make sure you understand this
The stronger our desire the more resolute our persistence will be
Desire and determination are part of the path the way to gain release from stress
When our desire to go heaven to attain nibbana to gain release from stress is strong and makes us brave in the fight then our persistence our stamina our fighting spirit are pulled together into a single strength by our desire to attain nibbana and release from stress
They keep spinning away with no concern for day or night the month or the year
They simply keep at the fight all the time
How about it
Are they resolute now
When the desire gets that strong we have to be resolute meditators
No matter how many defilements there are make them collapse
We can't retreat
We're simply determined to make the defilements collapse
If they don't collapse then we're prepared to collapse if we're no match for them
But the word 'lose' doesn't exist in the heart
If they kick us out of the ring we climb right back in to fight again
If they kick us out again we climb back in again and keep on fighting
After this happens many times we can start kicking the defilements out of the ring too you know
After we're been kicked and hit many times each time is a lesson
Wherever we lose to defilement whatever tactics the defilements use to beat us we use their tactics to counteract them
Eventually we'll be able to stand them off
As the defilements gradually become weaker the matters of the Dhamma  concentration mindfulness discernment persistence  become stronger and stronger
This is where the defilements have to grovel because they're no match
They're no match for the Dhamma
Before we were the only ones groveling
Wherever we groveled we'd get kicked by the defilements
Lying down we'd cry
We'd moan
Sitting we'd moan
Standing we'd feel desire
Walking we'd feel desire and hunger
Wherever we'd go there'd be nothing but love hate and anger filling the heart
There'd be nothing but defilement stomping all over us
But once these things get struck down by mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence they don't exist no matter where we go  because the defilements are groveling
They keep on groveling and we keep on probing for them without let up
Whenever we find one we kill it
Whenever we find one we kill it until the defilements are completely eradicated with nothing left in the heart
So now when we talk about defilement no matter what the kind we can talk without hesitation
Whatever tricks and tactics we employed to shed the defilements we can describe without hesitation
The purity of the heart that has no more defilements ruining it as before we can describe without hesitation
This is like the person who has gone into battle and can speak without hesitation
It's not the same as when we simply memorize
If we simply memorize we can speak only in line with the texts
We can't elaborate the least little bit
We don't know how
But a person who has gone into battle knows all the ins and outs  not simply that military science says to do things like this or to follow that route
He can make his way through every nook and cranny every zig and zag depending on what he needs to do to get to safety or gain victory
A fighter takes whatever means he can get
It's the same with us in fighting defilement
Whatever approach we should use to win the Buddha provides all the weapons of the Dhamma for us to think up with our own mindfulness and discernment
We people never run out of rope you know
When we really come to the end of our rope then mindfulness and discernment produce ways for us to help ourselves so that we can bash the defilements to bits until no more defilements are left
From that point on wherever the defilements bring in their armies in whoever's heart we know them all  because they've been entirely eliminated from ours
This is the practice
This is what's called the middle way
When the defilements come swashbuckling in the middle way goes swashbuckling out
If they bring in a big army the middle way has to fight them off with a big army
If they're hardhitting we're hardhitting
If they're daredevils we're daredevils
This is what's meant by the middle way the appropriate way appropriate for defeating the armies of the enemy
If their army is large while ours is small and our efforts few it just won't work
We'll have to lose
However large their army however many their weapons our army has to be larger and our weapons more
Only then will we win
This is what's called the army of the Dhamma
However large the army of defilement may be mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence have to go spinning in and treat them with a heavy hand
Finally the defilements fall flat on their backs and we won't have to chant a funeral service for them
We've gained the superlative Dhamma
When the defilements have fallen flat on their backs we aren't worried about where we'll live in the cosmos
Why ask
We're not interested in whether we'll be reborn in heaven in the Brahma worlds or in hell after we die
There is nothing that knows more than the heart
Normally the heart is already a knower so now that it knows clearly in line with reason in line with the Dhamma what is there to wonder about
This is why there is only one Buddha at a time  because a Buddha arises with difficulty gains release with difficulty
He's the first to gain Awakening making his way all by himself past the enemy army of defilement craving and mental effluents to proclaim the Dhamma to the world so that we can study it and put it into practice which is our great good fortune
We've been born right in the midst of the Buddha's teachings so be earnest in practicing them so as to profit from them
The teachings of the Lord Buddha aren't a child's doll or plaything you know
The Dhamma is sanditthiko  directly visible
The teachings of the Buddha are the open market of the paths fruitions and nibbana
They're never out of date  unless we're out of date which is why we let the defilements fool us into thinking that the Dhamma is out of date that people who practice the Dhamma are oldfashioned and out of date that people who enter monasteries are oldfashioned and out of date that the teachings of the religion have no paths or fruitions any more that the paths fruitions and nibbana don't exist that no matter how much you practice you'll just wear yourself out in vain
These things are nothing but defilement deceiving us  and we believe everything it says so we keep going bankrupt without even a scrap of good to our names
Why are we willing to believe it so thoroughly
'Kilesam saranam gacchami'  I go to defilement for refuge' We've never said it
All we say is 'buddham dhammam sangham saranam gacchami'  I go to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha for refuge' but when the defilements give us a single blow we fall flat on our backs
What good does it accomplish
What does 'Buddham saranam gacchami' mean
Nothing but Kilesam saranam gacchami
Even though we never say it our beliefs fall in line with defilement without our even thinking about it
This is called Kilesam saranam gacchami
The grandchildren of defilement we saranam gacchami
The grandparents of defilement we saranam gacchami
Everything about the defilements we grovel and saranam gacchami
We're all a bunch of kilesam saranam gacchami
Think it over
So be resolute meditators
Desire to see the truth
It's there in the heart of every person
The Buddha didn't lay any exclusive claims to it
All that's needed is that you practice
Don't doubt the paths fruitions and nibbana
When are the defilements ever out of date
They're in our hearts at all times
Why don't we ever see them being accused of being out of date
'Every kind of defilement is oldfashioned
The defilements are out of style so don't have anything to do with them' I don't see us ever give a thought to criticizing them
So how is it that the Dhamma that remedies defilement is out of existence
The Dhamma is a pair with defilement but defilement simply lulls us to sleep so that we won't use the Dhamma to defeat it
It's afraid of losing its power  because defilement is intimidated by the Dhamma which is why it deceives us into not heading towards the Dhamma
So remember this
Very well then
I'm tired of preaching to meditators who Kilesam saranam gacchami
I don't know where my courage came from
Just think  the fear I used to feel for Ven
Acariya Mun I didn't feel at all
I was bold
I wanted to speak
I wanted to tell him what I had experienced
The mind was impetuous and spoke right up without any fear
That was when he got to see my true nature
Before that I had never shown anything at all
No matter what the mind had been like I had never behaved that way but once this awareness arose I went up to see him when there were just the two of us and told him right away
It was as if he were the master of a dog urging me on to bite the defilements
Ven
Acariya Mun  who could be more astute than he
As soon as I went up to see him I started right in speaking without any fear
Once the mind knows the truth together with how it has contemplated it can describe it all including the results that appear
It can describe them in full detail
While I was speaking he listened in silence
As for me I kept right on going
'This crazy guy doesn't just fool around'  that's probably what he was thinking
'When his madness is on the rise he's really in earnest' That's probably what he said to himself
As soon as I had finished he burst right out 'That's the way it's got to be' He really got going and I bowed down and listened
'We don't die up to five times in a single lifetime' he said
'We die only once
So keep on striking away
You've finally caught on to the basic principle
You've finally got it so keep wrestling with it' I was like a dog he spurred on  I was so happy
Coming away from him I was ready to bark and to bite
I kept fighting away
That is I continued sitting all night in meditation and kept telling him the Dhamma I had gained
Sitting in meditation all night  I did it more than nine or ten times that Rains Retreat and I wasn't just sitting as normal because I was wrestling with my full strength both because of the marvels I was seeing and because of my frustration over the way my mind had regressed earlier
These two got added together so that the mind had the full strength of frustration and daring
As time passed though Ven
Acariya Mun finally gave me a warning  a single flash 'The defilements don't lie in the body' he said
'They lie in the heart'
He then gave a comparison with a horse
'When a horse is unruly and won't listen to its master the master has to give it really harsh treatment
If he has to make it starve he should make it starve  really treat it harshly until it can't make a move
Once it finally stops being rebellious though he can let up on the harsh treatment
When its rebelliousness weakens the harsh treatment can be relaxed' That's all he said  and I understood immediately
If he had said more than that He knew what sort of person I was He was afraid I'd go completely limp
So he gave just a flash of a warning and I understood
The important point for a meditating monk is to have principles in the heart
'Principles in the heart' means the various stages of concentration and levels of discernment all the way to the level of arahantship
These are called the principles in the heart for meditating monks
If the principles in the heart are good every aspect of the principles in our practice will be good as well because the heart is what gives the orders
This is why we see the heart as having primary importance
When a person with principles in the heart practices it's very different from a person without principles in the heart
When a person with principles in the heart makes compromises in line with events at some times in some places and with some individuals and when he is strict with himself at normal times he does so with reason  which is different from a person who is simply determined without having principles in the heart
Even though such a person may be resolute and courageous he's pervaded with error pride and conceit
He's not as even as he should be in his ascetic practices which are means of cleansing away the defilements of pride and conceit fermenting inside him
The body is an affair of the world like the world in general
It has to be involved with the world which requires compromises with certain people in certain places and on certain occasions
But if when we have to make compromises we can't do so for fear that we're sacrificing our strictness or our ascetic practices or if once we compromise we can't return to our strictness it's a matter of pride in either case and can't help but have an impact on ourselves and on others both when we should be strict and when we should make compromises in line with events
When a person with principles in the heart sees fitting in line with reason he makes compromises when he should with certain individuals places and events that may happen from time to time
But when that necessity is past he returns to his original strictness without any difficulty in forcing himself
This is because reason the Dhamma is already in charge of his heart so he has no difficulties both when making compromises and when following the ascetic practices strictly as he is accustomed to
All of this is something I practiced when living with Ven
Acariya Mun
For example I'd vow to follow a particular practice or several practices without telling him  although he would know perfectly well because I couldn't keep it secret from him
But because of my great respect for him I'd have to make compromises even though it bothered me
As a rule I wouldn't be willing to make compromises at all
That was a feeling set up like a barrier in the mind because my intentions were really determined like that
I wouldn't let anything pass without my working right through it with this determination of mine
The first year I went to stay with him I heard him talk about the ascetic practices  such as the practice of accepting only the food received on one's alms round  because he himself was very strict in observing them
From that point on I'd vow to take on special ascetic practices during the Rains Retreat without ever slacking
I'd vow to eat only the food I got while on my alms round
If anyone else would try to put food in my bowl aside from the food I had received on my round I wouldn't accept it and wouldn't be interested in it
Ever since then I've kept to this without fail
I'd be sure that I for one wouldn't let this vow be broken
Once the Rains Retreat came I'd have to make this vow as a rule in my heart without missing even a single year
The years we spent the rains at Baan Naa Mon Ven
Acariya Mun was really observant and astute
Of all the sages of our day and age who could be sharper than he
He knew I had vowed not to accept food that came afterwards but on the occasions he would come to put food in my bowl he'd say 'Maha please let me put a little food in your bowl
This is a gift from one contemplative to another' That's what he'd say
'This is a gift from a fellow contemplative
Please accept it' That meant he was giving me the food himself
Sometimes there'd be groups of lay people from Nong Khai Sakon Nakhorn or other places who would come to Baan Naa Mon to present food to Ven
Acariya Mun and the other monks in the monastery
This would happen once in a long long while because in those days there were no cars or buses
You'd have to travel on foot or by cart
These people would hire oxcarts to come and would spend a night or two  but they wouldn't stay with the monks in the monastery
They'd stay in the shack in Yom Phaeng's rice field
When morning came they'd prepare food and instead of waiting outside the monastery to place the food in our bowls as we returned from our alms round they'd bring it into the monastery to present it to us
I wouldn't dare accept their food for fear that my observance would be broken
I'd walk right past them
As I noticed though Ven
Acariya Mun would accept their food out of pity for them
There would be a lot of food left over from presenting it to the monks so they'd bring it to the meeting hall  fruit individual servings of food wrapped in banana leaves  but we wouldn't take any of it
It'd get passed around without making a ripple
No one except sometimes one or two of the monks would take any of it
It must have looked not just a little strange to the lay people
As for me I wouldn't dare take any of it for fear that my observance of this ascetic practice would be broken
Several days later Ven
Acariya Mun asked to put food in my bowl saying 'This is a gift from a fellow contemplative
Please let me put it in your bowl' And then he put it in my bowl
He did it himself you know
Normally  who would I let put anything in my bowl
I'd be afraid that my observance would be broken or at the very least wouldn't be complete
But he probably saw that there was pride lurking in my vow to observe this practice so he helped bend it a little to give me a number of things to think about so that I wouldn't be simply a straightarrow type
This was why he'd find various ways to teach me both directly and indirectly
I in particular was very straightarrow
I was very set on things in that way which is why I wouldn't let anyone destroy my ascetic practice by putting food in my bowl  except for Ven
Acariya Mun whom I respected with all my heart
With him I'd give in and let him put food in my bowl the times he saw fit
I was solidly determined not to let this observance be deficient not even the least little bit
This was something that kept chafing in the heart
I'd have to be complete both in terms of the observance I was following and in terms of my determination but because of my love and respect for him I'd accept his gifts even though I didn't feel comfortable about it
This is the difference between a principle in the practice and a principle in the heart
I admit that I was right in the earnestness of my practice but I wasn't right in terms of the levels of Dhamma that were higher and more subtle than that
Looking at myself and looking at Ven
Acariya Mun I could see that we were very different
Ven
Acariya Mun when looking at something would see it thoroughly in a way that was just right from every angle in the heart  which wasn't like the rest of us who would view things in our stupid way from one side only
We didn't use discernment the way he did
That was something we'd have to admit
Here I've been talking about practicing the Dhamma with Ven
Acariya Mun at Baan Naa Mon
When we moved to Baan Nong Phue I vowed again to observe this particular practice
Wherever I'd go I'd stick to my guns as far as this practice was concerned and wouldn't retreat
I wouldn't let it be broken
Coming back from my alms round I'd quickly put my bowl in order taking just a little of whatever I'd eat  because during the rains I'd never eat my fill
I'd never eat my fill at all
I'd tell myself to take only soandso much around to percent
For example out of percent full I'd cut back about to percent which seemed about right because there were a number of us living together as a group
If I were to go without food altogether it wouldn't be convenient because we always had duties involved with the group
I myself was like one of the senior members of the group in a behindthescenes sort of way though I never let on
I was involved in looking after the peace and order within the group in the monastery
I didn't have much seniority  just over ten rains in the monkhood  but it seemed that Ven
Acariya Mun was kind enough to trust me  also behind the scenes  in helping him look after the monks and novices
When the rains would begin all of us in the monastery would vow to observe different ascetic practices and after not too many days this or that person would fall back
This showed how earnest or lackadaisical the members of the group were and made me even more meticulous and determined in my duties and my ascetic practices
When I'd see my fellow meditators acting like this I'd feel disillusioned with them in many ways
My mind would become even more fired up and I'd encourage myself to be unrelenting
I'd ask myself 'With events all around you like this are you going to fall back' And the confident answer I'd get would be 'What is there to fall back
Who is this if not me
I've always been this sort of person from the very beginning
Whatever I do I have to take it seriously
Once I decide to do something I have to be earnest with it
I don't know how to fool around
I won't fall back unless I die which is something beyond my control
I won't let anyone put food in my bowl under any circumstances' Listen to that  'under any circumstances' That was how I felt at the time
So the changes in my fellow meditators were like a sermon for me to listen to and take to heart
I haven't forgotten it even to this day
As soon as I returned from my alms round I'd quickly take whatever I was going to eat put my bowl in order and then quickly prepare whatever I had that I'd put in Ven
Acariya Mun's bowl  this or that serving that I had noticed seemed to go well with his health as far as I knew and understood
I'd set aside whatever should be set aside and prepare whatever should go into his bowl
Then I'd return to my seat my eyes watchful and my ears ready to hear whatever he might say before we'd start eating
As for my own bowl when I had put it in order I'd put it out of the way behind my seat right against the wall next to a post
I'd put the lid on and cover it with a cloth to make doubly sure that no one would mess with it and put any food in it
At that time I wouldn't allow anyone to put food in my bowl at all
I made that clear in no uncertain terms
But when Ven
Acariya Mun put food in my bowl he'd have his way of doing it
After I had prepared the food I would give to him and had returned to my place after we had given our blessings and during the period of silence when we were contemplating our food  that's when he'd do it right when we were about to eat
I have no idea where he had arranged the food to put in my bowl  but he wouldn't do it repeatedly
He knew and he sympathized with me
On the occasions when he'd put food in my bowl he'd say 'Maha please let me put food in your bowl
These lay people came late'  and his hand was already in my bowl  right when I had placed my bowl in front of me and was contemplating my food
I didn't know what to do because of my respect for him
So I had to let him do it in his kindness  but I wouldn't let anyone else do it
He'd do it only once in a long while
In one Rains Retreat he'd do it only three or four times at most
He wouldn't do it repeatedly because he was every astute
The word majjhima  just right You'd have to hand it to him without being able to find anything to fault
So ever since then I've stuck to my practice all along up to the present
As for the monks and novices who couldn't get it together they all ended up in failure which has made me think  made me think without ceasing  about my fellow meditators 'What is it with their hearts that they don't have any firm principles that they keep failing like this
What mainstay can they have for the future when the present is already a failure' Events like this have kept me thinking in this way without ceasing all the way up to the meditators who are living with me at present
For this reason the ascetic observances are very important principles in the practice
Eating from the bowl There are many people monks among them who don't see the value of eating from the bowl
In addition to not seeing the value of this ascetic practice they may see it as unbecoming or inappropriate both in the monastery and in society at large in that all sorts of food  meat dishes desserts etc
 get mixed together in the one bowl
They may even think that it's ugly or messy  which is an opinion of the defilements trying to efface the truth of the Dhamma
There are few who see the value of any of the thirteen ascetic practices even though all thirteen are tools for us monks to wash away defilement
It's well known that the defilements and the Dhamma have always worked at crosspurposes from time immemorial
Those who give their hearts and lives in homage to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha will practice in line with what the Buddha taught
Those who give their hearts and lives in homage to the cycle of defilement will practice in line with the opinions of defilement
So to whom are we going to pay homage now
Hurry up and decide
Don't delay
Otherwise the defilements will pull you up to the chopping block  don't say I didn't warn you
The Dhamma has already been taught so hurry up and start walking
Don't waste your time being afraid that it's out of date or you won't be able to make a step
Pansukulacivaram  the practice of wearing robes made from castoff cloth This is to counteract our feeling for price ostentation pride and excess  the type of beauty that promotes defilement and steps all over the Dhamma  so that these things don't encumber the hearts of meditators whose duty is to eliminate the defilements in order to promote the Dhamma and nourish the heart to be gracious and fine
The items of consumption we collect from what is thrown away are good for killing the defilements of greed ostentation and excess love for beauty and haughtiness
Sages have thus praised and followed this practice all along up to the present
We can see their footprints in using this method to kill defilement as a treat for our hearts and eyes so that we won't die in vain in having followed the homeless life
The practice of going for alms This is so that we'll perform our duties in line with the Buddha's instructions  pindiyalopabhojanam nissaya pabbajja 'The life gone forth is supported by means of almsfood'  instructions we received on the day of our ordination
Don't be lazy
Don't forget yourself because of whatever other gifts of food you may receive
Whoever may present them see them as extraneous
They're not more necessary than the food we get by going for alms with the strength of our own legs  which is our duty as monks who do their work properly
This is the really appropriate way to gain food in line with the pindiyalopabhojanam in the instructions we receive during our ordination
Listen
It's fitting appropriate which is why the Buddha taught us to go for alms something of firstplace importance in our pure work as monks
The Buddha went for alms throughout his career
The few times he didn't were when he was staying in a place where it wasn't appropriate  as when he was living in the Prileyya Forest and the elephants looked after him because there were no people around
So there were only a few times when the Buddha made exceptions to this practice
Pubbanhe pindapatanca  in the five duties of the Buddha  'In the morning he would go for alms for the sake of the beings of the world' Listen to that
Sayanhe dhammadesanam At four in the afternoon he would give instructions to his lay following kings generals financiers landowners merchants and ordinary people in general
Padose bhikkhuovadam After dark he would exhort the monks
This is the second of his duties as a Buddha
Addharatte devapanhanam After midnight he would answer the questions posed by the various levels of the heavenly beings  from the lowest up to the highest  and give them instructions
This is the third of his duties
Bhabbabhabbe vilokanam In the last watch of the night he would survey the beings of the world using his superior intuition to see what beings might be caught in the net of his knowledge whom he should go to teach first  whoever might be prepared to receive the teaching and whose lives might be in danger so that he shouldn't wait long before going to teach them
This is the fourth duty
Pubbanhe pindapatanca The following morning he would then go out for alms on a regular basis
These are the five duties of the Buddha that he normally wouldn't abandon
He'd abandon them only on special occasions
For example going for alms When he was staying in the Prileyya Forest he couldn't go for alms so he put that duty aside
But otherwise he viewed going for alms as a necessary duty which is why we have to teach monks to view going for alms as a right activity as extremely appropriate work
For monks there is no work in searching for their livelihood more appropriate than going for alms
No matter who might have the faith to bring gifts of food no matter how much we should view it as extraneous gains a luxury and not as more necessary than the food gained by going for alms
This is so that we don't forget ourselves and become entangled in that sort of thing
The Buddha teaches monks not to forget themselves not to be lazy because the defilement of laziness is important and to forget ourselves is no mean vice  for we tend to become haughty when there are many people respecting us and especially when they are people of high status
When we have a large following we tend to throw out our chest and put on airs
Even though we don't have stripes it's as if we paint them on to be a royal tiger showing off his rank
Since when were they ever a small matter the defilements of monks
This is why the Buddha taught us to stamp out these ugly defilements in the society of Buddhists and monks by not forgetting ourselves
However many people come to respect us that's their business
Our business is not to forget our duties
Don't forget that monks' business is monks' business
To forget yourself is none of your business as a monk
Even lay people who are mindful don't forget themselves
They're always even in the way they place themselves in relation to others
We're monks  meditating monks at that  which is even more of a delicate matter
It's our business to be mindful of ourselves and to use our discernment to scrutinize events that come to involve us at all times not to be careless and forgetful in any circumstances
This is how we show our colors as monks who see danger in what is dangerous
We are members of the Sakyan lineage the lineage of the Buddha who was sharper and more intelligent than anyone else in the three levels of the cosmos
For what reason should we make fools of ourselves over the baits of the world which fill the earth and aren't anywhere nearly as difficult to find as the Dhamma
To forget ourselves to swell up with pride because of extraneous gains or the respect of people at large Is this our proper honor and pride as sons of the Sakyan
It's simply because we see the superlative Dhamma as something lower than these things that we monks don't think or come to our senses enough to fear their danger in the footsteps of our Teacher
Sakkaro purisam hanti  'Homage kills a man' Fish die because they are tempted by bait
If we monks don't die because of things like this what does make us die
Consider this carefully
Did the Buddha give this teaching to stupid fish or to those of us monks who are moving toward the hook at the moment
Be aware of the fact that the outside is bait but inside the bait is the hook
If you don't want to meet with disaster be careful not to bite the hook
Eating from the bowl This is a very important activity but we don't see its importance
Ordinarily we who have ordained in the religion have no vessel for our food more appropriate than our bowl
Even monogrammed plates and gold platters aren't more appropriate than the bowl
Only the bowl is appropriate for monks when they eat
Nothing else is better or more fitting
We each have only one bowl and put everything in there together
The Buddha has already set us a solid example
Or is it that when food gets mixed together like that it'll spoil our digestion  as most people say and we've already heard many times
If that's the case then when it all gets mixed in the stomach won't it spoil our digestion
How many stomachs do we have in our belly
How many vessels are in there for us to put our separate sorts of food in
This one for desserts this one for meat dishes this one for spicy curry this one for hot curry Are there any
Are there different vessels for putting our separate sorts of food in to keep our digestion from spoiling
We simply see that when food is mixed in the bowl it'll spoil our digestion but not when it's mixed in the stomach
This view  fearing that our digestion will be spoiled  is for the sake of promoting our tongues and stomachs not for promoting the mind and the Dhamma through our various practices
If there is anything toxic in the food  whether or not it's mixed in the bowl  then when it's eaten it can spoil our digestion with no relation to whether or not it's mixed together because the toxicity lies with the things that are toxic and not with the mixing together
When it's eaten it's toxic
But if the food isn't toxic then when it's mixed it isn't toxic so where will it get any toxicity
The food is beneficial without any harm or toxicity mixed in
When it's placed together in the bowl it's still food
When it's eaten and goes to the stomach it's a benefit to the body
So we as monks and meditators should be observant of the differences between Dhamma and notDhamma which are always effacing each other
For example Eating food from the bowl spoils your digestion
Eating outside of the bowl improves your digestion and fattens the defilements  but the Dhamma grovels and can't get up because notDhamma has kept stomping on it in this way without mercy from every side all along
Actually when food is mixed in the bowl it's an excellent sermon
Before eating we contemplate
While eating we contemplate the incongruity of food and we're bound to get unusual tactics for training the mind from the food that is mixed together  because we don't eat for enjoyment for beautification for pride or for recklessness
We eat enough to keep the body going to practice the holy life so as to take the defilements and the mental effluents  poisons that are buried deep cluttering the heart  and wash them away by contemplating them aptly using these ascetic practices as our tools
Refusing food that is brought afterwards This too is to prevent us from being greedy and forgetting ourselves
Even when there's a lot of food  more than enough  greed you know has no land of enough
That's good
This is good
The more food there is the wider our mouth the longer our tongue the bigger our stomach
These are always overtaking the Dhamma without letup
This is sweet
That's aromatic
This is rich  everything keeps on being good
There's no brake on our wheels  no mindfulness  at all
Actually the word 'good' here is a title conferred by defilement to erase our contentment with little our fewness of wants as meditators without our realizing it
This is why we tend to be carried away by the lullaby of the defilements' word 'good'
As for whether the Dhamma is good or not that's another matter entirely
If the food is sweet we know
If it's aromatic we know
If the mind is attached to the flavor we have to try to know
To be careful
To thwart the defilement that wants to get a lot and eat a lot
The Dhamma has us take just enough or just a little in keeping with the Dhamma to eat just enough for the body or just a little without being greedy for food or other items of consumption
We eat just enough to keep going
We aren't stuffed and lethargic aiming more at our beds than at the persistent effort to abandon defilement
We monks when we eat a lot and have a lot of extraneous gains get fat and strong but the mind forgets itself and doesn't feel like meditating
This is good for nothing at all
We simply have food fattening the body without any Dhamma to fatten the mind
The mind that used to have Dhamma to some extent gets thinner and more emaciated day by day
If it's never had any Dhamma  such as the Dhamma of concentration  the situation is even worse
It has no goals at all
The ascetic practices thus have to put a brake on our greed for food so that the mind can have a chance to follow the Dhamma
The defilements won't have to be fattened the body will be light the mind will be still and light while making its effort  more easily stilled than when the belly is stuffed tight with food
This is something really embarrassing in meditating monks the way we take our stomachs instead of the Dhamma to show off to the world
Living in the forest How does it differ from living in villages
It has to differ which is why the Buddha taught us to live there
And living in an ordinary forest vs
living in a lonely forest How does this feel to the person living there
For a person aiming at the Dhamma there's a big difference between living in a forest and living in a lonely forest including the effort required to make the mind quiet
In a lonely forest the mind becomes still easily because we aren't complacent
We're watchful over ourselves
Wherever we're mindful and alert that's the effort of practice
Defilement is afraid of people who are mindful and alert who are always watchful over themselves
It's not afraid of complacent people
The Buddha thus opened the way using the ascetic practices for us to take victory over defilement
This is the way that will stamp out defilement
It's not the case that he opened the way through the ascetic practices for defilement to stomp all over the heart
All the ascetic practices for those who follow them are ways of subduing defilement
For example living under the shade of a tree in appropriate forests and mountains The Buddha and his Noble Disciples all came into being in purity from these things so we as meditators should reflect on this
We shouldn't forget ourselves
However many material gains we may receive we shouldn't forget ourselves because of them for that's not the way of those who follow in the footsteps of the Buddha and his Noble Disciples
No matter how many people come to respect us that's their business
We in practicing the Dhamma should beware of that sort of thing because it's a concern and a distraction an inconvenience in the practice
We shouldn't get involved in anything but the contact between the heart and the Dhamma at all times
That's what's appropriate for us
If the mind becomes a world of rebirth it'll outstrip the worldliness of the world to the point where it has no limits or bounds
The more people come to respect us  and our defilements as monks and human beings are always ready to welcome this  the more pride we feel the more we forget ourselves
We swell up more than a river overflowing its banks because this is a matter of defilement not of the Dhamma
Matters of the Dhamma have to be even
They require us to be mindful at all times and not to forget ourselves
This is the path followed by those who have practiced to lift themselves beyond suffering and stress
Those of us who want to gain release like them have to practice like them  or like students who have teachers
We shouldn't practice haphazardly claiming to be smart and not listening to anyone
That's the path of practice taking us up on the chopping block with the onions and garlic not the path taking us to the paths fruitions and nibbana
These are things I have felt ever since I was a young monk and so I've been able to hold to them as good lessons all along
There were times when I saw people coming to show respect to my teachers and it gave rise to a strange sort of feeling in my heart  the feeling that I'd like to have them respect me in the same way  but at the same time I knew that the mind was base and was giving rise to an obscene desire so I didn't encourage it
I kept blocking it and was always conscious of my own fault in feeling that way
When I really began to practice I knew even more clearly that that was a wrong notion that to think in that way wasn't right at all
It was like the toad trying to compare himself to the ox
My teacher's status was that of a teacher
My status was that of a toad lurking underground
How could I try to compare myself with him if I didn't want to burst like the toad in Aesop's fable
That fable is a very good lesson for those who practice properly for the sake of release
The practice of visiting the cemetery Why visit the cemetery
We people have to see evidence with our own eyes if we're going to come to our senses
Visiting cemeteries is for the sake of seeing human death
Cemeteries in the past weren't like they are today
Unburied bodies were scattered all over the place  old bodies and new scattered around like logs
When you saw them you'd see clear evidence with your own eyes
The Buddha gave instructions on how to visit a cemetery
Go from the upwind side he said not from the downwind side
Don't begin by looking at new corpse
Look at the old ones first
Keep contemplating the theme of your meditation and gradually move on until you know that the mind has enough mindfulness and discernment to contemplate a new corpse
Only then should you move on to a new corpse  because a new corpse still has regular features
If the person who just died had beautiful features it might cause desire to flare up and you'd end up with an outoftheordinary meditation theme which is why you have to be careful
The Buddha taught stage by stage to visit the cemetery at intervals or in steps and to contemplate it at intervals in keeping with your capabilities
He wouldn't have you go storming right in for that wouldn't be fitting
He taught all the steps
Don't be in a hurry to contemplate a corpse that hasn't fallen apart or been bitten a corpse that is still new and hasn't swollen or grown foul
Don't be in a hurry to approach such a corpse
And be especially careful with a corpse of the opposite sex  that's what he said  until the mind is capable enough in its contemplation
Then you can contemplate anything
Once we've contemplated death outside until we gain clear evidence we then turn inward to contemplate the death in our own body until we catch on to the principle within the mind
Then the external cemetery gradually becomes unnecessary because we've caught on to the principle within ourselves and don't need to rely on anything outside
We contemplate our body to see it as a cemetery just like the external cemetery both while it's alive and after it dies
We can compare each aspect with the outside and the mind gradually runs out of problems of its own accord
The practice of not lying down This is simply a way of training ourselves to make a great effort
It doesn't mean that we take notlyingdown as a constant practice
We may resolve for example not to lie down tonight as our ascetic practice
This is a practice to be observed on occasion  or you might resolve not to lie down for two or three nights running depending on the resolution you make
The practice of living in whatever dwelling is assigned to one This is another ascetic practice
They're all ways of getting monks to subdue the defilement of forgetting oneself
A monk who observes the ascetic practices well who is solid in his observance of them is one who is solid in his practice truly intent on the Dhamma truly intent on subduing defilement
He's not a person ordained to do nothing or who forgets himself
All thirteen ascetic practices are tools for subduing the defilements of those who follow them
There's nothing about them that anyone can criticize  except for Devadatta and his gang
A monk who doesn't observe any of these practices is an empty monk who forgets himself who has nothing but the outside status of a monk
He wraps himself in a yellow robe calls himself venerable  and becomes haughty as a result
Even more so when he's given ecclesiastical rank If the heart is taken with that sort of thing it'll have to get excited over its shadow without any need for backup music to get it going
The mind gets itself going through the power of the clay on its head thinking that it has a crest
Since when has this defilement ever been willing to yield to anyone
People of this sort forget all the affairs of monks and become part of the world  going even further than the world
Rank is given for the sake of encouraging good practice and conduct but if the mind becomes haughty rank becomes a way of destroying oneself killing oneself with various assumptions
The King bestows ranks and names this and that and we assume them to be a crest
Actually they're just a bit of clay stuck on our head not a natural crest
If you want a natural crest then follow the practice well
What could be finer than to be 'venerable' in line with the principles of nature
The word 'venerable' means excellent so why be enthralled with dolls and clay
To be venerable doesn't mean that just our name is excellent
We have to be excellent in our practice and conduct in line with such principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya as the ascetic practices
If we're solid in the ascetic practices we'll gradually become excellent people in line with the principles of our practice and ultimately in line with the principles of nature  excellent not just in name but through the nature of a mind made spotless and pure
A name can be established any old day
You can even build it up to the sky if you want
They establish names just to flatter one another as a matter of custom
This is an affair of the world
They keep conferring titles on one another
Those who confer the titles have good intentions so we have to repay those good intentions by setting our hearts on the practice in line with the principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya and on observing our duties as monks to the full
This is in keeping with their purpose in conferring titles so as to encourage monks to be good
At any rate don't take the conferring of titles Don't take the title and use it to destroy yourself with pride and conceit
The highest perfection in line with natural principles with no need to confer titles is to practice well
Observe the precepts well
Don't violate or overstep them
Make the mind still and calm with meditation
Whichever theme you focus on be earnest and mindful with it
When you investigate investigate right on down so as to give rise to astuteness
Analyze the properties the khandhas and the sense media so as to see them as they are in line with their reality as I've already explained many times
What are the properties
The four physical properties earth water wind and fire
These are the primal properties the things that exist originally and get combined until a mind comes in and lays claim to ownership so that they're called a living being or an individual even though the various parts are just physical properties in line with their natural principles
No matter who confers titles on them as being a living being or an individual or whatever they don't turn into that
They remain physical properties as they originally were
We should come to know this with our own discernment through investigating
The sense media or connections There are internal sense media and external ones
The internal ones are the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind
The external ones are sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas that make contact with the internal sense media giving rise to cognition and then to all sorts of assumptions most of which go off in the wrong directions
We should analyze these things so as to see them well
This is called vipassana which means seeing clearly  knowing clearly and seeing truly not knowing in counterfeit or illusory ways
So we should perform our duties correctly and to the full
Our heart is always hoping to depend on us because it can't get by on its own
It's been oppressed and coerced by greed anger and delusion all along which is why it's always calling for our help
So what can we use to help this heart that is always oppressed and coerced so as to release it from danger if we don't use our practice of concentration discernment conviction and persistence as a means of advancing and uprooting so as to help it escape from the danger of the things that coerce it
At present we've come to strip off the danger in the heart
We must try every way we can to remove it
The main principle in the practice is to have the solidity  the heart  of a warrior ready to die in the battle of washing the world out of the heart
If we don't gain victory we're prepared to die offering our life in homage to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
Don't retreat in defeat or you'll lose face and the defilements will taunt you for a long time to come
You won't be able to stand your feelings of inadequacy and embarrassment in the face of the cycle of defilement
Whichever world you go to there will be nothing but defilements trailing you and taunting you 'What are you looking for being born and bearing this mass of suffering you goodfornothing person you
Whenever we fight you lose miserably every time
You've never had the word victory at all' Listen to that fighters for the sake of completing the holy life
Do the taunts of the defilements sting
I myself would be stung to the quick
Even if I died I wouldn't forget
So how do we feel
Are we spurred on to fight with them by giving our lives
Our Buddha was a noble warrior to the last inch
His every movement was bravery in the fight with defilement without retreat to the point where the defilements were annihilated and he became the Teacher of the world to whom we pay homage up to the present
The footprints of his practice are still fresh in every word every phrase of the welltaught Dhamma which hasn't been corrupted or effaced
So hold to him as a principle in the heart a principle in the practice until you have no breath left to breathe
Don't let him go
The land of victory when all the defilements fall back in defeat You don't have to ask about it
You'll know it on your own through the Dhamma immediately apparent to every person who practices to that point
The Buddha didn't lay any exclusive claims on it but bestowed it as the wealth of every person who practices in dignity in the midst of this world of inconstancy stress and notself
When the khandhas no longer carry on we will attain full anupadisesanibbana with nothing more to worry about
The Dhamma is something secure and complete
On the side of its causes it's a Dhamma right for remedying and removing defilement of every sort
There's no defilement that lies above this Dhamma at all
The Buddha taught it rightly in every way in every facet for remedying defilement of every sort
Nothing excels this Dhamma  in particular the Dhamma of the middle way which is summarized as virtue concentration and discernment
This is the Dhamma of causes the methods with which we should train ourselves and which the Buddha taught us in full
As for the Dhamma of results it comes in stages
The mind is solid and doesn't stray or lean in line with its preoccupations
It has stillness and calm This is the mind centered in concentration
The mind is courageous and capable astute and aware allaround in terms of the things that become involved with it both within and without This is the mind with discernment
And when it's even more astute and refined than that to the point of being astute allaround and attaining release then the entire mind is Dhamma
In other words the mind is the Dhamma the Dhamma is the mind  oneness  without any adversaries paired with it as before
My own impression  and whether I'm right or wrong please decide for yourselves  but I'm certain that the Dhamma of the doctrine the teaching of the Buddha refers for the most part to causes
The Buddha explained the causes the practices to follow so as to remedy and remove defilement or to develop the various forms of goodness
The results are happiness
The teachings are simply directions showing the way
As for the genuine Dhamma appearing from the practice whether or not we give it names it's a Dhamma in the principles of nature
It's Dhamma that we can't easily reach to touch
This is the Dhamma that's said to exist with the world at all times
As for the Dhamma of the doctrine taught by the Buddhas this can disappear from time to time as has happened with each of the long line of Buddhas who have gained Awakening
This in itself shows the inconstancy of the Dhamma of the doctrine for us to see clearly  unlike the Dhamma in the principles of nature which has existed from the very beginning and has no involvement with inconstancy stress or notself in any way that would give rise to that Dhamma or make it end
The tactics given by each of the Buddhas to the world are called the Dhamma of the doctrine
These aren't the genuine Dhamma
They're tactics  different offshoots  actions and modes displayed by the genuine Dhamma means for letting go and striving teaching us to let go teaching us to strive using various methods saying that the results will be like this or that
As for the genuine Dhamma of results in the principles of nature that's something to be known exclusively in the heart of the person who practices
This Dhamma can't really be described correctly in line with its truth
We can only talk around it
And particularly with release This can't be correctly described at all because it's beyond all conventions and speculations
It can't be described
Even though we may know it with our full heart we can't describe it
Like describing the flavor and fullness that come from eating Even though eating is something in the realm of conventional reality that can be described and though we all have savored the flavor and eaten our fill still we can't describe these things at all in line with their truth
The Dhamma that can't be described That's the genuine Dhamma
It doesn't have the word 'vanishes' or 'disappears'  simply that the world can't reach in to know it and touch it
As for annihilating this Dhamma it can't be annihilated
When we practice in line with the tactics given by each of the Buddhas we can touch it and become aware of it
The heart becomes an awareness of the Dhamma a right and fitting vessel for the Dhamma  and there is no vessel more appropriate for receiving each level of the Dhamma than the heart
When it enters into the Dhamma in full measure the heart becomes one with the Dhamma
The heart is the Dhamma
The Dhamma is the heart
Oneness
There is nothing but oneness not becoming two with anything else
This Dhamma of oneness Our ability to reach and to know it depends on our individual practice
It doesn't depend on the time or place or on anyone else
The important point is simply that our practice be right and appropriate
It will foster the mind in making contact with the Dhamma step by step to the highest step
So we should be intent and make determination the basis for our practice
Don't forget the phrase Buddham saranam gacchami  I go to the Buddha for refuge  as I have already explained it to you
Dhammam saranam gacchami  I go to the Dhamma for refuge
This I have also explained
Sangham saranam gacchami  I go to the Sangha for refuge
Don't forget the ways in which the Noble Disciples practiced
Virtually all of them went through hardships to the brink of death before becoming our Sangham saranam gacchami
It's not the case that they were spoonfed while we practice with hardship and difficulties to the brink of death
That's not the case at all
They went through difficulties just like ours  or far greater than ours  before becoming our Sangham saranam gacchami
They came from all levels of society some from royal families and noble families leading a very delicate life
They had the ranks of kings courtiers and financiers all the way down to ordinary farmers and slaves
Coming from different classes of society  and some of them having lived in comfort in their homes  when they went forth to practice they had to train and fit their thoughts words and deeds into a single mould the mould of the sons of the Sakyan
So why wouldn't they have had trouble
Why wouldn't they have had difficulties
The way they ate in their homes was one thing when they went forth to become monks they had to ask others for alms
Instead of getting to eat this they got that
Instead of getting hot food they got cold food
Instead of getting to eat a lot they got just a little not in keeping with their wants
So how wasn't this difficult
It had to be difficult
But after they had finished eating the important thing was training the mind to subdue defilement
Defilement has been the adversary the foremost opponent of the Dhamma within the heart all along
There is no adversary stronger smarter or trickier than the defilements that have held power over the hearts of living beings for so long
For this reason we have to produce enough mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence to subdue defilement
Otherwise we'll be deficient in the fight
To be deficient in the fight is no good at all
It's sure to make us deficient in the results we'll obtain
So the production of mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence to be appropriate for subduing defilement of every sort step by step is the path of victory for the meditator who is to gain complete results who will one day be free and independent for sure
Virtually all of the Noble Disciples practiced in this way until reaching release
They gained release from suffering through struggle before becoming our saranam gacchami
So don't forget
Our refuges  Sangha saranam gacchami  weren't spoonfed people
They were people who struggled to the brink of death just like us
Think of them and hold to them as examples
Don't take the diddlyshit affairs of the world which have no value or standards as the principles in your heart or you'll become irresolute and good for nothing unable to find any goodness any release from stress any happiness or prosperity any standards at all to your dying day
When this is the case fullness and satisfaction in your work and in the results of your work won't exist in your heart
So be intent on practicing
The Dhamma of the Buddha is always shining new
Don't forget that it's always shining new
Majjhima patipada  the middle way  is a shiningnew Dhamma not tarnished shabby or worn out like objects we've used for a long time
Majjhima means right in the middle  the Dhamma that has been appropriate for curing defilements of every sort all along
Ultimately it becomes majjhima in the principles of nature because it has cured defilement and brought release within the mind
The mind becomes a majjhima mind always even within itself
So don't take anyone as your model more than the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
By and large the mind tends to take lowly things as its model which is why we have to say 'Don't take anyone as your model other than the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha' The meditation masters who have practiced rightly appropriately and well as a good example for us who aim at studying with them They too derived their model from the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
If we get weak or discouraged we should reflect on the cemeteries of birth and death that will burn us forever Is there anything good about them
The struggle involved in the effort of the practice even though it involves hardship is a means of cutting back on our becoming and birth
More than that it completely eliminates becoming and birth which are a massive heap of stress from the heart so that we can freely pass by and gain release
There are none of the various sorts of defilement  even the most subtle  infiltrating or coercing such a heart
This is what it means to be free in every way above the world of rebirth  which is a conventional reality  through the power of our persistent endeavor
For this reason we should take persistence endeavor and effort as our basis for victory or as our basis for the practice
We are then sure one day of attaining release from suffering and stress
No one has the power to coerce us or decide our score
We are the ones who'll decide our score for ourselves
Very well then
That's all I'll discuss for now
The way of practice that follows the aims of the Buddha and the true Dhamma is to be truly intent on acting rightly
Every sort of duty that is ours to do should be done intently
When doing a task of any sort even a small one if we lack intentness it won't get finished in a presentable way at all because intentness  which is a matter of mindfulness and principles in the heart that can bring a task to completion  is lacking in ourselves and in our work
To have mindfulness and principles of the heart in ourselves and in our work is in and of itself to be making the effort of the practice regardless of whether the work is internal or external
If a person lacks intentness as a means of keeping his work in focus then even if he is a craftsman capable of making things solid and beautiful his lack of intentness will reduce the quality and beauty of his work
For this reason intentness and concentration are important factors that shouldn't be overlooked by those who aim at full results in their work
We have gone forth from the household life
We're meditators
We should display intentness in our every duty and be deliberate in our every task
Even when we sweep the monastery compound clean our quarters and the meeting hall set out sitting mats and drinking water in all our movements comings and going even when looking right and glancing left we should be mindful at every moment
This is what it means to be making the effort of the practice
In developing the habit of mindfulness we have to use our work as our training ground
Every external task of every sort is a duty
Walking meditation and sitting meditation are duties
If we're mindful in doing our duties it means that our effort in the practice hasn't lapsed
To train ourselves in the habits of those who are intent on the higher levels of Dhamma we must begin  with urgency  by training ourselves to be mindful in every task of every sort from the very beginning
For the sake of the certainty and stability of your future develop mindfulness as a habit from this moment onward until you have it constantly present within you every moment you act and every moment you rest
When the time comes to make the mind still mindfulness will come to stick close by the heart and be established as soon as you make the effort just as you want it to
At the same time your mindfulness will have enough strength to force the mind into stillness at will
For the most part when people are unable to make their minds still as they like it's because mindfulness which is the primary factor isn't strong enough and so the mind easily finds the opening to slip out after other preoccupations  like an inquisitive child who has no one to watch over him and who can thus get into danger any time at all
The mind that's always carried away without any mindfulness to look after it is thus always getting disturbed to the point where it can never find any stillness and peace
The guardians of the mind are mindfulness and discernment which continually watch over it all the time it is thinking about various issues and which continually try to reason with the mind to free it from the issues that come to involve it
When the mind is constantly hearing the logic of its discernment it will be unable to disobey its discernment by thinking about and becoming attached to any issues any longer
To train mindfulness and discernment to become progressively stronger and not to deteriorate please train them in the method already mentioned
Don't let yourself be careless in any useful activity of any sort no matter how small
Otherwise the carelessness that's already the lord of the heart will become a chronic disease taking deep root in the heart ruining every aspect of your practice
Try to train yourself in the habit of being dependable and intent in your proper activities within and without at all times
Don't let carelessness or negligence incubate in your character at all because people who have trained themselves in the habit of being true to their every duty are sure to be able to succeed in every sort of activity whether inner or outer without any obstacle to thwart them
Even when they train their hearts which is the important job within they are sure to succeed with circumspection in such a way that they will find nothing with which they can fault themselves  because outer activities and inner activities both point to the same heart in charge of them
If the heart is habitually careless then when it takes charge of any inner task it's bound to ruin the task without leaving even a scrap for itself to take as its refuge
So for a bright future in the tasks that form your livelihood and source of happiness you should train yourself in the habit of being dependable and true in your duties
Perform each task to the utmost of your ability
Then when you turn inward to perform your inner work for the sake of stillness or for the sake of discernment and discovery you will be able to perform both sorts of work with precision and circumspection because of the habits you have developed in training yourself to be true and circumspect all along
To follow the practice from the beginning to the highest level depends mainly on your basic habits
The 'beginning' of the practice and the 'end' both refer to the one heart whose condition of awareness will develop when it's modified by the Dhamma both in terms of causes  the striving of the practice  and in terms of the results or happiness just as a child gradually develops from infancy to adulthood when nourished by food and all sorts of other factors
The beginning of the practice thus refers to the training of the mind in the beginning stages so as to change its habits and sensibilities making them reasonable and right until it is knowledgeable and can maintain itself without any deviations from the reasonability and rightness appropriate to it
But when we come right down to it the beginning and end of the practice are like a piece of fruit We can't say exactly where it begins and where it ends
When we look at it it's simply a piece of fruit
The same sort of thing holds true with the mind
We talk about the beginning or the end of the practice in the sense that the mind has its various preoccupations coarse and refined mixed in with it
In modifying them we have to keep coming up with new techniques changing those preoccupations from their original state to more and more refined levels that should be called where suitable the beginning or the end of the path
Those of you listening should make yourselves reach this sort of understanding of the defilements and evil qualities in the heart that are given such a variety of names that they can go beyond the bounds of what the suppositions of a single mind can keep track of and resolve
Otherwise you won't have any techniques for curing yourselves of the condition just mentioned
Let me stress once more the principle that guarantees sure results Train yourself in the habit of being solid and true in your work and duties at all times
Don't be unsteady uncertain or undependable
If you say you'll go go
If you say you'll stay stay
If you say you'll do something do it
Once you've settled on a time or a task keep to it
Be the sort of person who writes with his hand and erases with his hand
Don't be the sort who writes with his hand and erases with his foot
In other words once we've made a vow no one else can come in and destroy that vow and yet we ourselves are the ones who destroy it This is what is meant by writing with the hand and erasing with the foot which is something very unseemly
We have to be true to our plans and always decisive
Once we've determined that a particular task is worthwhile and right we should give our life to that task and to our determination
This way we'll become dependable and selfreliant
The virtues we are maintaining will become dependable virtues and won't turn into virtues floating in the wind
Our practice of concentration will become dependable concentration on every level and won't turn into concentration floating in the wind ie concentration only in name but without the actuality of concentration in the heart
And when we develop each level of discernment it will be dependable discernment in keeping with the truthfulness of our character and won't turn into discernment floating in the wind ie discernment only in name but without any ingenuity in freeing ourselves
What I've said so far is so that you will see the drawbacks of being undependable and desultory without any inner truthfulness and so that if you hope for genuine progress in terms of the world and the Dhamma you'll look for a way to give these things a wide berth
Now I'd like to say more about mindfulness and discernment the factors that can make your character more stable and circumspect
You should always be aware that discernment isn't something that you can cook up like food
It comes from considering things carefully
A person without discernment is unable to complete his tasks with any sort of finesse and unable to protect his valuables  in the sense of the world or of the Dhamma  from danger
For this reason the important factors in maintaining and practicing the teachings of the religion are mindfulness and discernment
Whenever an event whether good or bad makes contact with the mind mindfulness and discernment should take it up immediately
This way you can be alert to good and bad events in time and can prevent the heart from straying after things that will harm it
For the most part whenever an issue arises whether it's sudden or not the heart can be swayed or harmed in line with that issue because it lacks the mindfulness and discernment to observe and inspect things carefully beforehand
It then sees everything as worth pursuing and so you let the mind follow along with things without your being aware of it
By the time you realize what has happened time has been wasted and it's too late to put a stop to the mind so you let things follow their own course until they all turn to ashes without any way of being remedied
Don't think that this comes from anything other than a lack of the mindfulness and discernment that can lead out to freedom
If not for this who would be willing to sacrifice his or her own worth  with a value above that of anything else in the world  for the sake of this sort of failure
Yet it's unavoidable and we have to give in  all of us  for when the chips are down it's normal that mindfulness will lapse and we won't be able to latch onto anything in time
We'll then let things follow their own course in line with the force of events too strong for the mind to withstand
Thus it is only right that we should prepare ourselves from this moment onward to be ready for the events that lie in wait around us within and without and are ready to strike at any time or place
Even though it's still morning don't let yourself delay
To be prepared is to strive to have a firm basis both within and without for your living and dying
Whether you live here or there whether death will happen here or there whether you live in this world or the next or whether you're coming to this world or going to the next you should prepare yourself beginning now in the immediate present
Otherwise when life is up you won't be able to prepare anything in time
I've never seen any Teacher's Dhamma that says to prepare yourself tomorrow or next month or next year or in the next life which would simply encourage people to be complacent
I've seen the Dhamma say only that you should make yourself a refuge both within and without right now while you're alive
Even though days nights months and years this world and the next are always present in the cosmos they're not for worthless people who are born and die in vain without doing anything of any benefit to the world or the Dhamma at all
In particular now that we are monks and meditators  which is a peaceful way of life a way of life that the world trusts and respects a way of life that more than any other in the world gives us the opportunity to do good for ourselves and others  we should be fully prepared in our affairs as monks and shouldn't let ourselves be lacking
For our behavior as monks to be gracious in a way pleasing and inspiring to others we must use mindfulness and discernment as our guardians looking after our every movement
A person with mindfulness and discernment looking after his behavior is gracious within and without and maintains that graciousness in a way that never loses its appeal at any time
When we use mindfulness and discernment to straighten out things within us  namely the mind and its mess of preoccupations  the mind immediately becomes clean clear and a thing of value
Remember the Dhamma you have studied and heard and bring it inward to blend with your practice and to support it
Keep your mindfulness and discernment right with the heart and with your every movement
Wherever the eye looks or the ear listens mindfulness and discernment should follow them there
Whatever the tongue nose and body come into contact with  no matter how good or bad coarse or refined  mindfulness and discernment should keep track of those things and pry intelligently into their causes every time there's a contact
Even when ideas occur in the mind itself mindfulness and discernment must keep track and investigate them without break  because those who have gained release from the world of entanglements in the heart have all acted in this way
They have never acted like logs thrown away on the ground where children can climb up to urinate and defecate on them day and night
If anyone acts like a log defilements and cravings from the various directions  namely from sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations  will come in through the openings of the eyes ears nose tongue and body to urinate and defecate on the heart that is making itself into a log because it doesn't have any intelligence or circumspection with regard to its inner and outer preoccupations
It simply lets cravings and defilements urinate and defecate on it day and night
This isn't at all fitting for those who aim at freedom from the cycle  ie who aim at nibbana  because the nibbana of the Buddha and his disciples is not a lazy nibbana or a log's nibbana
Those who want the Buddha's nibbana in their hearts must try to conform to the tracks left by the practice of the Buddha and his disciples
In other words they must make an effort to develop mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence to keep abreast of the events occurring within and without at all times
Don't act like a log simply going through the motions of walking sitting meditating sitting like a stump in the middle of a field without any sense of circumspection in the heart
This sort of going through the motions isn't any different from the way people in general normally act
To be a disciple of the Tathagata whose fame has spread throughout the three levels of the cosmos you should try to revive the mindfulness and discernment lying dormant in the heart so that they can support your efforts in extracting all the various defilements and cravings coming from the heart that at the moment is like a log
Greed anger delusion laziness discontent jealousy possessiveness All of these things are excrement piled on the heart
Once mindfulness and discernment have been trained as we have mentioned they will become stronger day by day more and more accustomed to working in the same way that we get accustomed to other forms of work
When we bring them to bear on the effort of the practice within the heart they will be able to understand the affairs of the heart in due time without taking long
In order to be principled and methodical in your training keep your awareness constantly with the body
Keep mindfulness focused there and use discernment to investigate within the sphere of the body
To do this is to follow the principles of the frames of reference and the Noble Truths which form the path of all the Noble Ones
There are four frames of reference the body feelings the mind and phenomena
'The body' refers to every part of the body
This is termed kayanupassana satipatthana
'Feelings' refers to pleasure pain and indifference
This is termed vedananupassana satipatthana
'The mind' refers to the mental states that are fashioned by the mind and color it
This is termed cittanupassana satipatthana
'Phenomena' refers to anything material or mental that is the object or focal point of the mind's investigation
This is termed dhammanupassana satipatthana
In investigating the four frames of reference be sure to come to a right understanding from the outset that body feelings mind and phenomena as frames of reference are a class separate from the mind that possesses them as frames of reference
Otherwise you'll get discouraged or upset when they exhibit change as part of their normal nature or as a result of the investigation which is something that may happen in the course of the practice
In other words these four factors normally undergo change that can give rise to pleasure or displeasure
When we are investigating them they continue to undergo change which can make the meditator pleased or displeased or sometimes even discouraged and fed up with the investigation
I mention this so that you'll be forewarned when it happens and will make yourself understand with circumspection that the mind in charge of the frames of reference hasn't changed along with its frame of reference in any way
Once you have come to a right understanding you can become confident in your investigation of the frames of reference
No matter which frame of reference  body feelings mind or phenomena  exhibits change or disappears the heart  a phenomenon that doesn't change or die  will be able to investigate to the full extent of its strength and come to a clear comprehension of these four factors step by step without being affected by the pleasures and pains in the body and mind which are the conditions exhibited by the frames of reference
In investigating the body you can deal either with the internal body or with external bodies depending on the situation and what comes easiest to the heart
'The internal body' refers to every part of your own body
'External bodies' refers to the bodies of other people and animals
'The body within the body' refers to any one part of the body
All of these things will show themselves to be disgusting and dismaying to the person who uses discernment to investigate them and know them as they actually are
Inside and out both the internal body and external bodies all share in the same characteristics
They always have to be washed and cleaned  and thus the care of the body is a constant duty for everyone in the world
The things that are used to care for the body to keep it alive and presentable are thus the bestselling merchandise all over the world
The investigation of the body so as to see clearly with discernment into its origins needs and behavior is thus a means of cutting off a wellspring of worries and stress in the heart  because even a huge mountain of solid rock reaching to the clouds would never weigh on the heart causing it any stress but the khandhas  such as the physical khandha or body  oppress and weigh on the heart at all times to the point where we can find no chance to put them down
The affairs of stress that are related to the khandhas thus converge on the heart responsible for them
For this reason the mind in charge of the khandhas should gain an allaround understanding of the khandhas both in their good and their bad aspects so as to manage them smoothly and comfortably and not always be abused by them
Normally the khandhas take advantage of us all day long
Every move we make is for their sake
If the mind can find a way out by becoming wise to its khandhas  even while it is still responsible for them  it can then be in a position to contend with them and won't have to take on all their stresses and pains
At the same time the stresses and pains in the khandhas won't set up shop to sell us all their suffering
Thus those who investigate the khandhas so as to see their benefits and drawbacks with discernment aren't destined to take on pain and nothing but pain from the khandhas
They are sure to find a way to reduce and relieve the tensions and strains in their hearts
In investigating the body you have to investigate it repeatedly time and again  as required for your understanding and not as determined by your laziness  until you really see clearly that the body is nothing but a body and is in no way a being a person one's self or another
This is called the contemplation of the body as a frame of reference
As for feelings the mind and phenomena you should realize that they are all present in this same body but their characteristics are somewhat different which is why they are given different names
Make sure that you understand this point well
Otherwise the four frames of reference and the four Noble Truths will turn into a cause of stress  a source of worries and doubts  while you are practicing because of your confusion about where these phenomena begin and end
As for feelings there are three pleasure pain and indifference  neither pleasure nor pain
Feelings coming from the body and those coming from the mind have these same three sorts
To investigate them you should ferret them out and examine them in line with their characteristics but don't take the body to be a feeling
Let the body be the body
Let the feeling be a feeling  in the same way as seeing a tiger as a tiger and an elephant as an elephant
Don't take the tiger to be an elephant or else your evidence won't be in line with the truth and the issue will spread until it can never be resolved
In other words ferret out and investigate the feeling displaying itself in the present moment so as to see how it arises how it takes a stance and how it disbands
The bases for the arising of all three kinds of feeling are the body and mind but the feelings themselves aren't the body nor are they the mind
They keep on being feelings both in their arising and in their disbanding
Don't understand them as being anything else or you'll be understanding them wrongly
The cause of stress will arise in that moment and you won't be able to find any way to remedy or escape from it
Your investigation instead of leading to the discernment that will release you from stress and its cause will turn into a factory producing stress and its cause at that moment without your realizing it
The way feelings behave is to arise take a stance and disband
That's all there is to them every time
And there's no 'being' 'person' 'our self' or another to them at all
As soon as we invest them with the ideas of 'being' or 'person' they will appear in terms of beings and persons which are the powers giving rise to the cause of stress in that moment and we'll immediately be intensifying stress
Meditators should thus use their discernment to be circumspect in dealing with feelings
If you don't take feelings to be yourself while you are investigating them all three sorts of feelings will appear clearly as they truly are in line with the principles of the frames of reference and the Noble Truths
No matter how these feelings may change for good or bad it will be a means of fostering the discernment of the person investigating them each moment they exhibit movement and change
The notions of 'being' 'person' 'our self' or 'another' won't have an opening by which to slip into these three sorts of feelings at all
There will be just what appears there feelings as nothing but feelings
No sense of sorrow discontent discouragement infatuation or pride will be able to arise in any way while these three sorts of feelings are displaying their behavior because we have come to a proper understanding of them  and all the time that we as meditators have a proper understanding of feelings while they are arising we are said to have the contemplation of feelings as a frame of reference in the heart
The mind as a frame of reference is not a level of mind different or apart from the other three frames of reference which is why it is termed a frame of reference just like the body feelings and phenomena
If we were to make a comparison with timber the mind on this level is like an entire tree complete with branches bark softwood roots and rootlets which is different from the timber put to use to the point where it has become a house
To contemplate the mind as a frame of reference is thus like taking a tree and cutting it up into timber as you want
To investigate the mind on this level we should focus on the thoughtformations of the mind as the target or topic of our investigation because these are the important factors that will enable us to know the defilement or radiance of the mind
If we don't know them then even if the mind suffers defilement and stress all day long we won't have any way of knowing
If we want to know the mind we must first understand the thoughtformations that condition the mind in the same way that seasonings give various flavors to food
The fact that the mind displays such an infinite variety of forms becoming so changed from its original state as to bewilder itself not knowing the reason and how to cure it giving in to events with no sense of good or evil right or wrong is all because of the thoughtformations that condition it
For this reason the mind as a frame of reference is a mind entangled with its preoccupations and conditioned by its thoughtformations
The investigation of thoughtformations is thus related to the mind because they are things interrelated by their very nature
If we understand thoughtformations we will begin to understand the mind and if we understand the mind we will understand more about thoughtformations  starting with thoughtformations from the blatant to the intermediate and subtle levels and the mind from the blatant to the intermediate and subtle levels
These levels of thoughtformations and the mind come from the fact that the mind can become involved with blatant intermediate or subtle preoccupations
People contemplating the mind as a frame of reference should thus make themselves understand from the very outset that the mind and its conditions or thoughtformations are two different sorts of things
They aren't one and the same
Otherwise the mind and its thoughtformations will become entangled and this will complicate the investigation as I have already explained
The point to focus on is the arising and involvement of thoughtformations  what preoccupations they touch on  as well as their disbanding together with the disbanding of their preoccupations
Try to observe and keep track of the movements of these thoughtformations that come out from the mind to focus on preoccupations of the past or future both blatant and subtle
Always be aware that thoughtformations and preoccupations of every sort that are interrelated must arise and disband together
They can't be made to behave otherwise
Thus the notions of 'being' 'person' 'self' or 'other' shouldn't be brought in to refer to the mind because they will immediately turn into a cause of stress
Try to observe until you see this in the course of the investigation and you will see as the Buddha taught that the mind is simply a mind and nothing else  not a being a person self other or whatever
When we contemplate the mind in this way the heart will not be upset or infatuated with the fashionings and conditions the pleasures and pains of the mind
This is what it means to have the mind as a frame of reference
'Phenomena' as a frame of reference covers anything that serves as a focal point of the heart
On the refined level it refers to the heart itself
External phenomena are of many kinds
Internal phenomena include every part of the body all three kinds of feelings and the mind on the level of a frame of reference
All of this is included in the contemplation of phenomena as a frame of reference
The contemplation of the body feelings and mind together  all four frames of reference at once  is from the standpoint of forest Dhamma the contemplation of phenomena as a frame of reference
If this is in any way wrong due to my lack of skill in understanding and explaining the matter I ask forgiveness of all my listeners and readers because I always feel at a loss every time I mention the topic of forest Dhamma in any of my talks or writings
For this reason I ask that my readers when reading about forest Dhamma try to cultivate a fairly open mind toward every passage so that they won't get upset while they are reading
When in the course of the investigation the four frames of reference are brought together in the contemplation of phenomena so that they become a single level of Dhamma this is a point in the practice more amazing and unexpected than anything that has gone before
This is because in the beginning steps of the investigation the body is like a piece of wood in the raw state
Feelings are in a raw state
The mind is in a raw state
Even phenomena are in a raw state because the investigation itself is like a piece of wood in the raw state so that the things investigated are all in the same state
But when we plane and polish things with the effort of the practice everything in the area of the practice gradually changes its condition
What I have mentioned here concerning the contemplation of phenomena as a frame of reference is a fairly refined level of Dhamma so we can't help but be grateful for the groundwork laid during the raw state of the investigation on the beginning levels
When we investigate phenomena in the final stages if feels very different from the beginning stages even though they are the same four frames of reference
When we reach the final stages it appears to the mind that all four frames of reference  body feelings mind and phenomena  connect so that they all come under contemplation of phenomena as a frame of reference
They converge completely so that there is no sense that this is the body that's a feeling this is the mind that's a phenomenon
They all seem to come together on a single level of Dhamma
In dealing with the body feelings and mind I've given a fairly adequate explanation of the methods of investigation for remedying and freeing the mind but now that we come to the topic of phenomena the discussion seems to have dealt entirely with my own experiences
Nevertheless I hope that you will approach it with the attitude I've just mentioned and put it into practice in a way suited to your own temperament
The results are sure to come out directly in line with what I've explained to you
To summarize the four frames of reference There is the body which covers the internal body external bodies and the body within the body
There are feelings  internal feelings external feelings and feelings within feelings
There is the mind  the inner mind the outer mind and the mind within the mind
'The inner mind' refers to mental states that deal with preoccupations exclusively within the mind
'The outer mind' refers to mental states involved with external preoccupations
'The mind within the mind' refers to any single mental current out of the many mental currents that come out of the heart
And then there are phenomena  inner phenomena outer phenomena and phenomena within phenomena
'Inner phenomena' are the refined states or preoccupations that are objects or focal points of the mind and also the mind itself which is the converging point of all mental objects
'Outer phenomena' refers to every kind of external condition capable of being an object of the mind
'Phenomena within phenomena' refers to any single condition out of the many conditions that are the focal points of the mind
Thus the terms 'body within the body' 'feelings within feelings' 'the mind within the mind' and 'phenomena within phenomena' refer to any single part or instance of these things
For example any one hair out of the many hairs on the head any one tooth out of the many teeth we have These are termed the body within the body
A person investigating any one part of the body in general is said to be contemplating the body within the body
The same holds true for feelings mind and phenomena but I won't go into detail on this point for fear that we won't have enough time
Let's save it for a later date
The four frames of reference from the point of view of forest Dhamma are present in full measure in our own bodies and minds
This doesn't mean though that their external aspects are irrelevant
This is a point you will see clearly when you work at the frames of reference until you can connect them entirely on the level of contemplation of phenomena
The mind won't feel compelled to search for anything external to help in its practice
Simply investigating exclusively in the area of the body and mind using the four frames of reference complete in the body and mind will be enough to cure it of its problems
On the beginning level though everything internal and external is relevant
But as you reach the stage of letting go step by step those various conditions will lose their relevance
Even the body feelings mind and phenomena which are the necessary terms of the frames of reference have to be let go
They shouldn't be held to or borne as a burden on the heart
They must all be let go when your investigation fully reaches the point of dhamma anatta Phenomena are notself
Then later you can turn around to contemplate and connect them again as a pastime for the mind in the present once the mind has gone beyond and yet is still in charge of the khandhas
Meditators if they are firm and unflinching in the practice of the frames of reference are sure to see a variety of extraordinary and amazing things arising at intervals in their minds
When the time comes to reap the results on the level of Dhamma corresponding to the causes that have been properly developed the results will have to appear stage by stage as the attainment of streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship
There is no need to doubt this
So know that whether we contemplate the four frames of reference or the four Noble Truths they are one and the same path for the sake of release from suffering and stress
Even though there may be some differences they differ only in name
In terms of their basic principles they are one and the same
Those who work at the four frames of reference and those who work at the four Noble Truths are performing the same branch of work because stress its cause its disbanding and the path to its disbanding are the same level of truth as the body feelings mind and phenomena  in the same way as when different people do different jobs in a single factory the profits from their labor all go to the same factory
To summarize the final results that come from working at the frames of reference and the Noble Truths step by step In the beginning the body feelings mind and phenomena are in a raw state
Stress its cause its disbanding and the path to its disbanding are in a raw state because the practice is in a raw state of planing and polishing back and forth without any feel for the heaviness or lightness depth or shallowness breadth or narrowness of the Dhamma and without any sense of right or wrong good or bad in the practice because it's something we have never done before
No one from our greatgrandparents down to our parents and other relatives has ever told us that the frames of reference and Noble Truths are like this or that that they should be put into practice this or that way so as to give results of this or that sort  for they themselves had no way of knowing
What's worse they have taken these excellent frames of reference and Noble Truths and thrown them away underground underwater and into the fire time and again
We are simply their children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren How can we boast that we're wise and allknowing in these matters
We simply have to admit our own ignorance
Even though it's true that the frames of reference and Noble Truths have been excellent Dhamma from the very beginning when they reach us they have to start as Dhamma in the raw state because we ourselves are people in the raw state
Even our practice is practice in the raw state
But as we practice persistently without retreating and as our understanding into the Dhamma and the practice gradually appears bit by bit day by day and slowly begins to take shape our conviction in the teachings of the Buddha grows continually stronger and more deeply rooted
The things that used to be mysterious gradually come to be revealed for what they truly are
For example the four frames of reference and four Noble Truths even though they were always right with us used to be as if buried out of sight without our being aware of them
We listened to monks giving sermons and imagined things to be far away beyond the range of our ears and eyes
We never thought at all to refer these teachings inwardly to ourselves the converging points of the Dhamma
When the monks finished their sermons the results could be summarized as this 'We don't have the capability of reaching the Dhamma that has been taught because it's infinitely deep and exceedingly subtle
The Dhamma explained and we the listeners lie on opposite sides of the world' The thought never occurred to us that all of us  teachers and listeners alike  are in the same world of the frames of reference and the four Noble Truths and that the matters explained were entirely our own affairs without the slightest deviation
These sorts of misunderstandings can happen to all of us
But when the truth  such as the frames of reference  starts revealing itself in the course of our practice these teachings turn step by step into a map for the mind
We see the body feelings mind and phenomena as if they were a piece of paper covered with symbols and signs showing us the way to proceed so as to gain release from suffering and stress
The frames of reference and Noble Truths within and without become symbols and signs showing the way for the mind to proceed on all sides as if they were saying 'Hurry up and follow these arrows showing the way to safety
The enemy is in a frenzy searching for you right nearby and is waiting in ambush for you everywhere
Don't be lulled into thinking that any of these places are safe
Only if you hurry through this jungle will you reach safety' Our persistence in the practice then grows stronger together with the mindfulness and discernment we have been training by using the frames of reference and Noble Truths as our whetstone and path
The body feelings mind and phenomena that we used to investigate erratically and unevenly now become Dhamma on a common level and can all be investigated so as to be brought together and subsumed under the level of contemplation of pure phenomena
When the mind takes the contemplation of phenomena as its frame of reference until it is skilled and thoroughly sure of itself the contemplation of phenomena turns to deal exclusively with the affairs of the mind
At this stage you could say that the Dhamma becomes the mind or the mind becomes Dhamma
Once the mind has entered purely into the contemplation of phenomena then external conditions  sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas together with the senses of sight hearing smell taste feeling and ideation which used to be like a solid mountain of rock obstructing the mind so that it could find no way out  fade away and vanish from the imagination
The body feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance that were like clouds obscuring the heart are now dispersed bit by bit from their shapes  the suppositions of conventional reality  by the winds of mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence until they fade away to the point where almost nothing is left
What is left is simply a vapor arising from the heart This is a level of phenomena that hasn't yet been destroyed but can't display itself openly because strong mindfulness and discernment have it surrounded and are constantly probing after it to destroy it at all times
Finally this level of phenomena  the mind of unawareness  is utterly destroyed by mindfulness and discernment using the truth of dhamma anatta  phenomena are notself  and the teaching that all phenomena are unworthy of attachment
The notions of being person self or others when they no longer have any conventional suppositions in which to find shelter must now float away of their own accord
The moment that mindfulness and discernment have completed their duties toward the frames of reference a nature that is extraordinary and amazing appears in all its fullness
All problems are resolved without any chance of continuation because cause and effect between the khandhas and the mind have come to a full and lasting truce
Even though they still live together they no longer quarrel the way they used to
Each is free in line with its truth
The word yathabhutañanadassana  knowledge and vision of things as they are  in the understanding of forest Dhamma means living with no mistrust between the khandhas and mind the world and the Dhamma the inside and the out
The heart and all things everywhere are no longer enemies as they used to be and the heart can now put all things to their proper uses
I ask that all of you as monks and meditators listen to this so that it goes straight to the heart and make an effort until your practice goes straight to the heart as well
All of this dhamma will appear as a treasure of infinite worth in the hearts of those who are intent and nothing will ever be able to separate them from it
The effort made for an honorable victory like that of the Buddha  a victory unmatched by anything else in the world  is the effort to take victory over oneself as the Pali says
atta have jitam seyyo It is better to take victory over oneself
This seems to be enough explanation for the time being so now at the end of this talk I ask that the power of the Triple Gem safeguard and protect each and every one of you so that you meet with ease in body and mind and so that you progress in virtue concentration and discernment until you can overcome all obstacles to the realm of security and peace that is nibbana
Here in this monastery we practice not in line with people's wishes and opinions but in line for the most part with the principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya the principles of the religion
We do this for the sake of the public at large who rely on the religion as a guiding principle in what is good and right and who rely on the good and right behavior of monks and novices the religious leaders for Buddhists at large
For this reason I'm not interested in treating anyone out of a sense of deference over and above the principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya that are the basis of the religion
If our minds start to bend under the influence of the views and opinions of any one person or of the majority  who have no limits or standards  then monasteries and the religion will come to have no limits or standards
Monasteries that bend under the influence of the world without any sense of reason as an underlying support will have no order or standards and will become monasteries without any of the substance of the religion remaining in them at all
Those who look for things of value to revere and respect  in other words intelligent people  won't be able to find anything good of any substance that will have a hold on their hearts because there will be nothing but worthless and counterfeit things filling the monasteries filling the monks the novices the nuns filling everything everywhere
In homes as well as in monasteries in the area of the world as well as the Dhamma everything will get mixed into being one with what is counterfeit and lacking in any value or worth
For this reason we have to keep things in their separate places
The religion and the world even though they may dwell together are not the same thing
A monastery  whether it's located in a village outside of a village or in a forest  is not the same as a village
The people who come to stay there are not the same as ordinary people
The monastery has to be a monastery
The monks have to be monks with their own independent Dhamma and Vinaya that don't come under or depend on any particular individual
This is an important principle that can have a hold on the hearts of intelligent people who are searching for principles of truth to revere and respect or to be their inspiration
I view things from this angle more than from any other
Even the Buddha our Teacher viewed things from this angle as well as we can see from the time he was talking with Ven
Nagita
When a crowd of people shouting and making a big racket came to see the Buddha he said 'Nagita who is that coming our way making a commotion like fishmongers squabbling over fish
We don't aspire to this sort of thing which is a destruction of the religion
The religion is something to guard and preserve so that the world will find peace and calm  like clear clean water wellguarded and preserved so that people in general can use it to drink and bathe at their convenience
The religion is like clear clean water in this way which is why we don't want anyone to disturb it to make it muddy and turbid' This is what the Buddha said to Ven
Nagita
He then told Ven
Nagita to send the crowd back telling them that their manner and the time of day  it was night  were not appropriate for visiting monks who live in quiet and solitude
Polite manners are things that intelligent people choose to use and there are plenty of other times to come
This is a time when the monks want quiet so they shouldn't be disturbed in a way that wastes their time and causes them difficulties without serving any kind of purpose at all
This is an example set by our Teacher
He wasn't the sort of person to mingle and associate with lay people at all times without any reasonable limits or rules the way things currently are  as if the religion were a distillery and we monks and novices were distributing liquor so that the public could be drunk without ever sobering up for a day
Actually the religion is medicine for curing drunkenness
Monks and novices are supposed to be doctors for curing their own drunkenness and that of the world
They're not supposed to sell liquor and intoxicants to the point where they have no sense of shame
Whenever people set foot in the monastery we say that they come in good faith  and so we make allowances and compromises until we forget ourselves forget the Dhamma and Vinaya and forget the good standards of monasteries and monks to the point where we destroy ourselves the monastery and the religion bit by bit day by day and everything turns into mud
Homedwellers and monasterydwellers can't find any principles to hold to
Monks are full of excrement  ie the worthless things in the monasteries and in the monks and novices themselves
For this reason each of us who has ordained in the religion should reflect a great deal on these matters
Don't see anything as having greater value than the Dhamma and Vinaya which are the major principles for uniting the hearts of Buddhists in confidence conviction and peace
If the principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya are lacking or deficient the benefits received by Buddhists will have to be deficient in turn until there is nothing to which their hearts can hold
Even though the teachings of the religion fill the texts and copies of the Canon fill every monastery still the important essence that should be put into practice so that people can be inspired to take this essence into their hearts and put it into practice themselves for the sake of what is beneficial and auspicious doesn't exist  even though the religion still exists
This is something we can clearly see at present
The important factors that can make the religion prosper and can serve as witnesses to the people who become involved with it for the sake of all things meritorious and auspicious are the monks and novices
If the monks and novices are intent on behaving in line with the principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya as taught by the Buddha they are the ones who will preserve the good pattern of the religion and of the paths fruitions and nibbana without a doubt
People will be able to take them as their standard  because there are still plenty of intelligent people left in the world
As for stupid people even though they may overflow the world they have no sure standards
If they feel pleased they praise you
That praise simply comes out of their stupidity and serves no purpose
If they feel displeased they criticize you
That criticism serves no purpose either for them or for you
If intelligent people praise you though that can be taken to heart and benefits both parties them as well as you
If they praise the Sangha they praise it in line with the principles of the truth and of their intelligence
At the same time those members of the Sangha who hold to reason can make themselves a field of merit for them as well so that they too can benefit
Even if they criticize us they have their reasons that should be taken as food for thought
Thus we who practice should make ourselves well aware of this point
Wherever you go don't forget that you are a practitioner of the religion a representative of our Teacher in following the religion and proclaiming it through your practice
This doesn't mean that you have to teach the public to understand the Dhamma
Even the practices you follow rightly are a visible example that can make them feel conviction in the religion from what they see
Even more so when you can explain the Dhamma correctly in line with the principles of the practice following the teachings of the Buddha This is all the more the right and proper proclamation of the religion for good people to hold to in their hearts
The religion will come to flourish more and more in the hearts of Buddhists
Wherever you go wherever you stay don't forget the basic principles  virtue concentration and discernment  which are the basic principles of our work as contemplative
These are the essential principles of each monk's work
This is where we become 'sons of the Sakyan of the victorious Buddha' disciples of the Tathagata and not when we simply shave our heads and don the yellow robe
That's something anyone can do and isn't important
What's important is behaving in line with our duties
Virtue
We should be careful to maintain our precepts so that they aren't broken or stained
We should be careful using mindfulness and discernment in our every activity
Whatever else may get broken don't let your precepts get broken for they are the invaluable treasure of your status as a monk something on which you can truly stake your life
Concentration
If it hasn't yet arisen try to train the heart and bring it under control coming down hard on its unruliness caused by the power of defilement so that you can have it in hand in your efforts with the practice
Use mindfulness and discernment to block its recklessness so that it can settle down in peace and quiet
This is our samadhi treasure as monks
Discernment is intelligence and ingenuity
Discernment is of use in all places at all times
Both in your internal and in your external activities always make use of your discernment
Especially in your internal activities when you're investigating the various kinds of defilements and mental effluents discernment becomes especially important
Discernment and mindfulness shouldn't be separated
They have to perform their duties together
Mindfulness is what keeps watch over the work discernment is doing
Whenever mindfulness lapses that work won't accomplish its full aims
For this reason mindfulness is a necessary quality that must always be kept fastened on your work
These things are our work as contemplatives
Remember them and always take them to heart
Don't be apathetic or you'll become a shameless monk callous to the fact that the world is bowing down to you at all times
Now that the Rains Retreat is over we'll each go our separate ways in line with duty and necessity and the laws of inconstancy stress and notself
These are things we can't prevent because they are big matters the way of nature
Even I myself I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to stay with you all because I lie under the law of inconstancy too
So while we are still living together I want you to be intent on training yourselves with your full hearts in keeping with the fact that you've come to study to train yourselves and to practice
The word 'discernment' which I mentioned a moment ago means to investigate and unravel the various factors that become involved with us within and without
The body Usually it's the body of the opposite sex
As the Dhamma says there is no sight that's a greater enemy to the state of a contemplative than the sight of the opposite sex
The same holds true for the voice the smell the taste and the touch of the opposite sex
These are the foremost dangers that face contemplatives so we have to show greater care and restraint toward these things than toward anything else
Mindfulness and discernment have to unravel these important points more than they have to deal with any other work
The body
We should analyze it with our discernment so as to see it clearly
The words 'the body of a woman' or 'the body of a man' are simply names given in line with convention
Actually it's not a woman or a man
It's simply an ordinary body just like ours covered all over with skin
If we look inside there's flesh tendons and bones
It like us is all full of filthy and repulsive things
There's no part that's basically any different from our own body
There's simply the label in our mind that says 'woman' or 'man' This word 'woman' or 'man' is engraved deeply within the heart by the heart's own suppositions even though it's not a truth and is simply a supposition
The same with the voice It's just an ordinary sound and yet we label it the voice of the opposite sex and so it stabs deep into the heart  especially for those of us who are ordained  and goes clear through to the point where we forget ourselves
The heart gets cut at the stem even though we continue to live
The stem of the heart is torn rotten and putrid and yet we don't die
Instead we listen with pleasure to the song of our heart's being cut at the stem without ever wearying of it or having enough
The smell It's an ordinary smell just like ours because it's the smell of a person
Even if we bring perfumes and scents from the realms of the devas and Brahmas to rub down that body the smell is the smell of those things not the smell of a woman or man not the least little bit
So analyze this and make careful distinctions
The taste is simply the touch
The touch of that body is no different from one part of our own body touching another part
Each of the parts is just earth water wind and fire just like ours
We can't see that there's any difference
So we have to investigate clearly like this and then make comparisons comparing the sight sound smell taste and touch of the woman or man with our own sight sound smell taste and touch
There's no difference in terms of the principles of nature and of the truth aside from the mind's conferring titles in line with its thoughts
For this reason we must use discernment to unravel things
Don't let suppositions of any kind that will be your enemies infiltrate or destroy your heart
Shake them off using discernment which is a truth coming down to the truth that these things are just sights just sounds just smells just tastes just tactile sensations all of which pass by and disappear like other things
This is without a doubt the right way to contemplate that can gradually uproot our attachments and misconceptions concerning these matters
Whatever object you may investigate in the world it's full of inconstancy stress and lackofself
There's nothing lasting to be found
All things depend on one thing or another and then fall apart
Whatever the object If it exists in the world it has to fall apart
If it doesn't fall apart we will
If it doesn't break up we'll break up
If it doesn't leave we'll leave  because this world is full of leaving and separation through the principles of nature
So investigate in this way with discernment to see clearly before these things leave us or we leave them and then let them go in line with their truth
When we can do this the mind will be at its ease
Here we've been talking about discernment on the level of investigating sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations
Whether within or without on the blatant or the subtle level this is how all of these things are investigated
Concentration I've already explained to some extent
Concentration refers to the stability and solidity of the heart beginning with its small moments of stillness and peace all the way up to the refined and stable levels of stillness and peace
If the mind isn't trained isn't improved isn't forced with various tactics backed up by mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence it won't be able to attain peace till its dying day
It will die in vain
It will die restless and confused straying off to different preoccupations
It won't have any mindfulness or selfawareness
It will die without any principles or standards to hold to
It will die just as a kite whose string is cut when it's up in the air floats wherever the wind blows
Even while it's still living it lives without any principles or standards because of its absentmindedness and heedlessness its lack of any sense of reason for it to follow
It lives simply drifting
If we live simply drifting without any good principles to hold to then when we go we'll have to go simply drifting
What purpose will it serve
What goodness and certainty can we have for our destination
So as long as we're alive and aware as we currently are we should build certainty for ourselves in our hearts by being strong and unflinching in matters that are of solid worth
Then we can be certain of ourselves both as we live and when we die
We won't be upset or affected by life or death by being separated from other beings or our own bodies  something we all have to meet with because these are things lying within us all
It's not the case that discernment arises automatically on the heels of concentration when the mind has been centered
It has to be exercised and trained to think explore and investigate
Only then will discernment arise with concentration as its support
Concentration on its own can't turn into discernment
It has to remain as concentration
If we don't use discernment to investigate concentration simply makes the mind refreshed and calm content with its preoccupation in tranquillity not hungering to think here or there not confused or straying  because once the mind is still it's calm and refreshed with the Dhamma in line with the level of its stillness
We then take the mind that has been refreshed by tranquillity and use it with discernment to investigate and unravel various things none of which in this world lie over and beyond inconstancy stress and notself
All things are filled with these same conditions so use discernment to contemplate  from whatever angle most suits your temperament  by investigating these things with interest with the desire really to know and see them as they truly are
Don't simply investigate without any intention or mindfulness in control
In particular the theme of unattractiveness This is a good a very good cure for the mind obsessed with lust and passion
However strong the lust that's how strongly you should investigate unattractiveness until you can see your own body and that of others throughout the world as a cemetery of fresh corpses
Lust won't have a chance to flare up when discernment has penetrated to the knowledge that the body is filled with repulsiveness
Who would feel lust for repulsiveness
Who would feel lust for things with no beauty
For things that are disgusting
This is one form of the medicine of unattractiveness one of the prime medicines for curing the disease of lust and craving
Once you've made a really full investigation make the mind grow still in a restricted range
Once the mind has investigated unattractiveness many many times to the point where it becomes proficient adept at contemplating external bodies as well as the internal body able to visualize things in whatever way you want then the mind will converge to the level of unattractiveness within itself and see the harm of the pictures of unattractiveness it paints as being one form of illusion
It will then let go of both sides both the side of unattractiveness and the side of attractiveness
Both attractiveness and unattractiveness are labels coupled with the affairs of lust
Once we have investigated and fully understood both sides the word 'attractive' will dissolve and no longer have meaning
The word 'unattractive' will dissolve and no longer have meaning
That which gives the meaning of 'attractive' and 'unattractive' is the mind or in other words sañña
We are now wise to sañña as being what labels things
We see the harm of this labeling and so it will no longer be able to go out interpreting in such a way as to make the mind grasp and be attached again
When this is the case the mind lets go of both attractiveness and unattractiveness  or of beauty and ugliness  by seeing that they are simply dolls for training the mind and discernment as long as the mind is still attached to them and the discernment for investigating to uproot them is not yet proficient enough
When the mind is proficient and realizes the causes and effects of both sides  both attractiveness and unattractiveness  it can at the same time turn around to know its own labeling that goes out to dress this thing up as attractive and that as unattractive
When it knows this labeling clearly the labeling disbands
The mind can see its harm in that this labeling is the culprit
The unattractive object isn't the culprit
The attractive object isn't the culprit
Instead the labeling that says 'attractive' and 'unattractive' is the culprit deceiving us and making us become attached
This is where things start coming inward
Our investigation comes inward like this and lets go step by step
When the mind has reached this stage then whether we focus on attractiveness or unattractiveness it will appear in the mind without our having to create an external image to exercise with just as when we travel and have passed progressively along a road
The image appears in the mind
The moment it appears there we immediately know that sañña can label only as far as this and can't go labeling outside
Even though the image appears in mind we know clearly that the phenomenon that appears there as attractive or unattractive comes from sañña in the same way
We know the image that appears in the mind as well as the sañña labeling it also as an image in the mind
Finally the images in the mind vanish
The sañña  the labels the interpretations  disband
We know that the labels that used to fool us into seeing things as attractive and unattractive and all sorts of other ways without limit  that used to fool us into falling for both of these sides  have disbanded
There is nothing further to deceive the heart
This is how unattractiveness is investigated in line with the principles of the practice  but you won't find this anywhere in the texts
You'll find it only if you search for the truth in the principles of nature that exist with the body and mind  the location of the four Noble Truths and the four frames of reference  coming down finally to the text of the heart
That's where you'll find the things I've explained here
This is the body
We can know clearly that every part of the body is simply a physical phenomenon
And what is there in these physical phenomena
All the parts  hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones marrow spleen heart liver membranes kidneys lungs intestines stomach gorge feces  are just physical phenomena things separate from the mind
If we consider them as unattractive they've been unattractive all along even before we considered them
And who is it that gives them meaning saying that this is attractive or that is unattractive
When did these things ever give themselves meanings
When did they ever say they were attractive or unattractive
They don't label or say anything at all
Whatever their truth is that's how it's always been in line with its nature from the very beginning  and they don't know their meaning
What knows their meaning is sañña
The one that falls for their meaning is also sañña which comes out of this deluded mind
Once we are wise to this labelling all these things disappear
Each has its separate reality
This is what it means to be wise to these things
Feelings are the feelings of pleasure pain and indifference that arise from the body
The body is a phenomenon that has existed since before these feelings arose
Pains arise remain and then vanish
The body is the body
The pain is a pain
Each is a separate reality
Investigate and analyze them so as to see them for what they are  just a feeling just a body  without regarding them as a being a person us or anyone else ours or anyone else's
The feeling isn't us ours or anyone else's
It's simply something that appears for a moment and disappears for a while in line with its nature
That's what the truth is
Sañña means labeling
Whatever it labels  things near far past present or future  whatever it labels it vanishes immediately
It keeps vanishing  arising and vanishing arising and vanishing  so how can we regard it as a self a being a person
Here we're referring to discernment on the refined level penetrating down in line with the truth that is clear to our heart without our having to ask anyone else
Sankhara means thoughtformation forming good thoughts bad thoughts neutral thoughts
Whatever it forms is simply a matter of arising and vanishing arising and vanishing
We can't get any sense out of these thoughtformations at all if saññas don't take up where they leave off and turn them into issues
As for saññas we already know them clearly so what is there to form thoughts pick up where they leave off and grasp at them turning them into long issues
All there is is just the arising and vanishing in the mind
This is thoughtformation
It's one reality which the Buddha calls the sankhara khandha
Khandha means heap or aggregate
Rupa khandha means the physical heap
Vedana khandha means the heap of feelings
Sañña khandha means the heap of labels the aggregate of labels
Sankhara khandha means the heap of thoughtformations the aggregate of thoughtformations
Viññana khandha means the aggregate or heap of cognizance that which takes note the moment external things make contact as when visual images make contact with the eye and cognizance occurs
As soon as the object passes this cognizance vanishes
No matter what thing it takes note of it's always ready to vanish with that thing
What sense or substance can we get out of these five khandhas
How can we assume them to be us or ours
This is what the issues of the five khandhas are like
They've occurred this way appeared this way arisen and vanished this way one after another continually from the day of our birth to the present moment
We can't find any meaning or substance in them at all unless the mind labels and interprets them grasping onto them as being itself or belonging to itself and then carrying their weight  which is heavier than an entire mountain  within itself without any reward
Its only reward is suffering and stress because its own delusion has caused these things to reward it
When the mind has investigated and seen these things clearly with sharp discernment then the body is true in its body way in line with the principles of nature that are made clear with discernment
Feelings of pain pleasure and indifference in the body are known clearly in line with their truth
Feelings in the mind  the pleasure pain and indifference arising in the mind  are the factor the mind continues to be interested in investigating
Even though we may not yet be abreast of these things they have to be alerting the mind to investigate them at all times because on this level we aren't yet able to keep abreast of feelings in the mind  in other words the pleasure pain and indifference exclusively in the mind that aren't related to feelings in the body
Cognizance is simply a separate reality
We see this clearly as it truly is
The mind has no more doubts that would cause it to latch onto these things as its self because each is a separate reality
Even though they dwell together they're like a piece of fruit or an egg placed in a bowl
The bowl has to be a bowl
The egg placed there is an egg
They aren't one and the same
The mind is the mind which lies in the bowl of the body feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance but it's not the body feelings labels thoughtformations or cognizance
It's simply the mind pure and simple inside there
When we clearly make the distinction between the mind and the khandhas that's how it is
Now that the mind clearly understands the body feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance with nothing more to doubt all that remains is the fidgeting and rippling exclusively within the mind
This rippling is a subtle form of sankhara that ripples within the mind a subtle form of pleasure a subtle form of stress a subtle form of sañña appearing in the mind
That's all there is
The mind will investigate and analyze these things at all times with automatic mindfulness and discernment
The mind on this level is very refined
It has let go of all things
The five khandhas no longer remain but it hasn't yet let go of itself its awareness
This awareness though is still coated with unawareness
This is called unawareness converging
It converges in the mind and can't find any way out
The paths of unawareness are out the eyes ears nose tongue and body leading to sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations
Once mindfulness and discernment have been able to cut these paths step by step unawareness has no way out
It doesn't have any following so it just goes 'blip blip blip' within itself taking just the mind as the support onto which it latches because it can't find any way out
It displays itself as a subtle feeling of pleasure a subtle feeling of stress a radiance that's extremely amazing as long as discernment isn't yet allaround and can't yet destroy it
The mind keeps contemplating right there
No matter how radiant or magnificent it may be any conventional reality  no matter how refined  has to display a symptom of one sort or another that will arouse the mind's suspicions enough to make it look for a way to remedy the situation
Thus the pleasure and stress that are refined phenomena appearing exclusively within the mind together with the brightness and marvelousness have unawareness as their ringleader but because we have never encountered them before we're deluded into holding onto them when we first investigate into this point and are lulled sound asleep by unawareness so that we grasp onto the radiance  to the pleasure to the marvelousness or to the magnificence arising from the unawareness embedded in the mind  as being our self
And so we assume the mind complete with unawareness to be our self without our realizing what we are doing
But not for long  because of the power of supermindfulness and superdiscernment qualities that by now are uncomplacent
They keep scrutinizing investigating and analyzing back and forth in line with their nature on this level
The time will have to come when they know for sure by noticing the subtle pleasure that behaves just slightly in an irregular manner
Even though stress displays itself just barely in line with this level of the mind it's enough to make us suspicious 'Eh  why does the mind have symptoms like this
It's not constant' The magnificence displaying itself in the mind the marvelousness displaying itself in the mind display irregularities just barely but enough for mindfulness and discernment to catch sight of them
Once they catch sight of these things they get suspicious and take them as the point to be investigated at that moment
So now the mind  this sort of awareness  becomes the target of their investigation
They focus down on this point to find out 'What is this
We've investigated everything of every sort to the point where we've been able to uproot it all stage by stage but this knowing nature so bright so amazing What exactly is it'
Mindfulness and discernment keep focusing on down and investigating
This point thus becomes the target of a fullscale investigation the battlefield of automatic mindfulness and discernment at that moment
Before long they are able to destroy the mind of unawareness that is so superlative so amazing and magnificent from the viewpoint of unawareness smashing and scattering it completely so that nothing not even an atom is left remaining in the heart
When the nature on which we ignorantly conferred such titles as superlative and amazing is dissolved away something on which we don't have to confer the titles of superlative or notsuperlative appears in full measure
That nature is purity
And this purity When we compare it with the mind of unawareness that we once held to be superlative and supreme the mind of unawareness is like a pile of cow dung while the nature that had been concealed by unawareness once it is revealed is like pure gold
Pure gold and squishy cow dung Which has greater value
Even a baby sucking his thumb can answer so we needn't waste our time and expose our stupidity by making comparisons
This is the investigation of the mind
This level when we have reached it is where things are severed completely from becoming and birth in the mind severed completely from all unawareness and craving
'Avijjapaccaya sankhara'  'With unawareness as condition there occur thoughtformations'  is completely severed and becomes 'avijjayatveva asesaviraganirodha sankharanirodho sankharanirodha viññananirodho'  'Simply with the disbanding of unawareness with no remaining passion thoughtformations disband
With the disbanding of thoughtformations cognizance disbands' all the way to 'this is the disbanding of this entire mass of stress'
When unawareness has disbanded the formations that are the cause of stress disband and keep disbanding just as the Buddha said while the formations that continue as part of the khandhas become formations pure and simple and aren't a cause of stress
The cognizance that appears in the heart is cognizance pure and simple and not cognizance as a cause of stress
'Viññanapaccaya namarupam namarupampaccaya salayatanam salyatanapaccaya phasso'  whatever is a physical or mental phenomenon a sense medium or a sensory contact is simply its own simple nature
It can't provoke the mind that has finished its task to the point of 'evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa nirodho hoti'  'This is the disbanding of this entire mass of stress' The words 'evametassa kevalassa'  'all things mentioned here'  have absolutely disbanded
This is called disbanding in full measure
When we disband defilement craving and unawareness when we disband the world of rebirth where do we disband it if not in the mind which is the essence of the world of rebirth the essence of unawareness the essence of birth aging illness and death
The seeds of birth aging illness and death  namely passion and craving with unawareness as their ringleader  lie only here in the mind
When they are completely scattered from the mind there is simply 'nirodho hoti'  'This is the disbanding'
This then is the work of the practice in line with the principles of the Buddha's teachings
From the time of the Buddha down to the present these principles have remained constant
There are no deficiencies or excesses in the principles of the Dhamma taught by the Buddha that would make it unable to keep up with the tricks and deceits of the various forms of defilement
This is why it's called the middle way the Dhamma always appropriate for curing every sort of defilement to the point where defilement no longer remains
This is how you should understand the power of the middle way
Hold to this path in your practice because release from suffering and stress is something with a value transcending all three levels of existence
And what do we see in any of the three levels of existence that is more fantastic than the release of the heart from all suffering and stress
When we see this clearly with our reason our efforts in the practice will be able to advance
We'll be ready to die in the battle
If it means death then go ahead and die  die in the battle for victory over the defilements that have smothered the heart for so long
There is no teaching no tool at all that can attack the defilements and strike them down like the middle way taught by the Lord Buddha
For this reason we can be secure and confident in the words 'Buddham saranam gacchami'  'I go for refuge in the Buddha'  in that he practiced so that both the causes and the results  everything of every sort  were perfect and complete before taking the Dhamma to teach the world
'Svakkhato bhagavata dhammo'  'The Dhamma of the Blessed One is well taught' He taught it well in every facet from having comprehended and seen the truth of every thing of every sort
'Sangham saranam gacchami'  'I go for refuge in the Sangha' The Noble Disciples who practiced in line with the principles of the Buddha's Dhamma  without slacking or weakening enabling themselves to expel defilement from their hearts making their hearts superlative and becoming our refuge  did so without going outside the principles of this middle way
So I ask that you listen to this and take it to heart
Don't set your heart on the deceitful and counterfeit issues filling the world of rebirth
Set your heart on the truth of the Dhamma the truth of the practice
You will see the truth continually appearing in your heart in the midst of all the counterfeit things in the heart and throughout the world
Don't harbor any doubts for that would be to linger over the defilements that know no end
In practicing the Dhamma aim at the qualities of the heart  virtue concentration and discernment  more than at material things
As for material things if we have just enough to get by that's plenty enough
Wherever you go We are born from human beings
We monks come from people
People have homes we monks need places to stay  enough to provide ordinary shelter  but they should be just enough to get by
Don't make them fancy
Don't go competing with the world outside
That would simply foster your own defilements and make you known throughout the world in a way that the defilements would ridicule
Make yourself known instead for your virtue concentration and discernment your conviction and persistence
Make yourself known for having striven to cure yourself or extricate yourself to gain release from defilement and the mass of stress in the cycle of rebirth
This is what it means genuinely and directly to enhance your stature
Don't abandon your efforts
Make it to the other shore of this turning churning cycle in this lifetime  which is much surer than any other lifetime any other time or place
And don't forget wherever you go Don't get involved in construction work
Everywhere we go these days there's construction work and monks involved in it
It's enough to make you sick
As soon as they meet each other 'How's it going with your meeting hall' 'How's it going with your school
Are you finished yet
How much has it cost' Whenever there's a project whatever the project they go harassing lay people gathering up funds so that the lay people have to spend money and get embroiled too without any respite
Let the lay people have enough money so that they can stash some of it away
They practically kill themselves just to scrape together a little cash but instead of being able to use it to provide for their stomachs for their families their children and other essentials and for making merit at their leisure they end up having to hand it all over to help the monks who harass them by fundraising to the point where they're left emptyhanded
This is the religion of harassing the world which the Buddha never practiced and never taught us to practice
So I want you all to understand this
The Buddha never acted this way
This is the religion of material objects the religion of money not the religion of Dhamma following the example of the Buddha
Look around us Monks' dwellings as large as Doi Inthanon
How many stories do they have
They stretch up to the sky
How luxurious are they
How much do they make you sick to your heart
Even my own dwelling I can't help feeling embarrassed by it even though I stay there against my will and have to put up with the embarrassment
They sent the money to build it without letting me know in advance
I'm ashamed of the fact that while I have asked for alms all my life my dwelling even a palace in heaven is no match for it while the people who give alms live in shacks no bigger than your fist
What's appropriate what's fitting for monks who are habitually conscious of danger is to live wherever you can squeeze yourself in to sit and lie down
But as for your effort in the practice I ask that you be solid and stable diligent and persevering
Don't waste your time by letting any job become an obstacle because exterior work for the most part is work that destroys your work at mental development for the sake of killing and destroying defilement
This is the major task in body and mind for monks who aim at release and feel no desire to come back to be reborn and die to carry the mass of major and minor sufferings in levels of becoming and birth any more
There's no danger greater than the danger of defilement smothering the heart able to force and coerce the heart into suffering everything to which the Dhamma doesn't aspire
There's no suffering greater than the suffering of a person oppressed by defilement
If we don't fight with defilement while we're ordained will we be able to fight with it after we die
The vagaries of life and the body are things we can put up with but don't put up with the oppression of defilement any longer for that wouldn't be at all fitting for monks who are disciples of the Tathagata
Whether things may be just enough to get by or however much they may be lacking be sure to look to the Tathagata as your refuge at all times
Don't let things that are unnecessary for monks become luxurious beyond all reason  such as building things to the point of competing with the world outside and being crazy for hollow rank and fame without being interested in building the Dhamma to revive the heart from its stupor
The people of the world live in flimsy little shacks that are ready to collapse at a sneeze
Whatever they get they deny their own stomachs and their families so that they can make merit and give donations to monks
But monks live in manystoried mansions  fancier and more luxurious than those of heavenly beings  as if they had never lived in tiny shacks with their parents before becoming ordained
And who knows what they have decorating their mansions in competition with the world outside
It makes you more embarrassed than a young bride when her motherinlaw sneezes and passes wind so loud she practically faints
We forget that our heads are shaved Why don't we ever think about what that means
Aren't we becoming too shameless
This isn't in line with the principles of the religion that teach those who are ordained to cure their defilements by seeing the dangers in worldly comforts
These sorts of things clutter up the religion and the hearts of us monks so I ask that you not think of getting involved in them
Be conscious always of the fact that they aren't the principles of the Dhamma for curing defilement in a way the heart can see clearly
Instead they're means for making monks forget themselves and become involved in the business of defilement which is none of their business as monks at all
The primary principle of the Dhamma for monks is 'rukkhamulasenasanam nissaya pabbajja tatha te yavajivam ussaho karaniyo'  'Once you have ordained in the religion of the Buddha you are to live under the shade of trees in forests and mountains in caves under overhanging cliffs in the open by haystacks which are all places suitable for killing defilement for wiping out the defilements in your hearts
Try to act in this way all of your life' Everything else  such as the things termed 'extraneous gains'  are unnecessary comforts
The work the Buddha would have us do is the contemplation of kesa loma nakha danta taco taco danta nakha loma kesa hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin skin teeth nails hair of the body hair of the head and from there on to the parts of the body  beginning with hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones marrow spleen heart liver membranes kidneys lungs intestines stomach gorge and feces  which exist in each of us
'Try to unravel these things with your discernment so as to see them as they truly are
When you have completed this work with the full mindfulness and discernment of heroes then release from suffering  that tremendous treasure  will be yours' Listen to that
Isn't it far removed from the way we like to take our pleasure with the scraps and leftovers that the Buddha taught us to relinquish in every word every phrase every book of the Dhamma
We ourselves are the adversaries of the teachings of the religion
We luxuriate in everything the Dhamma criticizes
Lay people are no match for us
Whenever they get anything good they use it to make merit and give to monks
Whatever they eat and use is just so as to get by
All they ask for is good things to give to monks in line with their nature as meritseekers while we monks have become luxuryseekers
Our dwellings are fine the things we use are fine and on top of that some of us have radios TV sets cars If you compare this with the basic rules of the Dhamma and Vinaya it makes you more heartsick than you can say
How is it that we have the stomach to kill the Buddha redhanded this way with our shameless and unthinking ostentation as monks
It really makes you embarrassed
So I ask that each of you reflect a great deal on these matters
If you've ordained really for the sake of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha  and not for the sake of being adversaries of the Buddha's teachings  I ask that you reflect on the Dhamma and the path followed by the Buddha more than on any other matter
No time excels the time of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha that they have set as an example for us to follow
This is a very important principle
I ask that you all follow the principles of the time of the Buddha
The results which are refreshing and satisfying are sure to appear in line with the principles of the welltaught Dhamma the Dhamma that leads out from suffering
There's no way to doubt this
These things I've practiced to a fair extent myself
I used to be a junior monk too you know
When I went to study and train with my teachers  and especially Ven
Acariya Mun  I really listened
I listened to him speak
He would speak half in earnest half in jest in the ordinary way of teachers talking with their students but I would never listen in jest
I always listened in earnest and took things to heart
I had the greatest imaginable love and fear and respect for him
I'd hold to every facet of what he'd say that I could put into practice
What I've been able to teach my students is due to the power of what he taught me
For this reason even though in this monastery we may conduct ourselves somewhat differently from other monasteries in general I'm confident in line with the principles of reason and of the Dhamma and Vinaya so that I'm not worried about the matter
I don't think that what we do is wrong because I have the example of the Buddha's teaching and of my teachers  everything of every sort that follows the original patterns  which is why I've led my fellow meditators to practice this way all along
Whether this is right or wrong we have to decide in line with the principles of reason
Deference to people is an affair of the world an affair of individuals and not an affair of the Dhamma and Vinaya which are fixed principles for the practice
Speaking in line with the Dhamma for the sake of understanding and right practice That's the genuine Dhamma
For this reason an unwillingness to speak the truth for fear of stepping on someone's toes is not a trait for those who aim at the Dhamma together
This seems enough for now so I'll ask to stop here
This state of mind with its unawareness is a magnificent mind bold and daring  not only radiant but also bold and daring as well and reckless because of its daring in thinking that it's smart
It's not reckless in the ordinary way
It's reckless in line with its nature as a state of mind of this sort
This is called the nine forms of mana or conceit
The nine forms of conceit lie right here
The Buddha explains this in the five higher fetters passion for form passion for formlessness conceit restlessness and unawareness
Conceit means to assume  to assume that the state of mind blended into one with unawareness is one's self that it's 'me' or 'mine' and then taking it to make comparisons 'How is it with those people or these people
Are their minds on a par with mine
Higher than mine
Lower than mine' This is why there are nine forms of conceit
In other words three times three is nine
For example our mind is lower than theirs and we assume it to be lower than theirs higher than theirs or on a par
Our mind is on a par with theirs and we assume it to be lower than theirs higher than theirs or on a par
Our mind is higher than theirs and we assume it to be lower than theirs higher than theirs or on a par
The refined level of defilement takes this state of mind out to make the comparison  because it's in the phase where it has fangs
Its fangs are growing sharp
The fangs of unawareness They're called conceit or selfassumption
Once this state is dissolved what is there to assume
What is there to be radiant
To be defiled
To be bold and daring
To be afraid
There isn't anything once that nature dissolves through the power of investigation
These things you know are phenomena that create problems in line with their level
Their level is subtle so they manage to create subtle problems
Blatant defilements create blatant problems
Subtle defilements create subtle problems
When the defilements are gone there's nothing to create any problems
There are no more problems in any way no more conditions for conventional reality to make further connections
All that remains is absolute purity which is why there are no more problems
Absolute purity is a condition for what
What problems does it create
The Buddha says that we run out of problems
This is where they run out
However many levels of becoming and birth there may be in the mind it has known them step by step until it reaches the converging point leaving just the seeds of these things that get planted here and there as birth
So we burn them up with tapas the fire of our effort until they are completely eradicated
So now are there any levels of becoming and birth to make further connections
Whom do we have to ask
Even if the buddha were sitting right in front of us we wouldn't ask him because the truth is the same for us as it is for him
There's nothing different enough for us to ask
This is why the Dhamma is said to be sanditthiko We know it and see it ourself
Paccattam veditabbo viññuhi Those who know it know it for themselves alone
This means that only those who know it from the practice can know it
It can't be made available to anyone else
This is what the Buddha calls vusitam brahmacariyam It's the end of the job
The earthshattering job is done  earthshattering because becoming and birth build themselves up with earth water wind and fire or because any level of becoming and birth is a matter of convention which is now overturned
This is why we say it's earthshattering
So what is there to move in and take up residence in the mind
Now we can watch defilement
Once we have completely killed defilement in this mind then how can defilement be kept hidden from us when it displays itself in anyone else's mind or actions
This mind can't help but know it every time
As they say defilement ordinarily rules us completely without our knowing it but how can the Buddha and the arahants have any trouble seeing
They see in the flash of an eye and they're already disgusted
Those who know know to the point where they're disgusted What do you say to that
As for us we're the blind living with the blind
We don't know our own affairs or those of anyone else
Neither side knows but each side thinks that it knows assumes that it knows assumes that it's right  and so both sides argue and bite each other like dogs because their inner eyes don't see
They don't have the eye of discernment like the Buddha and the Noble Disciples
This is the way it is with defilement It has to assume itself and exalt itself
The more vile it is the more it assumes itself to be good
This is the way defilement is
It has never submitted to the truth of the Dhamma from time immemorial
For this reason we practice to stamp out these things
Don't let them linger in the heart
Stamp them out till they're completely scattered and smashed and then you can be at your ease the mind completely open and yet a reservoir for the quality of purity without an inkling of convention passing in
If we were to make a comparison with conventional reality it's an outer space mind but that's just a manner of speaking
People who practice in earnestness trying to develop and improve the qualities in their hearts step by step beginning with virtue the stages of concentration and the levels of discernment are  to make a comparison  like the people who build a rocket or a satellite to travel in outer space
They have to put their vehicle into good shape
Otherwise it won't get off the ground  because the things that can act as obstacles to their vehicle are many
The object that's going to travel in space has to be developed in order to be completely suited to its environment in every way
Before they can get it safely past its obstacles they need to have made ample calculations
Even then there are times when mishaps occur
But once the vehicle has been thoroughly developed it can travel easily in outer space without any mishaps of any sort
This is an analogy for the minds of those who practice who have developed their inner qualities and put them in to shape
The heart is what will step out beyond the realm of conventional realities that exert a gravitational pull on it into the outer space beyond convention to vimutti or release
The things that act as obstacles preventing it from stepping out are the various kinds of defilement
For this reason we have to make a very great effort
The defilements have various levels of crudeness and subtlety so in developing the heart so as to pass through the crudeness and subtlety of the various levels of conventional reality  and of the defilements in particular  we must try to make it just right
We must use whatever qualities are needed to get the mind past the crudeness of conventional realities or defilement stage by stage by means of our practice by means of our efforts to improve and develop it
Our persistence has to be strong
Our efforts our endeavors in all ways have to be strong
Mindfulness and discernment are the important factors that will take the heart beyond the various obstacles thwarting it step by step
All of the techniques and strategies taught by the Buddha in the area of meditation are means for developing the heart so that it will be suited to transcending the realm of conventional reality and reaching outer space nibbana
What is it like the outer space of the Dhamma
They no longer doubt about whether the outer space of the world exists or not
The things that lie within conventional reality are known to exist
Outer space beyond our atmosphere is another level of conventional reality
Outer space What is it like
Does it exist
How does our world in the atmosphere differ from the things outside the world of our atmosphere called outer space
Both of these levels exist
The mind that lies in the realm of conventional reality  surrounded and controlled  is like the various objects in the world trapped by the pull of gravity at all times
The mind is trapped by the pull of defilement in just the same way
It can't escape which is why it must develop its strength to escape from the world of this gravitational pull
This gravitational pull is something the Buddha has already explained
In brief there is craving for sensuality craving for becoming and craving for no becoming
The details  the branches and offshoots  are more than can be numbered
They fill this world of conventional realities
They are all factors that make the mind attached and entangled  loving hating and resenting different things different beings different people
All these factors can be adversaries to the heart and come from the preoccupations of the heart itself that labels things and misinterprets them
For this reason the principles of the Dhamma that the Buddha taught in the area of meditation for developing and modifying the heart are very appropriate for helping us as meditators to escape from all the things in our hearts that exert a pull on us or weigh us down
These things are hard to remove hard to remedy hard to sever which is why we need a Teacher to guide us
If we had no Teacher the living beings in the three realms of the cosmos  no matter how many thousands or millions of forms and levels there are  would all be as if deaf and blind
Not one of them would be able to escape from this darkness and blindness
This is why we should have a heartfelt sense of the awesomeness of the arising of a Buddha who leads living beings to escape from this gravitational pull from this oppressiveness safely and in large numbers  to the point where no one else can compare  beginning with each Buddha's foremost disciples and on to the end of his dispensation when his teachings no longer exist in the hearts of living beings which is the final point in his work of ferrying living beings from all sorts of blindness darkness suffering and stress
Our present Buddha performed these duties with the full mindfulness and discernment of his great mercy and compassion beginning with the day of his Awakening
It's as if he took a large ship and cast anchor in the middle of the ocean in order to gather the living beings of various kinds and strengths adrift in the water on the verge of death and bring them on board stage by stage
Those who take an interest in the Dhamma are like beings who struggle to get on board the Buddha's ship that has cast anchor in the middle of the sea
They keep climbing on board climbing on board until the day when the beings of the world have no more belief in the teachings of the religion
That's when the ship will no longer have any function
Those who are still left in the sea will have to stay there adrift with no more way of escape
They are the ones who are to become food for the fishes and turtles
Those who have come on board though are the various stages of those who have been able to escape as mentioned in the four types of individuals beginning with the ugghatitaññu vipacitaññu and neyya
These are the ones who have come on board
How high or low they are able to go depends on their individual capabilities
There are those who escape completely  those free of defilement there are those on the verge of escape  the nonreturners those in the middle  the oncereturners and then the streamwinners and finally ordinary good people
Here we're referring to the Buddha's ship in its general sense
He uses it to salvage living beings beginning from the day of his Awakening until the point when the teachings of the religion have no more meaning in the world's sensibilities
That's the final point
Those who remain are the diseased who can find no medicine or physician to treat their illnesses and are simply awaiting their day to die
So now we are swimming and struggling toward the Buddha's large ship by making the effort of the practice
In particular now that we have ordained in the Buddha's religion and have developed a feel for his teaching this makes us even more moved even more convinced of all the truths that he taught rightly about good and evil right and wrong hell heaven the Brahma worlds and nibbana all of which are realities that actually exist
We have followed the principles of the Buddha's Dhamma and in particular the practice of meditation
Try to build up your strength and ability without flagging so as to resist and remove all the things that coerce or exert a gravitational pull on the heart
Don't let yourself become accustomed to their pull
They pull you to disaster not to anything else
They're not forces that will pull you to what is auspicious
They'll pull you to what's inauspicious step by step depending on how much you believe give in and are overcome by their pull
Suffering will then appear in proportion to how much you unconsciously agree give in and are overcome by their pull
Even though there are the teachings of the religion to pull you back the mind tends to take the lower path more than the path of the religion which is why it is set adrift
But we're not the type to be set adrift
We're the type who are swimming to release using the full power of our intelligence and abilities
Wherever you are whatever you do always be on the alert with mindfulness
Don't regard the effort of the practice as tiring as something wearisome difficult to do difficult to get right difficult to contend with
Struggle and effort These are the path for those who are to gain release from all stress and danger not the path of those headed downward to the depths of hell blind and in the dark by day and by night their minds consumed by all things lowly and vile
The Noble Ones in the time of the Buddha practiced in earnest
With the words 'I go to the Buddha for refuge' or 'I go to the Sangha for refuge' we should reflect on their Dhamma investigating and unraveling it so as to see the profundity and subtlety of their practice
At the same time we should take their realizations into our hearts as good examples to follow so that we can conduct ourselves in the footsteps of their practices and realizations
'I go to the Buddha for refuge' We all know how difficult it was for him to become the Buddha
We should engrave it in our hearts
Our Teacher was the first pioneer in our age to the good destination for the sake of all living beings
Things were never made easy for him
From the day of his renunciation to the day of his Awakening it was as if he were in hell  there's no need to compare it to being in prison  because he had been very delicately brought up in his royal home
When he renounced the household life he faced great difficulties in terms of the four necessities
In addition there were many many defilements in his heart related to his treasury and to the nation filled with his royal subjects
It weighed heavily on his heart at all times that he had to leave these things behind
He found no comfort or peace at all except when he was sound asleep
As for us we don't have a following don't have subjects have never been kings
We became ordained far more easily than the Buddha
And when we make the effort of the practice we have his teachings correct in their every aspect as our guide
Our practice isn't really difficult like that of the Buddha who had to struggle on his own with no one to guide him
On this point we're very different
We have a much lighter burden in the effort of the practice than the Buddha who was of royal birth
Food wherever we go is full to overflowing thanks to the faith of those who are already convinced of the Buddha's teachings and are not lacking in interest and faith for those who practice rightly
For this reason monks  wherever they go  are not lacking in the four necessities of life which is very different from the case of the Buddha
All of the Noble Disciples who followed in the Buddha's footsteps were second to him in terms of the difficulties they faced
They had a much easier time as regards the four necessities of life because people by and large had already begun to have faith and conviction in the teachings
But even so the disciples didn't take pleasure in the four necessities more than in the Dhamma in making the singleminded effort to gain release from suffering and stress
This is something very pleasing something very worthy to be taken as an example
They gave their hearts their lives  every part of themselves  in homage to the Buddha and Dhamma to the point where they all became homage to the Sangha within themselves
In doing so they all encountered difficulties every one of them
Because the Dhamma is something superior and superlative whoever meets it has to develop and prosper through its power day by day step by step to a state of superlative excellence
As for the defilements there is no type of defilement that can take anyone to peace security or excellence of any kind
The defilements know this
They know that the Dhamma far excels them so they disguise themselves thoroughly to keep us from knowing their tricks and deceits
In everything we do they have to lie behind the scenes showing only their tactics and strategies which are nothing but means of fooling living beings into falling for them and staying attached to them
This is very ingenious on their part
For this reason those who make the effort of the practice are constantly bending under their gravitational pull
Whether we are doing sitting meditation walking meditation  whatever our posture  we keep bending and leaning under their pull
They pull us toward laziness and lethargy
They pull us toward discouragement and weakness
They pull us into believing that our mindfulness and discernment are too meager for the teachings of the religion
They pull us into believing that our capacities are too meager to deserve the Dhamma to deserve the paths fruitions and nibbana or to deserve the Buddha's teachings
All of these things are the tactics of the pull of defilement to draw us solely into failure away from the Dhamma
If we don't practice the Dhamma so as to get above these things we won't have any sense at all that they are all deceits of defilement
When we have practiced so as to get beyond them step by step though they won't be able to remain hidden
No matter how sharp and ingenious the various kinds of defilement may be they don't lie beyond the power of mindfulness and discernment
This is why the Buddha saw causes and effects benefits and harm in a way that went straight to his heart because of his intelligence that transcended defilement
For this reason when he taught the Dhamma to the world he did so with full compassion so that living beings could truly escape from danger from the depths of the world so full of suffering
He wanted the beings of the world to see the marvelousness the awesomeness of the Dhamma that had had such an impact within his heart so that they too would actually see as he did
This is why his proclamation of the Dhamma was done in full measure for it was based on his benevolence
He didn't proclaim it with empty pronouncements or as empty ceremony
That sort of thing didn't exist in the Buddha
Instead he was truly filled with benevolence for the living beings of the world
His activities as Buddha  the five duties of the Buddha we are always hearing about  he never abandoned except for the few times he occasionally set them aside in line with events
But even though he set them aside it wasn't because he had set his benevolence aside
He set them aside in keeping with events and circumstances
For example when he spent the rains alone in the Prileyya Forest he had no following and none of the monks entered the forest to receive instruction from him which meant that this activity was set aside
Other than that though he performed his duties to the full because of his benevolence with nothing lacking in any way
This is a matter of his having seen things clearly in his heart the harm of all things dangerous and the benefits of all things beneficial
The Buddha had touched and known them in every way which is why he had nothing to doubt
His teaching of the Dhamma regarding harms and benefits was thus done in full measure
He analyzed harm into all its branches
He analyzed benefits into all their branches and completely revealed the differing degrees of benefits they gave
The beings of the world who had lived drearily with suffering and stress for untold aeons and were capable of learning of the excellence of the Dhamma from the Buddha How could they remain complacent
Once they had heard the teachings of the religion truly resonating in their very own ears and hearts  because of the truth the honesty the genuine compassion of the Buddha  they had to wake up
The beings of the world had to wake up
They had to accept the truth
That truth is of two kinds
The truth on the side of harm is one kind of truth It really is stressful and the origin of stress really creates stress to burn the hearts of living beings
As for the path it really creates ease and happiness for living beings
Those who listened to these truths listened with all their hearts
This being the case the strength of will they developed their conviction and their clear vision of both harm and benefits all gathered to become a strength permeating the one heart of each person
So why shouldn't these things reveal their full strength and manifest themselves as persistence effort earnestness and determination in every activity for the sake of gaining release from all dangers and adversity by means of the Dhamma
This is why the disciples who heard the Dhamma from the Buddha from the mouth of the foremost Teacher felt inspired and convinced
Many of them even came to see the Dhamma and gain release from suffering and stress step by step to the point of absolute release right there in the Buddha's presence
As we've seen the texts say When the Buddha was explaining the Dhamma for the sake of those who could be taught his followers  such as the monks  attained the Dhamma to ultimate release nibbana in no small numbers
This is what happens when truth meets with truth
They fit together easily with no difficulty at all
Those who listened did so by really seeing the benefits and harm really convinced by the reasons of the Dhamma taught by the Buddha which is why they gained clear results right then and there
The Dhamma  both the harm and benefits that the Buddha explained in his day and age and that existed in the hearts of his listeners in that day and age In what way is it different from the truths existing in our hearts at present
They're all the same nature of truth the same Noble Truths
They don't lie beyond the four Noble Truths either in the Buddha's time or in the present
The Buddha's instructions were the truth of the path teaching people to have virtue concentration and discernment so that they could truly understand the affairs of stress straight to the heart and remove the cause of stress which is a thorn or a spear stabbing the heart of living beings creating suffering and stress that go straight to the heart as well
The truth of stress exists in our bodies and minds
The truth of the origin of stress reveals itself blatantly in our hearts in our every activity
What can reveal itself only intermittently or not at all is the path  even though we are listening to it right now
What is the path
Mindfulness and discernment
Right View and Right Attitude These things refer to the levels of discernment
If we add Right Mindfulness then when we have these three qualities nourishing the heart Right Concentration will arise because of our right activities
Right Activity for those who are to extricate themselves from stress refers primarily to the work of removing defilement  for example the work of sitting and walking meditation the work of guarding the heart with mindfulness using mindfulness and discernment continually to investigate and contemplate the different kinds of good and bad things making contact with us at all times
This is called building the path within the heart
When we bring the path out to contend with our adversary  the origin of stress  what facet is the adversary displaying
The facet of love
What does it love
What exactly is the object it loves
Here we focus mindfulness and discernment in on unraveling the object that's loved
What is the object in actuality
Unravel it so as to see it through and through being really intent in line with the principles of mindfulness and discernment
Reflect back and forth again and again so as to see it clearly
The object that's loved or lovable will fade away of its own accord because of our discernment
Mindfulness and discernment wash away all the artifice all that is counterfeit in that socalled love step by step until it is all gone
This is the discernment we build up in the heart to wash away all the artifices all the filth with which the defilements plaster things inside and out
Outside they plaster these things on sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations
Inside they plaster them on labels  sañña  that go out our eyes They plaster things beginning with our eyes ears nose tongue and body stage by stage
There's nothing but the plaster of defilement
When we meet with these things seeing them or hearing them sañña  labels and interpretations  and sankhara  thoughtformations  appear in the mind
These continue plastering layer on layer
For this reason we must use discernment to investigate
Whatever is plastered outside wash that plastering away
Then turn around to wash away the plastering inside
When we have seen these things clearly with discernment how can discernment help but turn to find the important culprit the deceiver inside
It has to turn inside
In using mindfulness and discernment this is how we must use them
When we investigate this is how we investigate  and we do it earnestly
This is Right Activity in the area of the practice
Right Speech As I've said before we speak in line with the ten topics of effacement
We don't bring matters of the world politics commerce matters of women and men matters of defilement and craving to converse among ourselves so as to become distracted and conceited piling on more defilement and stress in line with the things we discuss
With the topics of effacement  that's what the Buddha called them  we speak of things that will strengthen our will to make persistent effort making us convinced and inspired with the Dhamma
At the same time these topics are warnings against heedlessness and means of washing away the various kinds of defilement when we hear them from one another
This is Right Speech in the area of the practice
Right Livelihood Feed your heart with Dhamma
Don't bring in poison  greed anger delusion or lust  to feed the heart for these things will be toxic burning the heart and making it far more troubled than any poisonous substances could
Try to guard your heart well with mindfulness and discernment
The savor of the Dhamma beginning with concentration as its basis will appear as peace and calm within the heart in proportion to the levels of concentration
Then use discernment to unravel the various things that the mind labels and interprets so as to see them clearly step by step
This is called Right Livelihood  guarding the heart rightly feeding it correctly with the nourishment of the Dhamma and not with the various kinds of defilement craving and mental effluents that are like poisons burning the heart
Reduce matters to these terms meditators
This is called Right Livelihood in the practice of meditation
Right Effort as I've said before means persistence in abandoning all forms of evil
This covers everything we've said so far
The Buddha defines this as persistence in four areas or of four sorts but since I've already explained this many times I'll pass over it here
Right Mindfulness What does the Buddha have us keep in mind
All the things that will remove defilement
For example he has us keep the four frames of reference in mind being mindful as we investigate the body being mindful as we investigate feelings being mindful as we investigate the mind being mindful as we investigate phenomena that involve the mind arise in the mind arise and then vanish vanish and then arise matters of past and future appearing in the present all the time
We keep investigating in this way
If we investigate so as to make the mind progress in tranquillity meditation Right Mindfulness means using mindfulness to supervise our mental repetition
From there it turns into Right Concentration within the heart
This is called building the Dhamma building tools for clearing our way loosening the things that bind and constrict the heart so that we can make easy progress so that we aren't obstructed and blocked by the force of the things I have mentioned
Only the religion or only the Dhamma can remove and scatter all the things that have bound us for countless aeons clearing them away so that we can make easy progress
When the mind is centered in concentration then confusion and turmoil are far away
The mind is still and dwells in comfort and ease
When the mind develops discernment from investigating and contemplating the things that obstruct it it makes easy progress
The sharper its discernment the wider the path it can clear for itself
Its going is smooth
Easy
It advances by seeing and knowing the truth without being deluded or deceiving itself
Genuine discernment doesn't deceive itself but instead makes smooth progress
It unravels all the things that obstruct it  our various attachments and misconstruings  so as to see them thoroughly as if it were slashing away the obstacles in its path so that it can progress step by step as I've already explained to you
The most important basis for its investigation is the body
Bodies outside or the body inside investigate them carefully and thoroughly for they're all Noble Truths
They're all the path both inside and out
Investigate and unravel them so as to see them clearly  and while you're investigating them don't concern yourself with any other work more than with the work of investigation
Use discernment to investigate in order really to know really to see these things as they are and uproot the counterfeit labels and assumptions that say that they're pretty and beautiful lovely and attractive
Investigate so as to penetrate to the truth that there is nothing at all beautiful or attractive about them
They're thoroughly filthy and repulsive your body and the bodies of others all without exception
They're all filled with filthy and repulsive things
If you look in line with the principles of the truth that's how they are
Discernment investigates peering inward so as to see clear through  from the skin outside on into the inside which is putrid with all kinds of filth  for the sake of seeing clearly exactly what is pretty what is beautiful what is lovely and attractive
There's nothing of the sort in any body
There are only the lying defilements that have planted these notions there
When we have really investigated on in we see that these notions are all false
The genuine truth is that these bodies aren't pretty or beautiful
They're nothing but repulsive
When they fall apart what are they
When they fall apart earth is earth  because earth is what it already was when it was still in the body
The properties of water wind and fire were already water wind and fire when they were in the body
When the body falls apart where do these things ever become gods and Brahmas heaven and nibbana
They have to be earth water wind and fire in line with their nature
This is how discernment investigates and analyzes so as to see clearly
This is how we use clearseeing discernment to clear away the things obstructing and distorting our vision
Now there's no more such thing as being constricted or blocked
Our discernment if we use it has to be discernment all the day long
Wherever discernment penetrates it sees clearly clears away its doubts and lets go step by step until it lets go once and for all from having known thoroughly
Once it has investigated blatant things so as to know them clearly where will the mind then go
Once it has investigated blatant things and known them clearly it's as if it has completely uprooted the blatant defilements that have planted thorns in different objects such as our own body
So now where will the defilements go
Will they fly away
They can only shrink inward to find a hiding place when they are chased inside and attacked by mindfulness and discernment
Feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance These are simply individual conditions by their nature but they are under the control of defilement
Defilement is the basis from which they spring so it has to regard itself as being in charge
It uses labels to make them defilement
It forms thoughtformations so as to make them defilement
It cognizes and takes note so as to make these things defilement
However many feelings arise it makes them all defilement
Defilement can't make things into Dhamma
It has to be defilement all the day long
This is how it builds itself in its various branches
So
Investigate on in
Slash on in
Feelings of pleasure and pain They exist both in the body and in the mind
Feeling isn't defilement
If we look in line with the principles of nature it's simply a reality
The assumption that 'I'm pained' or 'I'm pleased'  delusion with pain delusion with pleasure delusion with feelings of indifference in the body and mind These things are defilement
The assumptions and delusions are defilement
When we really investigate inward the various feelings aren't defilement these four mental phenomena aren't defilement
Once we've spotted our assumptions and construings they retreat inward
The feelings that still exist in the body and mind even though they aren't yet thoroughly understood are still greatly lightened
We begin to gain an inkling of their ways step by step
We're not deluded to the point of complete blindness as we were before we investigated
Whichever aspects of feeling are blatant and associated with the body we know clearly
We can let go of bodily feelings
We can understand them
As for feelings remaining in the mind for the most part they're refined feelings of pleasure
We know and let go of them in the same way when the path gains power
These feelings of pleasure are like fish in a trap No matter what there's no way they can escape getting cooked
They can't swim down into large ponds and lakes as they used to
They can only sit waiting for their dying day
The same holds true for the refined feeling of pleasure  which is a conventional reality  within the heart
It can only wait for the day it will be disbanded as a convention when the ultimate ease which is not a convention comes to rule the heart through the complete penetration of mindfulness and discernment
So investigate on in until you understand reaching the point of letting go with no more concerns
What is sañña labeling
Labeling this labeling that making assumptions about this and that These are all affairs of defilement using sañña
When cognizance takes note it too is turned into defilement
So we investigate these things using discernment in the same way as when we investigate feelings
We then understand
When we understand these things become simply cognizance taking note simply sañña labeling without labeling so as to be defilement without taking note so as to be defilement
Defilement then retreats further and further inward
Ultimately these five issues  namely the physical khandha our body the vedana khandha feelings in the body the sañña khandha the sankhara khandha and the viññana khandha  are all clearly known in the heart with no more doubts
The defilements gather inward converge inward
They can't go out roaming because they'll get slashed to bits by mindfulness and discernment
So they have to withdraw inward to find a hiding place
This in actuality is what the investigation is like and not otherwise
In our investigation as meditators when discernment reaches any particular level we'll know for ourselves step by step
Both defilement and discernment We'll know both sides at the same time
When discernment is very strong defilement grows weaker
Mindfulness and discernment become even more courageous and unflinching
The words laziness and lethargy which are affairs of defilement disappear
We keep moving in with persistence day and night
This is the way it is when the path gains strength
As meditators you should take note of this and practice so as to know it and see it so as to make it your own treasure arising in your heart
Your doubts will then be ended in every way
We now take this atomic mindfulness and discernment and shoot it into the central point of conventional reality the point that causes living beings to founder in the wheel of the cycle so that they can't find their way out don't know the way out don't know the ways of birth don't know who has been born as what where they have died what burdens of suffering and stress they have carried
Mindfulness and discernment go crashing down into that point until it is scattered to pieces
And so now how can we not know what it is that has caused us to take birth and die
There is only defilement that is the important seed causing us to take birth and die causing us to suffer pain and stress
The true Dhamma hasn't caused us to suffer
It has brought us nothing but pleasure and ease in line with its levels in line with the levels of what is noble and good
The things that give rise to major and minor sufferings are all affairs of defilement
We can see this clearly
We can know this clearly
Especially when defilement has been completely scattered from the heart it's as if the earth and sky collapse
How can this not send a tremor through the three levels of the cosmos
 because this thing is what has wandered throughout the three levels of the cosmos
When it has been made to collapse within the heart what is the heart like now
How does the outer space of the Dhamma differ from the outer space of the world
Now we know clearly
The outer space of this purified mind Is it annihilation
The outer space of the world isn't annihilation
If it were annihilation they wouldn't call it outer space
It's a nature that exists in line with the principles of its nature as outer space
The outer space of the mind released from all forms of gravitational pull ie conventional reality What is it like
Even though we've never known it before when we come to know it we won't have any doubts
Even though we've never seen it before when we come to see it we won't have any doubts
Even though we've never experienced it before when we come to experience it we won't have any doubts
We won't have to search for witnesses to confirm it the way we do with conventions in general
It's sanditthiko  immediately apparent  and only this fits perfectly with our heart and that outer space mind
This is what we referred to at the beginning when we talked about the outer space of the world and the outer space of the mind
The outer space of the mind  the mind of nibbana  is like that
Just where is it annihilated
Who experiences the outer space of the mind
If it were annihilation who could experience it
As for where it will or won't be reborn we already know that there's no way for it to be reborn
We know this clearly
We've removed every defilement or conventional reality that would lead to rebirth
Conventional reality is the same thing as defilement
All things  no matter how subtle  that have been dangers to the heart for such a long time have been completely destroyed
All that remains is the pure outer space of the mind the mind that is pure
You can call it outer space you can call it anything at all because the world has its conventions so we have to make differentiations to use in line with the conventions of the world so as not to conflict
When we reach the level of the outer space mind how does it feel for the mind to have been coerced oppressed and subject to the pull of all things base and vile full of stress and great sufferings for aeons and aeons
We don't have to reflect on how many lifetimes it's been
We can take the principle of the present as our evidence
Now the mind is released
We've seen how much suffering there has been and now we've abandoned it once and for all
We've absolutely destroyed its seeds beginning with 'avijjapaccaya sankhara'  'With unawareness as condition there occur mental formations' All that remains is 'avijjayatveva asesaviraganirodha' sankharanirodho'  'Simply with the disbanding of unawareness with no remaining passion thoughtformations disband' That's the outer space of the mind
The mind released from all gravitational forces Even though it's still alive and directing the khandhas there's nothing to bar its thoughts its vision its knowledge
There's nothing to obstruct it nothing to make it worried or relieved nothing to make it brave nothing to make it afraid
It is simply its own nature by itself always independent in that way
For this reason knowledge of all truths has to be completely open to this unobstructed and unoppressed mind
It can know and see
If we speak of matters related to the body and khandhas we can speak in every way without faltering because there's nothing to hinder us
Only the defilements are what kept us from seeing what we saw and from describing the things we should have been able to describe because we didn't know we didn't see
What we knew was bits and pieces
We didn't know the full truth of these various things
When this was the case how could we know clearly
How could we speak clearly
All we knew was bits and pieces so when we spoke it had to be bits and pieces as well
But once we've shed these things everything is wide open
The mind is free vast and empty without limits without bounds
There's nothing to enclose or obscure it
When we know we really know the truth
When we see we really see the truth
When we speak we can speak the truth
You can call the mind brave or notbrave as you like because we speak in line with what we experience what we know and see so why can't we speak
We can know we can see so why can't we speak
 for these things exist as they have from the beginning
When the Buddha proclaimed the Dhamma to the world he took the things that existed and that he saw in line with what he had known  everything of every sort  and proclaimed them to the world
Think of how broad it was the knowledge of the Buddha how subtle and profound  because nothing was concealed or mysterious to him
Everything was completely opened to him
This is why he's called lokavidu  one who knows the world clearly  through the vastness of his mind that had nothing to enclose or conceal it at all
Aloko udapadi 'Brightness arose' His mind was bright toward the truth both by day and by night
This is how the Buddha knew
The Noble Disciples all knew in the same way except that his range and theirs differed in breadth
But as for knowing the truth it was the same for them all
Here we've described both the benefits and the harm of the things involved with the mind  in other words both the Dhamma and the defilements  for you as meditators to listen to and contemplate in earnestness
So
Let's try to develop our minds so as to shoot out beyond this world of conventional realities to see what it's like
Then we won't have to ask where the Buddha is how many Buddhas there have been whether the Noble Disciples really exist or how many they are  because the one truth that we know and see clearly in our hearts resonates to all the Buddhas all the Noble Disciples and all the Dhamma that exists
We won't have any doubts because the nature that knows and exists within us contains them all all the Buddhas the community of Noble Disciples and all the Dhamma that exists
It's a nature just right in its every aspect with nothing for us to doubt
This is the place  if we speak in terms of place  where we run out of doubts about everything of every sort
We oversee the khandhas which are simply conventions of the world just as all the Noble Disciples do while they are still living
As for the mind it has gained release and remains released in that way
As we have said even though it remains in the midst of the world of conventions this nature is its own nature and those other things are their own affairs
Each is a separate reality that doesn't mingle join or have an effect on the others
When we say release from the world this is what we mean
All of the Dhammas I have mentioned here When do they exist
And when don't they exist
The Dhamma exists at all times and in all places
It's akaliko timeless
So I ask that you penetrate into the Dhamma of these four Noble Truths
You'll be right on target with the results of the Buddha and the Noble Disciples and there's no doubt but that you'll be right on target with the results of the Buddha's and the Noble Disciples' work
Their workplace is in these four Noble Truths and the results that come from the work are the paths fruitions and nibbana
They arise right here
They're located right here
When we have practiced and reached them fully and completely there will be nothing for us to question
This is why there won't be any reason to doubt the time of the Buddha as compared to our own time as to whether the Dhamma of the Buddha was different because the defilements are now different from what they were then
The defilements then and now are all of the same sort
The Dhamma is all of the same sort
If we cure defilement in the same way we're bound to gain release in the same way
There is no other way to gain release no matter what the day and age
There is only this one way following the way of the path beginning with virtue concentration and discernment to eliminate defilement the cause of stress  in particular craving for sensuality craving for becoming and craving for no becoming  completely from the heart
As for nirodha the cessation of stress When defilement is disbanded from where will any more suffering or stress arise
When defilement and stress are disbanded for good that's the outer space of the mind
As for the Noble Truths they're activities or our workplace
The result that comes from these four Noble Truths is something else entirely
As I've always been telling you What is it that knows that stress and the cause of stress disband
When the path has performed its duties to the full and has completely wiped out the cause of stress then nirodha  the cessation of stress  appears in full measure after which it disbands as well because it too is a conventional reality
As for the one who knows that the cause of stress has disbanded by being eradicated through the path so as to give rise to the cessation of stress The one who knows this is the pure one  the outer space of the mind  and that's the end of the matter
So investigate carefully
Listen carefully when you listen to the Dhamma while putting it to use
When we work we can't let go of our tools
For instance if we're working with an ax the ax has to be at hand
If we're working with a knife the knife has to be at hand
If we're working with a chisel the chisel has to be at hand
But when we've finished our work we let go of our chisel we let go of our various tools
So here the virtue concentration and discernment that are called the path are our tools in the work of eliminating defilement
We have to keep them right at hand while we are working
When we have eliminated defilement until it's completely defeated and nothing is left these tools are phenomena that let go of themselves of their own accord without our having to force them
As I've always been saying the teachings on inconstancy stress and notself are our path
We can't let go of them
We have to investigate things with mindfulness and discernment so as to see them clearly in line with the principles of inconstancy stress and notself
Once we're ready and we've run the full course we let go of these principles in line with the truth
We don't call anything notself
Each thing is a separate reality with no quarreling
This is the Dhamma It has many stages many levels so those who listen have to make distinctions because in this talk I've discussed many stages on many levels back and forth so as to make things plain for those listening
To summarize The marketplace of the paths fruitions and nibbana is located in the Noble Truths
It isn't located anywhere else
So whatever else make sure that you attain them
Accelerate your efforts to the full extent of your ability
Use all the mindfulness and discernment you have to contemplate and investigate things in order to see them clearly
See what it's like to set them spinning as a wheel of Dhamma which the Buddha has described as supermindfulness and superdiscernment
When we start out practicing how can they immediately become supermindfulness and superdiscernment
When children are born they don't immediately become adults
They have to be nourished and guarded and cared for
Think of how much it takes how much it costs for each child to become an adult as we all have
Mindfulness and discernment need to be nourished and guarded in just the same way
When we nourish and guard them unceasingly unflaggingly they grow bold and capable until they become supermindfulness and superdiscernment
Then they attack the defilements  no matter what the sort  until the defilements are slashed to pieces with nothing left so that we attain purity  release and nibbana  within our own heart which will then have the highest value
Whether or not anyone else confers titles on it we ourselves don't confer titles
We've reached sufficiency so what is there to gain by conferring titles
All that's left is the gentleness and tenderness of purity blended into one with benevolence
The entire mind is filled with benevolence
The Buddha taught the beings of the world through his benevolence
His mind was completely gentle toward every living being in the three levels of the cosmos
He didn't exalt or demean any of them at all
'Sabbe satta'  'May all living beings who are fellows in suffering birth aging illness and death'  'avera hontu'  'be free from enmity' all the way to 'sukhi attanam pariharantu'  'may they maintain themselves with ease' That was his benevolence
He gave equality to all living beings
He didn't lean because his mind didn't have anything to lean
It didn't have any defilements infiltrating it that could make it lean
The things leaning this way and that are all affairs of defilement
When there's pure Dhamma the mind keeps its balance with pure fairness so there's no leaning
It's a principle of nature that stays as it is
So I ask that you all take this and earnestly put it into practice
Gain release so as to see it clearly in your heart
How do they compare this heart as it's currently coerced and oppressed and the heart when it has attained release from coercion and oppression
How do they differ in value
Come to see this clearly in your own heart
You won't see it anywhere else
Sanditthiko It's immediately apparent within the person who practices
So then
This seems to be enough explanation for now
The search for inner wealth is much the same as the search for outer wealth
In searching for outer wealth intelligent people have no problems They can find it easily
But stupid people have lots of difficulties
Look around and you'll see that poor people are many while rich people are few
This shows that stupid people are many while intelligent people are few which is why there are more poor people than rich people
In the search for inner wealth  virtue and goodness  the same holds true It depends more on ingenuity than on any other factor
If we're stupid then even if we sit right at the hem of the Buddha's robe or the robe of one of his Noble Disciples the only result we'll get will be our own stupidity
To gain ingenuity or virtue from the Buddha or his Noble Disciples is very difficult for a stupid person because inner wealth depends on ingenuity and intelligence
If we have no ingenuity we won't be able to find any inner wealth to provide happiness and ease for the heart
External wealth is something we're all familiar with
Money material goods living things and things without life All of these things are counted as wealth
They are said to belong to whoever has rights over them
The same holds true with the virtue and goodness we call merit
If unintelligent people search for merit and try to develop virtue and goodness like the people around them the results will depend on their ingenuity and stupidity
If they have little ingenuity they'll gain little merit
As for those of us who have ordained in the Buddha's religion our aim is to develop ourselves so as to gain release from suffering and stress just like a person who aims singlemindedly at being a millionaire
People in the world have basically three sorts of attitudes
The first sort Some people are born in the midst of poverty and deprivation because their parents are ignorant with no wealth at their disposal
They make their living by begging
When they wake up in the morning they go begging from house to house street to street sometimes getting enough to eat sometimes not
Their children fall into the same 'kamma current'
That's the kind of potential they've developed so they have to be born to impoverished parents of that sort
They just don't have it in them to think of being millionaires like those in the world of the wealthy
The parents to whom they are born act as a mould so they are lazy and ignorant like their parents
They live in suffering with their parents and go out begging with them sometimes eating their fill sometimes not
But this is still better than other sorts of people
Some parents are not only poor but also earn their living by thievery and robbery
Whatever they get to feed their children they tell their children what it is and where it came from
The children get this sort of education from their parents and grow up nourished by impure things  things gained through dishonesty thievery and robbery  so when they grow up they don't have to think of looking for work or for any education at the age when they should be looking for learning because they've already received their education from their parents education in stealing cheating thievery and robbery laziness and crookedness
This is because their parents have acted as blackboards covered with writing their actions and the manners of their every movement
Every child born to them receives training in how to act to speak and to think
Everything is thus an education from the parents because the writing and teachings are all there on the blackboard of the parents
Laziness dishonesty deceit thievery Every branch of evil is there in the writing on the blackboard
The children learn to read to draw to write all from their parents and fill themselves with the sort of knowledge that has the world up in flames
As they begin to grow up they take over their parents' duties by pilfering this and that until they gradually become hoodlums creating trouble for society at large
This is one of the major fires burning away at society without stop
The reasons that people can be so destructive on a large scale like this can come either from their parents from their own innate character or from associating with evil dishonest people
This is the sort of attitude found in people of one sort
The second sort of people have the attitude that even though they won't be millionaires they will still have enough to eat and to use like people in general and that they will be good citizens like the rest of society so that they can maintain a decent reputation
People of this sort are relatively hardworking and rarely lazy
They have enough possessions to get by on a level with the general run of good citizens
When they have children the children take their parents as examples as writing on the blackboard from which they learn their work their behavior and all their manners
Once they gain this knowledge from their parents they put it to use and become good citizens themselves with enough wealth to get by without hardships able to keep up with the world so that they don't lose face or cause their families any shame
They can relate to the rest of society with confidence and without being a disgrace to their relatives or to society in general
They behave in line with their ideals until they become good citizens with enough wealth to keep themselves out of poverty
These are the attitudes of the second sort of people
The third sort of people have attitudes that differ from those of the first two sorts in that they're determined no matter what to possess more wealth than anyone else in the world
They are headed in this direction from the very beginning because they have earned the opportunity to be born in families rich in virtue and material wealth
They learn ingenuity and industriousness from their parents because their parents work hard at commerce and devote themselves fully to all their business activities
Whatever the parents do the children will have to see
Whatever the parents say with regard to their work inside or outside the home near or far the children  who are students by nature  will have to listen and take it to heart because the children are not only students but also their parents' closest and most trusted helpers
The parents can't overlook them
Eventually they become the supervisors of the parents' workers inside and outside the home and in all the businesses set up by their parents
In all of the activities for which the parents are responsible the children will have to be students and workers at the same time keeping an eye and an ear out to observe and contemplate what is going on around them
All activities whether in the area of the world such as commerce or in the area of the Dhamma  such as maintaining the precepts chanting and meditating  are things the children will have to study and pick up from their parents
Thus parents shouldn't be complacent in their good and bad activities acting as they like and thinking that the children won't be able to pick things up from them
This sort of attitude is not at all fitting because the way people treat and mistreat the religion and the nation's institutions comes from what they learn as children
Don't think that it comes from anywhere else for no one has ever put old people in school
We should thus realize that children begin learning the principles of nature step by step from the day they are born until their parents send them for formal schooling
The principles of nature are everywhere so that anyone who is interested  child or adult  can study them at any time unlike formal studies and book learning which come into being at some times and change or disappear at others
For this reason parents are the most influential mould for their children in the way they look after them give them love and affection and provide their education both in the principles of nature and in the basic subjects that the children should pick up from them
This is because all children come ready to learn from the adults and the other children around them
Whether they will be good children or bad depends on the knowledge they pick up from around them
When this is stored up in their hearts it will exert pressure on their behavior making it good or bad as we see all around us
This comes mainly from what they learn of the principles of nature which are rarely taught in school but which people pick up more quickly than anything that schoolteachers teach
Thus parents and teachers should give special attention to every child for whom they are responsible
Even when parents put their children to work helping with the buying and selling at home the children are learning the livelihood of buying and selling from their parents  picking up along the way their parents' strong and weak points
We can see this from the way children pick up the parents' religion
However good or bad right or wrong the religion may be  even if it's worshipping spirits  the children are bound to pick up their parents' beliefs and practices
If the parents cherish moral virtue the children will follow their example cherishing moral virtue and following the practices of their parents
This third sort of person is thus very industrious and hardworking and so reaps better and more outstanding results than the other two sorts
When we classify people in this way we can see that people of the first sort are the laziest and most ignorant
At the same time they make themselves disreputable and objects of the scorn of good people in general
People of the second sort are fairly hardworking and fairly welloff while those of the third sort are determined to be wealthier than the rest of the world and at the same time are very hardworking because since they have set their sights high they can't just sit around doing nothing
They are very persevering and very persistent in their work going all out to find ways to earn wealth devoting themselves to their efforts and to being ingenious circumspect and uncomplacent in all their activities
People of this sort even if they don't become millionaires are important and deserve to be set up as good examples for the people of the nation at large
We monks fall into the same three sorts
The first sort includes those who are ordained only in name only as a ceremony who don't aim for the Dhamma for reasonability or for what's good or right
They aim simply at living an easy life because they don't have to work hard like lay people
Once ordained they become very lazy and very wellknown for quarreling with their fellow monks
Instead of gaining merit from being ordained as most people might think they end up filling themselves and those around them with suffering and evil
The second sort of monk aims at what is reasonable
If he can manage to gain release from suffering that's what he wants
He believes that there is merit and so he wants it
He believes that there is evil so he wants really to understand good and evil
He is fairly hardworking and intelligent
He follows the teachings of the Dhamma and Vinaya well and so doesn't offend his fellow monks
He is interested in studying and diligently practicing the threefold training of virtue concentration and discernment
He takes instruction easily has faith in the principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya is intent on his duties and believes in what is reasonable
The third sort of monk becomes ordained out of a true sense of faith and conviction
Even if he may not have had much of an education from any teachers in the beginning once he has become ordained and gains instruction from his teachers or from the texts that give a variety of reasons showing how to act so as to head toward evil and how to strive so as to head toward the good he immediately takes it as a lesson for training himself
The more he studies from his teachers the stronger his faith and conviction grow to the point where he develops a firm singleminded determination to gain release from suffering and stress
Whether sitting standing walking or lying down he doesn't flag in his determination
He is always firmly intent on gaining release from suffering and stress
He's very persistent and hardworking
Whatever he does he does with his full heart aiming at reason aiming at the Dhamma
This third sort of monk is the uncomplacent sort
He observes the precepts for the sake of real purity and observes them with great care
He is uncomplacent both in training his mind in concentration and in giving rise to discernment
He is intent on training the basic mindfulness and discernment he already has as an ordinary runofthemill person so that they become more and more capable step by step making them the sort of mindfulness and discernment that can keep abreast of his every action until they become supermindfulness and superdiscernment capable of shedding all defilements and mental effluents from the heart
He thus becomes one of the amazing people of the religion earning the homage and respect of people at large
In the area of the world there are three sorts of people and in the area of the Dhamma there are three sorts of monks
Which of the three are we going to choose to be
When we come right down to it each of these three types refers to each of us because we can make ourselves into any of them making them appear within us  because these three types are simply for the purpose of comparison
When we refer them to ourselves we can be any of the three
We can be the type who makes himself vile and lazy with no interest in the practice of the Dhamma with no value at all or we can make ourselves into the second or third sort
It all depends on how our likes and desires will affect our attitudes in our thoughts words and deeds
Whichever type we want to be we should adapt our thoughts words and deeds to fit the type
The affairs of that sort of person will then become our own affairs because none of these sorts lies beyond us
We can change our behavior to fit in with any of the three
If we are going to be the third sort of person then no matter what we are sure to release ourselves from suffering and stress someday in the future or in this very lifetime
So be uncomplacent in all your activities mindful of your efforts and actions and discerning with regard to your affairs at all times
Don't let the activities of your thoughts words and deeds go straying down the wrong path
Try to train your mindfulness and discernment to stay involved with your activities at all times
To safeguard these sorts of things isn't as difficult as safeguarding external wealth because inner wealth stays with us which makes it possible to safeguard it
As a monk you have only one duty
When sitting be aware that you're sitting
Whatever issue you think about know that you're thinking
Don't assume that any issue comes from anywhere other than from a lapse of mindfulness in your own heart which makes wrong issues  from minor ones to major ones  start spreading to your own detriment
All of this comes from your own lack of watchfulness and restraint
It doesn't come from anything else
If you want to gain release from suffering and stress in this lifetime then see the dangers of your own errors your complacency and your lack of mindfulness
See them as your enemies
If in your eyes the currents of the mind that spin to give rise to the cravings and mental effluents termed the origin of stress are something good then you're sure to go under
Be quick to shed these things immediately
Don't let them lie fermenting in your heart
Those who see danger in the round of rebirth must see the danger as lying in the accumulation of defilement
Your duties in the practice are like the fence and walls of a house that protect you stage by stage from danger
In performing your duties that constitute the effort of the practice you have to keep your mindfulness with those duties and not let it lapse
Nourish your mindfulness and discernment so that they are always circumspect in all your affairs
Don't let them flow away on the habitual urges of the heart
You can then be sure that the affairs of the mind will not in any way lie beyond the power of your effort and control
So I ask that each of you be mindful  and don't let your mindfulness conjecture ahead or behind with thoughts of the past or future
Always keep it aware of your activities and you will be able to go beyond this mass of suffering and stress
Even if your mind hasn't yet attained stillness it will begin to be still through the power of mindfulness
There is no need to doubt this for the mind can't lie beyond the power of mindfulness and discernment coupled with persistent effort
Of the famous meditation masters of our present era Ven
Acariya Mun is the one I admire and respect the most
In my opinion he is the most outstanding teacher of our day and age
Living and studying with him I never saw him act in any way at odds with the Dhamma and Vinaya
His behavior was in such harmony with the Dhamma and Vinaya that it was never a cause for doubt among those who studied with him
From my experience in living with him I'd say that he was right in line with the path of those who practice rightly straightly methodically and nobly
He never strayed from this path at all
When he would tell us about the beginning stages of his practice he'd talk about how he had tried to develop mindfulness
He liked to live alone
If others were living with him they would get in the way of his meditation
If he could get away on his own he'd find that mindfulness and discernment were coupled with his efforts at all times
He would stay with his efforts both day and night
It was as if his hand was never free from its work
Mindfulness converged with his mind so that they were never willing to leave their endeavors
He had resolved never to return to this world of continual death and rebirth
No matter what he would have to gain release from suffering and stress in this lifetime and never ask to be reborn again
Even being born into this present lifetime had him disgusted enough but when he also saw the birth aging illness and death of human beings and living beings in general day and night together with the blatant sufferings caused by the oppression and cruelties of the strong over the weak it made him feel even greater dismay which is why he asked not to be reborn ever again
The way he asked not to be reborn was to take the effort of the practice as the witness within his heart
Wherever he lived he asked to live with the effort of the practice
He didn't want anything else that would delay his release from suffering
This is what he would tell us when the opportunity arose
Whatever knowledge or understanding he had gained in the various places he had lived he wouldn't keep from us
When he lived there his mind was like that when he lived here his mind was like this
He even told us about the time his mind realized the land of its hopes
The way each person's mind progresses is purely an individual matter
It's not something we can imitate from one another
Even the various realizations we have and the means of expression we use in teaching ourselves our fellow meditators and people in general have to be a matter of our own individual wealth in line with our habits and capabilities just as a millionaire with lots of wealth uses his own millionaire's wealth while a poor person with little wealth makes use of his own wealth
Each person no matter how rich or poor makes use of the wealth he or she has been able to accumulate
In the area of habits and capabilities how much we may possess depends entirely on ourselves
These aren't things we can borrow from one another
We have to depend on the capabilities we develop from within
This is why our habits manners and conversation our knowledge and intelligence our shallowness and depth differ from person to person in line with our capabilities
Even though I studied with Ven
Acariya Mun for a long time I can't guarantee that I could take his Dhamma as my own and teach it to others
All I can say is that I depend on however much my own knowledge and capabilities may be in line with my own strengths which is just right for me and doesn't overstep the bounds of what is fitting for me
As for Ven
Acariya Mun he was very astute at teaching
For example he wouldn't talk about the major points
He'd talk only about how to get there
As soon as he'd get to the major points he'd detour around them and reappear further on ahead
This is the way it would be every time
He was never willing to open up about the major points
At first I didn't understand what his intentions were in acting this way and it was only later that I understood
Whether I'm right or wrong I have to ask your forgiveness for he was very astute in keeping with the fact that he had taught so many students
There were two reasons why he wouldn't open up about the major points
One is that those who weren't really intent on the Dhamma would take his teachings as a shield claiming them to be their own as a way of advertising themselves and making a living
The other reason is that the Dhamma that was a principle of nature he had known and might describe was not something that could be conjectured about in advance
Once those who were strongly intent on the Dhamma reached those points in their investigation if they had heard him describe those points beforehand would be sure to have subtle assumptions or presuppositions infiltrating their minds at that moment and so they would assume that they understood that level of Dhamma when actually those assumptions would be a cause for selfdelusion without their even realizing it
As far as these two considerations are concerned I must admit that I'm very foolish because of my good intentions toward those who come intent on studying with me
I'm not the least bit secretive
I've revealed everything all along without holding anything back not even the things that should be held back
I've been open to the full extent of my ability which has turned into a kind of foolishness without my being aware of it
This has caused those who are really intent on studying with me to misunderstand latching onto these things as assumptions that turn into their enemies concealing the true Dhamma all because I may lack some circumspection with regard to this second consideration
Ven
Acariya Mun was very astute both in external and in internal matters
On the external level he wouldn't be willing to disclose things too readily
Sometimes after listening to him you'd have to take two or three days to figure out what he meant
This at least was the way things were for me
Whether or not this was the way they were for my fellow students I never had the chance to find out
But as for me I'd use all my strength to ponder anything he might say that seemed to suggest an approach to the practice and sometimes after three days of pondering the riddle of his words I still couldn't make heads or tails of it
I'd have to go and tell him 'What you said the other day I've been pondering it for three days and still can't understand what you meant
I don't know where to grab hold of it so that I can put it to use or how much meaning your words had'
He'd smile a bit and say 'Oh
So there's someone actually pondering what I say'
So I'd answer 'I'm pondering but pondering out of stupidity not with any intelligence'
He'd then respond a little by saying 'We all have to start out by being stupid
No one has ever brought intelligence or wealth along at birth
Only after we set our mind on learning and pondering things persistently can we become intelligent and astute to the point where we can gain wealth and status and can have other people depend on us
The same holds true with the Dhamma
No one has ever been a millionaire in the Dhamma or an arahant at birth'
That's all he would say
He wouldn't disclose what the right way would be to interpret the teaching that had preoccupied me for two or three days running
It was only later that I realized why he wouldn't disclose this
If he had disclosed it he would have been encouraging my stupidity
If we get used simply to having things handed to us readymade from other people without producing anything with our own intelligence then when the time comes where we're in a tight spot and can't depend on anything readymade from other people we're sure to go under if we can't think of a way to help ourselves
This is probably what he was thinking which is why he wouldn't solve this sort of problem when I'd ask him
Studying with him wasn't simply a matter of studying teachings about the Dhamma
You had to adapt and accustom yourself to the practices he followed until they were firmly impressed in your own thoughts words and deeds
Living with him a long time was the way to observe his habits practices virtues and understanding bit by bit day by day until they were solid within you
There was a lot of safety in living with him
By and large people who studied with him have received a great deal of trust and respect because he himself was all Dhamma
Those who lived with him were bound to pick up that Dhamma in line with their abilities
At the same time staying with him made you accustomed to being watchful and restrained
If you left him and were intent on the Dhamma you'd be able to take care of yourself using the various approaches you had gained from him
When you'd stay with him it was as if the paths fruitions and nibbana were right within reach
Everything you did was solid and got results step by step
But when you left him it wouldn't be that way at all
It would turn into the other side of the world If the mind didn't yet have a firm basis that's the way it would usually be
But if the mind had a firm basis  in other words if it had concentration and discernment looking after it  then you could benefit from living anywhere
If any doubts arose that you couldn't handle yourself you'd have to go running back to him for advice
Once he'd suggest a solution the problem would usually disappear in an instant as if he had cut it away for you
For me at least that's the way it would be
Sometimes I would have left him for only five or six days when a problem started bothering me and I couldn't stand to wait another two or three days
If I couldn't solve this sort of problem the moment it arose then the next morning I'd have to head right back to him because some of these problems could be very critical
Once they arose and I couldn't solve them myself I'd have to hurry back to him for advice
But other problems aren't especially critical
Even when they arise you can wait
Problems of this sort are like diseases
When some diseases arise there's no need to hurry for a doctor
But with other diseases if we can't get the doctor to come we have to go to the doctor ourselves
Otherwise our life will be in danger
When these critical sorts of problems arise if we can't handle them ourselves we have to hurry to find a teacher
We can't just leave them alone hoping that they'll go away on their own
The results that can come from these problems that we don't take to our teachers to solve At the very least we can become disoriented deluded or unbalanced at worst we can go crazy
When they say that a person's meditation 'crashes' it usually comes from this sort of problem that he or she doesn't know how to solve  isn't willing to solve  and simply lets fester until one of these two sorts of results appear
I myself have had these sorts of problems with my mind which is why I'm telling you about them so that you can know how to deal with them
The day Ven
Acariya Mun died I was filled with a strong sense of despair from the feeling that I had lost a mainstay for my heart because at the time there was still a lot of unsettled business in my heart and it was the sort of knowledge that wasn't willing to submit easily to anyone's approaches if they weren't right on target  the way Ven
Acariya Mun had been and that had given results  with the spots where I was stuck and that I was pondering
At the same time it was a period in which I was accelerating my efforts at full speed
So when Ven
Acariya Mun died I couldn't stand staying with my fellow students
My only thought was that I wanted to live alone
So I tried to find a place where I could stay by myself
I was determined that I would stay alone until every sort of problem in my heart had been completely resolved
Only then would I stay with others and accept students as the occasion arose
After Ven
Acariya Mun's death I went to bow down at his feet and then sat there reflecting with dismay for almost two hours my tears flowing into a pool at his feet
At the same time I was pondering in my heart the Dhamma and the teachings he had been so kind to give me during the eight years I had lived with him
Living together for such a long time as this even a husband and wife or parents and children who love one another deeply are bound to have some problems or resentments from time to time
But between Ven
Acariya Mun and the students who had come to depend on his sheltering influence for such a long time there had never been any issues at all
The longer I had stayed with him the more I had felt an unlimited love and respect for him
And now he had left me and all my wellintentioned fellow students
Anicca vata sankhara Formations  how inconstant they are
His body lay still looking noble and more precious than my life which I would have readily given up for his sake out of my love for him
My body was also still as I sat there but my mind was in agitation from a sense of despair and my loss of his sheltering influence
Both bodies were subject to the same principle of the Dhamma  inconstancy  and followed the teaching that says 'uppajjitva nirujjhanti' Having been born they are bound to die
There's no other way it could be
But as for Ven
Acariya Mun he had taken a path different from that of conventional reality in line with the teaching 'tesam vupasamo sukho' In their stilling is ease
He had died in this lifetime lying still for just this brief span of time so that his students could reflect with resignation on the Dhamma but from now on he would never be reborn to be a source for his students' tears again
His mind had now separated from becoming and birth in the same way that a rock split into two pieces can never be truly rejoined
So I sat there reflecting with despair
The problems in my heart that I had once unburdened with him With whom would I unburden them now
There was no longer anyone who could unburden and erase my problems the way he had
I was left to fend for myself
It was as if he had been a doctor who had cured my illnesses countless times and who was the one person with whom I had entrusted my life  and now the doctor who had given me life was gone
I'd have to become a beast of the forest for I had no more medicine to treat my inner diseases
While I was sitting there reminiscing sadly about him with love respect and despair I came to a number of realizations
How had he taught me while he was still alive
Those were the points I'd have to take as my teachers
What was the point he had stressed repeatedly
'Don't ever stray from your foundation namely what knows within the heart
Whenever the mind comes to any unusual knowledge or realizations that could become detrimental if you aren't able to investigate your way past that sort of knowledge then turn the mind back within itself and no matter what no damage will be done' That was what he had taught so I took hold of that point and continued to apply it in my own practice to the full extent of my ability
To be a senior monk comes from being a junior monk as we see all around us and will all experience
We all meet with difficulties whether we're junior or senior
This is the path we all must take
We must follow the path of difficulty that is the path toward progress both in the area of the world and in the area of the Dhamma
No one has ever become a millionaire by being lazy or by lying around doing nothing
To be a millionaire has to come from being persevering which in turn has to take the path of difficulty  difficulty for the sake of our proper aims
This is the path wealthy and astute people always follow
Even in the area of the Dhamma we should realize that difficulty is the path of sages on every level beginning with the Buddha himself
The Dhamma affirms this Dukkhassanantaram sukham  people gain ease by following the path of difficulty
As for the path to suffering sukhassanantaram dukkham  people gain difficulties by following the path of ease
Whoever is diligent and doesn't regard difficulty as an obstacle whoever explores without ceasing the conditions of nature all around him will become that third sort of person the sort who doesn't ask to be reborn in this world the sort who tesam vupasamo sukho  eradicates the seeds for the rebirth of any sort of formation experiencing an ease undisturbed by worldly baits an ease that is genuinely satisfying
So
I ask that all of you as meditators keep these three sorts of people in mind and choose for yourselves which of the three is the most outstanding within you right now  because we can all make ourselves outstanding with no need to fear that it will kill us
The effort to gain release from suffering and stress in the Lord Buddha's footsteps isn't an executioner waiting to behead the person who strives in the right direction
Be brave in freeing yourself from your bonds and entanglements
The stress and difficulties that come as a shadow of the khandhas are things that everyone has to bear as a burden
We can't lie to one another about this
Each person has to suffer from worries and stress because of his or her own khandhas
Know that the entire world has to suffer in the same way you do with the khandhas you are overseeing right now
Don't let yourself be content to cycle through birth aging illness and death
Be uncomplacent at all times
You shouldn't have any doubts about birth because the Buddha has already told us that birth and death are outandout suffering
Don't let yourself wonder if they are flowers or sweets or any sort of food you can eat to your satisfaction
Actually they are nothing but poison
They are things that have deceived us all in our stupidity to be born and to die in heaps in this world of suffering and stress
If we die in a state of humanity there's some hope for us because of the openings for rebirth we have made for ourselves through the power of our good deeds
But there are not just a few people out there who are foolish and deluded and who thus have no way of knowing what sorts of openings for rebirth their kamma will lead them to
So for this reason see the danger in repeated birth and death that can give no guarantees as to the state in which you'll take birth and die
If it's a human state as we see and are at present you can breathe easily to some extent but there's always the fear that you'll slip away to be reborn as a common animal for people to kill or beat until you're all battered and bruised
Now that's really something to worry about
If you die you die if you survive you live and breathe in fear and trembling dreading death with every moment
How many animals are dragged into the slaughterhouses every day
This is something we don't have to explain in detail
It's simply one example I mention to remind you of the sufferings of the living beings of the world
And where is there any shelter that can give a sure sense of security to the heart of each person overseeing his or her heap of life
As meditators we should calculate the profits and losses the benefits and drawbacks that come from the khandhas in each hour period of day and night
The discontent we feel from being constantly worried Isn't it caused by the khandhas
What makes us burdened and worried
We sit stand walk and lie down for the sake of the khandhas
We eat for the sake of the khandhas
Our every movement is simply for the sake of the khandhas
If we don't do these things the khandhas will have to break apart under the stress of suffering
All we can do is relieve things a little bit
When they can no longer take it the khandhas will break apart
Even though the earth rocks and mountains may be heavy they stay to themselves
They've never weighed us down or oppressed us with difficulties
Only these five khandhas have burdened and oppressed us with difficulties with their every movement
Right from the day the khandhas begin to form we have to be troubled with scurrying around for their sake
They wield tremendous power making the entire world bend under their sway until the day they fall apart
We could say that we are slaves to the khandhas from the day we're born to the day we die
In short what it all comes down to is that the source of all worries the source of all issues lies in the khandhas
They are the supreme commanders making us see things in line with their wants
This being the case how can anything wonderful come from them
Even the khandhas we will take on as a burden in our next birth will be the same sort of takingbirthanddying khandhas lording it over us and making us suffer all over again
So investigate these things until you can see them clearly with discernment
Of all the countless lifetimes you may have been through over the aeons take this present lifetime before you as your evidence in reviewing them all
Those who aren't complacent will come to know that khandhas in the past and khandhas that will appear in the future all have the same characteristics as the khandhas that exist with us in the present
All I ask is that you force your mind to stay in the frame of the three characteristics which are present throughout the body and mind at all times
No matter how wild and resistant the mind may be it can't withstand the strength of mindfulness and discernment backed up by persistent effort
As long as mindfulness and discernment aren't yet agile you have to force them but as soon as they gain enough strength to stand on their own they'll be like a fire and its light that always appear together
Once mindfulness and discernment have been trained to be authoritative then wherever you are you're mindful and discerning
It's not the case that you will always have to force them
They're like a child When it's first born it doesn't have the strength and intelligence to care for itself so its parents have to take on the duty of caring for it in every way until it matures and becomes able to survive on its own
The parents who used to look after it are then no longer burdened with that duty
The same holds true with mindfulness and discernment
They gain strength step by step from being trained without ceasing without letting them slide
They develop day by day until they become supermindfulness and superdiscernment at the stage where they perform their duties automatically
Then every sort of thing that used to be an enemy of the heart will be slain by supermindfulness and superdiscernment until nothing remains
All that remains is a heart entirely 'buddho' 'Dhammo' will become a marvel at that very same moment through the power of supermindfulness and superdiscernment
So I ask that all of you as meditators make the effort
See the burden of birth aging illness and death that lies ahead of you as being at least equal to the burden of birth aging illness and death present in living beings and formations all around you
It may even be more  who knows how much more
For this reason you should make sure that you gain release from it in this lifetime in a way clear to your own heart
Then wherever you live you'll be at your ease  with no need to bother with any more problems of birth or death anywhere at all  simply aware of this heart that is pure
I ask that you all contemplate this and strive with bravery in the threefold training of virtue concentration and discernment
The goal you set for yourself in that third sort of person will one day be you
There's no need to doubt this
That's enough for now so I'll ask to stop here
When we investigate we have to investigate over and over time and time again many many times until we understand and are fully sure
The mind will then let go of its own accord
There's no way we can try to force it to let go as long as we haven't investigated enough
It's like eating If we haven't reached the point where we're full we're not full
There's no way we can try to make ourselves full with just one or two spoonfuls
We have to keep on eating and then when we're full we stop of our own accord
We've had enough
The same holds true with investigating
When we reach the stage where we fully know we let go of our own accord all our attachments to the body feelings labels thoughtformations cognizance step by step until we finally penetrate with our discernment into the mind itself  the genuine revolving wheel the revolving mind  until it is smashed to pieces with nothing left
That's the point  that's the point where we end our problems in fighting with defilement
That's where they end  and our desire to go to nibbana ends right there as well
The desire to go to nibbana is part of the path
It's not a craving
The desire to gain release from suffering and stress is part of the path
It's not a craving
Desire has two sorts desire in the area of the world and desire in the area of the Dhamma
Desire in the area of the world is craving
Desire in the area of the Dhamma is part of the path
The desire to gain release from suffering to go to nibbana strengthens the Dhamma within us
Effort is the path
Persistence is the path
Endurance is the path
Perseverance in every way for the sake of release is the path
Once we have fully come into our own the desire will disappear  and at that point who would ask after nibbana
Once the revolving wheel the revolving mind has been smashed once and for all there is no one among any of those who have smashed that revolving mind from their hearts who wants to go to nibbana or who asks where nibbana lies
The word 'nibbana' is simply a name that's all
Once we have known and seen once we have attained the genuine article within ourselves what is there to question
This is what it means to develop the mind
We've developed it from the basic stages to the ultimate stage of development
So
Now no matter where we live we are sufficient unto ourselves
The mind has built a full sufficiency for itself so it can be at its ease anywhere at all
If the body is ill  aching feverish hungry or thirsty  we are aware of it simply as an affair of the body that lies under the laws of inconstancy stress and lack of self
It's bound to keep shifting and changing in line with its nature at all times  but we're not deluded by it
The khandhas are khandhas
The pure mind is a pure mind by its nature with no need to force it to know or to be deluded
Once it's fully true from every angle everything is true
We don't praise or criticize anything at all because each thing is its own separate reality  so why is there any reason to clash
If one side is true and the other isn't that's when things clash and fight all the time  because one side is genuine and the other side false
But when each has its own separate reality there's no problem
Contemplate the mind so as to reach this stage the stage where each thing has its own separate reality
Yathabhutañanadassana the knowledge and vision of things as they are
The mind knows and sees things as they are within and without through and through and then stays put with purity
If you were to say that it stays put it stays put with purity
Whatever it thinks it simply thinks
All the khandhas are khandhas pure and simple without a single defilement to order their thinking labeling and interpreting any more
There are simply the khandhas pure and simple  the khandhas without defilements or in other words the khandhas of an arahant of one who is free from defilement like the Lord Buddha and all his Noble Disciples
The body is simply a body
Feelings labels thoughtformations and cognizance are each simply passing conditions that we use until their time is up
When they no longer have the strength to keep going we let them go in line with their reality
But as for the utterly true nature of our purity there is no problem at all
Those who have reached full release from conventional realities of every sort you know don't assume themselves to be more special or worse than anyone else
For this reason they don't demean even the tiniest of creatures
They regard them all as friends in suffering birth aging illness and death because the Dhamma is something tender and gentle
Any mind in which it is found is completely gentle and can sympathize with every grain of sand with living beings of every sort
There's nothing rigid or unyielding about it
Only the defilements are rigid and unyielding
Proud
Conceited
Haughty and vain
Once there's Dhamma there are none of these things
There's only the unvarying gentleness and tenderness of mercy and benevolence for the world at all times
 The translator
The Ven
Acariya Maha Boowa accepted an invitation to go to England in June together with two other Bhikkhus Ven
Paññavaddho and Ven
Abhiceto originally from the UK
and Canada respectively
All three had the good fortune to be able to stay at the Dhammapadipa Vihara in Haverstock Hill which was run by the English Sangha Trust
It was there that Acariya Maha Boowa gave the talks recorded in this book the only exception to this being the discussion on th June in the morning at Cambridge when the Bhikkhus went to receive food at Mr
Benedic Wint's house
The talks given by Acariya Maha Boowa were tape recorded but the questions and answers were mostly taken down in shorthand by MR
Sermsri Kasemsri
It is mainly due to her efforts not only in taking down the questions and answers but also in subsequently transcribing all the talks and her shorthand notes and typing out the manuscript that the Thai book was produced from which this translation was made
Translation from Thai into English does not normally present any special problems
But in the case of this book the origin of it was the spoken word and in addition the subject matter is Dhamma which involves many concepts and technicalities for which English has a rather poor vocabulary and often a lack of the necessary fundamental concepts
The teachings of Buddhism may in fact be compared to a technical subject such as chemistry or electronics in that many technical terms and phrases are necessary and also special concepts and ways of thinking are needed in order to understand and appreciate the reasoning and truth of Buddhism
When it comes to a question of whether to translate a technical word has a wellknown and accurate equivalent in English then the English word is used
But if there is no wellknown or accurate equivalent or if the use of an English word leads to more confusion or misunderstanding than the original Pali word then the Pali word is used
I must apologise to those people who are not familiar with Pali terms and who find difficulty in reading a book such as this which has many Pali terms but I feel sure that it is far better for readers to not understand rather than to misunderstand
In any case following on this introduction is a short list of those Pali words which occur frequently in the book together with a brief assessment of their meaning so that the reader who is not familiar with those words can have a ready reference
There is also a more complete glossary at the end of the book
I should like to thank all those who have helped to produce this book including MR
Sermsri Kasemsri for her work on the original book in Thai Mr
Michael Shameklis for his help in translation of the first thirty or so pages Tan Suchard for helping to correct many many translation mistakes and to Tan Chris for typing out the manuscript
We all believe in the teachings of the Buddha which unites the hearts and minds of all Buddhists
We therefore should not be afraid of having no friends
We should think first of all that our friends do not yet understand us and so they drift away and no longer associate with us
Our way of practice in the way of wholesomeness still remains however
One should see this  and that there are still good people in the world
Good people eventually meet and become friends with other good people and these good people will be our friends
If there are no good people in the world and if there is nobody interested in associating with us then we should associate with the Dhamma  with Buddho Dhammo and Sangho in our hearts which is better than friends who are not interested in goodness at all
Buddho Dhammo and Sangho are friends which are truly excellent
Ordinarily those good friends of yours will come back to you
You should therefore rest assured that if your heart is satisfied that you are going in a wholesome direction then that is enough
You should not be concerned with or worry about others more than yourself
You should be responsible for yourself in the present and in the future for there is nobody but yourself who can raise you up to a higher level
Please understand that Buddhism does not teach people to draw away from each other
Buddhism and Christianity both teach people to be good so that they will be happy and go to heaven
If we compare the city of London to heaven we could tell people that there are many ways to enter the city
When they have chosen a way and made use of it all of them will reach London
Whatever religion one has one should practice it accordingly
They will meet in heaven
Buddhism however besides having a way to reach heaven also has the way to reach Nibbana
If one understands and practices according to the teachings and wants to reach Nibbana there are ways for going beyond
Nibbana means the complete absence of Dukkha
The Buddha and his arahant disciples being completely free from all defilements have all attained to Nibbana
One therefore should not be worried about anyone who follows them
You should explain this to your mother so that she will not worry about you for what Buddhism teaches will be for the stability and prosperity of society
It encourages people to be good so tell your mother not to worry that Buddhism is not hell and that it does not bring disaster or ruin to those who practice its teachings
Other people interfering with us is a normal obstacle but people cannot vie with oneself in the hindrances one makes for oneself
This is probably the case with everyone
When one wants to do something which is good which is useful a state of mind is liable to arise as a hindrance thus preventing it and one then wastes a lot of time
Beyond that it can lead one to do evil things which are also harmful and generally speaking lead to harm
When you get a feeling that there is something rubbing against your stomach you should understand that this is only a state of mind manifesting itself that it is not anything real or anything that is useful to the Citta
You should then make the Citta be aware of the rising  falling
Do not let the mind dwell on the sensation of rubbing
That sensation will subside and pass away by itself
Tan Acharn Maha Boowa said that he would give a short explanation of the Dhamma each day
The following is his first Dhamma explanation
Buddhism is derived from practice because the Buddha himself practiced until he himself knew and saw and was able to do it for himself and only then did he begin to teach others
Buddhists therefore understand the importance of practicing and training themselves according to the teachings
Learning for the purpose of gaining knowledge and understanding but without putting it into regular practice will not bring results as it ought to
One should therefore study and practice moral precepts until it becomes higher morality study all the different levels of wisdom until one reaches the level of higher wisdom and study freedom
One must then practice until one truly reaches freedom until one has truly escaped
Practice is therefore the most important part of Buddhism
When one who has practiced has reached any particular state of development he will know this for himself
For example if he practices the development of mindfulness of breathing he will know what the state of his breath is and he will know to what extent the Citta is quiet still and peaceful
But he must have mindfulness and he must not let the Citta wander outside
For someone who is beginning to practice the most important thing is the Citta and mindfulness
The Citta will improve if mindfulness is there to control it and it will then be peaceful cheerful bright and happiness will come by itself
But if the Citta is not controlled by mindfulness and if it is allowed free rein so that any and all thoughts can insert themselves the Citta will not be peaceful and happiness will not arise
Therefore the most important rule is to not let the imagination give rise to emotionally charged thoughts
Train the Citta to be truly peaceful and happiness will then follow in the wake of the calm which gradually develops
A high degree of calm means a high degree of happiness  until it reaches an extraordinary happiness which comes from the more subtle levels of concentration
For myself I feel that today is a fortunate occasion in that I have been able to meet you English Buddhists
I'm sorry that I can't speak to you in English and must depend on Ven
Paññavaddho to help translate
On this auspicious occasion let us all sit in meditation together each practicing according to his ability
Some of you can perhaps sit for a long time and some of you may tire quickly
Let each of you decide for how long you can sit before you get bodily discomfort and pain arising so that you gradually withdraw from Samadhi
You should however try to put up with the pain and discomfort for a while because you really want happiness of heart
You have already experienced and know enough about other kinds of happiness and you have no doubts about them enough not to be attracted to them
When I was able to sit in meditation for twelve or thirteen hours and it became painful I contemplated the place where the pain was and asked What is it that's painful
One finger
One bone
If they are painful why are they not painful after one is dead
Why is it that they are painful
If the Citta is where the pain is then if one does not have a body does that mean that the Citta dies too or not and so on until I reached the truth
But if one is going to contemplate painful feeling one must be brave enough to find the truth
One's desire to know the truth must be stronger than the pain and death
Mindfulness and wisdom must be continually traversing throughout oneself like a wheel which is turning then one can know
When one searches for the basis of truth and one meets truth one understands clearly one truly knows and understands all the time and the heart is freed from attachment
If one does not know truly the heart is still attached
The more one wants to be rid of Dukkha the more the Dukkha and the origin of Dukkha will increase in one's heart
Instead of getting rid of the origin of Dukkha one succeeds only in increasing it more than ever
The Venerable Acharn then invited those present to sit in meditation and he himself sat in meditation for a time before returning to his quarters leaving the lay people there each to sit in meditation as long as they liked
The Venerable Acharn began by asking the following question Is there anything useful in particular that you would like to discuss today
There may be many things When those in the room remained silent the Venerable Acharn began as follows
Sitting in meditation while listening to an explanation of Dhamma will greatly help to calm the Citta
I shall therefore begin with an explanation of the Dhamma and while you are listening please feel free to make use of whatever method of meditation you have practiced before
When the Citta is calm you will naturally receive the taste of Dhamma each according to his own level of practice
The Buddhist religion which we profess today is the Dhamma to which the Buddha had attained
His name was the Samana Gotama and he searched for and practiced many ways which he saw would bring him to the attainment of the Saccadhamma which was what he wanted
The word Dhamma means the teaching of a Buddha which is a new Dhamma and a new era that follows upon the Enlightenment of each buddha and the teaching which he gives to the world
Truly speaking the real Dhamma is always in the world right from the beginning
But this real original Dhamma is never touched by that which is conventional or mundane even though it is always in contact with the heart
But although these forms of Dhamma are always present in the world it is we who lack the ability to see them
What sort of thing is Dhamma
There is Dhamma as cause and Dhamma as result and because of this people are led to think in all sorts of ways until they have almost nothing to do with Dhamma or religion
The word Sasana means teaching  the teaching which arose as the result of those practices done by the Buddha in searching for knowledge and truth until he found it
Because he searched in the right way and because he attained results which satisfied his heart he proclaimed this teaching to the world of those who were suited to receive the Sasana Dhamma  this being the training and teaching of Buddhism
Teaching Dhamma to a world full of blindness so that it would come to know the truth was very difficult for the Teacher  it was no light task
Before he proclaimed his teaching to the world men already had various thoughts and ideas the majority of which were contradictory to the Dhamma
Teaching was therefore very difficult and being one of the Great teachers of the World was to be one who takes a great burden on himself
Few are the men therefore who wish to become a Buddha because ordinary men unlike a Buddha do not want any difficulties or burdens in teaching the world
There is no one who can teach as correctly or as accurately as the Buddha taught his Teaching to the people of the world so he was given the name of The Highest Teacher in the World There is none comparable to the Buddha because he is superior to all human beings
His teaching is fully complete in both cause and effect
Nothing is missing from the teachings which he taught to all beings
With regards to Dhamma he explained wholesome and unwholesome and neither wholesome nor unwholesome Dhamma
These Dhammas are Svakkhata Dhamma  Dhammas which are wellexplained
The essence of this Dhamma is in the Eightfold Path which is the Middle Way
If we were to compare the Middle Way to food its taste would be delicious for it would not be too salty too tasteless or too spicy
If we were to compare it to clothes it would be well cut and tailored to fit the person wearing it
It would not be like inexpensive clothes which are massproduced
Dhamma teaching is therefore the Middle Way which is appropriate in both its causes and its effects from the beginning to the end
It is not only Dhamma that is the Middle Way but the things that one depends on in the world
If one tried to do everything in the Middle Way it would be something worth seeing worth admiring worth living in and making use of
Those men and women monks and novices who practice the Dhamma of the Middle Way would be lovely and would be persons worthy of respect
Both the world and the Dhamma would be cool and quiet and it would be a good world to live in
There would be no complaining that the world is in trouble we are in trouble he is in trouble as is heard at present
Everything is burning with trouble and we practically have no world left to live in
This is because people do not take into consideration the principles of Dhamma which are correct and good
A world divorced from Dhamma that is goodness is therefore a world which is contrary to Dhamma people are contrary to Dhamma and this contrariness to Dhamma has the power to produce endless worry and confusion
If we refuse to see faults and if we refuse to stop this opposition to Dhamma this world will continue to experience Dukkha
Magga means the path which the Buddha declared using the principles of the Middle Way
It is therefore the only path which always leads straight and steadfastly to Vimutti
It is never outdated never having to be altered or changed in any way to keep up with changing situations and changing times
Even if everything should go on changing until they turn and turn about the Dhamma of the Middle Way will still be the Dhamma which is always consistent
If we liken it to a medicine it would be a medicine which doctors have already experimented with and proven the worth of and which is being used to cure disease
All Dhammas have already been completely tried and proven by the Buddha and there is no reason for doubting or being sceptical about them for the proving of these Dhammas resulted in the enlightenment of the Buddha
Furthermore all of the Buddha's disciples also attained the field of Vimutti by means of these Dhammas in the same way
We have come together today to train our minds to be calm and cool
The normal state of the mind is such that it has no Middle Way
It continually tends to go to extremes of thinking and imagining and its moods which are connected with work and duty are in confusion
Or in other words what the heart is used to and likes leads it away from what it should be doing
We must therefore make use of the Dhamma principles of the Buddha as a means to train the Citta to be calm  and however much or little one does this it will not be without result
Whoever makes use of any method of meditation as for example paying attention to one's breath or the repetition of Buddho Dhammo or Sangho should have mindfulness to control the Citta
The Citta should not be allowed to wander for if it does one will not get results and the Citta will not get calm
In the Dhamma it says Natthi santi param sukham which means there is no happiness greater than peace and this shows that the heart must be peaceful or calm to attain happiness so we should try to make the heart calm
The Citta which is not calm will tend to be agitated continually and even when it is asleep it dreams of all sorts of things
If one's Citta thinks a lot it will create fantastic dreams and talking in one's sleep for if one's sleep is not deep dreaming will occur whereas a deep sleep is a sleep without dreams
So one trains to make the Citta calm down but whether the Citta becomes calm and to what degree will depend on the ability of each person
If the Citta is very calm there will be a great deal of happiness and this is the first step of the training
The value of the mind will then be apparent to the owner so that he can admire it at that time while it is peaceful because there is nothing of greater value than a quiet mind
I would ask you to make your minds steadily overcome the difficulties and laziness which are things that usually overcome us the whole time
We believe that we cannot overcome them because we have seen their power but if we think we are able to fight them and if we really do fight them then the time will arrive when we do overcome them
We still hear of victories in regard to such things as sports and such like but with regard to Kilesas we only hear of giving in to them
Perhaps this is because we fall on our faces before the Kilesas and let them walk all over our backs
This religion shook the world because it was tested and proven by those whose hearts are pure
The Enlightenment of the Buddha shook his heart that is it shook the Kilesas in his heart just as if this world itself were shaken
Even though we have never seen or experienced any results from this religion we will surprise ourselves when the Citta becomes calm because this initial training will greatly move the heart when the Citta and Dhamma come together in unreserved completeness of the Citta and of Dhamma
The word religion is not a trifling matter
It exists with everyone of us and is not just a thing of this person or that person and it does not just belong to the Buddha
He taught us so that we would be good people and have worth appropriate to a human being
He taught that the virtue and value which comes from the religion is one's own wealth right up to the Path Fruition and Nibbana
This lies within the reach of each Buddhist who resolves to practice and he can be one who possesses and savors the results of it endlessly
There is no finish or end as there is with other forms of wealth which are impermanent unsatisfactory and notself and which someone has grabbed
Therefore Buddhism belongs to each of us and not only to this or that ethnic group class or caste
This is enough for today
I would now like to ask Ven
Paññavaddho to explain what he can remember
Why when we train the Citta do we fix the Citta on only this or that object
In fixing the Citta on the breath one should know the breath as it goes in and out at the nose all the time but this is not a breathing exercise
This is like using bait to catch a fish  what one wants to catch is the fish
Or if we make a simile of the Citta of someone who has not yet been trained his Citta will be scattered in various places like a fish net which has been cast into the water and spreads out wide until one can no longer see what it looks like
If we are going to know the Citta we will have to take hold of the leader that is the string on the net which one uses to draw it together
When we pull on the leader the rest of the net comes together until we can see it and hold it in our hands
The Citta is where we ourselves are
We are the owners of the Citta but we cannot force it to become whatever we want it to be
We assume that form memory feeling thoughts and consciousness are the Citta but in reality these aggregates can all be separated from each other and we can begin to see this when we practice
Then we will be able to promote the Citta so that it improves or deteriorates
When we have practiced we will gradually see that the Citta is the Lord of Birth and Death If we make merit practice generosity guard our moral precepts and practice meditation we promote the Citta so that it improves  it becomes brighter and is raised to a higher level
But if we follow our desires and are not afraid of demerit and unwholesomeness the Citta will do whatever it likes
Not being controlled the Citta will deteriorate and meet with nothing but Dukkha
Even in the present when we are downhearted and we do not know what to do we let go and are then besieged by Dukkha even though we are aware of it and because people do not know how to change Dukkha into happiness the world experiences Dukkha which is just what it does not want
The Citta which has been trained which is freed from defilements and which is pure must still depend on the aggregates while they are alive
But the duty and work of one whose Citta is pure will only be for the good of the world
This pure Citta is called arahant or arahat The person who is an arahant has a Citta which is entirely pure in all respects
His Citta is completely free from anything which will cause it to be born again and it will encounter happiness which is entirely satisfying while there is still life
When he dies it has absolute bliss and it has no Dukkha nor any involvement with the mundane relative world
Thus there is a saying of the Buddha which states Nibbanam Paramam Suññam which means Nibbana is entirely empty  of all Dukkha
But it does not mean that when one has attained Nibbana there is nothing left as the world understands emptiness to mean
But one also does not exist in the way that the world exists
In other words the happiness of Nibbana is happiness specific to Nibbana without any of the mundane conventions
If the Citta still wears the form of the aggregates when the defilements have been completely eradicated it means that it has attained to freedom
Freedom and the mundane world are very different from each other
It is difficult to compare the world of Sammuti which has mundane conventions with what has not  which is Vimutti
Buddhism has the purpose of teaching us to make our Citta pure so that we can experience the sublime happiness of Vimutti
By entering Samadhi the Citta can become completely quiet
The heart is then naturally happy and becomes strong so that in reading thinking or doing other various jobs the Citta will be clear and relaxed and when thinking it will be able to see through things more clearly than usual
Therefore training the Citta by way of either Samadhi or wisdom in accordance with the principles of Buddhism is a good way to help one in one's work for it does no harm to one's work which is contrary to what people generally understand even though those who think like this are only nominally believers and know nothing about Buddhism
Therefore in working with perseverance so as to get results one must use hard work and determination but these must be used differently in different cases
If one wants to attain calm one must use determination to aim for a single spot in other words one must quell mental distraction
But if one is going to contemplate so as to know the Dhamma truths one must use hard work determination in observing and develop understanding in the Dhamma from various viewpoints
If on the other hand one is aiming for the arising of wisdom one must use hard work and determination in the investigation of causes and their effects in various ways
The Buddha taught us about the six consciousnesses so that we would not cling to things which we see and know and so that we would know that they just arise and fall away and that there is no permanent essence in them
When we can supervise them we will be able to see the seventh Viññana more clearly
There is only one form of this consciousness and it is Eka Viññana To make an analogy it is like the trunk of a tree and this is the part that matters when we want to make use of a tree
The other six consciousnesses are then like the branches and twigs which we cannot make much use of
We should therefore keep this in mind and take an interest in contemplating the one Citta which will take birth
One should also try to look after the Citta and make it clean and raise it as high as one can in accordance with one's own level which one has gained from doing practice
An explanation such as this is theoretical knowledge and it might lead to endless argument if one has not practiced
But going on talking about and discussing it will not bring benefit
If one practices and comes to see the truth of Dhamma for oneself reading listening and discussing leads to understanding
But if that person has not practiced accordingly it will just go in the direction of argument
Because the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha has levels which are gross middle or subtle and it is better to speak about those things which will be valuable
What can be obtained from reading and what can be obtained from practice are quite different from each other because remembering what one has read is quite different from the truth that has been experienced from practice
Even when other people speak of the results from their practice it is difficult for one to understand them until one has practiced and experienced more with one's heart
Then one's doubts will clear up of themselves
Anything which enters and associates with us  whichever type of character we may have from amongst those which people have  is connected with and concerns us from then on
If we practice and try to eliminate the Kilesas then eliminate them we can for there were and are arahants who were once very angry men
We are common people who only know and understand this but we do not yet have the ability to eliminate the root of anger
We must train the Citta to know how bad a fault hate is then it will go by itself
If we try to get rid of it by just wanting it to go we will not succeed
We must depend on practice and then we will see results coming steadily which is called the right kind of meditation and suitable for the removal of that kind of Kilesa
Please understand that the Kilesas are not afraid of only remembering their names
Even though we remember everything about them in great detail they still remain Kilesas which govern the hearts of beings in the world
They do not think about removing themselves to another place unless one practices meditation and develops mindfulness and wisdom so as to be bold and strong enough to be able to drive them out
Then the time comes when they will break and scatter from the heart without any doubt like the Buddha and all his disciples who eliminated the Kilesas by means of practice
The methods they used have been taught to the world down to the present day
I will explain sitting meditation
Why did the Buddha sit cross legged in meditation
If one looks at it only superficially sitting in that position is not very important and one can sit in any position that one wants
But if one is going to sit for hours then one should sit crosslegged because the pressure due to the weight of the body will be evenly distributed
When it becomes painful the pain will be spread out and it will not be excessively painful in any one spot
If one sits for a very long time then it may become very painful because sitting in meditation is extremely important work for those who are determined to get real results and they may sit for a long time even for many hours
If they become too worried or anxious about their bodies then the Citta will be weak
This will be dependent on the Dukkha of the body
It is important to make the Citta one's goal
Let the Citta do the work that is set for it and have mindfulness in control of the Citta while meditating so that it does not wander outside thinking about this or that
The Citta which is always controlled by mindfulness will remain with oneself
It will be calm and will be clearly aware
The more one has mindfulness with the Citta however good it may be the clearer the Citta will be
One must therefore not allow the Citta to wander or to be distracted
Concerning the Path of the arahant and Fruition and speaking of mindfulness and wisdom as well if one makes use only of mindfulness and does not make use of wisdom one will not get results that are desirable
If one is going to be able to eliminate the Kilesas entirely one must make complete use of mindfulness and wisdom  which are like tools
In making use of tools one must know what to use with what the way to use them and how
There can be a lot of mindfulness it is true but people are deficient in doing what is their duty because they do not use wisdom as they ought to
The end result of this is that the full state that should arise does not
Being deficient in what is one's duty is not a good thing so the result one gets is not complete
Therefore one who learns about the Middle Way should always take into consideration what is sufficient  which is appropriate to the name of Dhamma  which is the Middle Way that one has learned
When light falls on the surface of an object the top of that object is illuminated while its underside is in shadow and dark
Wisdom is like the light which can truly penetrate but what it penetrates is the Kilesas which cover the heart so that there is not any shadow in the heart where Kilesas can hide or conceal themselves
This means that wisdom is powerful and able to investigate circumspectly throughout the darkness of all the Kilesas with ease and confidence until the Citta has reached ultimate Vimutti
Q Does this mean that we should carefully examine the five Indriya
If wisdom is strong it will penetrate throughout like a light which shines completely through an object from top to bottom so that there is no shadow which is Avijja left at all
Is that correct
The word brightness refers here to the state of Vatta Citta which is different from Vivatta Citta
In other words Pabhassara is clarity and brightness but is not yet the state of purity
The brightness which comes from practice is due to the Kilesas gathering together in just one spot
When the brightness which is the most subtle of the Kilesas has been passed by by the cleansing process of supermindfulness and superwisdom then the Citta is pure
Kilesas are coarse medium and subtle and the knowing which is formed out of these Kilesas is not the real Citta but only the characteristics of the Citta
We must use wisdom to follow and remove these Kilesas at all three levels and when we have done this until the Citta does not change is not sad or downhearted and has none of the characteristics of the Citta which is covered by the Kilesas at all this Citta will know that there are no causes left for rebirth in the future
The Citta is then pure and need not take birth again
The Citta which has the germ of goodness and badness within it can be compared to a seed which can grow and which has the germ of life or the potential for development in it
This kind of Citta will therefore be born die and be born again and again according to the causes which it has itself made  good and bad variously
As for the Citta which is pure it is constant and the germ of rebirth is no longer present
Regardless of whether one believes that after death there is nothing more or that after death there is still something if the Citta has the germs of goodness and badness present in it it will be born again endlessly but if the Citta is pure and has no such germs it will not be born
This is the way of it but the permanence of the pure Citta is not the same as the world understands permanence to mean so there is nobody who can understand the permanence of the pure Citta correctly except the arahants alone
The Buddha practiced until he saw truly for himself
He did not make any wild guesses or just think about it as we do
Therefore the Buddha's Dhamma is absolutely correct and we can have absolute confidence in it
If we cannot yet attain to the level of the pure Citta then we should persist in doing what is good so that in whatever way this Citta is born it may be a good way
This will lead to development and is far better than clinging to doubt and uncertainty which obstructs our way so that we live in vain without gaining anything useful for it only sets up a barrier so that we are swept away or pushed down into the mass of the round of Dukkha
The Citta is like all other things  trees children etc it needs nourishment so that it will grow and develop
The Citta however has to depend on its owner for the way it is nourished so it will develop accordingly
I am very pleased to be able to come here and answer your questions but I am afraid that my stay here will be rather short as I cannot remain very long due to the many duties which I have waiting for me in Thailand
Thailand is about  Buddhist and I have much to do in the way of meeting the people and my followers
It was necessary for me to prepare my work about three or four months in advance before I could actually come to England and it is necessary that I return home quickly because of the many people waiting there
I am very pleased to have been received by our English brothers and sisters and I would like to come to England once again but Aniccam Dukkham and Anatta make it impossible for us to be sure that we will have the opportunity of doing so
I hope that the Dhamma we have discussed here today will enable you to get the important essence which will help you in your future practice
Ven
Paññavaddho has been in Thailand for twelve years and he speaks and understands Thai fluently
During that time I have tried to learn English from him but I never really succeeded in learning it so I am unable to speak to you in English during my stay here
I must have Ven
Paññavaddho translate for me
Usually if one knows that something is bad and dangerous to oneself in the future one will not do it but if one thinks that it is good or if one does not consider the fault of it and one goes on doing it because one gives way to the emotion of anger one will not be able to get rid of anger
In fact this will only increase one's anger and make it stronger so that it will constantly harass oneself and bring trouble and harm to others
You must examine yourself thus What is it that I like or dislike
That which the other party does to me makes me angry and I restrain myself and do not display any abnormal behavior
I investigate so as to correct myself by thinking of the way they feel so as to find out if I have done anything that would make them angry
I cannot recall anything that I may have done so if they are in the wrong I am not in the wrong they make a show of anger but I do not their heart is troubled within them and other people will see for themselves that they are bad but I do nothing bad Because you do not show any reaction by answering them back you increasingly become an admirable person
But nobody admires a person who gets angry saying that he is good because he is clever at getting angry
When one gets angry with someone who is going to admire this and say that one is good because one can get angry and because one has got angry with this person
Anger is not a good thing and people everywhere in the world are afraid of it and tired of it
Even animals recognize anger and quickly try to avoid it and hide from it
They are afraid of anger which is a poison more harmful than fire
Anger should therefore not be encouraged  in fact one should look for a way to quench it until there is none left
If one feels anger for anyone and one dislikes them and if one sees the fault as being in oneself seeing that it makes one uneasy in one's heart one will get rid of that feeling entirely
Therefore to go straight to the point one must before all else examine one's own faults or the faults which will arise or have arisen in oneself then get rid of that feeling entirely
When one begins to practice this form of Dhamma at first one does not understand oneself one only has feelings about external things and one has likes and dislikes
One begins to observe other people and one sees how angry people display the characteristics of anger and one does not like it
So then one tries not to produce such characteristics towards other people
Acting in this way one begins to understand one's own Citta
When one does this often one's awareness will arise more quickly and awareness of oneself and one's Citta will also arise more quickly so that as soon as one is the recipient of someone else's display of anger in whatever way it may come about one knows oneself and one can quell one's emotions
In this way one can get rid of one's defilements little by little and reduce the Dukkha and anxiety in one's own heart
Being dissatisfied with anything is nothing but Dukkha which accords with the Dhamma that the Lord taught but we generally oppose Dhamma  being that which is right good and proper  so we generally find Dukkha all the time without feeling any dread of it and not being in dread of it leads us to encounter Dukkha again and again
In addition those who are concerned with reasoning about the basic meanings of Dhamma should always be wary of this
One must look on that work as being the object of one's attention
For example one method is to take the raising and lowering of one's feet as this object while walking in which case one must do just this because this is the work that one has set the Citta to do
If one uses any other method one will have the corresponding object upon which to fix one's attention
When contemplating Dhamma one should go on until one comes to the end of that aspect of Dhamma that one is contemplating and one should have mindfulness associated with it in every bodily action and position
The various forms of practicing this Dhamma do not in fact conflict with each other
But a person who practices is likely to be prejudiced and to see his own methods as being right and other people's methods as having no value so then quarrels start or they boastfully say Whose is the better way
It is better to do it our way Another person who takes it up and uses that method may find it unsuitable to him and it can be wrong and unsatisfactory
When one takes up and for some time practices a method using which other people have practiced and gained good results it can happen that one gets no good results for oneself
Therefore the practice of the Dhamma depends upon the individual characteristics of each person for one person will like it this way and another will like it that way
For the latter part of your question in which the burden of the Citta is increased such that as soon as a sound is heard the Citta must Know know and then return and set up the practice as before if there is something which breaks into the practice often your Citta will be too slow and it will never be able to keep doing the work which it should be doing
When one is at the stage of a beginner in doing practice the Citta still has not much strength and to increase the burden of the Citta greatly is not good
It is like getting a child to do work which must be gradually explained in each of its aspects
If one explains how to do too much of it all at once the work is too difficult then laziness will arise and the child will probably dawdle over the work
The Citta is like this
This work of the Citta is firstly for the attainment of calm and secondly for getting rid of the defilements internally
But when one is contemplating so as to attain understanding and skill in the parts of the body mindfulness  that which controls the contemplation  is essential just as much as it is when doing Samadhi practice to attain calm
Mindfulness must be present to supervise the work all the time
The Citta will then have courage and ability and it will have mindfulness and wisdom to get rid of the defilements  and this is what makes up Magga
When one has reached this stage all laziness will have disappeared one will be able to do Citta Bhavana so that one forgets time and sits for long periods and then one attains results which are of high value
When one has sat for a long time one then walks while contemplating so as to change the posture
One uses supermindfulness and superwisdom to go on curing doubts and problems until there are no more defilements left to cure
One will then understand by oneself that the Citta and Dhamma have penetrated each other
Thus the way of practice can help to arouse knowledge and understanding of the Citta this way
The Citta is a very important thing in a person
For one has already been born and the Citta is the entity which has caused one to be born as a person good or bad and high or low
When the Citta is the chief cause of this one must rely upon those things which influence the Citta for one's future state
If it develops well one can rise up until one reaches the stage of Sugato  one who has great happiness
But if the heart accumulates bad things even without knowing that they are bad the results which one gets will be bad all the time
If one practices Dhamma well there will arise a sense of wellbeing in one's heart
People generally do not know the reason why we receive Dukkha nor when we will be free from it because we are not aware that we have done bad things nor when we did them
We just see the results of them which arise as Dukkha at the present moment
But in this case we ought to try and choose the work for the Citta to do
If it is evil and Akusala we should avoid it completely
If we are used to doing such things we should try and find a way to abstain from them and we should promote what has value and is good even though it may be difficult to do
Thus we gradually train ourselves going on like this until we become used to it meanwhile using wisdom to drive us on
But lazy people and those who do not like what is good are no use at all because they have no wisdom to drive them on
If the people love what is good wisdom compels them to do good until the Citta is used to it
Then results of calm peace of heart and happiness will come
It may also happen that something strange and wonderful of a different kind arises spontaneously in the Citta
We are not normally acquainted with such wonderful things but they will arise from the practice of what is good  the important thing being the practice of Citta Bhavana
As for the above good person he has only virtue
He is not distracted and he is not at cross purposes with Dhamma with anybody nor with anything as far as and including his own heart
But because his heart does not have any power of control to make the heart body and speech go in the right direction  the direction in which it should go which leads to those results that bring happiness  he must purify and cure his Citta and try to get it to work using the methods of meditation practice which causes the bad things within him to disintegrate
Those things which are dignified and noble will then develop and increase in the heart which is appropriate to the value of the Citta  which by way of nature has a very high value
If one trains one's Citta one will agree with one's own Citta before anyone else and if one practices and follows the way that the Lord Buddha taught one will be a clever person
But if one practices and follows the way of someone who does not truly know it is like the blind and foolish leading the blind  they cannot walk the right way to reach the goal the end of the road which is desired
If one is not prepared to let oneself be led by someone who knows the way then the more one acts in this way the more stupid one becomes the more one lacks cleverness and one will not see those results which one desires
Cleverness must depend on mindfulness and wisdom in looking for reasons
People in this world do not become good on their own without doing anything they must rely upon learning and they must have training
Training raises the Citta higher and if one does not have training one's Citta cannot go higher and the defilements will pull the Citta down until it cannot escape
But the Citta which has trained well can get rid of the Kilesas and this has the highest value
The Sangha nowadays who practice in the way described above may be taken as a refuge this being a kind of byproduct because the Sangha who practice properly are within the circle of the SANGHA This is the way the Lord said one could tell whether the Sangha exists which one can take to be a refuge or not
A basic principle which I can give you which is common to all ways is as follows Do not let your Citta go out externally When the Citta is outside there are things which fascinate the Citta so one must then train oneself to concentrate anew and do this time after time
One does not know whether those things come from one's own heart  or from where they come
But if they are lovable things and beautiful one then loves them
If they are loathsome things and what is more important fearsome things one will be afraid
Therefore in order to guard against fear one must look after the Citta and keep it inside and arouse calm internally and peace of heart
The extent of our interest in Buddhism is because of our interest in ourselves in those who are associated with us in our surrounding environment and because it shows how we should act towards ourselves and towards those people and things
As for the Sasana it is neutral for if we remain silent and disinterested it remains unclaimed wealth because the Lord Buddha bestowed the Sasana impartially on human beings and on Buddhists which includes us here
The Sasana can become the wealth of people at each and every level depending on the interest taken the taking up and doing of the practice disciplining the body and using these as food for the heart in the way which accords with the teaching of the Lord
The results of this will be a calm and cool heart the extent of which will accord with our standing and level of development
So the Sasana cannot be separated from ourselves for it is like a path which goes to various locations
For us the path is the thing that is necessary for whichever point we intend to go to we must study and learn how this path leads us on and what is its destination for if it does not go to the right way it will waste a lot of time
The way of Buddhism is the way of calm
It is Niyyanika Dhamma  leading on those who practice so that they can get free from Dukkha in accordance with the level of their Dhamma basis and Citta basis
When people who are living in a state of confusion who are discontented who do not know what to do and who do not know how to get rid of those things which are unsatisfactory have taken the Sasana as their guide their behavior and practice becomes correct and dignified
Therefore the Sasana is necessary for us who want what is correct and dignified
The problems which concern ourselves and the Sasana are our own problems
In other words we are bound to be born to meet with Dukkha and hardship and to die
Our problem is having been born how should we act so as to be troublefree and contented without accumulating Dukkha and trouble for ourselves  or making trouble for others and for society generally
Because our knowledge of how things work is not sufficient for this
Death is a thing that nobody wants because of the fear that one will be completely destroyed and that one will get Dukkha and hardship which may come to one after one is dead
If one is still alive one knows the meaning of being destroyed so people in the world do not want to die
But if it was known that after death one would experience ease and contentment everyone would want to die now because there are things that we hope to get having greater value than what exists here waiting for us if we get rid of the container  which is this body  and this life may be a barrier to the wealth which one will get when one is dead
But if people are still not sure whether after death they will come to destruction or to happiness and contentment they do not want to die
The principles of Dhamma stand unshakably on their own
They are certain and can be accepted on faith
The speech of the Lord Buddha is correct and accurately spoken and comes from his purity of heart
Every aspect of Dhamma the Lord Buddha knew for himself before he gave it as a teaching to other people
He had practiced and attained the fruits of it which satisfied his heart and he taught with purity of heart filled with Metta for all beings
Therefore the Dhamma is a Dhamma which gives hope to those who practice it willingly
When we have practiced it wholeheartedly hope will become clearly apparent to ourselves
One who practices Dhamma  that is practicing in his own heart rightly following the principles of Dhamma can see the results appear in himself with certainty
Having come up against the principles of Dhamma which one has put into practice one's former knowledge which was uneven and inconsistent is all overthrown  or so it seems to the heart
However long one's life will be one will then never be afraid or timid because one knows how one has practiced and how it gave results step by step
When this life ends wherever one is born again whether one receives Dukkha or Sukha in whatever way it is already clear to oneself and there is no room for doubt
Therefore one who practices following the way of the Lord Buddha can cut off all fear and doubt and there remains only the entire truth and a life of happiness and contentment without trouble
Therefore one should learn about one's own problems so as to bring them to an end and the Sasana will help to arouse hope for oneself
Buddhism teaches us to avoid things which are dangerous and it teaches that the Citta should have its own basis and then it will not waver or be afraid nor doubtful about death and how it will go afterwards
Nor will it be interested in thinking about anything outside oneself  which would be like grasping at shadows
If you are going to a place and you are not sure that you are going to find everything convenient there you will probably prepare yourself and take all sorts of things that you might need so that you will have everything
Then you may be certain that everything will be convenient and that you will lack nothing
When you are sure that you will find food there and you have also taken food along with you you do not feel any apprehension
Virtue is comparable to food for food is food of the body and virtue is food of the Citta
The practice of Dhamma will be food of the Citta which you carry along with you and the heart will be at ease so that whenever you die there will not be Dukkha
One knows that the body wants food and whatever type of food is lacking it eats
The Citta wants virtue and Dhamma and if it lacks this food the factors of confusion arise and the heart is uneasy and troubled
One should therefore know where one is deficient and hurry to correct it and accumulate virtue from now on
Tan Acharn explained Dhamma further
Merit is happiness
Kusala is skill in finding things which bring happiness to oneself
You who have come here to search for what is good which is food for the heart such as the practice of Samadhi meditation if your hearts constantly do virtuous things your Citta will have skill courage good natures and certainty about the future
This is like someone going on a journey who has arranged everything that will be necessary for his use on the way
We are going on a journey coming from which state of existence we do not know but we are human  which means we are people living now whether men or women
People are more clever than animals in this world and we find that we have been born as human beings
Since birth we have had Dukkha and Sukha difficulty and confusion and we have gradually come to know this
We have learned about the events of our own past and one day in the future we are bound to die
After death how will it be
If we act so as to develop our Cittas to attain complete clarity this problem can answer itself and we will have certainty ease of heart and a feeling of confidence in ourselves
The Lord Buddha saw clearly into Dhamma and he also saw clearly into the method by which he had trained himself
Therefore it was never in vain that Buddhists turned to him and he was ready to help the world to enable it to get free from various dangers with methods which were full of Metta
Summarising this in both religions the Founders taught people to be good with Metta in the same way
They are different in their degrees of subtlety following the abilities of the founders of each religion
It is important to depend on mindfulness to know and attend to the work which one has set one's Citta to do and to avoid anticipating the result which one will get while one is doing the practice
When mindfulness and the work are going along together the result will come of itself steadily from the practice of meditation
To what extent can we practice it
The Lord Buddha intended that we should have untold wealth but the extent to which we ourselves can have it depends upon the ability of each person
When you have mindfulness always with you and working all the time then you can sit in Samadhi in whatever way you like
But it is important that mindfulness keeps your attention on just that work that you are doing
In Buddhism the Lord revealed Dhamma in three categories
These are
In the time of the Lord Buddha the Lord did not teach the Savakas a great deal
Unlike nowadays when they teach to pass exams of grade grade and Periyan
Instead they learned so as to practice and those who knew the TiPitaka were many and they got no diploma to boost their vanity but only knowledge and understanding which they learned so as to be able to go further and further in the future
The Lord Buddha taught every one of the Savakas to contemplate hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth and skin which are things that we have in our bodies but by ourselves we are incapable of realising that these things arise and cease continually and change in accordance with the truth of what they are
The Lord taught the Savakas to do this so that they should know the truth which these parts themselves display
When these things reveal themselves as having a nature which is unpleasant then discontent arises
Nevertheless people grasp hold of them and consider them to be their treasure so that now they must decorate them take care of them and look after them more and more
This teaching of the Lord's is given so that we should not feel worried and anxious when these things start to show abnormal functions and to go wrong
Kesa Loma Nakha Danta and Taco have inherent within them the characteristics of continual change quite regardless of the status of one's birth social level or skin color
Those who learn them will get to know them truly because they are attached to our bodies
Birth old age change and uncertainty are Dukkha and hardships as well as Dukkha in the hearts of people
Therefore the Lord Buddha taught every one of the Savaka Sangha these five Kammatthana and then sent them off to practice in the forest so as to learn Kesa Loma Nakha Danta and Taco contemplating them one by one in the forward order and then returning going through them in the reverse order
The Savaka Sangha went to practice in the hills caves and gorges wherever it was convenient and peaceful for those who worked taking up these five or other Kammatthanas as the basis for striving until clear knowledge arose of both the body and the Citta
Pariyatti was what they learned from the Lord Buddha as mentioned previously so as to get rid of stupidity and dullness in regard to those things which we have in our own bodies
Patipatti is the practice of sitting in Samadhi walking Cankama and investigating the above five things which are like a grindstone for sharpening wisdom to make it become keen and strong until it comes to know the truth of various things skill and cleverness develop in the heart and even Samadhi develops making the heart calm and cool
These are the results that come
Pativedha Dhamma is clear knowledge penetrating into all the Dhamma truths until it reaches Vimutti  complete freedom
All three of these Dhammas are necessary in association with each other and they cannot be separated out from the beginning to the end of the path
Whoever intends to get results from Dhamma should therefore practice accordingly without being deficient in any of them and the results will then be clearly evident and always satisfying in every age
The things which the Lord taught from the time of the Buddha right up to the present time have not changed
Those who learn and practice should understand that this is the teaching which gives us the knowledge of how to practice in regard to the body and Citta at such times as dislike desire anger and delusion arise because they are sure to arise countless times in our lives making us feel that this is Dukkha and dangerous
This is because we are not circumspect not being guarded in thoughts and the imaginings of the heart so we must learn to know that such and such actions give rise to ill effects or to what is valuable as the case may be
The practice of the way of Buddhism is therefore the practice on ourselves so as to go the way of the development of a calm and cool heart giving increasing benefits to oneself which is appropriate for the religion that teaches people to be clever in guarding themselves so as to get free from danger
As for Viññana the consciousness which comes from the impact of sensation through the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind it arises in association with these things and then dies away and ceases
This is what is called Viññana in the five Khandhas and is different from the former
But Patisandhi Viññana is the Citta which goes to take birth each time in any one of various possible places and characteristic forms
Because this Citta has seeds attached to it  in other words Kamma which has been done and which can send it off to be born in various different states
In Buddhism it is explained that beings are born in various different circumstances and states because of Patisandhi Viññana or in other words this Citta has the nature of Anicca Dukkha and Anatta
Then Kamma is the force which drives it on
But when this Citta has been washed clean so that it is made pure free from Kilesas and Kamma which would otherwise attach themselves to it this Citta which is pure knows of itself that it will not go to be born again and that it is free and that it is finally and absolutely beyond the rule of Anicca Dukkha and Anatta
As long as the Citta or Patisandhi Viññana is still not pure in every way it must live under the rule of Anicca Dukkha and Anatta
But this Citta is very subtle and how can it be Anatta
It may be illustrated by the following simile which gives a comparison with emptiness
Suppose that a man was told to go and look in a room and say whether it was empty or not and in this room there is nothing at all
He goes in and says The room is empty But the person who sent him in says How can it be empty when you are standing there in the middle of it He then becomes aware of himself and leaves the room after which the room is truly empty
The Citta which gets rid of Attanuditthi entirely has nothing mundane or relative left at all therefore it is said to be an empty Citta or a Citta which is pure throughout
Because Atta and Anatta are not there in the Citta the Citta is absolutely free from both conditions of Atta and Anatta
As to your question what is this Dukkha
Please examine carefully at such times as you have Dukkha what this Dukkha is and who can you go and ask about it if you have this Dukkha and do not know it yourself
Because these things exist in everybody without exception
If one knows then one practices the way that the Lord Buddha taught
This practice is the way to come to know Dukkha with certainty that there is no other way
Before one comes to know that the Citta is Samsara wisdom will probably have to contemplate external things until it knows them clearly and lets go of them
Then it comes and sees danger in the true ringleader of Samsara  which is the Citta
When one sees that the Citta is Samsara it is called seeing in the reverse manner in other words returning back inwards to get to know oneself and ending all doubts at the same time
One must contemplate both internally and externally
Externally there are the surrounding objects of nature these being basically earth water air and fire
Internally means within one's Citta and one should know what it is that one must get rid of
This is like a drinking glass that falls and breaks  one must look and see it as it is
If one imagines that it is someone's fault in that they made it fall and break one will be troubled and upset
But if one sees that it went its own way according to its nature one frees one's heart entirely and then there is no need to be upset for it broke in accordance with its nature
It is important for the Citta to turn round and catch up with it and see it in the right way
Then at last one knows the one who creates imagination  this being the Sankhara  the one who creates stories
The stories then cease forthwith and they no longer follow on from one another building a series of thoughts branching out wider and wider
Discussing Dhamma today in its essence has been more and more interesting both for those who ask for the one who answers and for those who listen
But there should also be something about practice
What is practice
It is that which brings results to oneself letting one know and see fully
If those who practice tell each other of the results which they have attained and report to the teacher this will correct any faults or give clarity and confidence to them
Because each person who practices gains results according to the basic nature of his Citta and his Dhamma which differ from person to person
So the teacher has to give explanations continuously to encourage those who practice so that they can strengthen their resolve because he knows the results which he attained for himself and those which the pupil has attained by practicing in the same way to be the same
Also because the teacher who knows clearly has already gone the whole way and he is able to talk the pupil into penetrating through and letting go of everything until he can also penetrate through and gain freedom
Buddhism is not Mogharaja but it is genuine and true and capable of giving release from Dukkha
But people to a great extent change Buddhism into a tool for arguing with each other
I would like to explain this to you so that you would understand all the reasoning  but I have no way to do so because my command of English is no use and I have to speak depending on the translator
Concerning Vimutti the Lord Buddha revealed this fully  because the Lord knew it truly and the Savaka arahants also knew it in the same way
They never disputed amongst themselves about it and they all equally revealed it in the same way but other people crowd together doubting everything
None of the arahants have any doubt at all for they have seen that Nibbanam Paramam Sukham
Nibbana Paramam Suññam which all of us have learned to know as emptiness in the way that people in the world generally understand it meaning that everything has disappeared
It is like this glass tumbler here if anyone takes it or it breaks we are then empty of this glass and this is the way the conventional world sees it
But emptiness in the manner of Vimutti as was known by the Lord Buddha and the Savaka arahants is of a different kind
The happiness which comes from Emptiness the ordinary person has never seen
So we are bound to be doubtful and to deny it in spite of the fact that the Lord Buddha always taught true things
For our hearts which are still not pure cannot yet accept it and have not reached understanding of it and the Citta which is still false is not yet likely to accept true things as its objective support
It is like excellent food well prepared that drops on the ground  we do not like to eat it then
The Dhamma of the Lord Buddha is pure but if the Citta of a person is dirty they cannot accept each other in a good way
But whenever the Citta and the Dhamma are both pure they can blend well together
Therefore none of the arahants have the slightest doubt in regard to the Vimutti that the Lord Buddha constantly taught
Today I will give some explanation of Dhamma before answering questions
I will not talk for long as I am afraid the translator will not be able to remember
The word Sasana if its meaning is shown by analogy with things in this world is like clean pure water and the Citta is like an object which is in continual use
It will probably come into frequent contact with dirty things and so it should be continually cleaned and washed otherwise one should not go on using it anymore
The Citta works the whole time always thinking speaking and acting
Therefore the Citta is important to people and to other beings who think and imagine all the time without thinking whether what is good or bad is dangerous to themselves or to others who are in any way associated with them
The Buddhist religion is like water which washes and cleanses the Citta keeping it always clean
If this Citta is likened to clothes one can say that they are fit to be worn or if it likened to household utensils they are suitable for use and are not unpleasant
But if they are not washed and cleaned constantly they become unfit for use
The Citta which is not good is like this
The Citta which is regularly washed and trained is likely to be clear clean calm cool and developed in ways appropriate to Dhamma and there is nothing in the world which can accept the Dhamma as well as the Citta which is a vessel for receiving Dhamma
The Lord Buddha practiced until his heart was pure so the Dhamma is clean and the heart of the Lord is clean and free from blemish taint or intoxication with the world so regardless of status or caste he taught all equally and Buddhism is therefore not a danger to anyone
Like clean water people of every status and caste can use it and nobody dislikes it
Buddhism comes from the Lord who was genuinely pure and the Lord Buddha was thus the first hand to be clean
The hands of the Savakas of the Lord Buddha are also clean so the first hand and the second hand are clean and because the Savaka Sangha had all attained purity and arahantship the Dhamma which was propagated and taught in those days was clean and gave results to those who listened with full attention
From then on it began to get more and more tainted and the taints were connected with those who were associated with the religion
Religion thus became a basis for criticism such that other religions that people did not like were seen as being enemies to their own religion
Then there arose a liking for this religion and a loathing for that one which was not the intention of the religion nor of the founder
The founder of every true religion does not want people to spoil its harmony nor to break it up and oppose the religious teaching
They taught that people should blend well together and not split up and break harmony for this is a hindrance to the religion
But because the heart has the world within it this world hidden inside has the power to make people go according to what is hidden there and the religion is therefore a danger to those who dislike it and a boon to those who like it
Amongst those who believe in different religions there arose conflict and disagreement and they looked down on reviled and despised each other's religion
Religion thus became a tool for the two sides to quarrel over with dirty hearts which drove them on
But the religions remained good because they taught people to be good people as accords with their knowledge ability and good intentions
In the same way as we learned various branches of knowledge at school not all of which came from one teacher for one taught us this and another taught us that and it is just about impossible that they should all have taught exactly the same things
The Lord Buddha taught so that people would attain the level of arahant
An arahant is one who has reached the level of Visuddhi Guna  he is a pure person and a pure Citta
Whatever basic level of development a person has he can teach to that level but depending also on his inherent ability to teach
The person who learns can also receive the teaching to an extent depending on his inherent ability to learn
Therefore the extent to which we will be able to follow and practice the way of the religion will also depend on our own ability because to go further than the ability of the teacher and the ability of the pupil who practices it is almost impossible
If anyone brings up any of the essential points of Dhamma from the subject of today's talk I will be very glad to explain it in accordance with mindfulness and wisdom in a practical way
All of us in ourselves variously have hope in our hearts for we are not people who have given up hope but it does not yet show itself so that we may know it in ourselves
Some hopes have already been fulfilled some have not and some have only been partly fulfilled
The principles of Dhamma in Buddhism bring people fulfillment of their hopes in a way that is complete and satisfactory
There is no need to talk of people who have given up hope because they have not decided to become good people so they are likely to remain hopeless
Therefore we should act and behave in such a way that will always give us hope
Hope makes us good people who practice generosity morality and Bhavana and based on this whether today tomorrow this life or in future lives we will not be people who have no refuge and no support for we have the Dhamma which continues to be with us
Normally the heart has good evil and neutral things in it and it can deteriorate or develop
The wisest people therefore try to train the Citta so that they become good people and when it gets difficult they will try to be victorious over all bad things so as to take hold of Dhamma as their refuge and as the basic principle of their hearts
They will then get the hopes of their hearts in full measure in the future
Any of you who have questions may ask them now either about Dhamma which has been explained today  or any other day if you wish
The hearts of people cannot disappear for they can develop they can deteriorate or they can be made pure and when the Citta has become pure happiness which is not of the type found in this world will be found by the one who practices and he will find in himself what kind of happiness it is and to what extent also
If you can be confident in yourself that the method of fighting against Dukkha by investigating it is the best and highest way you should analyze Dukkha into external and internal
But practicing and striving in this way is truly very painful  as though all one's bones are breaking apart or hot as though one is on fire all over
One wants to know the extent of one's ability but one must fight before one knows how far one's Citta is able to go
One still does not know for sure what Dukkha Vedana really is whether it is Dukkha the cause of Dukkha the cessation of Dukkha or the path leading to the cessation of Dukkha so mindfulness and wisdom must be used to search and think it out and if one can search it out to completion it can quench Dukkha like burning gunpowder which flares up and in a moment it all goes out  and the Citta remains
Therefore take up Dukkha Vedana and examine which Dukkha this is at the moment when the body breaks up and ceases
In truth Dukkha arises and ceases continuously but that the Citta should die never happens in fact the Citta becomes more and more clear and drops into a state of calm beyond one's expectations
But those who are afraid of death will get more and more of death
Therefore one should take up this Citta Bhavana and practice it
But it is a much more difficult thing to do than the ordinary methods of the type in which one sleeps at times and wakes up at times which does not give results such as one ought to get
Those who want the highest results should not feel repelled by this method which can fight the tricks and deceits of the Kilesas better than other methods
The training is difficult in the beginning for to start with one has never done it before one has never seen what results come from doing it and one must depend on mindfulness to force one to do it going against one's inclinations by using reason to show the need for it
But once the results of this begin to appear in one's Citta interest the will to do it and the effort will all steadily follow
Then the more that results appear whether great or small the more and more strange and unusual and the effort then comes of itself
Those factors of Dhamma which are the means of attaining successful results  being the four Iddhipada including Chanda Viriya Citta and Vimamsa  will steadily become stronger until they enable one who practices to attain his intended goal without any obstacle being able to stop him
Training in Samadhi is the same as the above
To begin with one must use mindfulness constantly to supervise and force the Citta to do it
As he goes on doing it the one who practices will be successful and get various results for himself and he will gain skill and ability
When he practices Samadhi and strives and gets rid of the Kilesas until he eventually becomes free from them all he still goes on doing Samadhi but he no longer strives for freedom from the Kilesas anymore because they have already gone
When he lies down to rest and sleep he stops but when he gets up he uses mindfulness and wisdom in all sorts of activities including the practice of Samadhi meditation which he continues to do for he does not throw away the work that he has done in the same way as someone who knows about books and is able to read and write a lot
He goes on doing this so that it shall be of increasing value in various ways and he does not stop just because he is able to read and write
The practicing of Samadhi meditation by those who have got rid of the Kilesas is like this they must go on doing it for the purpose of Vihara Dhamma  living comfortably in this world where the Dhatu and Khandhas live
The Lord Buddha and the Savakas in the TiPitaka all said that they had to force themselves to put forward effort very often before they gained Enlightenment
From then up to the time when they each entered Parinibbana the Buddha and the Savakas still entered Samadhi and Nirodha Samapatti which was a way for the Citta to dwell comfortably at ease amongst the Khandhas which is called Vihara Dhamma  Dhamma as a dwelling place  until the time when the Citta departs from the body which cannot last any longer and enters Nibbana which is the ultimate happiness free from trouble of any kind at all
When the Lord Buddha was about to enter Parinibbana he entered Samadhi
He entered the first Jhana and went up stage by stage to the state of Saññavedayitanirodha Samapatti and then he returned step by step back to the first Jhana
Then he entered the first Jhana and went up to the fourth Jhana and then attained Parinibbana between the rupa Jhanas and the Arupa Jhanas
Because the Lord Buddha was able to do and experience the highest levels like this all the Savakas persevered in following his example until they succeeded in becoming arahants after the Lord Buddha
The Lord Buddha sought and found Dhamma until he became enlightened and he upheld this as the Dhamma method which he continually taught to his followers until the day he entered Nibbana
All of us therefore have taken to heart with faith that
continually in our status as Buddhists and we do not hold anyone else as our refuge in a heartfelt way as we do the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha which are the most excellent and supreme
When the Khandas and Citta had still not separated they entered Samadhi Samapatti in whatever way suited their characters and their skills until they reached the end of their time
Jhana is the realm which gives the heart a rest whereas Vipassana is the examination of the things of nature so as to know clearly what is the truth of them and to let go one's attachment for them one after another until one comes to the end of the things that one should let go of
Then one reaches purity and freedom from them
As to the question whether Vipassana will lead to Jhana or not this is the concern of stupid people who speculate in their habitual ways of thought and then do not begin to do anything in connection with them
 One's basic or fundamental knowing  this is the Citta and it will go on to create becoming and birth going to be born wherever it may be depending on how those things which are infused into the Citta
Going by general principles mindfulness and wisdom are Dhamma which can arise and cease in the same way as other things everywhere
Therefore to say that they are one and the same as the heart is not proper but on the other hand they are factors of the path  or tools for curing the Kilesas so as to attain purity of heart
As for sitting together with anyone or not this will probably depend on circumstances
But the important thing is that one should sit according to one's own temperament and whether this will be for a long time or not will be up to oneself
The word Anatta is a factor of the TiLakkhana and someone who aims for purity freedom and Nibbana should contemplate Aniccam Dukkham Anatta until they see and understand these TiLakkhana clearly
Then it may be said that the Citta has well gone free Because Nibbana is not Anatta for how can one force it to be Anatta which is one of the TiLakkhana which are the path for getting to Nibbana
When the Citta is calm it also wants to sleep which is strange
In other words when the Citta is calm it is contented and when it is not calm it is not contented
When thinking far and wide it is not contented and does not want to sleep but as soon as the Citta begins to get calmer and calmer it wants to sleep which means that it will get increasing happiness
A short while ago I was sitting developing calm and also felt that I would like to sleep but I did not let it go as far as sleep because sleep puts both the Citta and the body into a state of rest
While one is listening to a Dhamma talk and one becomes absorbed in listening to the Dhamma and the Citta is attending to the words of the Dhamma talk which is its only object of attention the Citta gradually becomes more and more calm and then it tends to become drowsy and can go into a dreamy doze
Some people blame themselves saying How is this
when I am alone or talking with my friends I don't feel sleepy but why is it that when I listen to a Dhamma talk I want to sleep and lie down and I sit nodding out of control
From where does this Mara come
What is this about Mara
The Citta has never had happiness and contentment and as soon as it gets the stream of Dhamma lulling it into happiness calm and contentment it just wants to go to sleep
Then from where does Mara come
In truth the owner is Mara who disturbs the owner himself all day and all night without getting peace and contentment until the Citta cannot sleep because it is not calm
One does not know the reason for this and as soon as one listens to Dhamma when the teacher gives a Dhamma talk the Citta grows calm and thus wants to sleep
One then says that it is Mara
Truly it is not Mara for everybody as soon as they become contented want to sleep
This means that the result of the stage in which the Citta is sufficiently contented is that it wants to sleep and this is the first stage in which one has received training
If the Citta has a foundation of calm then it has work to do while listening to a Dhamma talk  and the work will depend on the foundation or basic level of the Citta then it will not be drowsy
If it has been doing Samadhi then it will be engrossed in Samadhi
But if it is at the level of wisdom it will become engrossed while the teacher is giving the Dhamma talk
One's heart will tend to follow and become enraptured by the object of attention of Dhamma
It is as though the Teacher helps to clear the way so that one can follow in his footsteps step by step
This indicates that one has got to the stage of Vipassana  which is contemplation  and the Citta is engrossed in following because of which there is no drowsiness
This shows how drowsiness occurs when one begins to do practice
In other words the Citta does not want to drop into a state of calm but as soon as it begins to get calm the calm makes it want to lie down and sleep  because this is contentment
In evaluating or proving a religion and most especially Buddhism  which is the teaching of the Buddha  the evaluation should be done with one's own heart
In what way did the Lord teach
Take up the Lord's method and go and practice it or take up the method which the Lord taught and enter into the practice for the sake of one's own heart  in other words practice to develop one's heart
If one's heart follows the way that the Lord taught what sort of results will one get
One will come to know for oneself gradually and this will be the proof of the Buddhist teaching of Dhamma in one's own heart showing to one what things are good and true and what are false
One will come to know this gradually by grasping the principles of the teaching as that which points out the evidence so as to know the truth and falsehood which is in one's own heart  and they are not to be found anywhere else but only in one's own heart
Generally one does not know that they are false things and one cannot know from where or from what the falsehood comes
When one does not know this one thinks that one is good and clever  more clever than any teaching more clever than Buddhism more clever than the Buddha more clever than any teacher who founded a religion to teach to the world
This is the assumed opinion of self even while one is being extremely stupid and in fact it is one's being extremely stupid that makes one think how one is supremely clever
When one has taken up the principles of Buddhism and put them into practice to test and see how much and how far they are true and where they are false then one will be able to know how it is with the principles of Dhamma which the Lord taught
To begin with one is not able to do this so one starts by taking it in brief or taking up a short or easy method such as the Lord's teaching of Bhavana
How does one fix one's attention so that it may be called Bhavana
In the principles which are taught in the Lord's Religion there are various different methods to suit the abilities of those who practice so that they may attain a calm and peaceful heart  which is the result that comes from practice
For example fixing one's attention on one's breath going in and out
In doing this one should continually feel the breath as it enters and leaves not letting one's attention slip and wander away and not letting go of the Citta sending it away to other things
Just develop understanding and knowing of the breath  this is one method of knowing about the truth and falsehood of one's own heart
When one's heart becomes calm one will see the falsehood of one's heart and at the same time one will also see the truth that is in it
In addition one will both see how wrong and faulty is the restless distracted wandering of the heart which causes one to be agitated and to suffer and also the merit and virtue of a calm cool heart which is one's happiness while the heart is calm
This is called inwardly seeing both the wrong and the right at the same time
One who has determined to practice truly is bound to see in this way because the principles of Buddhism are the guarantee that the causes are correct and accurate and that the results are satisfying the Lord Buddha having been the first to experience them
Here is one method and only one method among all the methods to try out concerning the Citta so as so see results coming steadily from the practice
Thus to have mindfulness and clear self awareness to be aware of oneself all the time
This is a way to be careful and watchful of the Citta only letting it know what is within the field which one has established so that it has a limited boundary to its knowing
One does not allow it to know in a scattered and aimless way without any limit or boundary just as it feels inclined which is the way that nearly everybody in the world acts
For knowledge and understanding of this sort is not the type of knowledge and understanding which goes towards that level which gives rise to happiness and contentment enabling causes and results to be seen
One must therefore have a limited field in doing the practice for the development of the Citta by holding to the principles of Dhamma which are the principles of Buddhism and the way for the Citta to go
Or they are the way so that the Citta will walk along those paths which are taught in Buddhism  which is the way that leads in the right direction and not otherwise
If the Citta is to be set up and held by the use of one or another of the Parikamma words one's attention must be kept on that Parikamma word
If it slips away to think of all sorts of things one should try to understand what has happened or one should search for devices or methods of training it in various ways such as rapidly repeating the Parikamma word
But whatever device or method enables one's heart to gain the result of a calm cool heart and to arouse various skillful devices in one's heart may be considered as a right method of training oneself
If the Citta becomes more or less calm then concern disturbance time and place do not get in and make connection with it
There is just knowing and dwelling alone and this is happiness
Whether one sits for a long time or not there is nothing which comes to cause disturbances for in whatever place one sits and for however long nothing comes into relationship with the Citta as long as the Citta does not go out and get entangled with things and as long as it has Dhamma as the object of attention
There is a state of calm by dwelling alone and there is selfknowing right there at that time
This is called knowing in the ways of meditation  or knowing in the ways of guarding the Citta
There is a boundary to knowing and seeing and this is the method of progressing to begin with
However long one goes on doing the practice one should not abandon or give up the method which one has been in the habit of using and practicing but hold on to it as a foundation
Thus for example if one has been using Anapanasati one takes the breath as the foundation to start with
But the skill of the Citta which has done this constantly for a long time and attained calm often will know things at a speed which is very different from normal and after just one moment it will have passed on
Passed on to subtlety disappeared and gone utterly quiet and one will not know where the breath has gone
This indicates the skill of the Citta like when one writes if one writes the word you someone who is learning to write must think of the first letter then the second and so on until it is finished but after having learned for a long time the letters the sounds the vowels and consonants all arise together
Skill of the Citta whether in Samadhi or in Pañña is similar to this  and the Lord called it Jhana
The four Jhanas  first Jhana second Jhana third Jhana fourth Jhana are the Rupa Jhanas and beyond this are the four Arupa Jhanas altogether making the  attainments  plus Saññavedayitta Nirodha which is the quelling of Sañña and Vedana
But these Samapattis are Dhammas that are special or connected with the characteristic abilities of those who are inclined to go this way and they will occur spontaneously
But these are not Dhammas that are necessary to the Path or the Fruition in which there is the getting rid of Kilesas and reaching the levels and states of purity of heart leading to arahantship
But however this may be if anyone is skilled in Jhana it is similar to that person who is skilled in writing and that is all
Thus the first Jhana the second Jhana and so on  he can immediately reach all of them because of the speed of the Citta
But the characteristics of a Citta such as this which changes its state steadily does not go up like we go up stairs step by step for however able we are at going up stairs we do not jump several steps at a time but go up one by one
But the skill of this Citta is such that one moment it can reach its intended goal with extreme rapidity
There is nothing that is faster than the heart and this heart is the fastest for the more it becomes skilled in these functions the faster it becomes beyond the imagination of anyone who has not seen the power of the Citta of one who is used to knowing and seeing various things in the path of the practice of Dhamma
Samadhi is similar for such a person
Just sitting once the heart has become accustomed to being calmed by his own skill there is no need for him to find a Parikamma word to fix his attention to compel and tie down the Citta and to make it enter a state of calm for just limiting the Citta by means of mindfulness it immediately becomes fully calmed
Within just half a second it becomes calm and reaches a state of tranquillity nothing hinders it and it drops to the level of Samadhi
This is what is meant by one who has skill in Samadhi
As soon as he fixes his attention for just one moment it goes entirely through like we can write the word you and immediately read it without any need to grope and think and search for the vowels and consonants spending a lot of time as we had to in the beginning
In speaking of the levels of Samadhi when one is skilled it is as described above
But please do not believe that you are skilled or not skilled for this is anticipation which goes out from yourself and then returns to deceive you wasting a lot of time and preventing you from seeing the results in the way that you ought to
Whether one is skilled or not let it be that one trains oneself in that Dhamma and discipline which one has been in the habit of using
This is an important principle which one also uses in learning to write for one writes a single letter over and over again until one is skilled at doing it
There is no need to anticipate the way to write all the other letters for in due time skill at them will grow of itself as one goes on practicing
The method of training the heart is like this for skill will arise and grow in oneself
PAA
Pañña is wisdom of the Citta
Thinking and putting things together and contemplating using reason based on Dhamma in various ways was called Pañña by Lord Buddha
In other words carefully examining contemplating investigating the elements the Khandhas the changes of nature both externally and internally going on all the time everywhere always for if anybody has mindfulness and wisdom to fix his attention anywhere the whole of it will be Dhamma
All these things are like grindstones for sharpening wisdom continually and all the time in every position and posture one will see all these natural things displaying their characteristics and letting one know them by way of wisdom all the time and therefore Dhamma is to be found everywhere
It is not to be found just in oneself nor just when one sits doing meditation or walking Cankama for it is there at all times if one will make it be there and keep it there in all situations
In regard to one's skill in Samadhi or in mindfulness and wisdom these will be the same as has already been explained above
But one cannot explain much because it becomes too involved
In regard to one's skill in Samadhi or in mindfulness and wisdom these will be the same as has already been explained above
But one cannot explain much because it becomes too involved
In regard to wisdom this is vast and very strange
If one is to do what is truly appropriate one should just explain to those who have a need to listen to that particular aspect of wisdom and this is the most suitable way to do it
Apart from this one may explain enough to be a step or a pathway so that those who are beginning to train themselves in investigation may follow it as in the explanation which has just been given
The Citta can be trained and the characteristics of the Citta are things which can go on altering and changing step by step
From being refined they can fall down and become gross again depending on oneself who is the owner of them and the way in which one directs them to go
Thus for example we have trained ourselves in the moral precepts and we are at present training in meditation for Samadhi and this is the training of the Citta which raises it up to a higher level
If one considers the processes of the Citta then thinking of everything from the point of view of reason and morality is a way to make one act so that one rises higher  but there will also be things which one will have to get rid of from oneself
In other words there are both those things that one sees to be bad which should be got rid of and also those things that one sees to be right which one should practice and develop more and more
This may be called the practice or the training of the Citta to attain the level of knowing and seeing in which there are causes and results going up steadily higher
If the Citta deteriorates knowledge and understanding change and become lower and lower steadily
But if the Citta reaches purity entire and complete neither deterioration nor development take place because the conditions that bring about deterioration and development have then disappeared from the heart
There remains only complete purity  the heart is Dhamma and Dhamma is the heart
The heart and Dhamma are one and the same
From then on there is no more changing and altering and then one has come to the end of the practice of Brahmacariya for attaining the higher levels of Dhamma and has completed the task of getting rid of the Kilesas of every sort
When he has finished both the task of getting rid of and that of developing what else is there to get rid of
There is nothing else here because everything has been got rid of already
And there is nothing more he can do to develop higher than this because he has reached the highest already
As to deteriorating there is no basis for this to happen because this is Akuppa Dhamma  unshakable Dhamma  and there is no way for the Citta to deteriorate
The work which ought to be done which is that of getting rid of and developing has already been done to completion
This kind of Citta has nothing mundane entering and hiding in it  no time no place no past or future related to the present such as for example now it is like this in the future what will it be like  this sort of thing does not come in this Citta
This life is like this next life will be like that  does not occur in it  because the past and future have come together into existing in the present and have become pure in the one heart
Past and future which used to be associated with the heart therefore have no meaning at all because the heart is devoid of any meaning such as would lead it into all sorts of delusions
If one called this the ultimate Citta and the ultimate limit of the path along which the Citta goes it would not be wrong
All that has been said here has been said by way of the principles of practice which are the results that come from the practice of the Dhamma
These principles follow the religion of the Buddha which is the right way to go unchanging in which all Buddhists can be confident
There is no room to think with doubt that this Dhamma of the Lord Buddha has anything in it which may cause the world to be disrupted
Nor can it lead us to disappointment or to loss of faith for where could this be so in all the Dhammakkhandhas
Nowhere
Therefore there are no problems for those who practice accordingly
The only question that remains is How to act and practice so as to progress in accordance with the principles of the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha
This is called the Svakkhata Dhamma and it is also Niyyanika Dhamma  leading those who practice rightly and well to get free steadily from obstacles which are obstructions within the heart until they penetrate through and reach Vimutti ultimate freedom and then there is nothing left remaining in the heart
This is the ultimate and final result that comes from the practice of the Dhamma of Buddhism
When one has reached this level the heart and the religion are one and the same
The Sasana and the heart cannot then blame or find fault with each other
The heart is then genuine the Sasana is also genuine each is respectively genuine and true
It is thus that the Lord Buddha said Whoever sees the Dhamma sees the Tathagata meaning this Dhamma
Here the Tathagata is not the bodily form of the Buddha
Although this bodily form is one aspect of the Tathagata and means that bodily form of the Lord Buddha which is of the same nature as the bodies which we all have
In other words the body is the bodily form of the supreme Buddha and someone having seen the Lord having saluted paid homage and Puja to the Lord who delights the eyes and the heart could say that he had seen the Tathagata with his eyes  and this may be considered as seeing one kind of Tathagata
Another way is when someone recollects the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha with faith and belief then it may be said that they have reached Dhamma or reached the Lord Buddha
Yet another way is when someone attains to the level of Sotapanna Sakadagami or Anagami going on stage by stage then this may be called seeing the Tathagata step by step until they reach the final consummation
The true Tathagata is purity of Dhamma and purity of heart so that Dhamma and the heart are one and the same and one can find no way to separate them and analyze them apart
Wherever the heart is there the Dhamma is and wherever the Dhamma is there the Tathagata is
Then it can be said Who sees the Dhamma sees the Tathagata Seeing in the way of practice is like this  in other words to experience Dhamma at the level of Purity by way of the heart following the Lord Buddha is called seeing Dhamma or seeing the Tathagata consummately
Then one has no doubts whether the Parinibbana of the Lord Buddha was years ago or many aeons ago because all this is relative convention which is the same as the conventions of the world everywhere
Thus the texts have recorded where and when the Lord was at different times and places to act as a signpost waiting there to indicate the time and place of the Lord variously for Buddhists who pay homage and have faith in the Lord by doing obeisance and Puja on the anniversaries
But as far as the true Tathagata which is complete purity of heart is concerned there is no time and place associated with this at all and for one who is entirely pure wherever he may be it is the same as if he was before the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha the whole time  Akaliko  eternally
Therefore please practice these Buddhist teachings so that they develop in your hearts which means to say that you will not be without the Lord as the Teacher wherever you go and this is the same as being before the Master the Dhamma and the Sangha at all times until you reach Vimutti  freedom within your Citta
Then you will know for sure who the Master really is without having any doubts
This explanation of Dhamma is I think sufficient so I will end here
In listening to a Dhamma talk in the manner of those who practice generally one is not more interested in remembering what is said than in looking at the Citta and the Dhamma which the teacher is explaining at that time in order that one may get value while listening
For instance the Citta may gain calm or some ways of wisdom may then arise and get rid of some kinds of Kilesas
Now I will answer questions
The teaching of the Lord Buddha is said to be composed of Dhamma Khandhas which is not much because the Lord Buddha summarised making it suitable to the strength of beings in the world
When one is doing practice knowledge branches out more and more so that among those who are doing practice when they speak to each other they can gain a lot more knowledge
But if one has not yet gained results from practice however it is explained it is not likely to be of much use
The Lord Buddha had experienced more than the others and when the Savakas went to speak to him and ask him about knowledge saying that they had come across this and had had experiences of that kind the Lord knew all about it already and could answer immediately
Because the things which happen to each person are different and someone who has already had such experiences will understand them and can therefore guide them on the way along which he has already gone
Jhana means to concentrate intently  repeat Buddho Buddho Buddho and it will become Jhana
Jhana is a natural principle but Jhana is not essential for developing wisdom because in contemplating form there is Vitakka  which is disentangling those things which one sees and if this is done in a natural way the one who practices can have Jhana depending on his own characteristics though it may not go in the way that it is usually explained
The word Jhana interests us Buddhists a great deal even though we have hardly had any genuine results of Jhana  but we tend to talk extravagantly about it enough to be annoying
There is no need to memorize everything while one is listening but one should compose the heart and let it be knowing within oneself and one should not send it elsewhere at that time
The Citta will then receive knowledge in continually following the Dhamma which is being explained
Then the results of calm and peace will arise
Or it will arouse various ways and means which come to one while one is listening
This is what is meant by making gains from listening in the way of practice in the same way as those in the past who practiced in this manner
After this the Van
Acharn led a short meditation practice for five minutes after which the meeting closed
I will begin by explaining Dhamma as I have done before
Afterwards those who have questions from various viewpoints that they want to ask will be able to do so
Listening to Dhamma such as I told it to you yesterday the question was asked by somebody about being able to remember and not being able to remember and of what value it is if one cannot remember
Listening to Dhamma in the way of those who practice they understand what is being explained while they are listening
But now the Teacher speaks a different language and you who listen may not yet be able to understand while the teacher is explaining
But if your Citta stays just in front  in other words the determination to listen at this time has been made  this together with the flow of Dhamma which is being explained goes inward and touches one within the Citta
This will make the heart aware of the impact of the sound and it will at least become calm and cool
This is so because the sound is an emotionally based object which can cause the Citta to be a present Citta
As for those who listen and understand the language all the time while explanations are being given they have something which they can know clearly while listening
Then the Citta becomes engrossed in that aspect of Dhamma which the Teacher is explaining
Because in explaining this Dhamma he must speak about or say things which are there in us also for these things are to be found everywhere in the world
In other words the things which the teacher of Dhamma talks about and which Buddhism teaches concern those things that are inherently in beings and Sankharas everywhere
These things one should also be able to know as well as to understand about those things which are within oneself
In the system of religion which the Lord taught at that time he gave instruction about this also and we who listen can gradually gain understanding of the truths in the Dhamma that he taught
While listening and when one's Citta is paying close attention to the Dhamma which is being taught one's heart will gradually become calm and cool and while listening one does not think of going to all sorts of places nor of any objects of attachment
Then one's heart can drop into a state of calm undisturbed and contented so that one forgets the time and other things until one forgets one's tiredness and stiffness and everything else
If one's Citta has a strong inclinations to go the way of investigation which the Lord called Vipassana or Pañña the story is different for while Dhamma is being explained the Citta will keep moving and following continuously like walking behind and following in the footsteps of the Teacher who is going ahead
Each time he raises a foot one steps in the footprint after him step by step
In other words the Teacher clears the way so that one may know and understand while listening
When one knows understands and contemplates following the Teacher it makes one become engrossed and absorbed in the Kilesas and Asavas while one is listening
It is for just this reason that in the time of the Lord Buddha when the Savakas listened to the Lord revealing Dhamma many attained Magga Phala and Nibbana
Sometimes the Citta advances up to a certain point and then when it listens again in the future the Citta goes higher  and so on each time it goes up step by step until it reaches the highest point of Dhamma which they call penetrating the highest Dhamma by understanding just while listening
Not being interested in trying to remember is of value while one is listening to Dhamma in that one gets a calm and cool heart one steadily gets a clear understanding one gets happiness and contentment and one gains various skillful methods
These are the results which are gained while listening which cannot be gained from trying to remember such as reciting Dhamma in various Suttas over and over again so as to memorize them
But if anything or any part of Dhamma gets left behind in one's memory one can oneself remember it
Listening to Dhamma as done by those who practice is therefore held in high regard amongst them
I would like to tell you some things about Tan Acharn Mun who was a Teacher in this line of Kammatthana so that all of you may know a little about him
In what things was he most active or interested in connection with all the followers who went to be trained by him
He was more interested in pointing out the training in Dhamma to the Bhikkhus and Samaneras who went to learn with him than anything else
He would carefully watch the manners behavior and conduct in practice of the Bhikkhus and Samaneras for fear that they would go wrong and deviate from the principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya  this is the second thing
But the first was the training and teaching to get the Bhikkhus and Samaneras to understand the present Dhamma which is the focal point of the higher knowing and understanding right up to the highest Path and Fruition
When he gave a talk on Dhamma if there were only Bhikkhus and Samaneras present he would go on sometimes for two hours before finishing sometimes three or four hours and occasionally for six hours
But it was also strange how all those who were there sitting listening were quiet not making a sound  almost as if there were no Bhikkhus and Samaneras there at all
One heard just the sound of the Dhamma that he taught step by step without breaking the sequence or missing out any steps until he finished
However many Bhikkhus and Samaneras were present it was as though there were none there because each of them was listening with interest and concentrated attention
Every one of them was in a state of calm the aim of the Citta being to attain the truth and Dhamma so as to have a calm and cool heart
If the Citta steps in towards the realm of wisdom which means being able to think and contemplate following the Acariya the Citta then adjusts and adapts to his Dhamma all the time
At both levels we can say that it makes one absorbed in the following ways In the first stage  Calm
One becomes absorbed in the way of calm and in the Dhamma which lulls the Citta into a calm contented state
The second stage  wisdom
One becomes engrossed in the Dhamma which steadily causes the Citta to gain the way
Thus one's interest in the Dhamma is such that no interest remains in being tired or stiff while one is listening and while the Teacher is giving a talk just about practice from the story of Samadhi and wisdom right through to the end
The story of Sila was not necessary because it was covered by the behavior and practice of each one who was present
He did not talk of many things but only about the principles of Samadhi Wisdom and Vimutti
On those days when there was a meeting and he gave a talk he was sure to go right through until he reached the subject of the path fruition and Nibbana in the one talk and he never got stuck or diverted in any part of it
This was due to his character because he had great knowledge and ability in the field of practice and he had circumspection and great skill in the way of practice
When one's heart has been continuously trained in the ways of Dhamma it will have a basis to hold on to and the heart which has a basis to hold on to is because of that likely to live happily and to be normally happy as well as being happy in doing one's duties and earning a living
One then lives happily and one dies happily because one has a basis to hold on to within one and those who have such a basis are not likely to be troubled and anxious
Dhamma is the basis to hold on to for the heart and objects in the world are the basis to hold on to or the dependent conditions of the body  such as for example buildings clothing and various types of foods which are the sustenance and the refuges that the body depends on and lives with
That we have the necessity of depending on these things is because we have been born and born from these things and we must depend on these things as the means of curing ills and maintaining the body continually until the end of life
As for the heart it has Dhamma as its help as the thing it depends on as its guardian and as its nourishment  for it is said that Dhamma is the food of the heart  or it is the Arammana of the heart
But in regard to the word Arammana there are both good and evil Arammana
If the Arammana is not good it is poison to the heart and inflames the Citta causing it to be troubled and anxious
If the Arammana is good it makes the Citta cool and happy and then it becomes buried in that Citta which is what they call Upanissaya or Vasana Parami which means the continuous building up of what is good and right However much this has been developed it will be buried down in the Citta of that person until it becomes increasing Nissaya Vasana
When the heart changes and moves off to another place another life another realm it must depend on the virtue that one has done and the amount of it that one has accumulated in one's heart
This is what turns the Citta making it go in a good direction to have Sugati that which is hoped for and this is where one lives and experiences
The body has a graveyard
Wherever one goes to live and set up home there must be a graveyard for the body in that place for regardless of whether one lives in the country in the town in the forest the hills a cave or on the bare ground there is also a graveyard with every one of them
Because this form of nature is something that has been born so it is bound to die and wherever it dies that place is a graveyard
This is the way of the body
As for the Citta it has no graveyard because the heart does not die
Right here is a great and important principle so please take note of this and remember it well for this is an unchanging principle of truth in regard to ourselves
If someone has rightly thought about and properly investigated the story of the Citta and tried to practice in himself all the virtues of Dhamma which are in the teachings and if he has hopes of living anywhere going anywhere or being born in any place he will not be disappointed in his expectations or in the intended goal which he sets himself
And the hopes which he sets his heart on will be fulfilled
This is like all of us who have come here to learn today
In other words we come here to learn Dhamma so that it will go into the heart and be a basis to hold on to and so that the heart will depend on this Dhamma as its ruling principle
Because this heart is something that does not die it is not destined for the graveyard unlike the physical elements and the Khandhas  which are the body
The body breaks up and disappears but the heart does not break up and when it goes from this body it goes into another body and leaving that one it goes on to another
Going higher lower up and down because of those things which are within the Citta that the Lord called Vipaka which arise from Kamma  ie the actions that the Citta itself does
The Citta is the one who thinks and imagines things both good and evil and the Citta is the one who compels them to go out in the direction of speech or body so causing them to become actions of speech or body
Those actions which are done in the heart are called Mano Kamma those done by way of speech are called Vaci Kamma and those done by way of body are called Kaya Kamma The word kamma means the doing of action which can take place in our bodies speech or hearts
This is important for when Kamma which is the good or evil that dwells there opens the way for the result Sukha or Dukkha  which is the result of good or evil Kamma  is liable to arise of such a kind one cannot prevent it
Manokamma is action done by way of the mind speech or body each of which can be good or evil or neutral and these actions are what the Lord called Kamma and according to the principles of Buddhism they are also called Kamma The movements of the Citta of the body and speech were considered by the Lord to be actions which are called Kamma When there are actions and movements as a consequence of actions Vipaka  the results  must steadily go on being derived from them and it is only that they variously arise a little bit more quickly or slowly for some kinds can arise as results quickly and some slowly
Like results of things that we can see in the world some kinds arise in a short time some arise immediately and some take a long time before they appear but in the end they are all results just the same
This is what the Lord called Vipaka which one has within one's heart
The heart is the one that made it that did it some the heart can remember and some it cannot
But ultimately it will forget because it is making it all the time in every realm and every life in every day and night in every month and year
Who can succeed in memorizing and retaining all this firmly in mind since the time he was borne in this world
Let alone days or months ago for even just today one cannot remember some of the things that one has thought about
But thinking imagining and doing of good or evil by way of one's body and speech take place without depending upon being able to remember
They just depend upon the action of doing them and good or evil results are bound to become apparent from those actions all the time
This is an important principle and therefore the Lord taught that one should always do some good and now is the opportunity when we can develop something of value or cure whatever we see to be defective in every nook and cranny
This is not beyond our ability
Once one has gone beyond this life there is uncertainty both in doing actions and in partaking of the results because in the realm of ghosts or Devas it seems that there are no factories such as we human beings have
To be satisfied with being lazy in doing good in this world and then to go and be energetic in the next world  the world of ghosts or of Devas  this is a wrong way of understanding
All the men of great wisdom have thus taught that the one who came to teach us is not stupid
His name is the Lord Buddha and he is the supreme teacher the teacher of all the three realms the one who truly understands and clearly sees every part and section of the Dhamma which he himself taught with certainty  being the truth
There is no false changeable Dhamma hidden within this teaching and it is thus that the Lord called it Svakkhata Dhamma which means The Dhamma that the Lord Buddha has taught well The word well means perfectly and completely in all ways
Niyyanika Dhamma is the Dhamma which enables those who practice properly in accord with Dhamma to get free from Dukkha progressively
There is no way for doubt at all for it is Dhamma that is unchanging and certain
Who can speak rightly and precisely every time like the Lord Buddha
One feels that there has not been anyone else in our world of people
To make a comparison ordinary people everywhere if they speak words will speak at least which are likely to be false and only speak true
If they speak for a long time the false words will probably increase and they may all become false
But the words of the Lord Buddha are not false because his heart is not false
The heart of the Lord is a pure heart and it knows truly and understands truly which is derived from practicing truly and then the Lord gives any teaching it comes out of his heart which is both good and true  then from where could anything be found
So it is a supreme teaching and he is the World Teacher which all of us hold as the unchanging principle or as that in which we can have implicit faith so that we can say The Lord Buddha and the religion of Dhamma of the Lord are not enemies or opponents of any of us The Lord Buddha the Dhamma or the Sangha are those that are supreme and have Dhamma  excellence above the world
The teaching of the Lord which was the establishment of Buddhism was given for the group that followed him
It was not given for the Lord Buddha for the Dhamma for any of the Savaka Sangha all of whom had passed beyond Dukkha already
But it was given just for us
The Lord was not lacking anything which might make him desire for results from us as payment for it was only because of his Metta that he gave the teaching to his followers so that they could take it as the direction for them to go
We have only to practice following the teaching of the Lord
But then we see that it is difficult to do and we are unable to struggle and follow the way the Lord went
How then shall we live in this world and in what way so as to have happiness both bodily and mentally which is appropriate to human beings who are clever in searching for happiness for themselves
This is a question that we should consider and ask ourselves at such times as laziness and carelessness arise so as to cure these things which are Mara waiting to block the way forward
We can do this by methods which we like using Dhamma and our skill and cleverness so as to have a way to go on in order to gain happiness and the fulfillment of our hopes so as to be not entirely barred and blocked in every existence every life every day and all the time like it is here where it is full of Dukkha in our hearts until we cannot find a way and method of getting rid of it
This is to be expected where there are so many people in the present world that there is almost no earth left for living on
But there are still those who are clever and sharpwitted who find a means of swimming on a bit and they are not all entirely dull and obtuse  this state being a sorrowful thing to those who are the wisest of men
How should we examine and contemplate
When we are waiting to wash our hands at once we still cannot do it
The teaching was taught by the Lord both rightly and precisely in all things and ways but to practice and follow it accordingly we see to be difficult
Then where will we go to find comfort
We have been living in this world a long time and from what do we derive comfort
We should question ourselves in this way and maybe we will start ourselves thinking
If it is to be in accordance with our desires wanting comfort wanting ease and relaxation we ought to be people with ease and relaxation since long ago and we should not be shouldering a mass of Dukkha like people everywhere in the world
But this does not accord with the image formed in our minds which symbolises what the heart wants  unless the Kilesas have been deceiving all people and all beings for a long time and they still have not seen the banefulness of their deception at all  on the contrary they agree wholeheartedly with their soothing suggestions lulling them to sleep in their skillful ways
The world teacher in the wheel of samsara is the Kilesas themselves
Once they get to teach people they stick to them and more and more people come until the Kilesas cannot handle them all
Because beings in the world very much like their trick methods of teaching and they are never bored or satiated by them even though they lead to Dukkha and punishment due to being deceived since long ago
The world teacher of freedom from the wheel is the Lord Buddha the first Venerable One the first to know and the first to train and teach and there is nobody who is his equal
But the Kilesas do not like this and continually obstruct Dhamma and so those beings who like the Kilesas will generally be bored with Dhamma and the Dhamma is therefore not likely to reach their hearts even if they listen and practice for a long time
In the event that happens here and there please look at yourselves and you will be able to see this well enough without difficulty
Whatever way we go we must analyze
If we are to be pupils who have a teacher  our Supreme Teacher to teach us then we must try to do good so as to wash away all things which are evil and bad
Fighting them is bound to be hard and difficult to some extent which is only normal
We must constantly think like this  which is better than having the Kilesas of laziness and slothfulness coming to be our teacher and to drag us into ways that are base and low causing us to suffer Dukkha and torture without end or reason when we may be able to get free from Dukkha
Now is our opportunity and we ought to have organised and got ready for we are now complete in everything
Our bodies are in good health and we know that we are human beings who have found Buddhism
This is also an opportunity for us to develop virtue so that it goes down into the heart and so that we may reach the goal that we want
There is just the heart and Dhamma which will be able to give us the fulfillment of our hopes
We must try to get things which are good and right into the balance sheet of the heart  which does not die
Apart from that we cannot find anything that is certain because the whole world of mundane conventions is impermanent which includes our own bodies and whatever we rely upon we wait but for it to be destroyed and disappear time after time
We see this in every place all the time  it happens everywhere and this the Lord called Aniccam Dukkham Anatta which surrounds us both externally and internally
In this we cannot have any confidence apart from the development of virtue which is the training of oneself just to have an even steady virtue with this Dhamma
This is an important principle to bring our fixed aim to steady fulfillment
Such a heart wants to go onward all the time it does not want to remain in a mass of Dukkha and torture and it wants to live happily
If we talk about levels and standards in other words the heavens and Brahma worlds then the heart is the one that wants to go there and does not want to go down to the hells at all
In fact Dukkha is something that it does not want to experience in life or feel its touch at all
But then why does the world find it and feel its touch all the time
It is because of the deluding tricks of the Kilesas which are in command and more clever and sharp than all beings
They are the teachers that teach beings and drag them all down and submerge them even though they do not want to be submerged
What is it that is the teacher of the round of Samsara  that is the cleverest in the world nowadays
Just the Kilesas Tanha and Asava apart from these there is none in the three realms of relativity where all beings dwell
And there is none which can extract and get rid of this nature apart from that Dhamma which is called the Svakkhata Dhamma of the Lord Buddha
Whoever wants to go free beyond Dukkha and tries to scramble up practicing according to the Dhamma of the Lord will have a way and will be able to pass beyond it
Whoever is energetic in complaining about Dukkha can complain as he pleases but if we do not want to let the Kilesa laugh and mock us again and again we should constantly try to understand ourselves
Because when we arrive at the time that we are cornered with no way out and we are truly up against it  and a time such as that gets right into oneself  what will we do
We must raise the proposition and question ourselves well beforehand
When it is cold those things that make us warm we see at that time as being important and when it is hot what are those things which make us cool
Whatever they are we will consider them to be important at that time
When Dukkha comes to us what are those things which bring us Sukha
The other half of the pair which is linked to it is virtue and this is the means by which Dukkha can be diminished and got rid of  and it can get rid of Dukkha in a positive certain manner without any shadow of doubt because never have any of the Kilesas been able to overpower the Dhamma since time immemorial
Summarising Wherever there is virtue there is Sukha and a warm hearted nature
The following is a close simile to illustrate the meaning  It is like a man who falls into some water and there is nothing to grasp or hold on to at that time
Even if he has always been afraid of ghosts and death since he was born yet if a dead body were to float up to him while he was drowning and searching for some refuge for something to hold on to with great anxiety he would immediately grasp hold of that corpse as it floated by so as to save his life
At the same time he would forget his fear of ghosts which he had always had because his life is much more important than his fear
This is a simile to illustrate the life and Citta of someone at the time when being trapped and cornered with no way out truly gets into them
The last moment at the end of life is sure to be like this and the Citta is bound to think of various things such as thinking of virtue or thinking of evil that one recalls
When one has no virtue adhering to oneself sufficient to give one some warmth of heart one thinks of evil that one remembers as the only alternative
Then anxiety and sorrow arise and pile up within the Citta causing the anxiety and trouble gathering round to increase further and further so that it becomes overwhelming
If one has done virtuous things as soon as one thinks about this virtue the Citta immediately grasps at it and goes quite calm
This is much more so with those who have practiced virtue constantly  they need not be in doubt for that virtue is a companion a friend and one that one can trust one's life to more truly than anything in the world
We Buddhists should always understand about ourselves
Which means that the heart is the one thing that matters and it is to be explained from two points of view these being Firstly What is the teacher of the round of Samsara and secondly What is the teacher of freedom from the round of Samsara and both of these have just been explained
Please do not forget this
I shall now finish so that it may be translated to you
Asking this question makes me think that the questioner's basis of Dhamma is uncertain
Those who practice must have gone through this for if they have practiced Samadhi and if the Citta has gone deep down they must know
If they go to sleep and when they wake up nobody knows and if there is just the sound of sleepiness and lying down all the time how shall we know about the Citta
In doing Samadhi as soon as the Citta is about to go down if we do not let it go down and force it to work we will never be able to build up a firmness of the Citta which accords with the teaching of Samadhi for the attainment of calm
The word Samadhi does not mean sleeping and knowing nothing
One must know within oneself in particular and not know anything else apart from oneself
Have you ever practiced Samadhi

For the Citta which has gained calm with any given object of attention whatever method was used to do this may also be used to learn about Atta or Anatta accordingly but to begin with one should hold on to Atta Later on one gradually withdraws the attachment to Atta until one can completely get rid of it because the Citta is naturally complete and its own self
But it is not Self having the nature of Atta as mentioned above which is a mundane convention for it is free and therefore is different
Therefore there is a general delusion throughout the world in regard to what people have got in themselves and they are the same everywhere
If we ourselves practice the Citta will know itself
If the Citta is skilled mindfulness and wisdom are bound to become more and more subtle and then you will be able to know for yourself without having to ask anyone else
There is nothing that can go beyond the power of mindfulness and wisdom  and because all the Kilesas are afraid of the Dhamma which is mindfulness and wisdom there are no Kilesas of any sort which can go higher than the Dhamma which is mindfulness and wisdom if one trains oneself to become proficient in them
Those who practice generally know that Citta differ for there is nothing more subtle than the Citta and one cannot measure it
If the Citta has mindfulness and wisdom then one can follow it
This must depend on the mindfulness and wisdom which people have developed and whether it is much or little accordingly
It is said that at the time when the Lord Buddha was about to enter Parinibbana he entered Jhana Samapatti and went up from the first Jhana until he reached Saññavedayitanirodha
The Venerable Anuruddha Thera who was very skilled in the ways of the Citta set his Citta to follow the Lord Buddha in whichever Jhana the Citta of the Lord Buddha entered
In other words he went up through the four Rupa Jhanas and then through the four Arupa Jhanas until he reached Saññavedayitanirodha
He rested there for a moment and then he withdrew back through the Arupa Jhanas and the Rupa Jhanas until he reached the state of Citta of ordinary purity
Then he entered the first Jhana and went through to the fourth Jhana and then the Lord entered Parinibbana between the Rupa Jhanas and the Arupa Jhanas
From then on it was beyond the ability of anybody to follow and know because he had gone beyond and was free from every kind of mundane convention
While the Lord was entering the various Jhanas the Venerable Anuruddha Thera sent the flow of his Citta to follow the Lord without letting up and he knew following the state of the Citta of the Lord Buddha from step to step
When the other Savakas asked him Has the Lord entered Parinibbana yet he answered Not yet and he told them each time the Lord entered and left each Jhana and he was able to tell them what happened step by step until the moment when the Lord entered Parinibbana
Why was he able to know from moment to moment the progress of the Lord Buddha's Citta while he was entering and leaving each Jhana for this is very different from us who also have minds that receive and know various things up to a certain level
The knowledge and ability of the Citta that has been fully trained is as different from the ordinary Citta as the sky is from the earth
For the Citta which is filled with a heavy burden as if there were a cesspit loading and weighing it down all the time can in no way be compared with the Citta which has become fully purified
Clever people are therefore likely to believe in those who have knowledge and ability above their own capacity and to accept them as teachers
Like the followers of the Buddha who believed in the Lord as being the world teacher and as their refuge
This differs from stupid people who deludedly think that they are clever until their cleverness leads them to breakdowns destruction and ruin and even then it is unlikely that they will feel themselves to be in fact what they are
There is a lot of this kind of cleverness in the world of human beings  and it seems to be increasing at a rate beyond one's imagination  until one fears that there will be no world for us to live on
Meditation is the process of learning about or looking into the body and examining the mind and reading the story of the heart for the Citta writes about various things the whole time but having written we never read it
Even if we never know that we have thought things that are good or evil on a particular day or time it is the character of the Citta to like thinking and imagining in various ways and this will show itself when we practice meditation because the Citta struggles and moves about a lot and cannot remain still and contented
The Citta of ordinary people are generally speaking like this everywhere and it is more difficult to break and stop than anything else
Therefore because the Citta is normally a subtle thing it must rely on mindfulness and wisdom to supervise and look after it
The more we examine what is wrong and right evil and good in ourselves the more we are likely to find that there is no limit and that the things that are faulty are many
Therefore the principles of Buddhism teach us to contemplate and look at what is good and what is faulty in us and sometimes it shows things that are unpleasant and sometimes pleasant
The teachings of Buddhism are the best tools for doing this and so generally they teach more about the heart than anything else
For the only tools that are able to match up to the ways of the heart are the principles of Dhamma and it depends on us whether we will be able to equip ourselves suitably with these tools or not
Making things of all kinds requires the use of tools and if the craftsman is well skilled these things will be beautiful and useful
This is equally so with one's body speech and mind for the body is like a growing tree which may be either softwood or hardwood but the thing that matters is that the craftsman takes it and changes it into something useful such as a table or chair depending on what is wanted
When it is finished it will have become beautiful ornamental or useful according to the type of wood and the ability of the craftsman
Similarly when the body speech and mind have been altered and corrected in accordance with the principles of Dhamma by putting forward the utmost effort with full commitment they will become one's treasure having more value than all other things
This is because people are not the same as animals and their value whether high or low depends on virtue as their wealth and not on their flesh and hide
The world considers that the value of animals is in their flesh and hide and other parts of the body and therefore when they die nobody is distressed
But this is not the case with people for they must also have good and seemly behavior to give assurance of their value
Good behavior of body speech and mind is the value that raises up human beings and this value and beauty does not alter with time which differs from the physical body that goes the way of nature and changes all the time
If one has value and virtue as an ornament to decorate oneself this remains and does not deteriorate even when the body gradually deteriorates
It is particularly important when training in meditation that one should try to restrain one's Citta and stop imagining all sorts of things so that one may get some calm and peace and then one will begin to see an increase in the value of one's heart
When doing meditation try to let the Citta keep its imagining within the work that one wants to promote such as Buddho Buddho which is work that will cause the Citta to become calm
When one tries to do this with interest and with mindfulness to control the Citta it will be able to attain a state of calm without being troubled by emotionally disturbing objects
The heart which is void of disturbing things will be happy calm and peaceful and this will be experienced within the heart at that time
Calm and happiness of heart without any emotionally disturbing things is a happiness that is a most longed for refuge and the Citta which is established with only a single knowing was called Ekaggatacitta by the Lord
Ekaggatacitta is to know one It is a happiness of heart that has nothing equal to it
For even though the Lord Buddha who established the profound Dhamma entered Parinibbana years ago the whole excellence of it is still this refuge in which all Buddhists have faith and pay homage to without ceasing
When the end of the Buddha era of this Lord Buddha is reached there will still be another Buddha who will come anew attain Enlightenment and teach the world and this will happen again and again endlessly
When the heart becomes calm and breaks free from emotionally disturbing things one will immediately know the wonder of the heart even though one has never known it before because this is a most strange and wonderful thing in the life of someone who has never known calm of heart
When the Citta is calm it is not liable to have any thoughts and imaginations giving rise to emotionally disturbing things to trouble oneself and cause confusion and distraction but it remains in a state of Eka Citta Eka Dhamma and it just stays in this state until it rises up and withdraws from it
After this it thinks and imagines various emotionally disturbing things according to its normal habits of thinking and imagining
If the Citta can go down into a state of calm even just once it will arouse the enthusiasm in someone who practices in an amazing way and he will hardly be able to forget it for even a day
In fact it will make him try to practice meditation more and more
Therefore someone who has already seen results from practice is likely to put forward strong effort without slacking
Let us respectfully put aside the knowledge that we have learned from the Buddhist texts for the time being for I would like to explain enough from this viewpoint of practice to point out the way
Because by learning about Dhamma one must come to know Dhamma and by practicing Dhamma one must come to know the results for the Dhamma has never been a secret thing since the Lord Buddha's Enlightenment up to the present time and the Dhamma which was taught so that we know it now still remains true and is not in the least deficient
The practice which accords with Buddhism is still there to give results which are neither more nor less than was taught in the past  except that the person who practices may not be capable in the way that those who practiced in ancient times were in which case the results will not be the same for the causes are insufficient and the results will be weak
Causes without effects do not exist so what or who should one blame
Therefore one should correct one's reasoning for right now who is it that is obstructing Dhamma and not walking the way that the Lord taught apart from oneself
At the time of the Buddha Dhamma was true Dhamma and they learned Dhamma so as to experience Dhamma and truly practice it and they did not hold back and turn Dhamma into the world
I would like to tell you that I myself am not entirely good in all ways
In coming here to visit you in London there is both good and bad that I have brought with me and if it turns out to be a mistake I hope that I will have the forgiveness of all of you who are listening
I will now give you an example of turning Dhamma into the world To begin with I studied the texts and managed to pass the exams and attain the grade of Dhamma Tri and I was very pleased at this  and it aroused a group of Kilesas
Later on I attained to Dhamma To and Eka and then I became big and puffed up and the Kilesas increased and a big mass of them arose so that I could not get away from them
Within me I was full of nothing but Kilesas and I thought I was clever
Later on I became Maha Parien and I thought I was even more clever
But in truth I was only clever at remembering the names of the Kilesas Tanha and Asavas and many others
I knew only the names but this never struck me for if it had I could have got some of the Kilesas however few free from my heart
There was just the thought that I was clever to attain this grade and that grade
If one does not look one does not know when Dhamma turns into the world
As soon as I turned and became interested in practice and the Citta aimed at the meanings of Dhamma the swollen pride gradually diminished and being a Dhamma scholar of this grade and Parien of that grade began to lose their meaning until I felt ashamed of them and I did not want to breathe the title Maha at all
Then this again became another type of Kilesa for I understood that this was right thought
Previous to this I liked to have my name and the title Maha well to the fore but now I wanted Maha to be in the background
The Kilesas then are Dhamma that is false  that has changed into the world When I had practiced more Dhamma these Kilesas gradually broke up and disappeared from the heart
In telling you this I don't intend to insinuate anything against anyone for I am just telling you about myself and how I used to be and this is what I call Dhamma turning into the world If one does not understand Dhamma one will never be able to cure the Kilesas which can hide themselves in subtle and strange ways
The word Samadhi which so far I had only known by name then became apparent to the heart
When I studied the texts as related above I memorized by repetition until I became skilled at it both by mouth and in the heart but I came to know the truth of some of these things when I practiced as hard as I could
But here I do not mean that I knew these things until the Kilesas arose as big as a mountain  while self was the size of a mouse or an elephant the essential meaning is the same
I am just telling you the story of the Kilesas which are found in the Citta and the owner must be one who knows them for himself and gets rid of them by himself
Samadhi is firm stability of the heart and it became steadily more firm and stable
Then I knew both the name and the nature of Samadhi and I knew it with my own heart
When I examined the elements and Khandhas I saw that the body is made up of the four Dhatus both internally and externally and all of them are within the scope of the TiLakkhana  Aniccam Dukkham and Anatta
Concerning Pañña I had already got the name of it and I had seen the heart do work using wisdom as hard as it was able to continuously without letting up  which is the way of those who practice
Mindfulness and wisdom are Dhammas which one knows for oneself
Then there are no doubts left about what is called MaggaPhala for Magga is the mindfulness and wisdom which steadily makes the Kilesas break away and leave the heart and makes one see in the heart that Dukkha Samudaya Nirodha and Magga have been truths right from the beginning
When mindfulness and wisdom can read the truth rightly until it has been accepted by the heart doubt comes to an end and one who has no doubt can live peacefully without being disturbed by anything ever again
This is the end of the story
Dhamma then is Dhamma the world is the world each of them is true and each of them exists independently by itself and the disturbance between the Citta and all things no longer takes place
The phrase Tesam Vupasamo Sukho does not mean that having died because the Sankharas have ceased is the only Sukha
But that the quelling of those Sankharas that are the basis of Samudaya that can cause the Kilesas to arise is then also Sukha even though one is not yet dead
Today we have explained Dhamma as Dhamma and Dhamma which becomes changed into the way of the world If one can practice as they did in the time of the Buddha then one will get results as they did in the time of the Buddha
But it is a sorry thing that Dhamma is the truth yet we generally like to play with it and the thing that shows up until it becomes bothersome is the argument which is generally put in the words Magga Phala and Nibbana can no longer be attained in this age anymore and that Whoever practices well and however much has no hope of penetrating It is as if there were somebody who monopolised Magga Phala and Nibbana just for himself as though he were omniscient even though he is so full of Kilesas that nobody is bold enough to compete
Then Buddhism is liable to be just a name
As for the truth of Dhamma in the circle of those who understand that they have faith in Buddhism they have been robbed by the Kilesas and plundered taken and eaten so that there is almost nothing left in the heart body and speech at all
If they continue to oppose Dhamma by understanding as they do now in the future I am afraid it will be a religion of text books and there will just be the names left
Who does not love their wife and children
And it is normal to cherish wealth possessions and servants but the Lord gave up all this because he saw that his way was better
The Lord Buddha and the Savakas in no small numbers fought and made up their minds to turn towards the way of this Dhamma and to practice and fight with the world within the realm of the heart until they won and gained freedom
As for us we have been defeated by the Kilesas in every becoming and birth
Do we never think that we would like to defeat them
Or are we so afraid to get free from Dukkha that we do not like opposing them
To compare the two what is worse and more cruel than the Kilesas and what is better at leading people to what is most excellent than Dhamma
Which will one take as best
Good and bad we know them already from the above comparison
As for the Kilesas they dwell in our hearts and they are already there
If they were excellent we should have been excellent long ago so there is no need to choose  it is a waste of time
But if one examines Dukkha and it truly becomes so strong that one cannot stand it when it is incredibly strong then one must give way a little
But the important point here is that the Citta is not willing to give way entirely and withdraw
One needs to understand this for if the Citta sticks at it it can quell the Dukkha
Because the Citta examines and divides up the Dukkha to find out whether it is Dukkha of the body or of the Citta
If the Citta is skilled in wisdom one will probably be fully cognizant and able to extract feeling
Then something wonderful such as one has never before experienced will happen at this time  and one will never forget it
We must still wait until we are ready and able to dispose of everything and not imitate the ways of others when we are not yet ready
But we should also not think only about whether other people are going to be sorry for we ought to consider the disadvantages that are inherently there for ourselves
Then we will not be careless due to other people being the sole cause
The truth is that the Lord Buddha and the arahants had already got rid of attachments in the Khandhas but they still relied on the Khandhas everyday until Nibbana
There is no indication that they broke away from the Khandhas and went to stay anywhere else
I am a person living in the world the world is angry so I can be angry the world laughs so I can laugh
We are not brick Bhikkhus or cement Bhikkhus
Here in London the weather is cold and it is getting colder
When I have gone I will think of my brothers and sisters in London but I am not sure whether I shall be able to come again nor when
But some of my brothers and sisters in London may be able to go and visit me in Thailand
My brothers and sisters in Thailand are anxious for Tan Acharn and I am anxious for them
This is because being associated with each other in Buddhism one is bound to be concerned for each other always in regard to Sukha and Dukkha which is found in people throughout the world which is something that I can help to reduce or remove with whatever strength I have
Comment This morning at the time for giving Pindapata food to the Bhikkhus at Dhammapadipa Vihara Colonel Mom Rajawong Pongtit Diskul Assistant Military Attache to the Thai Embassy in London and Mr
Brian Dyas and Mrs
Sue Tucker of the Hampshire Buddhist Society gave Pindapata food to the Bhikkhus
Later they asked Ven
Acariya Maha Boowa if he would answer questions as follows
There is a story of a Kammatthana Bhikkhu who was newly ordained and was afraid of ghosts
His teacher took him to stay in a cremation ground and told him to sit here and the teacher said he would go and sit over there some distance away
His teacher also told him to sit and close his eyes and meditate until he came to call him and then he should gently come out of meditation
The teacher then went to sit a little way off stayed for a short while and then got up and returned to the Wat
As for the newly ordained Bhikkhu he sat with his back to where the Teacher sat and did his meditation practice without any thought of fear because he thought that the Teacher was sitting watching out for the ghosts
After a long time a little apprehensive thought about ghosts arose
Then he slowly got up and walked to find the place where the Teacher said he would be sitting
When he got there and did not see the Teacher fear arose and he ran to the Wat
The Teacher then said to him I have not yet called you so why have you come here Then he spoke sternly to him This shows that when you thought the teacher was there with you you were not afraid but as soon as you did not see the Teacher where you thought he was fear of ghosts arose stronger and stronger until you had to run to the Wat without waiting for me to come and get you This indeed is the nature of the Citta that deceives oneself without there being any need for a ghost to come and deceive one at all
Therefore in saying that Indian Devas get into her and make her afraid it is most likely to be her own Citta that creates its own deception
People who practice Dhamma also do this for they speak about Dhamma and in particular about the field of practice and when they speak about meditation they are likely to become more and more engrossed until they forget time
The hours pass and they never notice it when they talk together about Dhamma and practice and however many are present it is a fascinating story
The Teacher trains and teaches them about the attainment of Samadhi the Samapattis mindfulness and wisdom
They talk about getting rid of  getting rid of the Kilesas of various kinds by means of the power of mindfulness wisdom faith and effort step by step and this makes them even more engrossed in following what he says
Even if the owner has not yet been able to experience Dhamma in any of the ways that his Teacher has it still makes him cheerful and joyful in the Dhamma which the Teacher has practiced known and seen and come to tell them in a manner that is fascinating so that they never feel that they have had too much of it
The Lord said that The flavor of Dhamma is superior to all other flavors of all flavors none tastes better than Dhamma
If the taste of Dhamma were not so supremely excellent the Three Worlds would be unlikely to have paid homage to and worshipped the Dhamma and then the Dhamma would not have been considered as supreme it would not be suitable as a refuge as something to hold on to as something certain nor as something in which all good and honest people can have implicit faith
The extent to which all Buddhists pay homage to and have faith in the Dhamma is because the Dhamma is a thing of excellence as befits the renown and prestige of Dhamma that spreads out from each of the Buddhas and the Savaka Sangha of each of the World Teachers respectively until it came down to us
That it came down to us was entirely due to those who after having partaken of the taste of Dhamma with their hearts then brought out this Dhamma which they had known seen and experienced and taught it to the world right up to the present time
They did not guess or suppose that the taste of Dhamma was superior to all other tastes for they knew the taste of Dhamma as well as seeing absolutely clearly into all aspects of Dhamma
Then they brought out that knowledge that revelation and proclaimed and taught the World in accordance with the fundamental truths which they had known and seen by taking their own knowing and seeing as evidence in proclaiming Dhamma and teaching the World
When we say Dhammam Saranam Gacchami how much depth or profundity has it
It is not a superficial Dhamma which one can know and see on the surface and teach the world in a superficial way
For the Lord knew the truth and taught the truth of Dhamma to the world at all levels
Therefore those who listen should listen with interest and practice with sincerity
The result which they get from Dhamma will be Dhamma that reaches the heart stage by stage going right up until the various kinds of Kilesas are removed
In fact they can all be removed entirely to the satisfaction of one's heart so that one knows this clearly in one's own heart as it says in the Dhamma teaching Sanditthiko  knowing for oneself and seeing for oneself
Even if the Lord Buddha was sitting in front of one one would not then waste time asking any questions because the truth is the same truth and the same experience
But in the practice of Dhamma amongst all those who are the highest sages they are very careful because Dhamma is not like the world If Dhamma were like the world it would not be called Dhamma because it would be the same thing as saying the world and just this one word would be enough and it would be all mixed in with the way of the world
But there is this word because Dhamma and the world are not the same and even though they are both in the world together they are not one and the same thing
It is only that they are here interfused with each other but not the same thing for they just dwell together like all of us here are just dwelling together at present  Bhikkhus and laypeople dwelling together but not one and the same men and women dwelling together but not one and the same children and adults dwelling together but not one and the same
Thus although they are living together they are separate individuals each one merely living there
It is like this with Dhamma and the world
The highest Sages practiced until they knew by experience clearly in their own hearts and they then led the religion steadily and consistently without acting in gross or unseemly ways in the eyes and ears of those who had faith in Buddhism
This refers to the Lord Buddha and the Savaka arahants who brought Buddhism to us for us to see and admire in the most beautiful and seemly way
They did not bring it in a manner that would surprise and disturb the listener
Here I will tell you an illustrative story for you who are practicing Dhamma
For it may be with some of you that this Dhamma overflows and when there is occasion you let it out or show it off without any shame or feeling of being open to criticism
This happens because of a desire to become famous or distinguished  which is nothing but the work of the Kilesas pushing it out
Therefore I will tell you this story of the wise men who followed the way of the Buddha  a moral lesson
The Venerable Assaji had penetrated and become an arahant with all the five Pañcavaggi who were the first five Savakas of the Lord Buddha
The Ven
Aññakondañña was the first and Ven
Upatissa who became the Ven
Sariputta the highest of the Savakas placed symbolically on the right hand side of the Lord Buddha had at this time not yet become one of the Savakas and he was ordained in the institution of wandering religious mendicants and practicing according to the customs of such people at that time
When he saw Ven
Assaji who was very beautiful and seemly in all his actions and manners  walking forward withdrawing backwards looking to the right and left with a very composed deportment which instilled great respect and confidence he followed stealthily behind him
As soon as they were out of the village he went up and asked him where he lived and about his Uppajjhaya and Acariya
He replied only briefly to the question about what Dhamma the Teacher or his Acariya taught saying I have no very great knowledge so I will just speak of it in brief for you to hear
'Ye Dhamma Hetupabhava etc'  'All Dhammas arise from a cause when they die away the cause must die away first' The Lord Buddha taught like this
That is all
Then Sariputta the Paribbajaka penetrated through and immediately became Sotapanna
As for Assaji who was the teacher he did not then say of himself that he was one of the arahants in fact he did not say anything at all
But Ven
Sariputta may have been able to know his attainment in Dhamma when he heard the Dhamma in brief which Ven
Assaji taught him because in the stage of Sotapatti Magga and Sotapatti Phala it is possible to penetrate deeply and to know the truth of someone who has a level of attainment higher than oneself
Therefore Ven
Assaji was able to teach him a wonderful kind of Dhamma which he had never heard before so that he penetrated Dhamma
But it seemed from the texts that Ven
Sariputta never heard Ven
Assaji say that he was an arahant because Ven
Assaji did not make any outward show of being an arahant
This is the first example to illustrate what was previously said
The second story concerns Mr
Kamanit who met the Lord Buddha in the house of a potter
When the Lord asked him where he was going he said he was going to see the Buddha
The Lord asked Where are you going so as to see the Buddha
and he replied I am going a long way for the Lord is sure to be at Savatthi But the Lord did not say that he was the Lord Buddha
How profound was the subtlety of the wisest sage in not telling him for the Lord knew all the ways of cause and effect and that to tell him would have led to some form of loss
When he had weighed up the situation he saw that it was of greater value not to tell so he left without saying anything about his being the Lord Buddha even though Mr
Kamanit was still searching for the Lord
As soon as the dawn came he left the Lord Buddha and shortly met Ven
Sariputta and Ven
Moggallana who were walking along the road towards him going to see the Lord Buddha in the pottery and they questioned Mr
Kamanit who said that he was going to see the Buddha
Both of the Savakas asked him whether when he came through that place he had met anyone there
He said that he met a Samana in the pottery and he was one whose behavior and manners made one respect and trust him very much
He was zealously practicing all last night and he taught Dhamma in a melodious beautiful voice and what he said went to the heart and was very impressive
But I am still not satisfied and want to go and meet the Lord Buddha so I have come from there
Ven
Sariputta and Ven
Moggallana did not say anything to let him know that the person he had met was the Lord Buddha
Why did they say nothing
Because this is the way of the sages for if anyone was to say anything it was for the Lord Buddha to say it first
For whatever the need was to let Mr
Kamanit stay for some time and then go on and meet Sariputta and Moggallana on the road they only spoke together when his back was turned saying Eh
That fellow has no idea that he has already met the Buddha but the Lord did not say anything to him and in short because of that we cannot say anything also This is how the Sages immediately understand each other and their knowledge and understanding does not lead to disagreement unlike people who have all the Kilesas who only want to sell themselves and incite the Kilesas making them increasingly pile up in the Citta instead of making the effort to get rid of them
In the practice of Dhamma in the sphere of Buddhism this sort of thing tends to happen all the time
Therefore I have anxious thoughts though in truth I should be more anxious for myself than for others
But I cannot help being anxious for all our companions including Upasakas and Upasikas and all others who have Saddha in a gradually widening circle
Suppose in a particular case something happens that is improper and disturbing in a way for one who wants to be a learned sage following the path of the Lord Buddha it is likely to cause deterioration and harm to himself and to Buddhism
Those who practice Dhamma should therefore always be selfcontrolled and careful to maintain virtue because Dhamma is different from the world
In the practice of Dhamma even though someone truly aims for Magga Phala and Nibbana until he is able to penetrate to the desired goal of Arahatta Phala such a person would not say that he knew that he had attained Enlightenment
Why
Because how could the words I have attained Enlightenment be of any use as a means of helping the listener
One cannot see how but they could be a basis for vainly boosting one's own state in accordance with what the world praises  that is about all
The Lord therefore did not do this but he used the method of giving advice over and over again by teaching the way of causes and the way of results which it was appropriate to teach in a manner that was more or less strong or gentle accordingly
He therefore taught according to the level of attainment of whoever came to be trained and depending on the time place and people and their status and state he taught and trained them in ways that were suitable
He taught according to the ways of cause and effect but he did not say that he was accomplished in Dhamma up to such and such a level for this would be an unseemly thing to do
The Lord was not addicted to speaking because it is not in harmony or appropriate to the status of a sage
In the time of the Buddha the Bhikkhus had great confidence in each other and they were very careful about this
Even in the present time if there is someone who has truly followed the way of the Lord Buddha one should understand that he will not deviate from this track
This is however not so with those present day Sages of whom there are a large number and one can count the one who is speaking as one of them also that are always overflowing and waiting to go overboard If this is the case it shows that the excess which is spilling over the edge of the Citta is not Dhamma
If there is true knowing and seeing let it just resound within one's own heart  do not let it go out externally where it can create disturbance
A sharp blade should be kept in its sheath where it will be safe
To throw it about the place whatever word or blade or weapon it is is dangerous both to oneself and others
If one puts it away properly it is not dangerous in fact one can get nothing but value from it
When someone advertises boastfully saying I have attained Sotapanna Sakadagami Anagami or arahant there is no reason why anyone who hears this should be glad in fact it may change their faith in him making it gradually diminish and they then see the Kilesas of that person quite clearly and they just feel wearied and fed up and that there is nothing else worth respecting in that person
Therefore all those who practice if they are people who aim truly for Dhamma must aim for reason rather than announcing Dhamma of this kind outwardly which is not the way of the Lord Buddha  but the way of a rotten fish which announces itself so that flies swarm around
Announcing and selling rotten fish to the flies is the way of rotten fish
When we hear or smell them they irritate our ears and nose and the irritation seeps into the heart
Why is it so irritating as this for if the Dhamma is a true Dhamma when these things go into the Citta they make one feel irritated and wearied of it all
Various people variously aim for gain and Dhamma of the higher levels
But when any of them announced things of such a kind that one cannot find any reason in them it means that they are repressed in their hearts  or they have a hunger in their hearts
So when they say these things they are not good to hear
But even though the person himself may not be aware of his state if other people admonish and warn him he should listen
If he is also a person who has been aiming for gain and Dhamma he should become aware of himself and be more restrained and careful of himself in the future
Do not turn yourself into a rotten fish within Buddhism for this Dhamma is sweet smelling and it has led people to respect and pay homage to it throughout the world for a long time
Today I will just explain this far to begin with
Ven
Pañña will translate for you
If I speak a lot he will forget much of what I have said already
A story of the present time Professor Ouay
I wonder if you have heard this one
It has been repeated so much that it has now become something of a legend
There is a Bhikkhu of the present time and not very long ago while Ven
Acariya Mun was alive who went together with some Bhikkhus to practice and train themselves in the way of Kammatthana Dhamma to a hill but there is no need to say in which province they went to do their meditation
While doing their meditation at about midnight this Bhikkhu thought that he had penetrated Dhamma and become arahant but what he was investigating in his meditation is not known
His hand felt in his handbag and he brought out his snuff pipe which he blew as a whistle  Peep
The other two Bhikkhus who were with him on this hill quickly ran to find him for they did not know what danger he was in
They never thought that if he had penetrated Dhamma he would blow a whistle so they thought there was some danger
The two Bhikkhus said nothing  they probably did not have the heart to
This thing about reaching arahantship may be alright but what was more important than that was Oho
Having attained arahantship you blow a whistle what level is this This was their doubt but they did not say anything because having thought about it in various ways they returned tired of it
Later on one night and once again about midnight the two Bhikkhus heard the whistle blow again
They thought He's probably attained to nobody knows what level now But they could not not go and see him because the three of them were living together in case of real danger coming to them so it was their duty to help each other
So the two of them came back to look for the Bhikkhu who blew the whistle and they asked him
You blew the whistle again this time so what further level have you attained
Have you reached the level of madness for whether arahant or whatever else it's a real nuisance This time he announced The other night I thought wrongly I had attained so I blew the whistle to call you and tell you for I was very glad
But then tonight I examined and found that I had not attained so I had to blow the whistle so as to let you know that in truth I had not attained The two Bhikkhus saw the funny side of it and felt sorry about the madness of this whistling arahant They told other Bhikkhus until it became a wellknown story
There is another story about this Bhikkhu for one day he was sitting in meditation and saw a disc of light like the sun as big as a coconut falling down in front of him
His Citta had attained Samadhi and saw light and it went out following it
The light moved away so he got up from where he was sitting and followed it without knowing what he was doing
The light went up a tree and he went up following it also
The light then floated up into the sky and disappeared
Then his awareness returned and he realised that he was up a tree and he wept until other Bhikkhus came running to see and to help him to get down
Then they asked him all about it and they heard that Samadhi had led him to float up into this tree
More than two years ago a Samanera told me a story when I was staying in a certain Wat
This Samanera came up to see me at the same time as another Bhikkhu and he told about knowing various things
I listened right through until he had finished and then I said  Samanera you must be careful you will grasp at shadows or go up a tree following a light I did not know what this Samanera had been like in the past but later on someone told me that this Samanera had already led some Bhikkhus to follow a light
The light led him into the forest and the Samanera ran after it and called the Bhikkhus to come and help to catch this light and he got those Bhikkhus who did not know about this to follow him and search for this light
There was a lot of noise and commotion until a Bhikkhu who was there and knew about him came to see and stopped it and dispersed them
Truly speaking this type of Citta is not found in many people in fact only about five percent are like this
If they are under the right teacher people of this sort are good and they have adventurous natures
I have also been of this kind but I did not send the Citta out externally for I knew what it was up to  light shooting up as though flying up into the sky so strong it seemed that if one should die at that time there would have been nothing left to cremate
I knew about it then and withdrew the Citta to its original base
As soon as the Citta saw this it immediately died away
The owner must go through many mad things like this then he will know about various things concerning those who practice enough for his needs and he can correct people without going off the path or flying up into the sky  even without wings
At one time I was sitting doing meditation in a shelter in a village in a place where there was a very fierce Pob which could even possess a Bhikkhu
I was doing meditation in the forest at
o'clock in the morning and saw a person coming whom the villagers had said was the Pob His eyes were shifty and restless and he came in to where I was resting and then walked off to another village
While doing meditation I did not know where I was and as soon as the ghost came and met me while I was sitting in Samadhi meditation I ducked and then my body fell down with a thump
When I became aware of myself I was very amused for I knew that the Citta had done this to me but I did not tell anyone about it
Whatever one sees and feels one must examine with wisdom to find out for sure what it is and one must find the way to cure it
If anything comes one's way and one assumes that it is absolutely real and true one will deludedly go wrong
One must know for oneself and examine oneself constantly
If one does not know one cannot teach others
The characteristics of some Cittas are very strange and if they do not have a teacher they will be lost
But if they do have a teacher to give them careful advice such people can quickly make valuable gains which they can use to advantage
But they must train in mindfulness and wisdom so as to know what the Citta is up to then it will not be able to get lost and will be of widespread value  more than one would imagine
The Citta and the objects of the Citta are quite bizarre and it is difficult to describe what truly happens
But in the case of those who have similar characteristics who also practice Dhamma and who have had similar experiences they can speak together and understand each other
This is like people who learn a technical subject and can speak together about it whereas others cannot understand
This story is an allegory for people who practice Dhamma
In other words if one reads a lot then one will begin to go from Atta to Anatta to not grasping or believing anything until one has no principles to take hold of
One must hold on and use Atta while one is practicing Dhamma in successively higher levels in the same way as one takes hold of a ladder and goes up step by step
Having passed any one step one does not hold on to that rung and try to carry it with one
Thus one goes up until one reaches the room at the top where one wants to go
Then one leaves the ladder behind without trying to hold on to it
So one goes into the room and rests and relaxes happily
This is the way with Anicca Dukkha and Anatta for finally one discards them but one cannot discard them before this because one must depend on them to go up step by step discarding each previous step until one is able to discard the lot holding nothing
Just now we were speaking about those who do harm to Buddhism either intentionally or unintentionally
Things which are wrong always were wrong but they are things which have already happened in the past arising from things which are true or deceptive genuine or artificial and internal or external
Truly speaking they arise only in the heart for there is a great deal of deceptiveness in each of our hearts including the one who is telling you this at present who has been like this and known about himself because of his training in mindful awareness  or because of having studied constantly the state of his Citta
Thus he was able to know which things are deceptive and which are true
Generally speaking there are only deceptive things constructed so that we deludedly go after them without being in the least aware that they are superdeceptions
For in fact we think that they are entirely true so we believe in them and go after them without putting up any counterreaction at all as a means of resisting or proving this kind of thinking
For example a person sits in meditation and in the first three seconds he feels that it is true
He fixes his attention on Buddho Buddho and he feels that it is the true Buddho for four or five seconds until he reaches one minute and then all the false things start to flow from the Citta more and more giving birth to children grandchildren and great grandchildren branching and spreading out and all of it is deception
Meanwhile the word Buddho has disappeared where to one does not know and all that is left is the story of emotionally charged objects and situations with which he has been used to thinking and imagining and deceiving himself
This is the means by which he is dragged away without being aware of it and after that assenting to go along fascinated at once going off engrossed with these false things
Buddho then disappears and Anapanasati is silent  even though he is still breathing  but it is silent as regards paying attention silent as regards the way of fixing his attention with determination and with mindfulness  all this has disappeared into silence
As soon as he is able to recollect himself he says I have done meditation for long enough but I did not see any result arise whatsoever why was that It is right that thoughts of this sort should arise but then he goes wrong again
In other words thoughts such as this are as if to say that he sees the fault in himself but he does not think I did not practice meditation for this sort of result but for some other kind of result of what sort I don't know For this would call his attention to the fact that he should have mindfulness
But he returns to his previous state of delusion  again saying I have sat for a long time and I think I will rest for a short while and after I get up I will really have a go at it But he does not sleep for a short while nor just a little for as soon as he goes to sleep he sleeps deeply until the sun has risen and when he wakes Oh goodness The next day he does it again and so it goes on deceitfully continually
The next day it starts off with three seconds at the beginning and four seconds the day after and so on getting worse steadily
This is the way of those who are superdeceptive
Apart from this he also harms himself saying Here I have been practicing meditation for a long time and I do not see that I have gained anything in thoughts or virtue and why should I go on doing this meditation
It is most likely that I am a person with unfortunate tendencies of character with little merit and little virtue which are not appropriate to the way and the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha for if I go on doing this it will not lead to anything of value and it will be nothing but a waste of time
It is better to stop entirely and this without ever thinking whether stopping like this is truly better or whether stopping meditation is truly a good thing
For if it was truly good people all over this world who never do any meditation ought to be good people since long ago
Again one can return and think How can stopping be better than doing meditation
For having done this meditation and not yet seen any results if I stop in what way will it truly be better
From what did the lack of results come Just from myself It cheats me continually for what is false externally and false within the Citta finds it good to stay there
Whatever things are false those which are false within oneself are the important ones
For deceiving oneself is a very important thing which one should examine and investigate
All of you have been cheated and deceived enough already
The owner's heart deceiving the owner
What has been said above briefly is enough to be able to know how much one has been deceived by what is debased
One should know that the first three or four seconds of practice are good but that the next three or four are not and then one should establish mindfulness and enter the practice again and go on establishing and reentering the practice again and again continually
Then the time will come when it knows at once when the Citta displays anything which is going in the wrong direction
One will begin to know what is going against one's intended purpose and when one begins to know one will begin to establish mindfulness and to set the Citta to do the practice anew
Knowing one enters into the practice again and again and then later on one knows continuously
One comes to know what is unreliable and one knows that the lack of those results of the Citta that one wants is because of this
As soon as one determines to practice truly and properly the false side of oneself is likely to do the same thing
In other words the Kilesas wait to try and get in during those times when one is off guard and unmindful
If one has set one's determination one's posture and one's direction firmly they give way
But give way here should not be understood to mean that they give way and lie down like we do
They give way waiting and watching and as soon as and whenever they can get at you they immediately do so pouncing on you quicker than a cat after a rat and then they disappear silent
They wait to hit and beat and smash in whenever one is offguard
If one is not offguard they do nothing but when one is overconfident that one is not offguard that is when they are sure to be encouraged and one is cheated continually  probably in every instance
This Acharn who is telling you this at present has also been like this
Therefore it is important to search for a method and a suitable place for reforming the owner and helping him to practice diligently in many directions and ways as I have written in the Biography of Tan Acharn Mun or in The Practice of Kammatthana in the manner of the Ven
Acariya Mun or in the book called Forest Dhamma
But Bhikkhus are not the same as lay people for wherever they go it is convenient and comfortable
The place where they practice is convenient and comfortable because they have only one duty
Like when they go into the forest and hills and frightening places because there are such places and there truly are various types of fierce animals such as tigers and bears and snakes
When one goes to stay in such places one's feelings change
For example being lazy in regard to maintaining effort gradually diminishes
One has little laziness and as soon as one goes into a critical situation all laziness vanishes
I do not know where it goes but one is left with no way out and nowhere to escape to
Then mindfulness comes of itself at once and when one determines to practice with effort why does one break into a sweat
One sweats because of the fear of death and at such a time mindfulness is good
Sometimes it even happens that a tiger roars repeatedly right by the path one uses for walking Cankama This has in fact happened to me and it does not come just to have a talk
It has happened to me many times how many I don't know but that tiger roaring there was no small cat  it was a big striped tiger
At that moment it seems as if all one's hair stands on end  and why is it that one shivers even though it is not cold
But the Citta is not allowed to withdraw and it goes round and round descending to here
Whether one lives or dies at this time one submits oneself to the Lord Buddha
Now there is just the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha to guard and preserve one's heart and if one's time has truly come one's Citta is not careless and unguarded and one has submitted one's Citta to the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha in all ways and whenever one goes one is prepared to go
While I live may I have mindfulness and may I not be caught at a disadvantage
Whatever comes to take me and eat me so be it but I will not abandon the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha The Citta submits completely and as soon as the Citta has submitted to the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha all longing ceases
The longing or cherishing of life is no longer there
Affection and possessiveness for the body have all gone and there remains only the Citta which is singleminded in the way and in Dhamma
Fear disappears entirely at that time and there is no trace of it left at all
The Citta has concentrated together and plumbed straight down to the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha in the heart completely and it seems then as if nothing can ever come to disturb one again
When the Citta has plumbed straight down it becomes full of strength and all fear disappears and after that no matter whether the tiger roars or comes right up in front of one one feels able to go up to it and stroke it unconcernedly with Metta and sympathy and a feeling that one has a close friendship with it because both of us are the same in having birth old age pain and death
In feeling this one has not even the slightest thought that the tiger is dangerous and that it may harm one if one were to go and stroke it
When this sort of thing happens there is just a feeling of intimacy and gentleness with Metta for it and therefore all fear disappears
There are many ways and methods for training and disciplining the Citta
But once one has found a good basis and something which one can use to recollect and reflect upon one may in the future bring up this basis and put it into practice
Then wherever one goes to live in whatever sort of place when one is at one's wit's end and cornered that which one has done and gained results from will immediately come to one
In confronting danger or confronting a situation each and every time if one is a warrior one is bound to gain an important lesson from it
Unless that is one hesitates on the verge and cannot make up one's mind
Then one can go mad because the Citta is uncertain will not commit itself or accept anything and it vacillates
But if the Citta truly accepts the situation there is nothing which can overpower the Citta which has become attached to Dhamma so that the two are as one and there will also be a certainty at this time that nothing is able to do any harm to one whether it be an animal a tiger or anything else or any other danger in the world
One does not fear anything at all of any sort from which one has ever been in danger and which one has ever feared
Thus the Citta and Dhamma when they fuse together as one have power over everything else in the world
For this reason Dhamma is superior to all the three worlds
I feel that the power of the Citta is greater than everything in this world
This is the way to train and harass one's deceit  which is linked with the Great Deceit that has always been there in one's Citta
If one lives in normal surroundings and does not go to any place where one is cornered with no way out it will invade and overpower one and destroy everything
But when one goes into a situation where one is cornered with no way out one equally puts pressure on it  although generally speaking the deceit is the one that applies the pressure and one does nothing to put pressure on it
But if one does put pressure on it even only once one will talk about it endlessly for years without stopping  not stopping until one dies but then it presses and squeezes one out smooth and one never says anything
Isn't this person showing off his cleverness too much
But in truth it is like this
In other words when the Dhamma enters and reaches the heart because of the abovementioned harassment one can then talk as though one's mouth is full of words because of this experience which went to one's heart at that time
In that one trained oneself to the utmost and willingly submitted one's life to the way and Dhamma with complete commitment in various circumstances the result is truly satisfying
As to winning  what is it
It displays a wonder which is also satisfying
How can one ever forget until the day one dies
That is enough explanation for today so now we may have some discussion
If the Citta has still not seen anything from itself in a time of necessity it still has not seen the importance of itself and so it will always take refuge in other people
In the Dhamma that the Lord taught the saying Attahi attano Natho  Self is the refuge of self is still not accepted in the heart
But whenever something happens that thing is completed in a satisfactory way one will then believe the Dhamma saying  Attahi attano natho  in a way that truly impresses the heart
The Citta that has known and seen the truth at a time when it was at an impasse with no way out such as when one has a fever and painful feeling overpowers one or when one sits for a long time or when one meets with some incident or other which is a strong or violent thing maybe threatening one's life if one is a true warrior the Citta goes round all over oneself without thinking of any hope from anything external
That is when the Citta will come to see the importance of oneself each and every time
This is a most wonderful thing and if one gets past those incidents one will probably have no anxiety in regard to life and death
Concerning painful feeling in whatever way or in whatever circumstances it arises or happens the anxiety as to whether one will be able to fight against it or not where one will be born again after one dies or the fear that one will be at a disadvantage or that one has wasted one's life for when painful feeling overwhelms the Citta until it reaches a point where it has no mindfulness to help one's heart  then how will it be nothing of this sort will then be in the Citta at all
In other words when it reaches a time of necessity like this the Citta and mindfulness immediately go in and find each other so as to get into the front line of battle One can talk of it like this in truth because it has fought before and won before and when one has almost reached the time to die mindfulness and wisdom will quickly find each other
When something of this sort happens mindfulness and wisdom join forces and they are not likely to flee or to withdraw but will immediately spin round and go in to fight this that is happening
In such a case whether one lives or dies one is not willing to be a slave but rather because of one's faith in Dhamma and faith in oneself one will want to know the truth of this that appears to be happening in the Citta
Faith in Dhamma right here
Where else should one have faith in Dhamma
The text books say it correctly but if the truth which is the Dhamma in one's heart is not found there is nothing to confirm them and to act as their witness so as to give one confidence
But as soon as the heart meets up with some incident and it gets to know and see it quite clearly and distinctly then it shows no disagreement in comparison with the Dhamma which they reveal in the text books
None of the sages when they were in times of real necessity liked to stay where there were many people and much disturbance
They liked to find a place which suited them and which accorded appropriately with the way they practiced and succeeded in gaining results of the kind that come in isolated or lonely places  isolated both in body and heart
People like us do not act like that
As soon as we begin to get ill you know how it is Oh where are all my children
Where are all my grandchildren
This child is not looking after me and my grandchildren are not paying any attention to me where have they all gone to where have all my relations and friends disappeared to
What's this
It's not good for them all to go and lose all interest in me
Who dislikes me
Nobody has any sympathy for me  suffering of life and death and nobody even turns and looks at me The Citta gets increasingly troubled and they cannot search for some basis to grasp hold of so as to reduce and diminish it by themselves
My husband before when we lived together was good but when I am truly about to die I haven't seen his face here at all
My husband is bad my children are bad my grandchildren are bad they are all bad
Because it is bad within her heart the filth which is there is brought out and thrown about externally making everything filthy
For the filthy water in her heart is the fear of death
Our inadequacy is what goes about throwing filth at other people and venting discontent
This is what is meant by having nothing as a basic principle in the heart Then we do not think about Attahi Attano Natho for our refuge is entirely based in other people
Having been born we took refuge in other people a long time ago
When a person is born he must to start with take refuge in other people such as mother father nursemaid one person after another until one comes to teachers professors and so on
Then afterwards one still wants to go on taking refuge in other people until one reaches the day of one's death without ever having the least thought of taking refuge in oneself
Therefore it is a difficult thing and it remains difficult to the day of one's death and one can neither set up or establish any principle or basis within one's heart at all
The Lord Buddha taught that one should take refuge in oneself  Attahi Attano Natho As for taking refuge in other people one is already doing that as much as is necessary to have got the resulting value from others or enough anyway to give oneself strength so that one will be able to take refuge in oneself in the future
This is an important principle that Buddhists should constantly keep in mind
Various activities are taught by mother and father by teachers and professors by the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and one should get the method from the knowledge and understanding which one has studied and learned and put it into practice as someone who is endowed with effort and energy so as to be able to help oneself
When one has seen the importance of oneself other things seem unimportant and one lets go of them all
That is the way of the Citta of somebody that has been trained for when it is having a truly bad time it will shake off everything whether relatives friends or anyone else and it will not want them to come and be a nuisance at all
One only has this duty to do and no other to let the Citta whirl round and down into it because one has no longing or yearning for anything in this world
Earth water air fire  one has examined these and seen quite clearly that everything in this world is composed of earth water air and fire and even though they are combined together things are still only combinations of earth water air and fire
We all give them names such as the body oneself one's possessions this or that and so on endlessly but things of this nature do not exist  and when they reach the time to die they also do not exist for they are going to do nothing but break up
The mindfulness and wisdom which one has developed by training separates out the elements and Khandhas with complete clarity
Everything of all kinds are examined completely in the light of truth
Then the Citta is true the elements are true feeling memory thought and consciousness or whatever else are true
Everything of all kinds are true and there is no disturbance and one can pass by contentedly this being Sugato  going well
There is nothing in one's surroundings which is a disturbance or troublesome one does not create Dukkha and difficulty for oneself or others and one has supreme happiness and contentment
When one dies there is no need to chant Kusala Dhamma Akusala Dhamma nor to invite Bhikkhus to the funeral thereby disturbing everyone
This is what I say and Venerable Boowa of Wat Pa Ban Tard speaks like this with certainty
Make up your minds I have been constantly telling them this giving talks in this way and teaching relatives and lay people
I have developed myself and trained myself and I have been ordained many Vassa already and I am still developing just Kusala Dhamma trying to develop Kusala
Whoever wants Kusala Dhamma should develop it themselves
After one has died those who are still living go about collecting Bhikkhus to give merit and Kusala Dhamma
They chase after the Bhikkhus who have gone into the forests and wild places and it is all a disturbing nuisance and I don't want it to be like that
In gaining Kusala  the skill which is put into one's Citta  Kusala meaning skill here  one must search for it and get enough
The method which will bring happiness and contentment to oneself one should try and do from now on
After one is dead for them to go and invite Bhikkhus to come and chant Kusala Dhamma which just becomes a nuisance to the Bhikkhus is no good
It is contrary to the purpose of Buddhism which teaches people to be clever to look for what is good and to make it part of themselves while they are still alive so that when one has reached one's time one is Sugato and one goes on in the way of one who is cured of worry
When one has reached the end point and the time comes to die  or at least when Grandfather Boowa dies  please do not invite Bhikkhus to come and don't make trouble for them
For if Grandfather Boowa has been doing Kusala Dhamma since the day of starting practice until now and if he is still stupid he is beyond help so let him alone die and it will only be Grandfather Boowa who sinks
But do not let other people come and be stupid also
In this I am speaking bluntly for this is the way I talk to my followers and it is the truth also
I am never concerned about anything and when the time comes to get rid of this lot then I will get rid of it with pleasure and die easily and entirely free from anxiety
The whole world embraces the elements and Khandhas and when the time comes to die and to abandon them Oh sadness sorrow and grief everywhere they do not want to accept death
When the body is dead they want it to live and when the time for death has come they do not want to go
It is all troublesome so do not let it be like this
The Lord Buddha thus let us know the truth When the time has come to go then go
But when the time has not come to go then live If there is any orange juice and sweet drinks bring them over if it is still not the time I will drink them all
But when one is about to die don't come and be a nuisance for then one will drop it  it is much too heavy  Bhara have Pañcakkhandha  and having dropped it going along in the true natural way and having passed on contentedly one comes to the ultimate fulfillment of one who practices The Lord Buddha was like that and so were the Savakas and we have followed the footprints of the Lord Buddha  how else could it be
Without doubt it must be this way
There
That's enough I have given two talks already
From tomorrow I shall no longer be here for I will return to Thailand I will think of all my brothers and sisters here
That I came this time and determined to come and meet and help people here is because of thinking only of the heart and this is why Tan Acharn came to England
I did not come for any worldly purposes at all for whether staying in my Wat or any other Wat or going to any place in Thailand I never think of going for worldly purposes and I never have it in mind to go for goods or money or wealth but I go for the Cittas of people so that they may gain something of value
In coming to England I also have a feeling of fulness in my heart in the same way
Intentions are more important than anything else
If one's intentions are good everything else of all kinds are also good but if one's intentions are not good everything is spoilt and goes wrong accordingly
Therefore in coming to visit my brothers and sisters in London I came with heart and when I go I shall think of your heart If our fortunes should cross in due course we may come here again or some of you here may go over there
In other words you may go to visit us out there or we may come from there to visit you here
This world is round and the hearts of beings in this world are whirling about in the round of Samsara with all the defilement which lead them round to birth and round to death endlessly
Therefore please all of you try to make your Citta become free from the round of Samsara
Then it will be absolutely contented and there will be no need to go round and round
This is enough explanation of Dhamma for today so I will stop
Those of you who have anything in your hearts that you want to ask may do so now
Tomorrow there will be no time in the morning for we will eat early and then must go
The training and practice of Dhamma so as to know Dukkha as it truly consists in using meditation and wisdom to examine how to train the Citta to draw out the Kilesas until one finds the taste of happiness in the Citta
This is bound to help one find true and genuine happiness and to get a basic principle to hold firmly in the heart no matter what the circumstances are
This is a partial index of numerically arranged topics that appear in the suttas available here at Access to Insight
The growing interest in women's spirituality has led to a renewed focus upon the Therigatha the Verses of the Elder Nuns as the oldest existing testament to the feminine experience of Buddhism
Despite this recent attention to the Therigatha however it seems that all but a few scholarly commentators have overlooked a short chapter in the Samyutta Nikaya that serves as an important supplement to the larger work
This is the Bhikkhunisamyutta Chapter of the Sagathavaggasamyutta the Connected Discourses with Verses Volume I of the Samyutta Nikaya
The Bhikkhunisamyutta is a compilation of ten short suttas in mixed prose and verse with a total of thirtyseven verses
Though several of these verses have parallels in the Therigatha a significant number don't and often the variations in roughly parallel versions are themselves of intrinsic interest
At least one nun in the Bhikkhunisamyutta Vajira does not appear in the Therigatha while the case of another nun Sela is problematic
A comparison between the two collections also brings to light some noteworthy differences in the ascription of authorship in one case  that of the three Cala sisters  a threeway shuffling of ascriptions occurs
Such differences can be readily understood once we realize that the texts were originally transmitted orally for several centuries and thus were contingent on less durable factors than paper and ink
Since the Samyutta Nikaya and the Therigatha were evidently transmitted by different lines of reciters it was only too easy for verses to break off from their original narrative setting and merge with a different background story connecting them to a different author
The antiquity of this collection is attested to by the fact that it has a counterpart in the Chinese translation of the Sanskrit Samyuktagama which probably belonged to the Sarvastivada school
Anesaki's The Four Buddhist Agamas in Chinese gives a breakdown of the Chinese equivalent of the Bhikkhunisamyutta and though the order of suttas is different the ten titles are almost identical except that the Pali Sela Sutta is there entitled Viri
This is strong evidence that the entire chapter had taken shape before the Pali and Sarvastivada schools went their separate ways
All the ten suttas are constructed according to the same pattern a direct confrontation between Mara the Evil One the Lord of Sensuality and an individual nun
This structure perhaps accounts for the placement of the Bhikkhunisamyutta immediately after the Marasamyutta in which the Evil One is shown trying to distract the Buddha and the monks
In each sutta of our collection a nun goes off by herself to pass the day in solitary meditation
Then Mara approaches her with a challenge  a provocative question or a taunt  intending to make her fall away from concentration
What Mara has failed to realize is that each of these nuns is an arahant and has seen so deeply into the truth of the Dhamma that she is utterly inaccessible to his wiles
Far from being flustered by Mara's challenge the nun promptly guesses the identity of her adversary and overturns his challenge with a sharp reply
Once Mara realizes that his number has been called he has no choice but to vanish on the spot sad and disappointed
In a dialogue that brings together the Lord of Sensuality with a solitary nun one might expect each of Mara's overtures to be aimed at sexual seduction
This however is so only in several suttas
The actual themes of the discourses vary and expose us to a broad range of perspectives on the attitudes and insights of the renunciant life
The contrast between the allurement and misery of sensual pleasures is the theme of  and
In  Mara does not himself attempt to seduce the nun but only urges her to enjoy sense pleasures before her time runs out in  he assumes the guise of a handsome youth who lavishes his seductive charms on the beautiful Vijaya and in  he almost threatens to rape the nun Uppalavanna who had actually been raped soon after her ordination by an infatuated youth
In all three cases the nuns sharply rebuke Mara with verses that reveal their utter indifference to his solicitations
In  Mara approaches Kisagotami the heroine of the wellknown parable of the mustard seed trying to arouse her maternal instincts to beget another son
His challenge thus touches on sensuality only indirectly
His primary appeal is aimed at awakening the feminine desire for children
Mara's dialogue with Soma voices the ancient Indian prejudice that women are endowed with mere twofingered wisdom and thus cannot attain Nibbana a goal reserved for males
Soma's rejoinder is a forceful reminder that enlightenment does not depend on gender but on the mind's capacity for concentration and wisdom qualities accessible to any human being who earnestly seeks to penetrate the truth
In  and we meet the three Cala sisters the younger sisters of the Venerable Sariputta
From these three nuns Mara tries to elicit respectively an affirmation of birth of rebirth in the heavenly realms and of heretical views
In each case the nun replies with appropriate verses exposing the dangers in birth in the entire triple world and in the systems of the nonBuddhist thinkers
The last two suttas are philosophical masterpieces compressing into a few tight stanzas insights of enormous depth and wide implications
Full appreciation of their richness and power would require extensive acquaintance with the whole corpus of early Buddhist texts particularly the Samyutta Nikaya chapters on dependent origination and the five aggregates
In  Mara challenges Sela with a question on the origins of personal existence
She replies with a masterly poem that condenses the whole teaching of dependent origination into three fourline stanzas adorned with an illuminating simile
In  he poses a similar problem to Vajira who answers with a stunning exposition of the teaching of nonself illustrating the composite nature of personal identity with the simile of the chariot
This simile was popularized by the famous Milindapañha but Vajira's simpler version has an incisive edge that is blunted by the bombastic tone of the later work
Though set against a mythological background in an ancient world whose customs and norms seem so remote from our own these poems of the nuns of old still speak to us today through their sheer simplicity and uncompromising honesty
They need no ornamentation or artifice to convey their message but startle us with the clarity of unadorned truth
Emerging from the depths of indubitable personal realization crackling with insight they point unwaveringly toward the rugged path of renunciation and wisdom that leads to the end of suffering

For clarification see the lines from the famous Kaccanagotta Sutta This world Kaccana is for the most part shackled by engagement clinging and adherence
But this one does not become engaged and cling through that engagement and clinging mental standpoint adherence underlying tendency he does not take a stand about 'my self' He has no perplexity or doubt that what arises is only suffering arising what ceases is only suffering ceasing
His knowledge about this is independent of others

The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The arahant ideal and the bodhisattva ideal are often considered the respective guiding ideals of Theravāda Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism
This assumption is not entirely correct for the Theravāda tradition has absorbed the bodhisattva ideal into its framework and thus recognizes the validity of both arahantship and Buddhahood as objects of aspiration
It would therefore be more accurate to say that the arahant ideal and the bodhisattva ideal are the respective guiding ideals of Early Buddhism and Mahāyāna Buddhism
By Early Buddhism I do not mean the same thing as Theravāda Buddhism that exists in the countries of southern Asia
I mean the type of Buddhism embodied in the archaic Nikāyas of Theravāda Buddhism and in the corresponding texts of other schools of Indian Buddhism that did not survive the general destruction of Buddhism in India
It is important to recognize that these ideals in the forms that they have come down to us originate from different bodies of literature stemming from different periods in the historical development of Buddhism
If we don't take this fact into account and simply compare these two ideals as described in Buddhist canonical texts we might assume that the two were originally expounded by the historical Buddha himself and we might then suppose that the Buddha  living and teaching in the Ganges plain in the th century B
 offered his followers a choice between them as if to say This is the arahant ideal which has such and such features and that is the bodhisattva ideal which has such and such features
Choose whichever one you like The Mahāyāna sūtras such as the Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra and the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Sūtra give the impression that the Buddha did teach both ideals
Such sūtras however certainly are not archaic
To the contrary they are relatively late attempts to schematize the different types of Buddhist practice that had evolved over a period of roughly four hundred years after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa
The most archaic Buddhist texts  the Pali Nikāyas and their counterparts from other early schools  depict the ideal for the Buddhist disciple as the arahant
The Mahāyāna sūtras composed a few centuries later in a Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit depict the ideal for the Mahāyāna follower as the bodhisattva
Now some people argue that because the arahant is the ideal of Early Buddhism while the bodhisattva is the ideal of later Mahāyāna Buddhism the Mahāyāna must be a more advanced or highly developed type of Buddhism a more ultimate teaching compared to the simpler more basic teaching of the Nikāyas
That is indeed an attitude common among Mahāyānists which I will call Mahāyāna elitism An opposing attitude common among conservative advocates of the Nikāyas rejects all later developments in the history of Buddhist thought as deviation and distortion a fall away from the pristine purity of the ancient teaching
I call this attitude Nikāya purism Taking the arahant ideal alone as valid Nikāya purists reject the bodhisattva ideal sometimes forcefully and even aggressively
I have been seeking a point of view that can do justice to both perspectives that of the Nikāyas and the early Mahāyāna sūtras a point of view that can accommodate their respective strengths without falling into a soft and easy syncretism without blotting out conceptual dissonances between them without abandoning faithfulness to the historical records  yet one which also recognizes that these records are by no means crystal clear and are unlikely to be free of bias
This task has by no means been easy
It is much simpler to adopt either a standpoint of Nikāya purism or one of Mahāyāna elitism and hold to it without flinching
The problem with these two standpoints however is that both are obliged to neglect facts that are discomforting to their respective points of view
Although I am ordained as a Theravāda Buddhist monk in this paper I am not going to be defending the opinions of any particular school of Buddhism or trying to uphold a sectarian point of view
For six years I have lived in Chinese Mahāyāna monasteries and my understanding of Buddhism has been particularly enriched by my contact with the teachings of the Chinese scholarmonk Master Yinshun and his most senior living pupil Master Renjun the founder of Bodhi Monastery in New Jersey
My first purpose is to draw out from the texts what the texts say explicitly and also what they imply about these two competing ideals of the Buddhist life
At the end when I draw my conclusions I will clearly state them as such and they will be entirely my own
Sometimes I will not draw conclusions but instead raise questions pointing to problems in the history of Buddhism that I am acutely aware of but unfortunately cannot resolve
It is quite possible that what I consider a nuanced and balanced point of view will draw fire from partisan advocates on both sides of the divide
However from the standpoint of my present understanding I have no choice but to take this risk
I want to start by making what I think is an extremely important but seldom made observation namely that both types of texts  the Nikāyas and gamas on the one hand and the Mahāyāna sūtras on the other  are in a sense looking to the Buddha himself as the ideal
That is it is not the case that Early Buddhism overlooks the Buddha and instead takes his disciples as the ideal while Mahāyāna Buddhism comes to the rescue and recovers what the Hīnayānists had missed namely the inspirational impetus imparted by the Buddha himself
Rather I want to maintain that followers of both forms of Buddhism  and the authoritative texts from which both forms of Buddhism develop  are looking upon the Buddha as the exemplary figure that a true follower of the Dharma should emulate
The two differ primarily in so far as they view the Buddha from two different perspectives
I'll use an analogy to illustrate this and then provide a fuller explanation
The Buddha Hall here at our monastery has two entrances situated on either side of the Buddha image
If one looks at the image after entering the hall by the west entrance the Buddha appears in one way the angle highlights certain characteristics of the face
If one looks at the image after entering the hall by the east entrance the Buddha appears in a different way the angle highlights other characteristics of the face
I see this as a fitting simile for the way the two traditions view the Buddha and his enlightenment
I see both the early suttas of the Nikāyas and gamas and the Mahāyāna sūtras to be giving us different perspectives on the Buddha and his enlightenment and thus as offering different understandings of what it means to be a true follower of the Buddha
To briefly characterize these perspectives I would say that the Nikāyas and gamas give us a historicalrealistic perspective on the Buddha while the Mahāyāna sūtras give us a cosmicmetaphysical perspective By using these terms I'm not intending to use the Nikāyas to trump the Mahāyāna sūtras  though naturally I hold they are more likely to be closer to the Buddha's own verbal teachings
Rather I'm just trying to characterize the standpoints that they use to look at the Buddha and interpret his significance for the world
These two perspectives then define what the Buddha accomplished through his enlightenment
When we take the historicalrealistic perspective the Buddha became an arahant
However though being an arahant he was what we might call an arahant with differences he was moreover not simply an arahant with a few incidental differences but an arahant whose differences eventually elevated him to a distinct level the Bhagavā a world teacher one who towered above all the other arahants
These differences opened the door so to speak to the cosmicmetaphysical perspective on the Buddha as a way to understand what accounted for these differences
Once this door was opened up the Buddha was viewed as the one who brought to consummation the long bodhisattva career extending over countless eons in which he sacrificed himself in various ways many times for the good of others this is the cosmic aspect of that perspective
Again he was viewed as the one who arrived at ultimate truth the Tathāgata who has come from Suchness and gone to Suchness and yet who abides nowhere this is the metaphysical aspect of that perspective
This cosmicmetaphysical perspective then became characteristic of the Mahāyāna
As I indicated above there is a sense in which both the Nikāyas and the Mahāyāna sūtras alike take it as their project to demonstrate what is required of one who wants to follow in the footsteps of the Master But they take up this project from these two different standpoints
I will explain first the standpoint of the Nikāyas and then the standpoint of the Mahāyāna sūtras
The Nikāyas begin with our common human condition and depict the Buddha as starting from within this same human condition
That is for the Nikāyas the Buddha starts off as a human being sharing fully in our humanity
He takes birth among us as a man subject to the limitations of human life
As he grows up he is confronted with inevitable old age sickness and death which reveal to him the deep misery that perpetually lies hidden behind youth health and life mocking our brightest joys
Like many other thoughtful Indians of his time he seeks a way to liberation from life's afflictions  and as he tells it he seeks liberation primarily for himself not with some grand thought in mind of saving the world
He goes forth becomes an ascetic and engages in a relentless struggle for deliverance
Finally he finds the correct path and attains the bliss of nirvāṇa
After his attainment he considers whether he should make the path available to others and his first impulse is to remain silent
Note that he almost follows the route of a paccekabuddha
It is only when the deity Brahmā Sahampati entreats him that he takes up the task of teaching this path to others
His major achievement is to have attained nirvāṇa the state free from all bondage and suffering
This is the great goal the final end of all spiritual striving the peace beyond all the anxiety and unrest of the ordinary human condition
By teaching the path he makes this goal available to others and those who follow the path reach the same goal that he himself attained
The Buddha is the first of the arahants while those who reach the goal by following his path also become arahants
In the verse of homage to the Buddha it is said Iti pi so Bhagavā Arahaṃ  The Blessed One is an arahant Shortly after his enlightenment while walking to Benares to meet the five monks a wanderer stopped the Buddha and asked who he was
The Buddha replied I am the arahant in the world I am the supreme teacher
So the Buddha first of all declares himself to be an arahant
The defining mark of an arahant is the attainment of nirvāṇa in this present life
The word arahant was not coined by the Buddha but was current even before he appeared on the Indian religious scene
The word is derived from a verb arahati meaning to be worthy and thus means a person who is truly worthy of veneration and offerings
Among Indian spiritual seekers in the Buddha's time the word was used to denote a person who had attained the ultimate goal for this is what made one worthy of veneration and offerings
From the perspective of the Nikāyas the ultimate goal  the goal in strict doctrinal terms  is nirvāṇa and the goal in human terms is arahantship the state of a person who has attained nirvāṇa in this present life
The Buddha's enlightenment is significant because it marked the first realization of nirvāṇa within this historical epoch
We might say that the Buddha rises above the horizon of history as an arahant in his historical manifestation he dawns upon human consciousness as an arahant
After attaining enlightenment the Buddha makes the path to enlightenment available to many others
Enlightenment is valued because it is the gateway to the ultimate freedom of nirvāṇa
In the Nikāyas we find several descriptions of the process by which the Buddha attained enlightenment and there are corresponding texts that describe the disciples' enlightenment in the same terms
In MN the Buddha says that being myself subject to birth aging sickness and death I attained the unborn ageless sicknessfree deathless supreme security from bondage Nibbāna A few months later when he taught the Dhamma to his first five disciples he says of them When those monks were instructed and guided by me being subject to birth aging sickness and death they attained the unborn ageless sicknessfree deathless supreme security from bondage Nibbāna
Thus the attainment of these monks is described in exactly the same terms that the Buddha uses to describe his own attainment
Again in several suttas  MN MN MN  the Buddha describes his attainment of enlightenment as involving two main stages
First comes the attainment of the four jhānas
Second during the three parts of the night he realized three higher knowledges the recollection of past lives the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings according to their karma and the knowledge of the destruction of the āsavas the primordial defilements that sustain the round of rebirths
Now several suttas in the same collection the Majjhima Nikāya describe the enlightenment of the disciple in just this way attainment of the four jhānas and realization of the three higher knowledges see eg
MN MN MN
While it is true that not all disciples attained the jhānas and most probably didn't attain the first two higher knowledges these seemed to mark a certain ideal standard within the early Sangha  a standard that the Buddha and the great arahants shared in common
At SN the Buddha says that both the Tathāgata and the arahant disciple are alike in being liberated from the five aggregates form feeling perception volitional formations and consciousness
So what is the difference between them
The answer the Buddha gives points to temporal priority as the distinction the Tathāgata is the originator of the path the producer of the path the one who declares the path
He is the knower of the path the discoverer of the path the expounder of the path
His disciples dwell following the path and become possessed of it afterwards
But they both walk the same path and attain the same final goal
Thus the Buddha is distinguished from the arahant disciples not by some categorical difference in their respective attainments but by his role he is the first one in this historical epoch to attain liberation and he serves as the incomparable guide in making known the way to liberation
He has skills in teaching that even the most capable of his disciples cannot match but with regard to their worldtranscending attainments both the Buddha and the arahants are buddho' enlightened in that they have comprehended the truths that should be comprehended
They are both nibbuto' in that they have extinguished the defilements and thereby attained the peace of nirvāṇa
They are both suvimutto' fully liberated
They have fully understood the truth of suffering they have abandoned craving the origin of suffering they have realized nirvāṇa the cessation of suffering and they have completed the practice of the noble eightfold path the way leading to the cessation of suffering
As the first to accomplish all these worthy achievements the Buddha fulfills two functions
First he serves as an example the supreme example almost every aspect of his life is exemplary but above all his very person demonstrates the possibility of attaining perfect freedom from all the fetters of the mind complete release from suffering release from the pitfalls of birth and death
Second as aforesaid he serves as the guide the one who knows the path and can teach it in its most intricate details
As the guide he constantly exhorts his disciples to make a dedicated effort to attain the ultimate goal nirvāṇa
He admonishes them to strive as diligently as a man whose turban was on fire would strive to put out the fire
The fires of the human heart are greed hatred and delusion their extinction is nirvāṇa
Those who extinguish greed hatred and delusion are arahants
Nevertheless it would hardly be correct to say that temporal priority is the only thing that distinguishes the Buddha from the arahants
To bring out the difference I want to take two stock formulas that occur many times in the texts one for the Buddha and one for the arahants
I already quoted the opening of the Buddha formula now let me take it in full The Blessed One is an arahant a perfectly enlightened one possessed of true knowledge and conduct an exalted one a knower of the world unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed teacher of devas and humans enlightened the Blessed One
There are nine epithets here
Of these nine four are also used for arahant disciples arahant possessed of true knowledge and conduct an exalted one enlightened five are used exclusively for the Buddha perfectly enlightened one knower of the world unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed teacher of devas and humans the Blessed One
Note that of these five two explicitly refer to the Buddha's significance for others while as I understand it this aspect is also implied by the word Bhagavā Even the epithets signifying knowledge are intended to show that he is a reliable authority that is by reason of his wisdom or knowledge he is someone whom others can trust as a source of guidance
So when the Buddha is designated a sammā sambuddha a perfectly enlightened one this highlights not only the fullness of his enlightenment but his authority and reliability as a spiritual teacher
The formula for the arahant reads thus Here a monk is an arahant one whose taints are destroyed who has lived the spiritual life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached his own goal utterly destroyed the fetters of existence one completely liberated through final knowledge Now all these epithets are true for the Buddha as well but the Buddha is not described in this way for these terms emphasize the attainment of one's own liberation and the Buddha is extolled not primarily as the one who has attained his own liberation but as the one who opens the doors of liberation for others
That is even in the archaic suttas of the Nikāyas an otherregarding significance is already being subtly ascribed to the Buddha's status that is not ascribed to the arahant
While the content of the Buddha's enlightenment according to the Nikāya suttas does not qualitatively differ from that of other arahants it plays a different role in what we might call the grand cosmic scheme of salvation
The Buddha's enlightenment has an essentially otherdirected component built into it from the start
By virtue of attaining enlightenment the Buddha serves as the great teacher who opens the doors to the Deathless AN I xiii says he is the one person who arises in the world for the welfare of the world out of compassion for the world for the good of devas and human beings
MN compares him to a kind man who leads a herd of deer from a place of danger to a place of safety MN compares him to a wise cowherd who leads his cows safely across the river
According to MN the Buddha is honored by other arahants because he is one who having attained enlightenment himself teaches the Dhamma for the sake of enlightenment having attained peace he teaches for the sake of peace having attained nirvāṇa he teaches for the sake of nirvāṇa
He is perfect in all respects and the most important of his perfections is his ability to teach the Dharma in ways that are best suited to the capacities of those who come to him for guidance
His teaching is always exactly suited to the capacities of those who seek his help and when they follow his instructions they receive favorable results whether it be merely the gain of faith or the attainment of liberation
Other arahants can certainly teach and many do teach groups of disciples
Nevertheless as teachers they do not compare with the Buddha
This is so in at least two respects First the Dhamma they teach others is one that comes from the Buddha and thus ultimately the Buddha is the source of their wisdom and second their skills in teaching never match in all respects the skills of the Buddha who is the only one who knows the path in its entirety
The Buddha can function so effectively as a teacher because his attainment of enlightenment  the knowledge of the four noble truths which brings the destruction of the defilements  brings along the acquisition of several other types of knowledge that are considered special assets of a Buddha
Chief among these according to the oldest sources are the ten Tathāgata powers which include the knowledge of the diverse inclinations of beings and the knowledge of the degree of maturity of the faculties of other beings
Such types of knowledge enable the Buddha to understand the mental proclivities and capacities of any person who comes to him for guidance and to teach that person in the particular way that will prove most beneficial taking full account of his or her character and personal circumstances
He is thus the unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed Whereas arahant disciples are limited in their communicative skills the Buddha can communicate effectively with beings in many other realms of existence as well as with people from many different walks of life
This skill singles him out as the teacher of devas and humans
Thus we can see the respects in which the Buddha and disciple arahants share certain qualities in common above all their liberation from all defilements and from all bonds connecting them to the round of rebirths
And we also see how the Buddha is distinguished from his disciples namely by the priority of his attainment by his function as teacher and guide and by his acquisition of certain qualities and modes of knowledge that enable him to function as teacher and guide
He also has a physical body endowed with thirtytwo excellent characteristics and with other marks of physical beauty
These inspire confidence in those who rely on beauty of form
I said above that each extreme attitude  Nikāya purism and Mahāyāna elitism   neglects facts that are discomforting to their respective points of view
Mahāyāna elitism neglects the fact that in his historical manifestation so far as we can ascertain through the early records of his teachings the Buddha did not teach the bodhisattva path which emerges only in documents that start to appear at least a century after his passing
What the Buddha consistently taught according to the early records is the attainment of nirvāṇa by reaching arahantship
The problem besetting Nikāya purism is the figure of the Buddha himself for in the Buddha we meet a person who while an arahant did not attain arahantship as the disciple of a Buddha but as a Buddha
In the Nikāyas themselves he is depicted not merely as the first of the arahants but as one member of a class of beings  the Tathāgatas  who possess unique characteristics that set them apart from all other beings including their arahant disciples
The Nikāyas moreover regard the Tathāgatas as supreme in the entire order of sentient beings To whatever extent monks there are beings whether footless or with two feet four feet or many feet whether having form or formless whether percipient or nonpercipient or neither percipient nor nonpercipient the Tathāgata the Arahant the Perfectly Enlightened One is declared the best among them
Now since the Buddha is distinguished from his liberated disciples in the ways sketched above it seems almost selfevident that in his past lives he must have followed a preparatory course sufficient to issue in such an exalted state namely the course of a bodhisattva
This conclusion is in fact a point of agreement common to all Buddhist schools both those derived from Early Buddhism and those belonging to the Mahāyāna it also seems to me to be a conclusion required by reflection
According to all Buddhist traditions to attain the supreme enlightenment of a Buddha requires the forming of a deliberate resolution and the fulfillment of the spiritual perfections the pāramis or pāramitās and it is a bodhisattva who consummates the practice of these perfections
However the Nikāyas and gamas the most ancient texts are strangely silent about this very issue
In the Nikāyas the Buddha does refer to himself as a bodhisatta in the period prior to his enlightenment in his immediately preceding life when he dwelled in the Tusita heaven and during the period of his final life as Gotama of the Sakyan clan before his enlightenment
But he says nothing to suggest that he had been consciously following a deliberate course of conduct aimed at the attainment of Buddhahood
Moreover soon after his enlightenment when the Buddha considered whether or not to teach the Dhamma he says that he first inclined to dwell at ease that is not to teach which suggests that even after his enlightenment he might not have fulfilled the function of a sammā sambuddha but could have become a paccekabuddha
There are however other passages strewn across the Nikāyas that prevent us from drawing the definitive conclusion that the Buddha somehow stumbled upon Buddhahood merely by chance or that his hesitation implied a genuine possibility of choice
These passages suggest to the contrary that his attainment of Buddhahood was already prepared for in his previous births
Though they do not say that in his past lives he was deliberately following a bodhisattva path to attain Buddhahood the Nikāyas do depict him as dwelling in the Tusita heaven in his immediately past existence destined to become a fully enlightened Buddha in his next life as Gotama of the Sakyan clan and this implies that in his past lives he must have fulfilled the most demanding prerequisites to take on such an exalted role to become the loftiest and most highly venerated being in all the world
When he descends into his mother's womb a great measureless light appears in the world surpassing the light of the devas and such a light appears again at his birth
When he is born he is first received by deities and streams of water pour forth from the sky to wash him and his mother
Immediately upon his birth he takes seven steps and declares himself the best in the world
The gods sing songs of delight declaring that the bodhisattva has arisen for the welfare and happiness of the human world
Such passages of course could be seen as later additions to the Nikāyas indicative of a stage when the Buddha legend was already making inroads upon the most ancient texts
Nevertheless given the law of cause and result as operating in the spiritual dimensions of the human domain it seems virtually impossible that anyone could have attained the extraordinary stature of a Buddha without having made a deliberate effort over many lives to reach such a supreme attainment
Despite such considerations in the Nikāyas the Buddha is never seen teaching others to enter a bodhisattva path
Whenever he urges his monastic disciples to strive for any goal it is to strive for arahantship for liberation for nirvāṇa
Whenever monastic disciples come to the Buddha they ask for guidance in following the path to arahantship
The monks that the Buddha praises in the midst of the Sangha are those who have attained arahantship
Lay disciples often attain the three lower stages of liberation from streamentry to nonreturning those who lack the potential for worldtranscending attainments aim at a heavenly rebirth or for a fortunate rebirth back into the human realm
No mention is ever made however of a lay disciple treading the bodhisattva path much less of a dichotomy between monastic arahants and lay bodhisattvas
We need not however simply take the Nikāyas at face value but can raise questions
Why is it that in the Nikāyas we never find any instance of a disciple coming to the Buddha to ask for guidance in following a bodhisattva path to Buddhahood
And why is the Buddha never seen exhorting his followers to take up the bodhisattva path
The questions themselves seem perfectly legitimate and I've tried working out several explanations though without complete success
One explanation is that there were instances when this happened but they were filtered out by the compilers of the texts because such teachings were not consistent with the teachings aimed at arahantship
This hypothesis seems unlikely because if discourses on the path to Buddhahood had the imprint of genuine teachings of the Buddha it is improbable that the monks compiling the texts would have omitted them
Another explanation is that in the earliest phase of Buddhism the pretextual phase the Buddha was simply the first arahant who taught the path to arahantship and did not differ significantly from those among his arahant disciples who possessed the three higher types of knowledge and the iddhis the supernormal powers
According to this account the Nikāyas are the product of several generations of monastic elaboration and thus already show traces of the apotheosis of the Buddha his elevation to an exalted status
On this hypothesis if we could take a timemachine back to the Buddha's own time we would find that the Buddha differed from the other arahants mainly in the priority of his attainment and in certain skills he possessed as a teacher but these differences would not be as great as even the old Nikāyas make them out to be
However this position seems to strip away from the Buddha that which is most distinctive about him his uncanny ability to reach deep into the hearts of those who came to him for guidance and teach them in the unique way suitable for their characters and situations
This ability betokens a depth of compassion a spirit of selfless service that harmonizes better with the later concept of the bodhisattva than with the canonical concept of the arahant as we see it portrayed for example in many of the poems of the Theragāthā or the muni poems of the Suttanipāta
In the final analysis I have to confess my inability to provide a perfectly cogent solution to this problem
In view of the fact that in later times so many Buddhists in Theravāda lands as well as in the Mahāyāna world have been inspired by the bodhisattva ideal it is perplexing that no teachings about a bodhisattva path or bodhisattva practices are included in the discourses regarded as coming down from the most archaic period of Buddhist literary history
This remains a puzzle  for me personally and also I believe a puzzle for Buddhist historiography
In any case the texts that we inherit do not show as steep a difference between the Buddha's otherregarding functions and the socalled selfenlightenment of the arahants as later tradition makes them out to be
The Nikāyas show sufficient emphasis on altruistic activity aimed at sharing the Dhamma with others admittedly though most of this emphasis comes from the Buddha himself in the form of injunctions to his disciples
Thus several texts distinguish people into four types those concerned only with selfgood those concerned only with others' good those concerned with the good of neither and those concerned with the good of both these texts praise as best those who are devoted to the good of both
And what is meant by being devoted to the good of both is practicing the noble eightfold path and teaching others to practice it observing the five precepts and encouraging others to observe them working to eliminate greed aversion and delusion and encouraging others to eliminate them
In other suttas the Buddha urges all those who know the four foundations of mindfulness to teach their relatives and friends about them and the same is said about the four factors of streamentry and the four noble truths
In the beginning of his ministry he exhorts his disciples to go forth and preach the Dharma out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of devas and human beings
Among the important qualities of an outstanding monk are abundant learning and skill in expounding the Dharma two qualities that are directly relevant to the benefit of others
Also we must remember that the Buddha established a monastic order bound by rules and regulations designed to make it function as a harmonious community and these rules often demand the renouncing of selfinterest for the sake of the larger whole
Regarding the lay followers the Buddha praises those who practice for their own good for the good of others and for the good of the whole world
Many prominent lay followers converted their colleagues and neighbors to the Dharma and guided them in right practice
Thus we can see that while Early Buddhism emphasizes that each person is ultimately responsible for his or her own destiny holding that no one can purify another or rescue another from the miseries of saṃsāra it includes an altruistic dimension that distinguished it from most of the other religious systems that flourished alongside it in northern India
This altruistic dimension might be seen as the seed from which the bodhisattva doctrine developed
It might thus also be considered one of the elements in ancient Buddhism that contributed to the emergence of the Mahāyāna
Perhaps for a fullfledged bodhisattva doctrine to emerge in Buddhism something more was needed than the conception of the Buddha that we find in the ancient texts of the Nikāyas
Thus the common project of comparing the arahant of the Nikāyas with the bodhisattva figure of the Mahāyāna sūtras may be somewhat misguided
As I see it one of the factors that underlies the emergence of the fullfledged bodhisattva doctrine was the transformation of the archaic Buddha concept of the Nikāya sūtras into the Buddha figure of Buddhist religious faith and legend
This took place mainly in the age of Sectarian Buddhism that is between the phase of Early Buddhism represented by the Nikāyas and the rise of early Mahāyāna Buddhism
During this period two significant developments of the Buddha concept occurred
First the number of Buddhas was multiplied and second the Buddhas came to be endowed with increasingly more exalted qualities
These developments occurred somewhat differently in the different Buddhist schools but certain common features united them
The Nikāyas already mention six Buddhas preceding Gotama and one to follow him Metteyya
Now since cosmic time is without any discernible beginning or conceivable end the inference was drawn that there must have been even earlier Buddhas and thus the number of past Buddhas was increased stories about some of these entered into circulation and brought them to life
Since space was likewise unbounded with world systems like our own spread out in the ten directions some schools posited the present existence of Buddhas in other world systems beyond our own  Buddhas still alive whom one might worship and by means of meditative power actually see with contemplative vision
The texts of Sectarian Buddhism increased a Buddha's faculties of knowledge until they eventually ascribed to him nothing short of omniscience
He came to possess numerous miraculous powers
Eighteen special Buddhadharmas not mentioned in the old suttas were added
Legends and stories entered into circulation describing the wonderful ways he taught and transformed others
Some of these stories are already found in the suttas the stories of his encounters with the serial killer Angulimāla the fierce demon ḷavaka the poor leper Suppabuddha the angry brahmin Bhāradvāja
These stories increased exponentially painting a picture of the Buddha as the incredibly resourceful teacher who redeems from misery and delusion people of every type
He breaks the pride of haughty brahmins he brings consolation to distraught mothers and wretched widows he dispels the complacency of proud warriors and beautiful courtesans he outdoes clever scholars in debates and rival ascetics in feats of supernormal powers he teaches avaricious millionaires the wonders of generosity he inspires diligence in heedless monks he wins the reverence of kings and princes
As Buddhist devotees looked back on their deceased Master and pondered the question of what accounted for his extraordinary greatness in no long time they realized that what was most outstanding about him was his boundless compassion
Not content with confining his compassionate concern for others to a single life they saw it as spread out over innumerable lives in the chain of samsaric existence
Their creative imaginations thus gave birth to a vast treasury of stories about births namely about the Buddha's previous births
These stories  the Jātakas or Birth Tales  told of how he had prepared himself for his mission as a Buddha by treading the path of a bodhisattva for unimaginable eons
The keynote of the most memorable of these stories is service and selfsacrifice
It was by serving others and sacrificing himself for their good that the bodhisattva earned the merits and acquired the virtues that entitled him to attain Buddhahood
Thus in Buddhist thought clear across the schools of Early Buddhism the altruistic dimension of the Buddha's enlightenment came to the forefront literally carved in stone  in pillars and monuments stretching from India to Indonesia  and memorialized in stories and poetry
From this perspective the Buddha's enlightenment was significant not merely because it opened the path to nirvāṇa for many others but because it consummated an eonslong career that began with an altruistic motivation and endured across many eons sustained by an altruistic resolve
During this career it was held the bodhisattva qualified himself for Buddhahood by fulfilling certain supreme virtues the pāramīs or pāramitās which now took the place that the factors of the noble eightfold path held in Early Buddhism
This understanding of the Buddha I must stress was common to all the schools of Sectarian Buddhism including the Theravāda
During the age of Sectarian Buddhism the Early Buddhist schools came to admit three vehicles to enlightenment the vehicle of the disciple arahant the śrāvakayāna to be taken by the greatest number of disciples the vehicle of the solitary enlightened one who attains realization without a teacher but does not teach the pratyekabuddhayāna which is still more difficult and the vehicle of the aspirant to Buddhahood the bodhisattvayāna
Once it became widespread in mainstream Indian Buddhism the idea of the three vehicles was not only taken up by the Mahāyāna but was eventually also absorbed into conservative Theravāda Buddhism
Thus we read in the later Theravāda commentaries such as those by cariya Dhammapāla and others of the same three yānas or of the three kinds of bodhi the enlightenment of disciples of paccekabuddhas and of sammā sambuddhas
Now at some point during this period the altruistic interpretation of the Buddha's enlightenment that culminated in the conception of the bodhisattva path flowed back upon the Buddhist community and for some members at least took on a prescriptive force
As they reflected deeply on what it meant to be an ideal follower of the Buddha such Buddhist disciples concluded that to follow in the Buddha's footsteps in the highest sense it was no longer sufficient simply to follow the noble eightfold path aimed at the attainment of nirvāṇa
This was still seen as a valid option an option that culminated in liberation for oneself and those one might immediately influence by teaching and example but they held the Buddha himself had aimed at a state that would enable him to promote the welfare and happiness of the hosts of devas and humans
Thus these thinkers felt the superior choice the higher way to follow the Buddha was to set out on the same quest that the Buddha had set for himself by taking the vows of a bodhisattva and following the bodhisattva course
This would have marked the emergence of the bodhisattvayāna as a conception of the ideal Buddhist way of life the way binding upon the true follower of the Enlightened One
This ideal emerged from a different starting point than Early Buddhism a different visionary background
Whereas Early Buddhism takes the common human condition as its starting point and even views the Buddha as beginning as a human being subject to human frailties earlyperiod Mahāyāna Buddhism takes as its starting point the longrange cosmic background to a Buddha's attainment of Buddhahood
It looks back to his first conception of the bodhicitta his original vows and his practice of the pāramitās over countless lives and treats these as the paradigm for practice
That is it sees this process not merely as a description of the path that a Buddha follows but as a recommendation of the path that his true disciples should follow some later versions of Mahāyāna see this as the actualization of a potential for Buddhahood the tathāgatagarbha or embryo of the ThusCome One already embedded deep within us
We can imagine a period when the bodhisattvayāna had been consciously adopted by a growing number of Buddhists probably first within small circles of monks who sought to guide themselves by the sūtras of the Nikāyas or gamas and the Jātaka stories dealing with the Buddha's past lives
They were still members of early Buddhist communities and probably had not yet even become conscious of themselves as branching off to form a new tradition
They would not have thought of themselves as Mahāyāna Buddhists as we understand the term today but simply as communities of Buddhists pledged to follow the bodhisattvayāna which they might have designated the mahāyāna simply in the sense that it constituted a great course to enlightenment
However while for some time they may have tried to remain within the fold of mainstream Buddhism once they began to openly propagate the bodhisattva ideal they would have found themselves in open confrontation with those who adhered more strictly to the ideas and ideals of the older wellestablished sūtras
This confrontation would have heightened their sense of distinctness and thus led to their conscious amalgamation into communities revolving around a new vision of the Buddhist path and goal
At this point they might have found that the teachings of the Nikāyagama sūtras which describe the practices needed to attain personal liberation from the round of birth and death no longer met their needs
They would of course still have accepted these teachings as authoritative since they stemmed directly from the Buddha but they would also felt the need for scriptures rooted in the same authority that provide detailed teachings about the practices and stages of the bodhisattva path which aimed at nothing less than perfect Buddhahood
It was to fill this need presumably that the Mahāyāna sūtras began to appear on the Indian Buddhist scene
Exactly how these sūtras were first composed and made their appearance is a matter about which contemporary scholarship is still largely in the dark for all we have at our disposal are Mahāyāna sūtras that are fairly well developed and represent Mahāyāna Buddhism at what we might call stage two or even stage three of its development
Unfortunately we cannot use them to peer back into the very earliest stage of the Mahāyāna when these sūtras were first starting to take shape or even past that period when Mahāyānist ideas were still in the stage of gestation seeking articulation without yet having come to expression in any literary documents
Now there are two attitudes noticeable in the early Mahāyāna sūtras regarding the older paradigm based on the arahant ideal
One is to affirm it as valid for the typical Buddhist follower while extolling the bodhisattva path as the appropriate vehicle for the person of excellent aspirations
This attitude treats the old arahant ideal or the śrāvaka paradigm with respect and admiration while lavishing the greatest praise on the bodhisattva ideal
When this attitude is adopted the two paths  together with the path to the enlightenment of a pratekabuddha  become three valid vehicles the choice of which is left to the disciple
The other attitude seen in the Mahāyāna sūtras is one of devaluation and denigration
It involves not simply comparing the path to arahantship unfavorably with the bodhisattva path but belittling and ridiculing the old ideal of ancient Buddhism sometimes treating it almost with contempt
The first attitude is seen in such early Mahāyāna texts as the Ugraparipṛcchā Sūtra
Over time however the second attitude became more prominent until we find such texts as the Vimalakīrti Sūtra which ridicules the great disciples of the Buddha like Sāriputta Upāli and Puṇṇa Mantāniputta or the Aśokadattā Sūtra in which a young girl bodhisattva refuses to show respect to the great arahant disciples or the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Sūtra which compares the nirvāṇa of the arahants to the wages of a hired laborer
In some sūtras it is even said that arahants feel shame and reproach themselves for attaining arahantship or that arahants are conceited and deluded
It is indisputable that the Mahāyāna sūtras often have passages of great depth and beauty
I believe however that a more conciliatory attitude towards the older form of Buddhism would have made the task of achieving harmony among different Buddhist schools today much easier than it is
Within the Theravāda school the Mahāyāna teachings on the bodhisattva ideal and the practice of the pāramitās were incorporated into the later commentaries but never in a way that involved denigration of the older more historical Buddhist goal of arahantship
In this part of my presentation I want to use this historical analysis to break down old stereotypes and the prejudices that have divided followers of the two main forms of Buddhism
From there we can work towards a healthy rather than competitive integration of the two
The two main stereotypes are as follows
Arahants and Theravādin Buddhists are concerned exclusively with their own salvation as opposed to the benefit of others they have a narrow fixation on personal liberation because they are fearful of birth and death and therefore have little compassion for others and don't undertake activities intended to benefit them
Followers of the bodhisattva ideal and Mahāyāna Buddhists are so much involved in social projects aimed at benefiting others that they don't take up the practice that the Buddha assigned to his disciples namely the taming of the mind and the development of insight
They have overwhelmed themselves with social duties and forsaken meditation practice
I'll take the two stereotypes in order and begin with the ancient arahants
Although the Buddha was the pioneer in discovering the path to liberation this does not mean that his arahant disciples just selfishly reaped the benefits of the path and did nothing for others
To the contrary in the suttas we can see that many of them became great teachers in their own right who were capable of guiding others towards liberation
The best known among them are Sāriputta Mahākaccāna Moggāllana and nanda
There was the monk Puṇṇa who went to the barbarian Sunāparanta country risking his life to teach the Dhamma to the people there
There were such nuns as Khemā and Dhammadinnā who were outstanding preachers Paṭācārā who was a master of the discipline and many others
For four hundred years the Buddhist texts were preserved orally transmitted from teachers to pupils and obviously there had to be thousands of monks and nuns who dedicated their lives to learning the texts and teaching them to pupils all for the purpose of preserving the good Dhamma and Vinaya in the world
The example established by the Buddha's great arahant disciples has been the model for the followers of the arahant ideal throughout history
While those who pursue this ideal do not make such lofty vows as do followers of the bodhisattva ideal they are inspired by the example of the Buddha and his great disciples to work for the spiritual and moral uplift of others to the best of their ability by teaching by example and by direct spiritual influence inspired by the Buddha's command to wander forth for the welfare of the multitude for the happiness of the multitude out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of devas and human beings
The life pattern of a follower of the arahant ideal conforms in many respects to that of the Buddha
I take as an example those who may not have actually achieved arahantship itself but are practicing within this framework and have reached some higher stage of spiritual accomplishment
In the early part of their lives they may go to a forest monastery or to a meditation center to train under a competent teacher
Then after reaching a sufficient level of maturity to practice on their own they will go into solitude to develop their practice for a period that might last five years or longer
Then at a certain point their achievements will start to exert an influence on others
They might start to teach on their own initiative or their teacher might ask them to begin teaching or prospective students might realize they have achieved some superior state and request guidance from them
From this point on they will begin to teach and in time they might become well respected spiritual teachers with many disciples and many centers under their guidance
In contrast to the image of selfish personal liberation that Mahāyāna Buddhists ascribe to the arahants and those following the śrāvakayāna the most eminent masters of the Theravāda tradition often teach thousands of disciples monastic and laity
Some may work ten or more hours a day
For example in recent times Ven
Mahasi Sayadaw of Burma established hundreds of meditation centers in Burma and presided over the Sixth Buddhist Council Ajahn Chah had a main monastery and many branch monasteries in Thailand one dedicated to foreign monks Ven
Pa Auk Sayadaw U Pandita and Bhante Gunaratana  presentday Theravāda meditation teachers  travel throughout the world conducting courses Ajahn Maha Boowa at age reputed to be an arahant supports sixty hospitals in Thailand and regularly visits them to console patients and distribute medicines
Those who are not competent to function as meditation teachers might still become masters of Buddhist texts and philosophy and devote themselves selflessly to guiding others in understanding the Dhamma whether by training monks and nuns by giving instructions to the laity by teaching in Buddhist monastic schools or by preaching in Buddhist temples
From the Theravāda perspective while social work is certainly praiseworthy of all benefits that can be conferred on others the most precious benefit is the gift of the Dharma
Thus the quest for liberation as an arahant is not a purely private personal undertaking but has a farreaching influence and can have an impact upon a whole society
In the traditional Theravāda countries before the corrupting influence of the West set in the whole life of the community revolved around the Dhamma
The monks who meditated in the forests and mountains were the inspiration and model for the society those who preached and taught in the villages helped to transmit the Dhamma to the people
The lay community from the king down to the villagers saw their principal duty to be the support of the Sangha
So the supreme goal of arahantship became the focal point for an entire social system inspired and sustained by devotion to the Dhamma
Those who seek the goal of nirvāṇa do not wait until they become arahants before they start helping others
Within this system giving is regarded as the foundation for all other virtues it is the first basis of merit and the first of the ten pāramis
Thus the Pali scriptures and monks in their preaching encourage people to give to the best of their ability
Lay people support the Sangha with their simple material needs of food robes dwellings and medicines
They also give generously to the poor and disadvantaged
In Sri Lanka for example blood donation campaigns are common on Buddhist holidays and many people donate their eyes to eye banks and their bodily organs for medical research after their death
I learned recently that in Sri Lanka more than monks have donated kidneys without any thought of remuneration or any other personal benefit solely for the privilege of giving a bodily organ
Monks with knowledge of the Dhamma and skill in speaking become preachers and teachers
Those with managerial skills might become administrators of monasteries
The few who are strongly motivated to make the effort to win liberation in this very life dedicate their energy to meditation in forest hermitages
Accomplished meditation teachers will devote their time to teaching meditation and will also try to find time to develop their own practice
Sometimes they have to delay their own practice in order to fulfill their teaching duties
So much for misunderstandings concerning the arahant ideal and now for the bodhisattva ideal I think it would be an oversimplification to equate the pursuit of the bodhisattva ideal with engagement in social service and to assume that a bodhisattva forgoes all training on the path to liberation
In my understanding the foundation of the bodhisattva path is the arising of the bodhicitta the aspiration to supreme enlightenment
This usually arises only through diligent training in meditation
According to the authoritative sources on Mahāyāna Buddhist meditation to generate the bodhicitta one must systematically train the mind to perceive all beings as one's mothers and fathers sisters and brothers and arouse towards them boundless lovingkindness and great compassion until such a perception becomes natural and spontaneous
This is not at all easy
I read that the Dalai Lama has said that he himself has experienced the real bodhicitta only a few times for a few moments each time so this gives us some idea of how difficult such an achievement must be
It can't be won just by casually engaging in a little social service and then convincing oneself that one has aroused the bodhicitta
It is true that the bodhisattva vows to work for the welfare of others in a broader way than the follower of the śrāvaka vehicle but all such efforts are superficial if they are not motivated and supported by the true bodhicitta
Besides generating the aspirational bodhicitta the bodhisattva must apply the bodhicitta through the practice of the six pāramitās and other great bodhisattva deeds of selfabnegation
The pāramitās begin with dānapāramitā the perfection of giving
Social engagement can certainly be included under this category as it involves giving others material gifts and the gift of security
But these gifts as worthy as they are do not equal in value the gift of the Dharma for the gift of the Dharma leads to the permanent extinction of suffering
To be qualified to give this gift requires skills that go beyond social service
The next spiritual perfection is sīlapāramitā the perfection of morality and social engagement can be included under the morality of altruistic action acts that benefit others
While engaged in social service a bodhisattva must also practice patience   patience in enduring difficult conditions patience in enduring disregard and abuse from others so he is fulfilling kṣāntipāramitā the perfection of patience
And the work of social service demands energy
This helps to fulfill the vīryapāramitā the perfection of energy
Thus social engagement can contribute towards the fulfillment of four of the six pāramitās
But the bodhisattva must also fulfill the dhyānapāramitā and the prajñāpāramitā the perfections of meditation and wisdom and these two perfections require the adoption of a contemplative life style
The Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras say that the prajñāpāramitā guides and directs the other five pāramitās and the other five pāramitās become perfections or transcendent virtues only when they are connected with prajñāpāramitā
But prajñāpāramitā can only be attained through contemplative practice by seeking out a lifestyle similar to that of one seeking arahantship
The early Mahāyāna sūtras such as the Ugraparipcchā Sūtra do not recommend that the novice monastic bodhisattva immerse himself in social work rather they point him to the forest and instruct him to devote his efforts to meditation
If we look at the history of Mahāyāna Buddhism whether in India China or Tibet we would see that the great Mahāyāna masters such as Nāgārjuna Asanga and Atīsha in India Huineng Zhiyi and Xuancang in China Longchen Gampopa and Tsongkhapa in Tibet were not renown for their engagement in social service but for their accomplishments as philosophers scholars and meditation masters
The Buddha himself achieved the highest attainments in meditation
Since bodhisattvas aim to become Buddhas it is only natural that they should perfect the meditative skills that are characteristic of a Buddha
Although the motivation and philosophical basis for followers of the bodhisattva vehicle differ from that of followers of the śrāvaka vehicle the lifestyles of the two are not very different
The popular images of the withdrawn solitary arahant and the gregarious superactive bodhisattva are fictions
In real life the two resemble each other much more than one would think
The arahants and those who seek to attain arahantship often work assiduously for the spiritual and material improvement of their fellow human beings
The bodhisattvas and bodhisattva aspirants often must spend long periods in solitary meditation cultivating the meditative skills that will be necessary for them to attain Buddhahood
They will also have to study all the doctrines and the paths of the śrāvaka vehicle yet without actualizing those paths
The bodhisattvas will have to learn to enter the meditative absorptions practice them and eventually master them
They will have to contemplate the three characteristics of impermanence suffering and nonself
They will have to acquire the insightknowledges into the three characteristics
They differ from śrāvakas in so far as a śrāvaka aims to use the insightknowledges to attain realization of nirvāṇa
A bodhisattva will link his or her practice of the path with the bodhicitta aspiration the bodhisattva vows and the spirit of great compassion
Sustained by these supports a bodhisattva will be able to contemplate the nature of reality without attaining realization of nirvāṇa until he or she has matured all the qualities that come to perfection in Buddhahood
Among these is the perfection of giving and the conferring of benefits on sentient beings
But the greatest gift that one can give is the gift of the Dharma and the kindest benefit one can confer on sentient beings is teaching them the Dharma and guiding them in the Dharma
Though a bodhisattva can certainly engage in social service as an expression of his or her compassion to reach the higher stages of the bodhisattva path the aspirant will require a different range of skills than is exercised in social engagement skills that are closer to those possessed by the arahant
In my own view both paths  the arahant path and the bodhisattva path  can be seen as valid expressions of the Buddha's teaching
However they must both conform to certain formal criteria
In matters of principle they must conform to such teachings as the four noble truths the three characteristics and dependent origination and in matters of practice they must embody wholesome ethics and follow the scheme of the threefold training in morality concentration and wisdom
Nevertheless even when these criteria are fulfilled we must further avoid any type of syncretism that leads to the denigration of the original teachings of the historical Buddha regarding them as mere expedients or adaptations to the Indian religious climate of his age rendered irrelevant by teachings arisen at a later period
The kind of tolerance that is needed is one that respects the authenticity of Early Buddhism so far as we can determine its nature from the oldest historical records yet can also recognize the capacity of Buddhism to undergo genuine historical transformations that bring to manifestation hidden potentials of the ancient teaching transformations not necessarily preordained to arise from the early teaching but which nevertheless enrich the tradition springing from the Buddha as its fountainhead
When we adopt this approach we can truly venerate those practitioners who work diligently to realize the final goal of the Dhamma here and now to reach nibbāna the extinction of suffering by following the noble eightfold path to its very end
We can venerate those who glorify the teaching by showing that it truly leads to ultimate liberation to the plunge into the unborn and unconditioned state the deathless element which the Buddha so often extolled calling it the wonderful and marvelous the peaceful purity the unsurpassed liberation
Again by taking this approach we can also venerate those who vow to follow the compassionate route of the bodhisattva and who make this vow as an act of supererogation not because it is a necessary condition for their own true deliverance
We can revere and cherish their lovingkindness their great compassion their lofty aspirations and their selfsacrificial service to the world
True Buddhism needs all three Buddhas arahants and bodhisattvas
It needs Buddhas to discover and teach the path to liberation it needs arahants to follow the path and confirm that the Dharma does indeed lead to liberation adorning the teaching with examples of those who lead the purest holy life it needs bodhisattvas to bring forth the resolve to perfect those qualities that will enable them at some point in the future near or distant to become Buddhas themselves and once again turn the unsurpassed Wheel of the Dharma
These talks  except for the two marked otherwise  were originally given for the benefit of Mrs
Pow Panga Vathanakul a follower of Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa who had contracted cancer of the bone marrow and had come to practice meditation at Wat Pa Baan Taad in order to contend with the pain of the disease and the fact of her approaching death
All in all she stayed at Wat Pa Baan Taad for days from November to February during that period Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa gave impromptu talks for her benefit all of which were tape recorded
After her death in September one of her friends MR
Sermsri Kasemsri asked permission of the Venerable Acariya to transcribe the talks and print them in book form
Seventyseven of the talks plus an additional eight talks given on other occasions were thus printed in two massive volumes together totaling more than pages
Six talks from these two volumes have already been translated into English and published in a book entitled Amata Dhamma
The talks in the present collection all deal with the practice of meditation and particularly with the development of discernment
Because their style of presentation is personal and impromptu they will probably be best understood if read in conjunction with a more systematic introduction to the techniques of meditation such as the Venerable Acariya's own book Wisdom Develops Samadhi which is available separately or as part of the volume Forest Dhamma
The title of the present book is taken from a request frequently made by the Venerable Acariya to his listeners that his teachings be taken to heart because they come straight from the heart
The Venerable Acariya Mun taught that all hearts have the same language
No matter what one's language or nationality the heart has nothing but simple awareness which is why he said that all hearts have the same language
When a thought arises we understand it but when we put it into words it has to become this or that language so that we don't really understand one another
The feelings within the heart though are the same for everyone
This is why the Dhamma fits the heart perfectly because the Dhamma isn't any particular language
The Dhamma is the language of the heart
The Dhamma resides with the heart
Pleasure and pain reside with the heart
The acts that create pleasure and pain are thought up by the heart
The heart is what knows the results that appear as pleasure and pain and the heart is burdened with the outcome of its own thoughts
This is why the heart and the Dhamma fit perfectly
No matter what our language or nationality we can all understand the Dhamma because the heart and the Dhamma are a natural pair
The heart forms the core within the body
It's the core the substance the primary essence within the body
It's the basic foundation
The conditions that arise from the mind such as thoughtformations appear and vanish again and again
Here I'm referring to the rippling of the mind
When the mind ripples that's the formation of a thought
Labels which deal with conjecturing memorizing and recognizing are termed sañña
'Long' thoughts are sañña short thoughts are sankhara
In other words when a thought forms  'blip'  that's a sankhara
Sañña refers to labeling and recognizing
Viññana refers to the act of taking note when anything external comes and makes contact with the senses as when visible forms make contact with the eye and cognition results
All of these things are constantly arising and vanishing of their own accord and so the Buddha called them khandhas
Each 'heap' or 'group' is called a khandha
These five heaps of khandhas are constantly arising and vanishing all the time
Even arahants have these same conditions  just like ordinary people everywhere  the only difference being that the arahants' khandhas are khandhas pure and simple without any defilements giving them orders making them do this or think that
Instead their khandhas think out of their own free nature with nothing forcing them to think this or that unlike the minds of ordinary people in general
To make a comparison the khandhas of ordinary people are like prisoners constantly being ordered about
Their various thoughts labels assumptions and interpretations have something that orders and forces them to appear making them think assume and interpret in this way or that
In other words they have defilements as their boss their leader ordering them to appear
Arahants however don't
When a thought forms it simply forms
Once it forms it simply disappears
There's no seed to continue it no seed to weigh the mind down because there's nothing to force it unlike the khandhas governed by defilements or under the leadership of defilements
This is where the difference lies
But their basic nature is the same All the khandhas we have mentioned are inconstant
In other words instability and changeability are a regular part of their nature beginning with the rupa khandha our body and the vedana khandha feelings of pleasure pain and indifference
These things appear and vanish again and again
Sañña sankhara and viññana are also always in a state of appearing and vanishing as a normal part of their nature
But as for actual awareness  which forms the basis of our knowledge of the various things that arise and vanish  that doesn't vanish
We can say that the mind can't vanish
We can say that the mind can't arise
A mind that has been purified thus has no more problems concerning the birth and death of the body and the khandhas and thus there is no more birth here and there appearing in crude forms such as individuals or as living beings for those whose minds have been purified
But those whose minds are not purified They are the ones who take birth and die setting their sights on cemeteries without end all because of this undying mind
This is why the Lord Buddha taught the world and in particular the world of human beings who know right and wrong good and evil who know how to foster the one and remedy the other who understand the language of the Dhamma he taught
This is why he taught the human world above and beyond the other worlds so that we could try to remedy the things that are harmful and detrimental removing them from our thoughts words and deeds try to nourish and foster whatever goodness we might already have and give rise to whatever goodness we don't yet have
He taught us to foster and develop the goodness we already have so as to nourish the heart giving it refreshment and wellbeing giving it a standard of quality or goodness so that when it leaves its present body to head for whatever place or level of being this mind that has been constantly nourished with goodness will be a good mind
Wherever it fares it will fare well
Wherever it takes birth it will be born well
Wherever it lives it will live well
It will keep on experiencing wellbeing and happiness until it gains the capacity the potential the accumulation of merit it has developed progressively from the past into the present  in other words yesterday is today's past today is tomorrow's past all of which are days in which we have fostered and developed goodness step by step  to the point where the mind has the firm strength and ability from the supporting power of this goodness that enables it to pass over and gain release
Such a mind has no more birth not even in the most quiet or refined levels of being that contain any latent traces of conventional reality  namely birth and death as we currently experience it
Such a mind goes completely beyond all such things
Here I'm referring to the minds of the Buddhas and of the arahants
There's a story about Ven
Vangisa that has a bearing on this
Ven
Vangisa when he was a layman was very talented in divining the level of being in which the mind of a dead person was reborn  no matter who the person was
You couldn't quite say he was a fortuneteller
Actually he was more a master of psychic skills
When anyone died he would take that person's skull and knock on it  knock
knock
knock
 focus his mind and then know that this person was reborn there that person was reborn here
If the person was reborn in hell or in heaven as a common animal or a hungry ghost he could tell in every case without any hesitation
All he needed was to knock on the skull
When he heard his friends say that the Buddha was many times more talented than this he wanted to expand on his knowledge
So he went to the Buddha's presence to ask for further training in this science
When he reached the Buddha the Buddha gave him the skull of an arahant to knock on
'All right see if you can tell where he was reborn'
Ven
Vangisa knocked on the skull and listened
He knocked again and listened
He thought for a moment
He focused his mind
He couldn't see where the owner of the skull was reborn
At his wit's end he confessed frankly that he didn't know where the arahant was reborn
At first Ven
Vangisa had thought himself talented and smart and had planned to challenge the Buddha before asking for further training
But when he reached the Buddha the Buddha gave him the skull of an arahant to knock on  and right there he was stymied
So now he genuinely wanted further training
Once he had further training he'd really be something special
This being the way things stood he asked to study with the Buddha
So the Buddha taught him the science taught him the method  in other words the science of the Dhamma
Ven
Vangisa practiced and practiced until finally he attained arahantship
From then on he was no longer interested in knocking on anyone's skull except for his own
Once he had known clearly that was the end of the matter
This is called 'knocking on the right skull'
Once the Buddha had brought up the topic of the mind that doesn't experience rebirth  the skull of one whose mind was purified  no matter how many times Ven
Vangisa knocked on it he couldn't know where the mind was reborn even though he had been very talented before for the place of a pure mind's rebirth cannot be found
The same was true in the case of Ven
Godhika This story should serve as quite some food for thought
Ven
Godhika went to practice meditation made progress step by step but then regressed
They say this happened six times
After the seventh time he took a razor to slash his throat  he was so depressed  but then came to his senses contemplated the Dhamma and became an arahant at the last minute
That's the story in brief
When he died Mara's hordes searched for his spirit
To put it simply they stirred up a storm but couldn't tell where he had been reborn
So the Lord Buddha said 'No matter how much you dig or search or investigate to find the spirit of our son Godhika who has completely finished his task you won't be able to find it  even if you turn the world upside down  because such a task lies beyond the scope of conventional reality' How could they possibly find it
It's beyond the capacity of people with defilements to know the power of an arahant's mind
In the realm of convention there is no one who can trace the path of an arahant's mind because an arahant lies beyond convention even though his is a mind just the same
Think about it Even our stumbling and crawling mind when it is continually cleansed without stop without ceasing without letting perseverance lag will gradually become more and more refined until it reaches the limit of refinement
Then the refinement will disappear  because refinement is a matter of conventional reality  leaving a nature of solid gold or solid Dhamma called a pure mind
We too will then have no more problems just like the arahants because our mind will have become a superlative mind just like the minds of those who have already gained release
All minds of this sort are the same with no distinction between women and men which is simply a matter of sex or convention
With the mind there is no distinction between women and men and thus both women and men have the same capacity in the area of the Dhamma
Both are capable of attaining the various levels of Dhamma all the way to release
There are no restrictions that can be imposed in this area
All that is needed is that we develop enough ability and potential and then we can all go beyond
For this reason we should all make an effort to train our hearts and minds
At the very least we should get the mind to attain stillness and peace with any of the meditation themes that can lull it into a state of calm giving rise to peace and wellbeing within it
For example mindfulness of breathing which is one of the primary themes in meditation circles seems to suit the temperaments of more people than any other theme
But whatever the theme take it as a governing principle a refuge a mainstay for the mind putting it into practice within your own mind so as to attain rest and peace
When the mind begins to settle down we will begin to see its essential nature and worth
We will begin to see what the heart is and how it is
In other words when the mind gathers all of its currents into a single point as simple awareness within itself this is what is called the 'mind'
The gathering in of the mind occurs on different levels corresponding to the mind's ability and to the different stages of its refinement
Even if the mind is still on a crude level we can nevertheless know it when it gathers inwardly
When the mind becomes more and more refined we will know its refinement  'This mind is refined This mind is radiant This mind is extremely still This mind is something extremely amazing'  more and more step by step this very same mind
In cleansing and training the mind for the sake of stillness in investigating probing and solving the problems of the mind with discernment  which is the way of making the mind progress or of enabling us to reach the truth of the mind step by step through the means already mentioned  no matter how crude the mind may be don't worry about it
If we get down to making the effort and persevere continually with what diligence and persistence we have that crudeness will gradually fade away and vanish
Refinement will gradually appear through our own actions or our own striving until we are able to go beyond and gain release by slashing the defilements to bits
This holds true for all of us men and women alike
But while we aren't yet able to do so we shouldn't be anxious
All that is asked is that we make the mind principled so that it can be a refuge and a mainstay for itself
As for this body we've been relying on it ever since the day we were born
This is something we all can know
We've made it live lie down urinate defecate work make a living
We've used it and it has used us
We order it around and it orders us around
For instance we've made it work and it has made us suffer with aches here and pains there so that we have to search for medicine to treat it
It's the one that hurts and it's the one that searches for medicine
It's the one that provides the means
And so we keep supporting each other back and forth in this way
It's hard to tell who is in charge the body or us
We can order it around part of the time but it orders us around all the time
Illness hunger thirst sleepiness These are all nothing but a heap of suffering and stress in which the body orders us around and orders us from every side
We can order it around only a little bit so when the time is right for us to give the orders we should make it meditate
So
Get to work
As long as the body is functioning normally then no matter how much or how heavy the work get right to it
But if the body isn't functioning normally if you're ill you need to be conscious of what it can take
As for the mind though keep up the effort within unflaggingly because it's your essential duty
You've depended on the body for a long time
Now that it's wearing down know that it's wearing down  which parts still work which parts no longer work
You're the one in charge and you know it full well so make whatever compromises you should
But as for the heart which isn't ill along with the body it should step up its efforts within so that it won't lack the benefits it should gain
Make the mind have standards and be principled  principled in its living principled in its dying
Wherever it's born make it have good principles and satisfactory standards
What they call 'merit' won't betray your hopes or expectations
It will provide you with satisfactory circumstances at all times in keeping with the fact that you've accumulated the merit  the wellbeing  that all the world wants and of which no one has enough
In other words what the world wants is wellbeing whatever the sort and in particular the wellbeing of the mind that will arise step by step from having done things such as meditation which are noble and good
This is the wellbeing that forms a core or an important essence within the heart
We should strive then while the body is still functioning for when life comes to an end nothing more can be done
No matter how little or how much we have accomplished we must stop at that point
We stop our work put it aside and then reap its rewards  there in the next life
Whatever we should be capable of doing we do
If we can go beyond or gain release that's the end of every problem
There will then be nothing to involve us in any turmoil
Here I've been talking about the mind because the mind is the primary issue
That which will make us fare well or badly meet with pleasure or pain is nothing else but the mind
As for what they call bad kamma it lies within the mind that has made it
Whether or not you can remember these seeds  which lie within the heart  can't be prevented from bearing fruit because they are rooted in the mind
You have to accept your kamma
Don't find fault with it
Once it's done it's done so how can you find fault with it
The hand writes and so the hand must erase
You have to accept it like a good sport
This is the way it is with kamma until you can gain release  which will be the end of the problem
Those who practice the Dhamma will begin to know the Dhamma or to gain a feel for the Dhamma in the area of meditation more markedly than in other areas and more extensively
For example the gratification that comes from being generous is moving in one way the gratification that comes from maintaining the precepts is moving in another way the feelings of gratification that come from the different forms of goodness are moving in their own separate ways
This is called finding gratification in skillfulness
But all of these feelings of gratification converge in the practice of meditation
We begin to feel moved from the moment the mind begins to grow still when the heart gathers its currents together to stand solely on its own
Even though we may not yet obtain a great deal of stillness from the inward gathering of the mind we still find ourselves gratified within in a way we can clearly sense
If the mind or the Dhamma were a material object there wouldn't be anyone in the world who wouldn't respect the religion because the goodness the wellbeing and the marvels that arise from the religion and from the practicing in line with the teachings of the religion are things desired the world over
Goodness wellbeing marvels These are things the world has always desired from time immemorial  with a desire that has never lost its taste  and they are things that will always be desired until the world loses its meaning or until people become extinct having no more sense of good and evil
That's when the world will no longer aspire for these great blessings
The wellbeing that comes from the marvels  the Dhamma in the area of its results  is something to which all living beings aspire simply that their abilities differ so that some attain their aspirations while others don't
But the Dhamma can't be displayed for the world to perceive with its senses of sight hearing smell taste or touch in the way other things can
Even though there may be other immaterial phenomena similar to the Dhamma  such as smells  still they aren't like the true Dhamma that is touched by the hearts of those who have practiced it
If the Dhamma could be displayed like material objects there is no doubt but that the human world would have to respect the religion for the sake of that Dhamma
This is because the Dhamma is something more marvelous than anything else
In all the three levels of existence there is no greater marvel than in the Dhamma
The Dhamma can appear as a marvel conspicuous and clear in the mind
The mind is what knows it  and only the mind
It can't be displayed in general like material objects as when we take things out to admire or to show off to others
The Dhamma can't possibly be displayed like material objects
This is what makes the world lack interest  and lack the things that could be hoped from the Dhamma  in a way that is really a shame
Even those who want the marvel of the Dhamma don't know what the marvel is or what the profundity of the Dhamma is because the mind has never had contact with that profundity
The eye has never had contact with the marvel
The ear has never obtained any marvel from the current of the Dhamma because the Dhamma can't be displayed as a current of sound as other things can
This is one obstacle that prevents people from becoming moved by the Dhamma that prevents them from fully believing and fully entrusting themselves to the Dhamma in a way consistent with the world's longfelt hunger for wellbeing and prosperity
Each of the Buddhas who has gained Awakening and taught the Dhamma to the world has had to reflect to the full extent of his intelligence and ability on the myriad ways of teaching the Dhamma to the world so that the world could see it as a marvel inasmuch as the Dhamma can't be put in shop windows or in public places
This is because the true Dhamma lies in the heart and reveals itself only in words and deeds which doesn't excite a gratifying sense of absorption in the same way as touching the Dhamma directly with the heart
Because there is no way to display the Dhamma directly the Buddhas display it indirectly through teaching
They point out the causes  the Dhamma of conduct and practices leading to the Dhamma of results at this or that point or this or that level and at the same time they proclaim the results  the excellence the marvels of the stages and levels of the Dhamma that can be touched with the heart all the way to the highest marvel vimutti the mental release called nibbana within the heart
Every Buddha has to devise strategies in teaching the Dhamma so as to bring that marvel out to the world by using various modes of speech and conduct  for example describing the Dhamma and showing the conduct of the Dhamma as being like this and that  but the actual Dhamma can't be shown
It is something known exclusively in the heart in the way in which each Buddha and each arahant possesses this marvel
None of the Buddhas none of the arahants who possess this marvel are in any way deficient in this regard
The marvel lies in their hearts  simply that they can't take the marvel that appears there and display it in the full measure of its wonder
Thus they devise strategies for displaying it in their actions which are simply attributes of the Dhamma not the actual Dhamma itself
For instance the doctrine they teach in the texts is simply an attribute of the Dhamma
Their act of teaching is also just an attribute of the Dhamma
The actual Dhamma is when a meditator or a person who listens to their teachings about the Dhamma follows the Dhamma in practice and touches it stage by stage within his or her own heart
This is called beginning to make contact with the actual Dhamma step by step
However much contact is made it gives a sense of gratification felt exclusively within the heart of the person who has gained that contact through his or her own practice
When it comes to ingenuity in teaching no one excels the Buddhas
Even so they reveal only what they see as appropriate for humanity
They can't reveal the actual Dhamma  for example by taking out the true marvel in their hearts and unfolding it for the world to see saying 'This is the marvel of the Tathagata of each Buddha
Do you see it' This can't be done for here we're talking about the marvel of the purity of a heart that was previously swamped with defilement like a heap of assorted excrement but now has become a pure unsullied nature or a pure amazing nature because of the practice of constantly and relentlessly cleansing it
They can't show that Dhamma to the world saying 'Do you see this
Look at it
Look at it
Feast your eyes till they're full and then strive to make this treasure your own' So instead they teach by using various strategies for those who practice describing the path in full detail in terms both of causes and of results
What they bring out to show is simply the current of their voices the breath of their mouths
That's what they bring out to speak simply the breath of their mouths
They can't bring out the real thing
For example when they say 'It's marvelous like this' it's just sound
The marvelous nature itself can't be brought out
All they can bring out is the action of saying 'That nature is marvelous' so that we can speculate for ourselves as to what that marvel is like
Even though this doesn't remove our doubts it's better than if we had never heard about it at all
But the basic principle in making us come to know and see the marvel of the Dhamma is that first we have to speculate and then we follow with practice
This qualifies as following the principles of the Dhamma the Buddha taught and this is fitting and proper
No matter what the difficulties and hardships encountered in following the path we shouldn't let them form barriers to our progress because this is where the path lies
There are no other byways that can take us easily to the goal
If our practice is difficult we have to stick with it
If it's painful we have to bear it because it's a duty we have to perform a burden we have to carry while working so as to attain our aims
The Dhamma of a pure mind is like this The mind is the Dhamma the Dhamma is the mind
We call it a mind only as long as it is still with the body and khandhas
Only then can we call it a pure mind the mind of a Buddha or the mind of an arahant
After it passes from the body and khandhas there is no conventional reality to which it can be compared and so we can't call it anything at all
No matter how marvelous that nature no matter how much it may be ours there is no possible way we can use conventional realities to describe it or to make comparisons because that Dhamma that realm of release has no conventions against which to measure things or make comparisons
It's the same as if we were in outer space Which way is north which way is south we don't know
If we're on Earth we can say 'east' 'west' 'north' and 'south' because there are things that we can observe and compare so as to tell which direction lies which way
We take the Earth as our standard
'High' and 'low' depend on the Earth as their frame of reference
How much higher than this lower than this north of this south of this These things we can say
But if we're out in outer space there is no standard by which we can measure things and so we can't say
Or as when we go up in an airplane We can't tell how fast or how slow we're going
When we pass a cloud we can tell that we're going fast but if we depend simply on our eyesight we're sure to think that the speed of the airplane is nowhere near the speed of a car
We can clearly see how deceptive our eyesight is in just this way
When we ride in a car the trees on both sides of the road look as if they were falling in together down on the road behind us
Actually they stay their separate selves
It's simply that the car runs past them
Since there are things that we sense that lie close enough for comparison it seems as if the car were going really fast
As for the airplane there's nothing to make comparisons with so it looks as if the plane were dawdling along as if it were going slower than a car even though it's actually many times faster
This is how it is when we compare the mind of an ordinary runofthemill person with the mind of the Buddha
Whatever the Buddha says is good and excellent we ordinary people tend to say that it's not
Whatever we like no matter how vile we say that it's good
We don't admit the truth in the same way as thinking that a car goes faster than an airplane
The practice of attending to the mind is something very important
Try to develop mindfulness and discernment so that they can keep up with the things that come and entangle the mind
By and large the heart itself is the instigator creating trouble continually relentlessly
We then fall for the preoccupations the heart turns out  and this makes us agitated upset and saddened all because of the thoughts formed by the heart
These come from the heart itself and the heart itself is what falls for them saying that this is this and that is that even though the things it names 'this' and 'that' merely exist in line with their nature
They have no meaning in and of themselves that they are like ''this' or 'that' The mind simply gives them meanings and then falls for its own meanings making itself glad or sad over those things without end
Thus the stress and suffering that result from thoughtformations have no end no point of resolution just as if we were floating adrift in the middle of the sea waiting to breathe our last breath
The Buddhas all reached Awakening here in this human world because the human world is rich in the Noble Truths
It's where they are plain to see
The Noble Truth of stress lies in the human body
Human beings know about stress  because they're smarter than common animals
The Noble Truth of the origin of stress This lies in the human heart
The Noble Truth of the path  the path of practice to cure defilement craving and mental effluents which are the things that produce stress This human beings also know
What is the path
To put it briefly virtue concentration and discernment
These things human beings know and can put into practice
The Noble Truth of the cessation of stress This human beings also know
No matter which of these truths all human beings know them  although they may not know how to behave toward them or take interest in behaving in line with them in which case there is no way the Dhamma can help them at all
The Buddhas thus taught the Dhamma in the human world because the human world lies in the center of all the levels of existence
We have been born in the center of existence in the midst of the religion
We should conform correctly to the central point of the religion so as to comprehend the religion's teachings that lie in the center of our heart
The superlative Dhamma lies right here
It doesn't lie anywhere else
The mind is what can reach the Dhamma
The mind is what knows all dhammas
The affairs of the Dhamma then do not lie beyond the mind which is a fitting vessel for them
Good evil pleasure pain The mind knows these things before anything else knows them so we should develop mindfulness and discernment to be resourceful to keep up with the events that are always becoming involved with the mind in the course of each day
If we're intent on investigating the origin of stress which fans out from our various thoughtformations we will find that it arises without stop
It arises right here in the mind
It's fashioned right here
Even though we try to make it quiet it won't be still
Why
Because of the 'unquietness' the thoughts with which the mind disturbs itself which it forms and sends out towards its preoccupations all the time
Once the mind sends out its thoughts it then gathers in stress for itself
It keeps at it in and out like this
What goes out is the origin of stress and what comes back in is stress
In other words thoughts form and go out as the origin of stress and when the results come back to the heart they're stressful
These things are constantly being manufactured like this all the time
When we want the mind to have even just a little bit of calm we really have to force it and even then these things still manage to drive the mind into forming thoughts whenever we let down our guard
This is how it is with the origin of stress which is constantly producing suffering
It lies in the heart and is always arising
For this reason we must use mindfulness and discernment to diagnose and remedy the origin of stress to keep an eye out for it and to snuff it out right there without being negligent
Wherever we sit or stand  whatever our activity  we keep watch over this point with mindfulness alert to it and discernment unraveling it so as to know it constantly for what it truly is
All those who practice to remove defilement practice in this way
In particular those who are ordained practice by going into the forest to look for a place conducive to their striving in order to wipe out this very enemy
Even when they stay in inhabited areas or wherever they go wherever they stay they keep their attention focused continually step by step on the persistent effort to remove and demolish the origin of stress which is a splinter a thorn in the heart
Such people are bound to develop more and more ease and wellbeing step by step in proportion to the persistence of their striving
We can see clearly when the mind is still and settles down Thoughtformations are still or don't exist
Turmoil and disturbances don't occur
The stress that would otherwise result doesn't appear
When the mind is quiet stress is also quiet
When thoughtformations are quiet the origin of stress is also quiet
Stress is also quiet
All that remains at that moment is a feeling of peace and ease
The war between the mind and the defilements causing stress is like this
We have to keep fighting with persistence
We have to use mindfulness and discernment conviction and persistence to contend with the war that disturbs and ravages the mind making it stagger and reel within
The disturbances will then gradually be suppressed
Even when there is only a moment of quiet we will come to see the harm of the thoughtformations that are constantly disturbing us
At the same time we will see the benefits of mental stillness  that it's a genuine pleasure
Whether there is a lot of stillness or a little pleasure arises in proportion to the foundation of stillness or the strength of the stillness which in the texts is called samadhi or concentration
A mind centered and still is called a mind in concentration or a mind gathered in concentration
This is what genuine concentration is like inside the heart
The names of the various stages of concentration are everywhere but actual concentration is inside the heart
The heart is what gives rise to concentration
It produces it makes it on its own
When concentration is still the mind experiences cool respite and pleasure
It has its own foundation set firmly and solidly within
It's as if we were under an eave or under the cooling shade of a tree
We're comfortable when it rains we're comfortable when the sun is out because we don't have to be exposed to the sun and rain
The same holds true with a mind that has an inner foundation of stillness It's not affected by this preoccupation or that which would otherwise disturb and entangle it repeatedly without respite
This is because stillness is the heart's dwelling  'concentration' which is one level of home for the heart
Discernment is ingenuity sound judgment evaluating causes and effects within and without above below and in between  inside the body  all the way to the currents of the mind that send out thoughts from various angles
Mindfulness and discernment keep track of these things investigating and evaluating them so as to know causes and effects in terms of the heart's thoughtformations or in terms of the nature of sankhara within us until we see the truth of each of these things
Don't go investigating these things off target by being clever with labels and interpretations that go against the truth  because in the investigation of phenomena we investigate in line with the truth
We don't resist the truth for that would simply enhance the defilements causing stress at the very moment we think we're investigating phenomena so as to remove them
Birth we have already experienced
As for old age we've been growing old from the day of our birth older and older step by step
Whatever our age that's how long we've been growing old until we reach the end of life
When we're old to the nth degree we fall apart
In other words we've been growing old from the moment of birth  older by the day the month the year  older and older continually
We call it 'growing up' but actually it's growing old
See
Investigate it for what it really is
This is the great highway  the way of nature
Don't resist it
For example the body is growing old but we don't want it to be old
We want it always to be young
This is called resisting the truth  which is stress
Even when we try to resist it we don't get anywhere
What do we hope to gain by resisting it and creating stress for ourselves
Actually we gain nothing but the stress that comes from resisting the truth
Use discernment to investigate just like this
Whenever pain arises in any part of the body if we have medicine to treat it then we treat it
When the medicine can take care of it the body recovers
When the medicine can't it dies
It goes on its own
There's no need for us to force it not to die or to stay alive for soandso many years for that would be an absurdity
Even if we forced it it wouldn't stay
We wouldn't get any results and would just be wearing ourselves out in vain
The body has to follow its own natural principles
When we investigate in line with its truth this way we can be at our ease
Wherever there's pain keep aware of it continually in line with its truth
Whether it hurts a lot or a little keep aware of its manifestations until it reaches the ultimate point of pain  the death of the body  and that's as far as it goes
Know it in line with its truth
Don't resist it
Don't set up any desires because the setting up of desire is a deficiency a hunger
And hunger no matter when or what the sort is pain Hunger for sleep is pain hunger for food is pain hunger for water is pain
When was it ever a good thing
The hunger the desires that arise wanting things to be like this wanting them to be like that These are all nothing but disturbances issues that give rise to stress and pain
This is why the Buddha doesn't have us resist the truth
Use your discernment to investigate to contemplate in line with the natural principles of things as they already are
This is called discernment that doesn't fly in the face of truth  and the heart can then be at ease
We study the four 'Noble Truths' here in our body
In other words we study birth aging illness and death all of which lie in this single heap of elements without ever leaving it
Birth is an affair of these elements
Growing up or growing old it's old right here
When there's illness it manages to be ill right here in one part or another
When death comes it dies right here
So we have to study right here  where else would we study
We have to study and know the things that involve us directly before we study anything else
We have to study them comprehensively and to completion  studying our own birth our aging our illness and pain and completing our study of our own death
That's when we'll be wise  wise to all the events around us
People who know the Dhamma through practicing so that they are wise to the events that occur to themselves do not flinch in the face of any of the conventional realities of the world at all
This is how it is when we study the Dhamma when we know and see the Dhamma in the area of the heart  in other words when we know rightly and well
'Mindfulness and discernment that are wise all around themselves' are wise in this way not wise simply from being able to remember
They have to be wise in curing doubt in curing the recalcitrance of the heart as well as in curing their own attachments and false assumptions so as to leave only a nature that is pure and simple
That's when we'll be really at ease really relieved
Let the khandhas be khandhas pure and simple in their own way without our messing with them without our struggling with them for power without our forcing or coercing them to be like this or like that
The khandhas are then khandhas the mind is then the mind each with its own separate reality each not infringing on the others as it used to
Each performs its own duties
This is called khandhas pure and simple the mind pure and simple without any conventional realities adulterating them
What knows is what knows the elements are elements the khandhas are khandhas
Whatever things may break apart let them break apart
We have already known them clearly with our discernment
We have no doubts
We've known them in advance even before they die so when death comes what doubts can we have
 especially now that they display the truth of their nature for us to see clearly
This is called studying the Dhamma practicing the Dhamma
To study and practice this way is to follow the same way that sages have practiced and known before us
All of these conditions are matters of conventional reality  matters of the elements the khandhas or the sense media
The four khandhas the five khandhas whatever are individual conditions individual conditions that are separated in line with conventions
Discernment is also a condition and mindfulness another condition  conditions of the heart  but they're Dhamma means of curing the mind that is clouded and obscured means of washing away the things that cloud and obscure it until radiance appears through the power of the discernment that cleanses the heart
Once the heart is radiant in the next step it becomes pure
Why is it pure
Because all impurities have fallen away from it
The various misconstruings that are an affair of defilement are all gone from the heart so the heart is pure
This pure heart means that we have completed our study of ourselves in line with the statement of the teaching
vusitam brahmacariyam katam karaniyam
'The task of the religion is done the holy life is complete there is no further task to be done'
When the tasks we have had to do  abandoning and striving  are done to completion we know right here because delusion lay right here in the heart
We study and practice simply to cure our own delusion
Once we know right here and delusion is gone what else is there to know
 for beyond this there is nothing further to know
What else is there for us to be deluded about
We're no longer deluded because we know fully all around
This very state of mind When at the beginning I referred to the superlative Dhamma the marvelous Dhamma I was referring to this very state of mind this very Dhamma  but it's something known exclusively within itself and exists only within itself
It's marvelous  this we know within our own mind
It's superlative  this we also know within our own mind
We can't take it out or unfurl it like other things for other people to see
So if you want to have any Noble Treasures to show for yourself practice
Remove all those dirty stains from the heart and the superlative things I have mentioned will appear by their own nature  in other words they will appear in the mind
This is called completing your study of the Dhamma and your study of the world is completed right here
The 'world' means the world of elements the world of the khandhas that lie right here with each of us which are more important than the worlds of elements and khandhas belonging to other people because this world of elements and khandhas lies with us and has been weighing on the heart all along
When we have studied the Dhamma to the attainment of release that's all there is to study
We've studied the world to completion and studied the Dhamma in full
Our doubts are gone and there is nothing that will ever make us doubt again
As the Buddha exclaimed 'When dhammas become apparent to the Brahman earnest and absorbed doubt comes to an end because the conditions the factors for continued being and birth come to an end'
Once we have reached this level we can live wherever we like
The war is ended  the war between the mind and defilement or the war between Dhamma and defilement is over
This is where we dismantle being and birth
This is where we dismantle the heap of suffering in the round of rebirth  right here in the heart
Since the heart is the wanderer through the cycle of rebirth we have to dismantle things right here to know them right here
Once we know that's the end of all problems right here
In this whole wide world there are no problems
The only problem was the issue of the heart that was deluded about itself and about the things that became involved with it
Now that it has completely rectified the way it is involved with things there is nothing left  and that's the end of the problem
From this point on there are no more problems to trouble the heart until the day of its total nibbana
This is how the Dhamma is studied to completion
The world  the world of elements and khandhas  is studied to completion right here
So keep striving in order to see the marvel described at the beginning which was described in line with the truth with no aspect to invite any doubt
The Buddha and the Noble Disciples have Dhamma filling their hearts to the brim
You are a disciple of the Tathagata with a mind that can be made to show its marvelousness through the practice of making it pure just like the Buddha and the Noble Disciples
So try to make it still and radiant because the heart has long lain buried in the mud
As soon as you can see the harm of the mud and grow tired of it you should urgently wake up take notice and exert yourself till you can manage to make your way free
Nibbana is holding its hand out waiting for you
Aren't you going to come out
Rebelliousness is simply distraction
The end of rebelliousness is stillness
When the heart is still it's at ease
If it's not still it's as hot as fire
Wherever you are everything is hot and troubled
Once it is still then it's cool and peaceful wherever you are  cool right here in the heart
So make the heart cool with the practice because the heat and trouble lie with the heart
The heat of fire is one thing but the heat of a troubled heart is hotter than fire
Try to put out the fires of defilement craving and mental effluents burning here in the heart so that only the phenomenon of genuine Dhamma remains
Then you will be cool and at peace everywhere and always
And so I'll ask to stop here
Our mind if we were to make a comparison with the world is a perpetual prisoner like a person born in jail who lives in jail behind bars with no chance to get out to see the outside world  someone who has grown from childhood to adulthood entirely in a prison cell and so doesn't know what there is outside someone who has seen pleasure and pain only in the prison and has never been out to see what kind of pleasure comfort and freedom they have in the outside world
We have no way of knowing what kind of happiness and enjoyment they have there in the outside world how they come and go how they live because we are kept in prison from the day we are born until the day we die
This is a comparison an analogy
We have only the pleasure and pain that the prison has to offer with nothing special nothing obtained from the outside world so that when it enters the prison we could see that 'This is something different from the prison world  this is from the outside world outside the prison' so that we could make comparisons and know that 'This is like this that is like that this is better than that that is better than this' There is nothing but the affairs of the prison
However much the pleasure and pain however great the deprivations the difficulties the oppression and coercion that's simply the way it's been all along from the very beginning  and so we don't know where to look for a way out or how to free ourselves
We don't even know where the outside world is because we have seen only the inside world the prison where we have always been locked away oppressed starved beaten tortured deprived
Even our bedding food belongings  everything of every sort  is like that of a prisoner in jail
And yet people like this can still live this way because they have never seen enough of the outside world to be able to make comparisons as to which is better which is more pleasant in order to feel inclined to search for a way out to the outside world
A mind controlled by the power of defilement and mental effluents is like this
It has been imprisoned by various kinds of defilement for aeons and aeons
For example in our present lifetime the defilements that hold sway over the hearts of living beings have been with us since the day of our birth
They have kept us in continual custody never giving us any freedom within ourselves at all
For this reason we have difficulty imagining what sort of pleasure there could be above and beyond the way things are just like a person who was born and has always lived in a prison
What sort of world is the world outside
Is it a good place to visit
A good place to live
The Dhamma proclaims it loud and clear but hardly anyone is interested
Still there are fortunately some places where some people are interested
In places where no one proclaims it where no one speaks of what the outside world  a mind with Dhamma in charge  is like no one knows what the teachings of the religion are like
No one knows what the happiness that comes from the Dhamma is like
Such people are so surrounded by darkness so completely drowned in attachment that not even a single limb shows above the surface because there is no religion to pull them out
It's as if the outside world didn't exist
They have nothing but the prison the defilements holding the heart in custody
Born in this world they have only the prison as their place to live and to die
A mind that has never known what could give it greater pleasure comfort and freedom than it has at present if we were to make a different comparison is like a duck playing in a mud puddle under a shanty
It keeps playing there splat splat splat splat splat
No matter how dirty or filthy it is it's content to play because it has never seen the water of the ocean of a river of a lake or a pond large enough for it to swim and immerse its entire body with ease
It has known only the mud puddle that lies stagnant under the shanty into which things in the shanty get washed down
And so it plays there thinking it's fun swimming happily in its way  why
Because it has never seen water wider or deeper than that enough to give it more enjoyment in coming and going or swimming around than it can find in the mud puddle under the shanty
As for ducks that live along broad deep canals they're very different from the duck under the shanty
They really enjoy themselves along rivers lakes canals and ponds
Wherever their owner herds them there they go  crossing back and forth over highways and byways spreading in flocks of hundreds and thousands
Even ducks like these have their happiness
What do they stand for
They stand for the mind
A mind that has never seen the pleasure the comfort the enjoyment that comes from the Dhamma is like the duck playing in the mud puddle under the shanty or those that enjoy swimming in canals rivers or lakes
We at present have our pleasure and happiness through the controlling power of the defilements which is like the happiness of prisoners in jail
When the mind receives training from the outside world  meaning the Dhamma that comes from the transcendent Dhammas from the 'land' of nibbana on down level by level to the human world revealing every level every realm  we find that those of us who are inclined who are interested in the outside world in happiness greater than that which exists at present still exist
When we hear the Dhamma step by step or read books about the outside world  about Dhamma about releasing ourselves from the pain and suffering we are forced to undergo within our hearts  our minds feel pleasure and enjoyment
Interest
A desire to listen
A desire to practice so as to reap the results step by step
This is where we begin to see the influence of the outside world making itself felt
The heart begins to exert itself trying to free itself from the tyranny and oppression from within like that of a prisoner in jail
Even more so when we practice in the area of the mind The more peace we obtain then the greater the effort the greater the exertion we make
Mindfulness and discernment gradually appear
We see the harm of the tyranny and the oppression imposed by the defilements in the heart
We see the value of the Dhamma which is a means of liberation
The more it frees us the more ease we feel in the heart
Respite
Relief
This then is a means of increasing our conviction in ascending stages and of increasing our effort and stamina in its wake
The mindfulness and discernment that used to lie buried in the mud gradually revive and awaken and begin to contemplate and investigate
In the past no matter what assaulted us by way of the eye ear nose tongue body or mind we were like dead people
We held these things to be ordinary and normal
They never provoked our mindfulness and discernment to investigate and explore searching for beginnings and ends causes and effects
Even though these things had been our enemies for a long long time making their assaults both day and night we were never interested
Now however we develop an interest
When the heart begins to enter the current of the Dhamma in which it has been trained to the point of developing a basis for mindfulness and discernment step by step it is bound to see clearly both what is beneficial and what is harmful because these things dwell together  benefits and harm  within this heart
The mind develops agility in contemplating and investigating
The heart develops boldness in its explorations
Seeing harm it tries to remedy it
Seeing benefits it tries to open the way for them it tries to foster them in ascending stages
This is called the mind gradually gaining release from tyranny and oppression  the prison  within
At the same time it is gaining a view of the outside world seeing what sort of world it is seeing whether it's like the prison that exists at present
Our eyes can see the outside world to some extent can see how those in the outside world live how they come and go  and what about us in the prison
What is it like to live overcome by defilements
How does the mind feel as we gain gradual relief from the defilements
We can begin to make comparisons
Now at last we have an outside world and an inside world to compare
The happiness and ease that come from removing however many of the defilements we can remove appear
The stress that continues as long as the remaining defilements still exert their influence we know clearly
We see their harm with our discernment on its various levels and we try continually to remedy the situation without letting our persistence lapse
This is when mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence stir themselves out to the front lines when we see both the outside world  however much we have been able to liberate the heart from defilement  and the inside world where the defilements keep up their oppression and coercion
Before we never knew what to use for comparisons because we had never seen anything other than this
Because we were born buried in pain and suffering this way no pleasure from the outside world  from the Dhamma  ever appeared to us
What did appear was the kind of happiness that had suffering behind the scenes waiting to stomp in and obliterate that happiness without giving a moment's notice
Now however we are beginning to know and see
We see the happiness of the outside that is of the outside world of those who have Dhamma reigning in their hearts and we see the happiness inside the prison the happiness that lies under the influence of defilement
We also see the suffering and stress that lie under the influence of defilement
We know this all clearly with our own mindfulness and discernment
The happiness that comes from the outside world  in other words from the current of the Dhamma seeping deep into the heart  we begin to see step by step enough to make comparisons
We see the outside world the inside world their benefits and drawbacks
When we take them and compare them we gain an ever greater understanding  plus greater persistence greater stamina  to the point that when anything connected with defilement that used to tyrannize and oppress the mind passes our way we immediately feel called upon to tackle it remedy it strip it away and demolish it step by step through the power of mindfulness and discernment backed by persistent effort
The mind will set itself spinning
When its awareness of harm is great its appreciation of what is beneficial is also great
When the desire to know and see the Dhamma is great when the desire to gain release is great persistence will have to become greater in their wake
Stamina and resilience will also come in their wake because they all exist in the same heart
When we see harm the entire heart is what sees it
When we see benefits the entire heart is what sees
When we try to make our way with various methods in line with our abilities it's an affair of the entire heart making the effort to free itself
This is why these things such as persistence that are the mind's tools the mind's support come together
For example saddha conviction in the paths and their fruitions conviction in the realm beyond suffering and stress viriya persistence perseverance in gaining release for oneself step by step khanti stamina endurance in order to be unyielding in passing over and beyond All of these things come together
Mindfulness and discernment contemplating along the way seeing what is right and what is wrong will come in their wake
If we were to speak in terms of the principles of the formal Dhamma as expressed by the Buddha this is called the path converging gradually gathering itself into this single heart
Everything comes together Right View Right Resolve Right Speech Right Action all the way to Right Concentration all come gathering into this single heart
They don't go anywhere else
Right Action Our only right undertakings are sitting and walking meditation because we have reached the stage of precision work where the heart gathers together
The mind is in a state of the path converging  gathering itself into a single heart
Right View Right Resolve These refer to the concerns of discernment always exploring the affairs of the elements the khandhas whatever appears or makes contact arises and vanishes whether good or evil past or future appearing in the heart
Mindfulness and discernment slash these things to bits step by step without bothering to waste time
Right Action On the level of the body this refers to doing sitting and walking meditation making the effort to abandon the defilements no matter what our posture
On the level of the heart this refers to persistence within the mind
Right Speech We speak only of the Dhamma
Our conversation deals only with the topics of effacement topics of polishing away or washing away defilements and mental effluents from the heart telling what methods we can use that will utterly end the defilements This is Right Speech
Right Livelihood When the heart feeds on any object that's its enemy this is called maintaining a wrong livelihood
Since the object is an enemy of the heart the heart will have to be clouded
There's nothing good about it at all
It has to lead to greater or lesser amounts of suffering and stress within the heart in proportion to the heart's crudeness or refinement
This is called poison
Wrong livelihood
We have to correct it immediately
Immediately
Any mental object that's rightful that leads to happiness wellbeing and ease is a fitting preoccupation a fitting food for the heart providing it with peace and wellbeing
This is how Right Livelihood is maintained with Dhamma on the ascending levels of training the heart
As for Right Livelihood on the physical level dealing with food or alms that applies universally for Buddhists in general to conduct themselves in line with their personal duties
Right Effort What sort of effort
This we know
The Buddha taught four kinds of effort Try to be careful not to let evil arise within yourself
Try to abandon evil that has already arisen
In being careful not to let evil arise we have to be careful by being mindful
Using mindfulness in trying not to let evil arise means being alert to the mind that thinks and wanders about gathering suffering and stress into itself
This is because thoughtformations of the wrong sort are the origin of stress and so we should be careful to guard against them
Don't be careless or complacent
Try to develop what is skillful  intelligence  so as to increase it step by step
Try to safeguard the skillful things that have arisen so as to develop them even further and not let them deteriorate
All of these right exertions apply right within us
Right Mindfulness keeps watch over the heart
Mindfulness and selfawareness keep constant track of its behavior and activities
Whatever makes contact by way of the eye ear nose tongue or body if it doesn't go into the heart where does it go
The heart is an enormous place always ready to be informed of various things both good and evil
Discernment is what contemplates and deliberates
Mindfulness is what keeps vigilant inspecting whatever comes in to engage the heart
Whatever the preoccupation good or evil mindfulness and discernment contemplate and are selective of what engages the heart
Whatever they see as improper the mind will reject immediately
Immediately
Discernment is what makes the rejection
Right Concentration Our work for the sake of making the defilements quiet through concentration is steady and constant to the point where the results appear as peace and calm in the heart as a true place of rest without any distractions coming in to disturb the heart at that moment
When entering concentration so as to relax the mind in order to give strength to discernment in its continuing explorations you should go ahead and really rest  rest in concentration
Enter the calm
Completely stop all thoughts and explorations in the area of discernment
Let the mind settle in and relax
It doesn't have to think or contrive anything at all related to its work
Let the mind rest comfortably by giving it a single preoccupation
If the mind happens to be extremely engrossed in its investigations so that you can't rein it in use 'buddho' as a means to drag it in
Make the mind stay with 'buddho buddho buddho' Even though the meditation word 'buddho' may be a mental contrivance it's a contrivance in a single focal idea
Contriving a single focal idea can cause the mind to settle down
For example if while we are repeating 'buddho buddho buddho' the mind flashes back to its work because it is engrossed in its unfinished business we should repeat the meditation word even faster so as not to let the mind go back to its work
In other words when the mind is at the stage where it is engrossed in its work we could say  to put it in worldly terms  that we can't let down our guard although on this level it's hard to say that the mind lets down its guard
To get nearer the truth we should say that we can't loosen our grip
To put it simply we can't loosen our grip
Otherwise the mind will jump back out to work
So at this point we have to be firm with our meditation word
Force the mind to stay with its single preoccupation  'buddho'  as a means of reining the mind in
Repeat 'buddho buddho buddho' in really close frequency then 'buddho' and the mind will become one
The heart will be firm and calm down calm down relaxing relaxing setting aside all its work
The mind will become cool and peaceful
This is Right Concentration
When the time comes to rest you have to rest like this for it to qualify as Right Concentration
When you've had enough when you see that the mind has regained strength then simply let go  that's all  and the mind will spring immediately back to work
It springs out of oneness of having a single preoccupation and returns to being two with its work
At this point the heart gets back to work without worrying about concentration while it is working
In the same way when centering the mind for the sake of stillness you don't have to worry about your work at all
When resting you have to rest in the same way that when eating you don't have to do any work at all except for the work of eating
When sleeping sleep peacefully
You shouldn't be concerned with any work at all
But once you have begun work you shouldn't concern yourself with eating and sleeping
Really set your mind on your work
This is called doing a solid piece of work work in its proper phases work at the proper time in keeping with events 'Right Action' work that doesn't overstep its boundaries appropriate work
The practice of centering the mind is something you can't neglect
In practicing for the sake of the heart's happiness the view that centering the mind keeping still serves no purpose is wrong
If someone is addicted to concentration unwilling to come out and work that's improper and should be criticized so that he or she will get down to work
But once the mind has become engrossed in its work concentration is a necessity in certain areas at certain times
Ordinarily if we work without resting or sleeping we ultimately can't continue with our work
Even though some of our money gets used up when we eat let it be used up  because the result is that our body gains strength from eating and can return to its work in line with its duties
Even though money gets used up and the food we eat gets used up still it's used up for a purpose for energy in the body
Whatever gets consumed let it be consumed because it doesn't hurt our purposes
If we don't eat where are we going to get any strength
Whatever gets spent let it be spent for the sake of strength for the sake of giving rise to strength
The same holds true with resting in concentration When we're resting so as to give rise to stillness the stillness is the strength of mind that can reinforce discernment and make it agile
We have to rest so as to have stillness
If there is no stillness if there's nothing but discernment running it's like a knife that hasn't been sharpened
We keep chopping away  chock chock chock  but it's hard to tell whether we're using the edge of the blade or the back
We simply have the desire to know to see to understand to uproot defilement whereas discernment hasn't been sharpened by resting in stillness  the reinforcement that gives peace and strength in the heart  and so it's like a knife that hasn't been sharpened
Whatever gets chopped doesn't cut through easily
It's a simple waste of energy
So for the sake of what's fitting while resting the mind in its 'home of concentration' we have to let it rest
Resting is thus like using a whetstone to sharpen discernment
Resting the body strengthens the body and in the same way resting the mind strengthens the mind
When it comes out this time now that it has strength it's like a knife that has been sharpened
The object is the same old object the discernment is the same old discernment the person investigating is the same old person but once we focus our examination it cuts right through
This time it's like a person who has rested slept and eaten at his leisure and whose knife is fully sharpened
He chops the same old piece of wood he's the same old person and it's the same old knife but it cuts right through with no trouble at all  because the knife is sharp and the person has strength
In the same way the object is the same old object the discernment is the same old discernment the person practicing is the same old person but we've been sharpened
The mind has strength as a reinforcement for discernment and so things cut right through in no time at all  a big difference from when we hadn't rested in concentration
Thus concentration and discernment are interrelated
They simply do their work at different times
When the time comes to center the mind center it
When the time comes to investigate in the area of discernment give it your all  your full alertness your full strength
Get to the full Dhamma the full causes and the full effects
In the same way when resting give it a full rest
Practice these things at separate times
Don't let them interfere with each other  being worried about concentration when examining with discernment or being preoccupied with the affairs of discernment when entering concentration  for that would be wrong
Whichever work you're going to do really make it a solid piece of work
This is the right way the appropriate way  the way Right Concentration really is
Once discernment has begun uprooting defilements step by step the heart develops brightness
The lightness of the mind is one of the benefits that come from removing the things that are hazardous the things that are filthy
We see the value of this benefit and keep on investigating
What defilement is is a weight on the heart
Our mind is like a prisoner constantly overpowered  coerced and tormented  by defilements and mental effluents ever since we were born
When we come right down to it where is defilement
Where is being and birth
Right here in this same heart
When you investigate these things gather in gather in and enter this single heart
The cycle of rebirth doesn't refer to anything else It refers to this single heart that spins in circles
It's the only thing that leads us to birth and death
Why
Because the seeds of these things are in the heart
When we use mindfulness and discernment to investigate we explore so as to see clearly and we keep cutting in step by step until we reach the mind that is the culprit harboring unawareness which is the important seed of the cycle in the heart
We keep dissecting keep investigating in investigating in so that there is nothing left of 'this is this' or 'that is that' We focus our investigation on the mind in the same way as we have done with phenomena in general
No matter how much brightness there may be in the heart we should know that it's simply a place for the heart to rest temporarily as long as we are still unable to investigate it to the point where we can disperse and destroy it
But don't forget that this shining star of a heart is actually unawareness
So investigate taking that as the focal point of your investigation
So then
If this is going to be obliterated until there's no more awareness leaving nothing at all  to the point where the 'knower' is destroyed along with it  then let's find out once and for all
We're investigating to find the truth to know the truth so we have to get all the way down to causes and effects to the truth of everything of every sort
Whatever is going to be destroyed let it be destroyed
Even if ultimately the 'knower' who is investigating will be destroyed as well then let's find out with our mindfulness and discernment
We don't have to leave anything remaining as an island or a vantage point to deceive ourselves
Whatever is 'us' whatever is 'ours' don't leave it standing
Investigate down to the truth of all things together
What's left after the defilement of unawareness is absolutely destroyed is something beyond the range to which convention can reach or destroy
This is called the pure mind or purity
The nature of this purity cannot be destroyed by anything at all
Defilements are conventional realities that can arise and vanish
Thus they can be cleansed made to increase made to decrease made to disappear because they are an affair of conventions
But the mind pure and simple  the phenomenon called a released mind  lies beyond the range to which any defilements which are all conventions can reach and destroy
If the mind isn't yet pure it's a conventional reality just like other things because conventional things have infiltrated it
Once they are entirely removed the phenomenon of release is one that no defilement can any longer affect  because it lies beyond range
So what is destroyed
Stress stops because the cause of stress stops
Nirodha  the cessation of stress  also stops
The path the tool that wipes out the cause of stress also stops
The four Noble Truths all stop together
Stress stops the cause of stress stops the path stops the cessation of stress stops
But listen
What knows that 'that stops' is not a Noble Truth
It lies above the Noble Truths
The investigation of the Noble Truths is an investigation for the sake of this
Once we reach the real thing the four Noble Truths have no more role to play no need to be cleansed remedied or removed
For example discernment Now that we've worked to the full extent we can let go of discernment with no need to set rules for it
Both mindfulness and discernment are tools in the battle
Once the war is over the enemy is wiped out so these qualities are no longer at issue
What's left
Purity
The Buddha in proclaiming the Dhamma to the world took it from this pure nature
The doctrines of the religion came from this nature and in the approach he used in teaching he had to teach about stress because these conditions are directly related to this mind
He taught us to know how to remedy how to stop how to strive  everything of every sort  all the way to the goal at the end of the path after which nothing more need be said
This is purity
The mind has come out to the outside world
It has left the prison and come to the outside world  freedom  never to be imprisoned again
But no one wants to go to this world because they have never seen it
This is an important world  lokuttara the transcendent a realm higher than other worlds  but we simply call it the outside world outside of all conventions
We call it a 'world' just as a figure of speech because our world has its conventions and so we simply talk about it that way
Think about escaping from this prison
You've been born in prison live in prison and die in prison
You've never once died outside of prison
So for once get your heart out of prison
You'll be really comfortable  really comfortable
 like the Buddha and his Noble Disciples They were born in prison like you but they died outside of the prison
They died outside of the world
They didn't die in this world that's so narrow and confining
I'll ask to stop here
People come with questions  some of which I can remember  and everyone has the question that's waiting right at the barn door Is there a next world after death
The next world who goes on to the next world These sorts of things aren't any one person's issue
They're an issue for all of us who are carrying a burden
When people ask this sort of question I ask them in return 'Was there a yesterday
Was there a this morning
Is there a present at this moment' They admit that there was and is
'Then will there be a tomorrow
A day after tomorrow
A this month
A next month
A this year
A next year and years after that'
Things in the past that we can remember we can use to make guesses about the future
Even for things that haven't yet happened we can make comparisons with things that have already occurred
The future has to follow the way things have been in the past
For example yesterday has already occurred today is occurring
These things have followed one after the other
We know this we remember we haven't forgotten
This afternoon this evening tonight tomorrow morning We've already seen that things have been like this
This is the way things have happened without being otherwise and so we accept that this is the way they will continue to be
Doubts about this world and the next or about things concerning ourselves This is delusion about ourselves
This is why these things become big issues causing endless fuss all over the world of rebirth
'Is there a next world
When people die are they reborn' These questions go together for who is it that takes birth and dies
We ourselves  always dying and taking birth
What comes to this world and goes to the next world is us
Who else would it be
If not for this being of the world this wanderer there wouldn't be anyone weighed down with these questions and burdens
This is the harm of delusion of being unable to remember
It shows within us but we can't catch hold of its causes of why it has come about
Things that have happened we can't remember
Our own affairs spin us around in circles and get us so tangled up that we don't know which way to go
This is why selfdelusion is an endless complication
Being deluded about other things is not so bad but being deluded about ourselves blocks all the exits
We can't find any way out
The results come right back at us  they don't go anywhere else  bringing us suffering because these sorts of doubts are questions with which we bind ourselves not questions by which we set ourselves free
We can have no hope of resolving and understanding these doubts if we don't find confirmation of the Dhamma in the area of meditation
This is why the Lord Buddha taught us to unravel and look at our own affairs
But unraveling our own affairs is something very critical
If we do it by guessing or speculating or whatever we won't succeed
The only way to succeed is to develop goodness step by step as a means of support and of drawing us in to mental development or meditation so as to unravel and look at our own affairs which lie gathered in the range of meditation
This is what will lead us to know clearly and to cut through our doubts at the same time leading us to satisfactory results
We will be able to stop wondering about death and rebirth or death and annihilation
What are our own affairs
The affairs of the heart
The heart is what acts creating causes and results for itself all the time pleasure pain complications and turmoil
For the most part it ties itself down more than helping itself
If we don't force it into good ways the hearts reaps trouble as a result the suffering that comes from being agitated and anxious thinking restlessly from various angles for no worthwhile reason
The results we receive are an important factor in making us pained and unsettled
This is thus a difficult matter a heavy matter for all those who are deluded about the world deluded about themselves agitated by the world and agitated about themselves without being interested in confirming the truth about themselves using the principles of the Dhamma principles that guarantee the truth
For example once we die we must be reborn as long as the seeds of rebirth are in the heart we have to continue being reborn repeatedly
It can't be otherwise  for instance being annihilated at death
The Buddha teaches us to keep watch of the instigator
In other words we should observe our own heart which is what causes birth and death
If we don't understand it he tells us various angles from which to approach until we understand and can deal with it properly
In particular he teaches us to meditate using any of the meditation themes repeating it so that the mind  which has no footing to hold to which is in such a turmoil of finding no refuge that it dwells in unlimited dreams and infatuations  will gain enough of a footing to get on its feet will gain quiet and calm free from the distraction and unsteadiness that would destroy the peace of mind we want
For example he teaches us to repeat 'buddho dhammo sangho' or 'atthi' 'kesa' 'loma' or whatever phrase suits our temperament being mindful to keep watch over our meditation theme so as not to become forgetful and send the mind elsewhere away from it
This is so that the mind which we used to send in various places can latch onto or dwell with its Dhammatheme its meditation word
Our awareness which used to be scattered among various preoccupations will now gather into that point  the mind  which is the gathering place of awareness
All the currents of our awareness will converge at the Dhammatheme we are repeating or pursuing with interest
This is because the meditation word  which is something for the mind to hold to so that it can gain a footing  becomes more and more an object of clear and conspicuous awareness
Thus at the beginning stages of meditation the meditation word is very important
Once we have seen the intrinsic value of the peace that appears this way we at the same time see clearly the harm that comes from the agitation and turmoil of the mind that has no footing to hold to and that creates havoc for itself
We needn't ask anyone The benefits of a peaceful mind and the harm of an agitated mind we see within our own mind from having practiced meditation
This is a step the first step by which the Buddha teaches us to know the affairs of the mind
We then try to make the mind progressively more firmly settled and calm by repeating the meditation word as already mentioned
We keep at it again and again until we become adept until the mind can become still the way we want it to
The sense of wellbeing that arises from a calm heart becomes even more prominent and clear all the time
As soon as the mind becomes still giving rise to clear and prominent awareness it is at the same time a gathering in of the defilements into a single spot so that we can see them more clearly and more easily observe their behavior  so that we can more easily cure them and remove them with the levels of discernment suited to dealing with crude intermediate and subtle defilements step by step
Now concerning defilements the things that force the mind to be agitated in countless inconceivable ways We can't catch sight of what defilement is what the mind is what the Dhamma is until we first have a firm basis of mental stillness
When the mind gathers in and is still the defilements gather in and are still as well
When the mind draws into itself to be itself or to become a point on which we can focus and understand the affairs of defilement also enter a restricted range in that same point
They gather in at the heart and rarely ever run loose to stir up trouble for the heart as they used to before the mind was still
Once the mind is still so that it can stand on its feet we are then taught to use our discernment to investigate unravel and contemplate the various parts of the body in which the defilements hide out
What is the mind interested in
When it isn't quiet with what does it like to involve itself
While the mind is quiet it doesn't stir up trouble for itself but a common habit with us human beings is that once we have gained peace and relaxation we get lazy
We simply want to lie down and rest
We don't want to unravel the body the elements or the khandhas with our mindfulness and discernment for the sake of seeing the truth and removing the various defilements from the heart
We don't like to reflect on the fact that those who have abandoned and removed the various kinds of defilement that hide out in the body and the khandhas have done so by using mindfulness and discernment
As for mental stillness or concentration that's simply a gathering together of the defilements into a restricted range
It's not an abandoning or a removal of defilement
Please remember this and take it to heart
The heart when it isn't still tends to get entangled with sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations and to take them as issues for stirring itself up
We can know with our mindfulness and discernment which of the various sights sounds etc the mind tends to favor most strongly
While we are investigating we can know with our mindfulness and discernment the objects with which the mind is involving itself
We can observe the affairs of the mind because the mind has been still
As soon as it begins to head out toward its various preoccupations we know
This is why we are taught to investigate and unravel things with our discernment so as to know what the mind goes to involve itself with
Try to observe so as to know so as to see clearly with mindfulness and discernment while you are investigating
Only when you are stilling the mind in concentration is there no need for you to investigate because concentration and discernment take turns working at different times as I have already explained
When you are investigating visual objects with which visual object is the mind most involved
What is the reason
Look at the object
Dissect it
Analyze it into its parts so as to see it clearly for what it truly is
Once you have dissected the object  whatever it is  so as to see it with discernment in line with its truth at the same time you will see the absurdity the deceptiveness of the mind that grows attached and misconstrues things in all kinds of ways without any real reason without any basis in fact
Once you have investigated carefully you'll see that the object has none of the worth construed and assigned to it by the mind
There are simply the assumptions of the mind that has fallen for the object that's all
Once you have investigated separating the various parts of 'their' body or 'your' body so as to see them in detail you won't see anything of any worth or substance at all
The heart of its own accord will see the harmfulness of its assumptions its labels and attachments
The more it investigates the more clearly it sees  not only the various sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations but also the acts of the mind involved with those objects  until it fully knows and clearly sees with discernment because it has been constantly unraveling things both within and without
You fully know and clearly see the acts inside the heart that become involved knowing that they come about for this reason and that all of which are thoroughly absurd
Before you didn't know why the mind was involved
But now you know clearly that it is involved for this reason and that namely delusion and mistaken assumptions
When you investigate in line with the truth and see the true nature of external things you know clearly within yourself that the mind has construed phenomena to be like this and like that which is why it has continually developed more and more attachment and clinging more and more of the defilements of love and hatred
The heart then realizes its own absurdity
When the heart realizes that it has been deluded and absurd it withdraws inward because if it were to continue to think of becoming attached to those things it would get cut right through by discernment  so what would it gain from becoming attached
To investigate so as to know clearly that this is this and that is that in line with the truth of every individual thing of every sort This is the way to unravel the great mass of problems that taken together are results  the mass of suffering inside the heart
This is how we are taught to unravel it
As discernment constantly keeps unraveling things without letup until it understands clearly and distinctly we don't have to tell it to let go
Once the mind knows it lets go of its own accord
It is bound to let go of its own accord
The mind attached is the mind that doesn't yet know doesn't yet understand with discernment
Once the full heart knows it fully lets go with no concern or regrets
All the concerns that used to bother and disturb the mind vanish of their own accord because discernment sees right through them
Once it sees everything clearly and distinctly what is there left to grope for
The problems of the heart that used to be broad and wideranging now become more and more restricted
Problems concerning outside affairs become less and less as I have said in previous talks
The next step is to unravel the mind the gathering point of subtle defilements so as to see what it is looking for when it 'blips' out
Where does it 'blip' from
What is there that pressures the mind into forming thoughts of various issues
When mindfulness and discernment can keep up with the thoughts that come 'blipping' out these thoughts vanish immediately without amounting to anything without forming issues to entangle us as they did before
This is because mindfulness and discernment are wise to them and always ready to herd them in and wipe them out as they keep following in on the tracks of the origin of defilement to see exactly where it is
Where do its children and grandchildren  the defilements  come from
Animals have their parents what are the parents of these defilements
Where are they
Why do they keep forming again and again thinking again and again
Why do they give rise to assumptions and interpretations increasing suffering and stress without stop
Actually thoughtformations are formed at the mind
They don't come from anywhere else
So investigate following them in step by step without losing the trail that will lead you to the truth to the culprit
This is genuine exploring observing the affairs of all the defilements using the power of genuine mindfulness and discernment
Ultimately we will know what the mind is lacking what it is still connected with what it is interested in what it wants to know and to see
So we follow the connections follow the seeds on in
Day by day the defilements become more and more restricted more and more restricted
This is because the bridges that connect them to sights sound smells tastes tactile sensations and the various things of the world in general have been cut away from the mind by using continual mindfulness and discernment to the point where we have no more doubts
It's as if the outside world didn't exist
There remain only the preoccupations that form  blip blip blip  in the mind
This is where the rebellious monarch lies
The one who concocts and creates the one who struggles and writhes restlessly in big and little ways lies right here
Before we didn't know in what ways the mind was writhing
All we knew were the results that appeared unsatisfactory every time giving us nothing but suffering and stress which no one in the world wants
Our own heart was so burdened with stress that it couldn't find a way out because it had no inkling of how to remedy things
But now that we know these things gradually disappear so that we know and see more and more clearly at the mind which is where unawareness is performing as an actor as an issuemaker here inside us
It can't find anything to latch onto outside so it simply acts inside
Why doesn't it latch on
Because mindfulness and discernment understand and have it surrounded
So how could it latch onto anything
All it does is go 'blip blip blip' in the mind
We now see it more clearly and focus our investigation on it scratch away at it dig away at it with mindfulness and discernment until we have it surrounded every time the mind makes a move
There are no longer any lapses in alertness as there were in the first stages when mindfulness and discernment were still stumbling and crawling along
Our persistence at this level is no longer a matter of every activity
It becomes a matter of every mental moment in which the mind ripples
Mindfulness and discernment have to know both when the rippling comes out and when it vanishes  and so there are no issues that can arise in the moment the mind is fashioning a thought an assumption or an interpretation
This is because our rocketfast mindfulness and discernment can keep up with things
As soon as a rippling occurs we know
When we know it vanishes
No issues can arise or connect
They vanish the moment they appear
They can't branch out anywhere because the bridges to outside matters have been cut by mindfulness and discernment
When mindfulness and discernment are exploring earnestly relentlessly unflaggingly they want to know to see and to destroy whatever is hazardous
'What causes us to take birth as individuals and beings
What leads us to wander in the round of rebirth
What are the causes what are the conditions that connect things
Where are they right now' This is called scratching away with mindfulness and discernment digging away at the mind of unawareness
There is no way we can escape knowing seeing and severing the important cause and condition that creates suffering and stress for the beings of the world namely the defilement of unawareness that has infiltrated the mind in an insidious way
See
This is the power of mindfulness discernment conviction and persistence on this level something that meditators never imagine will be possible to this extent
This is where defilements begin to reveal themselves because they have no place to hide
They no longer have the sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations in which they used to hole up because the bridges have been cut
Their only hideout is in the mind The mind is the hideout of unawareness
When we go ransacking through the mind until everything is smashed completely to smithereens with nothing left  in the same way that we used discernment to investigate phenomena in general  then when the mind of unawareness is ransacked in this way ultimately the supreme defilement  unawareness the emperor of the round of rebirth  is completely obliterated from the mind
At this point how can we help but know what it is that causes birth on this or that level
As for where we will or won't be reborn that's not important
What's important is seeing clearly that this is what has caused birth and death
This is how we prove whether death is followed by rebirth or annihilation
We have to prove it at the mind by practicing in line with the principles of mental development in the same way the Buddha and his Noble Disciples practiced and knew so that it was clear to their hearts
There is no other way to know
Don't go groping guessing scratching at fleas
You'll end up all mangy and dirty without gaining anything at all
When we reach this point it's called eliminating birth  whose primary seeds lie within  completely from the mind
From this moment onward there is nothing that can ever again connect and branch out
Mindfulness and discernment on the level of Dhammarealization know this completely
This is the culprit who asks 'Is there a next world' This is the one who reserves a place in the next world the one who reserved our place in past worlds the one who has been born and has died over and over and over again unceasingly relentlessly to the point where it can't remember the births the deaths the pleasures the pains the sufferings large and small in its various lives
This is the one
So please remember its face and take it to heart
Probe it and slash it away to smithereens
Don't show it any mercy You'll simply be feeding and fattening it for it to come back and destroy you
When we gather the defilements they come into the one mind
They gather here and we destroy them right here
Once we have finished destroying them so that nothing is left the questions about birth death and the suffering and stress that result from birth and death no longer exist
We can know this clearly and fully for ourselves in a way that is immediately apparent
There is no more problem about whether or not there is a next world
Our past worlds we have already abandoned
As for the next world the bridges have all been sent flying
And as for the present we're wise to it
There are no conventions no matter now refined left in the mind
This is truly a mind with no more problems
This is where we solve the mind's problems
Once they are all solved here there will never be any problems again
No matter how wide the world no matter how many universes there are they are all a matter of conventional reality which has no limit
The heart that knows all around itself is no longer involved
The affairs that have been constantly assaulting us up to the present and that will do so on into the future are the affairs of this mind that has hazards buried within itself
That's all there is
When these hazards have been entirely removed there is nothing left to be dangerous or poisonous ever again
The question of whether or not there is a next world no longer holds any interest because the realization has gone straight to the heart that it is done with the question of connecting up with any other world again
So in studying and solving our own problem we tackle it right here
This way there's hope that we can put an end to it  at the same time not causing any harm to ourselves or to others at all
The Lord Buddha solved the problem right here
His arahant disciples solved it right here  knew it right here severed it completely right here
The proclamation that the Teacher was completely free of suffering and stress that he was the foremost teacher of the world came from this knowledge and this freedom from issues
Our study of the world is completed right here at the mind
Our study of the Dhamma reaches full completion right here
The 'world' means the world of living beings
'Living beings' means those who are caught up caught up right at the mind
This is where we cut through the problem
This is where we study and know
The arahant disciples studied and knew right here with their full hearts  and that was the end of the problem
They solved the problem and it fell away with nothing remaining
But as for us we take on the whole thing the entire heap of suffering and stress
We take on all problems but we aren't willing to solve them
We simply hoard them to weigh ourselves down all the time
Our heart is thus filled with a heap of stress that nothing else can equal because nothing else is as heavy as a heart heaped with stress
Carrying this heap of stress and problems is heavy on the heart because we haven't completed our studies
We carry nothing but this heap because of our delusion
When vijja  true knowledge  has appeared and eradicated all the hazards from the heart this is what it means to 'graduate' in line with natural principles with none of the conferring of degrees or titles that would cause us to become even more deluded
To complete our study of the Dhamma in the heart means that we have erased it completely of all delusion with no traces remaining
At that moment the three levels of existence  the levels of sensuality form and formlessness  become no more problem because they all lie in the heart
The level of sensuality is a mind composed of sensuality
The levels of form and formlessness are the conventions of the various things in those levels buried in the heart
When the heart removes them that's the end of the problem
When we solve the problem this is where we solve it
This world and the next world lie right here because that which steps into any world lies right here
This mind is what steps out to receive stress in greater or lesser measure
The motor the propeller lies here in the heart and nowhere else
The Lord Buddha thus taught at the right point the most appropriate point the heart which is the primary culprit
The things I have mentioned here with whom do they lie if not with each of us
And if we don't solve them right here where will we solve them
Living beings have to go to their various worlds through the power of the good and bad kamma within the heart
That which goes to the worlds  to the bonfires  is this very heart
If we don't solve the problem right here there is no way of escaping the bonfires of stress and anxiety
If we solve the problem right here there is no problem as to where the fires are because we can keep ourselves protected
That's all there is to it
All of these things are very heavy worlds for living beings in general
Whatever problems arise they arise right here
'Is death followed by rebirth
By annihilation
Is there a next world
Does hell exist
Does heaven
Does evil exist
Does merit' Everywhere I go there's the same question 'Do heaven and hell exist' I never feel like answering
I don't see any reason to answer it because that which is burdened with heaven and hell is the heart which everyone already has
So why waste time answering
After all I'm not a recordkeeper for heaven and hell
Straighten things out right here at the cause that will go to heaven and hell
Straighten out the bad causes and foster the good
There will then be no stress if we straighten things out right on target
And how can we miss
The welltaught Dhamma teaches us to solve things right on target not offtarget
The Dhamma that leads by means of the welltaught Dhamma leads out those who are caught up in stress and anxiety through the power of delusion
Where will we solve things if we don't solve them at the heart
The big problems lie solely at the heart at this awareness
Crudeness is a matter of this awareness
Refinement is a matter of this awareness
That which makes people crude or refined is this awareness with defilement as the reinforcement
If the mind becomes refined it's because goodness is the reinforcement making it refined until it goes beyond the final point of refinement beyond the final point of conventions and ends up gaining release from all stress with no seeds for any further connections
Another question that people are always asking is how to overcome laziness
If we were to tell them to use laziness to overcome laziness it would be tantamount to telling them to become an enemy of beds blankets and pillows by sleeping without ever waking up
It would be as if they were already dead because laziness makes you weak and listless like a person ready to die
How can you use laziness to cure laziness
Once you get a nice resting place as a means of lulling you to drown in sleep it's as if you were already dead  dead right there on the pillow
Even when you wake up you don't want to get up because laziness stomps all over you and destroys you forcing you not to get up
This is how it goes when you use laziness to cure laziness
If you use energy and persistence to cure laziness then you get right up ready to fight
If there's a fight you have hope of winning
But if you simply lie prostrate all you can do is lose  although whether we should call it losing or something else is hard to say because you don't even put up a fight at all so how can you say that you lose
If there's a fight and you can't win then you can say that this person wins and that person loses
But here there's no fight at all
You simply lie there groveling
If you don't call this being a servant in the house of defilements what would you call it
Because that's what it is being a servant in their house
If you use laziness  to the point of being its servant  to cure defilement you end up piling on even more defilements
Or what would you say
As things stand defilements already fill the heart so if you foster them even more where are you going to put them
You've got only one heart
The only way is to remove defilements so that you can begin to breathe and not let them sit on top of your nose so that you can never gasp a breath at all
Remove them so that you can begin to see yourself 'At last after all the time I've been meditating I've finally seen a piece of defilement's grandchild  laziness  fall off just like a chip of bark off a tree
Today at last I can begin to see myself
Up to now there's only been defilement making use of my nose and mouth
It's really infuriating'
Persistence
Diligence
Exertion in the way of reason that can accomplish our purposes This is the path that sages have followed
Even though it may be difficult we're up to the fight
It's like removing a thorn from your foot Even though it hurts to remove it you have to bear it
If you let it stay there your whole foot will become infected and putrid
You won't be able to walk at all and may even lose the foot
So there's only one reasonable course Pull it out
No matter how much it hurts you have to bear it because you have to get the thing out
This is a line of reasoning you have to accept
Once the thorn is out it holds no more poison
Put medicine on the wound and the foot will heal without flaring up as it would if the thorn were still embedded there
Defilement is just like a thorn
We let it lie buried forever in the heart
As long as it remains the heart is infected and putrid there in the midst of the round of rebirth  an endless monotony
Is this what you want
To be a putrid person
Ask yourself
Don't ask the defilements
They'll simply do you more harm
If you don't want this you have to fight them
Once you fight them you are sure somehow of finding a way to win
No matter how many times you lose there will have to come a time when you win
Once you've won then you can keep on winning winning and winning until there is nothing left for you to fight because the defilements are completely mauled
When you win whom do you defeat
You defeat laziness with diligence
You defeat defilement with energy and persistence
This way you gain release from all stress
This is how you solve the problem of birth and death right at the heart
There is only this spot that most needs solving
It's the most appropriate spot the most correct spot to solve
To solve things you solve them here
There is no way you can solve them anywhere else
Keep on making assumptions and interpretations for aeons and aeons and you'll simply continue to be burdened with the problem as it leads you to birth death suffering and stress
So you shouldn't be bold in speculating and guessing or you'll waste your time and die in vain because there is no way the problem will be solved with guesses and speculations
'Does suffering exist or not
Do merit and evil exist or not' Actually we are experiencing these things all of us with no possible exceptions
'Evil' is mental darkness and stress
'Merit' is wellbeing and ease
These things exist in the body and mind of every person so how can you deny them
'Merit' is a name for wellbeing
The Buddha calls it merit
Stress he calls evil
We are touched by good and evil all the time
Whether we live in this world or the next we can't help but meet with good and evil
Hell or nothell if there's pain filling the body and mind who wants it
Who wants to meet with it
This is something we all know so why ask about hell when it's already with us like this
Wherever pain is burning us it's as hot as being branded with fire
No matter where you're branded it all has to be hot in the same way
You can call it hell or nothell as you like but nobody wants it because pain is something we have all known for ourselves
And where  to trouble your heart  are you going to go looking for heaven
When you meet with the wellbeing that comes from practicing the Dhamma  and especially with wellbeing in the heart beginning with stillness and calm in ascending stages to the point where the mind develops a firm and solid footing within so that it is sure of itself and then further to the point where you gain release  then where are you going to ask about heaven and nibbana
There's no need to ask
You know them directly with your heart
You are the owner in charge of the heart that is clearly the instigator so where else are you going to look  for the names 'heaven' and 'hell'
What is there to grope for
You've got the real thing within you
That's all there is to the matter
The Dhamma of the Lord Buddha doesn't delude people into groping for this or that
So take hold of the real thing right here
Well then
That should be enough for now
In the basic principles of the doctrine we are taught that 'A delight in the Dhamma surpasses all other delights
The flavor of the Dhamma surpasses all other flavors' This statement was made by a person who had felt delight in the true Dhamma who had tasted the flavor of the true Dhamma namely our Lord Buddha
For this reason those who take an interest in listening to his teachings find that no matter what the statement each word each sentence goes straight to the heart  except of course for people who are simply going through the motions of listening without focusing the mind letting it drift engrossed in various things in line with its original inclinations without gaining anything of any worth
The teachings of the religion have no meaning in a mind of this sort until it turns to the Dhamma develops an interest of its own accord and puts the Dhamma into practice
Only then will the flavor of the Dhamma seep deep into the heart nurturing it and giving rise to conviction step by step
This is because the heart now has a continuing basis for the Dhamma that supports it in ascending stages
In particular when listening to Dhamma dealing with the practice if our mind doesn't have any experience with meditation has never taken an interest in the Dhamma has never taken an interest in practicing the Dhamma then not even a single statement will arrest the attention
When listening to a talk on the practice dealing with the stages of the mind the progress of the mind setting the mind aright in relationship to the defilements or to the path  mindfulness and discernment or persistent effort  we won't understand
When we don't understand we become frustrated and turn our attention elsewhere
Perhaps we may become drowsy and want to go to sleep or something of the sort
The talk seems long because it acts as a drag on our defilements preventing them from roaming around as they please
This is because we have to keep control over the mind while we listen to the talk and the mind when kept under control in this way feels hemmed in imprisoned within limits it finds oppressive
Annoyed and bored it doesn't want to listen except for the purpose of creating useless issues for entangling itself
But when we keep listening with interest meditating even while we listen the mind becomes focused and follows along with the stream of Dhamma being explained
The mind grows still because the awareness making contact with the Dhamma maintains that contact continuously step by step without break
The heart has no chance to slip away to any other preoccupations that are its enemies while listening and so it's able to settle down and be still
To be able to settle down in this way is to begin building a base or to scrub our vessel  the heart  making it clean and fit to receive the Dhamma
The heart will start growing more peaceful and calm seeing the value of listening to the Dhamma as explained by the Buddha 'Listening to the Dhamma has five rewards' The fifth reward is the important one 'The mind of the listener becomes radiant and calm' This one is very important but it must build on the earlier ones
'The listener hears things he or she has never heard'  this is the basis for the rest
Suppose that we have never listened to anything in the way of the practice or whatever
When we come to listen we gain an understanding of things we have never heard before
Things that we have heard before but never understood clearly we gradually come to understand more and more clearly
We can bring our views more correctly into line
And finally we reach the stage where 'the mind of the listener becomes radiant and calm' When results of this sort appear a delight in the Dhamma will develop of its own accord
The flavor of the Dhamma will begin to appear while we listen and while the mind is stilling itself to listen
Even though this flavor may not yet surpass all others it is nevertheless absorbing and arresting and will remain long in the memory not easily erased
This is why meditators place great importance on listening to the Dhamma
If you were to call it being attached to one's teacher I wouldn't disagree
Meditating monks always like to listen to their teachers
If they have a teacher they venerate and revere in the area of meditation in the area of the mind then wherever he lives they will keep coming to be with him until there is hardly enough room for them to stay
Venerable Acariya Mun is an example
Wherever he stayed students would come continually from near and far to search him out
Even though they couldn't all stay in the same place with him inasmuch as there wasn't enough room they would still be willing to stay in nearby areas two three four or seven to eight kilometers away so that they might conveniently come to hear his teachings on the uposatha days and 'Dhamma meeting' days
On the uposatha days after listening to the Patimokkha and to his instructions anyone who had any doubts or questions about the Dhamma could ask him to resolve them
For this reason the township where he stayed was filled with nothing but meditating monks and novices
When uposatha day came they would begin gathering together after the morning meal
At pm
they would hear the Patimokkha and after the Patimokkha Venerable Acariya Mun would give his talk  that's when he'd usually give his talk after the Patimokkha
This would be an important part of the practice for those who lived with him
During the Rains Retreat we would meet like this every seven days
Outside of the Rains Retreat the schedule wasn't too fixed but this is how he would usually schedule things for those of us who stayed directly with him
Each time we would listen to his talks we would gain in insight and understanding  without fail
This is why meditation monks are attached to their teachers
Each time we would listen to him he himself would be like a magnet drawing the interest of the monks and novices
In all things related to the Dhamma he would be the major attracting force inspiring fascination and delight in the Dhamma
There was a delight in seeing him and meeting him each time and even more so in hearing him speak  talking in general giving instructions conversing about ordinary things joking  because he himself was entirely Dhamma
Everything he would do or say in any way would keep revealing Dhamma and reasonability that could be taken as a lesson so that those who were interested could gain a lesson each time they heard him
This is why meditating monks find a great deal of enjoyment in the area of the Dhamma by living with a meditation master
They go to be with him of their own accord
When they are far from him and their minds aren't yet to the stage where they can look after themselves they are bound to feel lonesome
Or if they come across a problem they can't solve they are sure to miss him
If they can't work out a solution they have to run to him for advice so as to save a great deal of the time it would take to figure out a solution on their own  because he has been through everything of every sort
If we would take a problem to him then as soon as we had finished the last sentence he would immediately have the solution and we would understand right then and there
This is why when living with a master who has realized the truth there's no delay no waste of time in dealing with each problem as it arises
This is a great benefit for those who come to study with him
They're never disappointed
The fact that one who has seen the truth is giving the explanation makes all the difference
A moment ago I began by mentioning a delight in the Dhamma
What I have just been talking about is the same sort of thing finding pleasure in the Dhamma continual pleasure through listening to it constantly
In the same way when we practice the Dhamma constantly the results  the flavor and nourishment that come from the practice  increase continually becoming more and more solid and substantial in the heart
Especially in the practice of centering the mind The mind is calm tranquil contented and relaxed
Its thoughts don't go meddling with anything outside
It's as if the world didn't exist because our attention isn't involved with it
There's simply the Dhamma to be contemplated and practiced so as to give rise to more and more steadiness and strength
And on the level of discernment no matter how broad or narrow our investigation of the many phenomena in the world may be it is exclusively for the sake of the Dhamma for the sake of selfliberation
We thus become thoroughly engrossed day and night
The more strongly our heart is set on the Dhamma the greater its stamina and courage
It has no concern for life itself no worries about its living conditions or anything external
Its only support is the guiding compass of the Dhamma
Whether we are sitting lying down or whatever the heart is engrossed in its persistent efforts in practicing the Dhamma
On the level of concentration it is engrossed in its stillness of mind
On the level of discernment it is engrossed in its explorations of the Dhamma from various angles for the sake of removing defilement step by step as it investigates
Peace of heart is thus possible in each stage of persisting with the practice
The more quiet and secluded the place the more conspicuously this awareness stands out
Even knowledge in the area of concentration stands out in our inner awareness
It stands out for its stillness
In the area of discernment our knowledge stands out for the shrewdness and ingenuity of the mind as it explores without ceasing  except when resting in the stillness of concentration  just as water from an artesian well flows without ceasing during both the wet season and the dry
When phenomena make contact with the mind  or even when they don't  a mind already inclined to discernment is bound to investigate peering into every nook and cranny gaining understanding step by step
For example when we are first taught mindfulness immersed in the body it seems superficial  because the mind is superficial
It has no footing no mindfulness no discernment
It hasn't any principles  any Dhamma  to hold to
Whatever it hears doesn't really go straight to the heart because the mind is buried way down there deep under the belly of defilement
But once it develops principles and reasonability within itself then  especially when we're sitting in meditation in a quiet place investigating the body  the whole body seems clear all the way through
That's how it really feels to a person meditating on this level
It's really enthralling
Whether we're contemplating the skin or the body's unattractiveness it appears extremely clear because that's the way its nature already is  simply that our mind hasn't fallen in step with the truth and so is constantly taking issue with it
So
Now that the mind can develop stillness and investigate using its discernment let's take it on a meditation tour exploring the body our five khandhas
We can travel up to the head down to the feet out to the skin into the muscles tendons and bones to see how all the parts are related and connected by their nature
As the mind contemplates in this way step by step as it gets engrossed in its investigation the final result is that even though we're investigating the body the body doesn't appear in our inner sense of feeling at all
The mind feels airy and light
The physical body disappears despite the fact that we continue investigating the mental image of the body as before
Even though we're using the mental image of the body as the focal point of our investigation the physical aspect of the body no longer appears
It completely vanishes
We investigate until there's a refinement in the mind's sense of awareness to the point where we can make the body in the image die and disintegrate step by step
Our awareness is confined solely to the mental image that we are investigating by means of discernment
We see it distinctly because nothing else is coming in to interfere
The mind feels no hunger or desire to go skipping outside
It's completely engrossed in its work of investigation
Its understanding grows clearer and clearer
The clearer its understanding the greater its fascination
Ultimately there is simply the mental image or the idea and the mind or discernment
As for the actual body it disappears
You don't know where it's gone
There's no sense of the body at that moment even though you are investigating the body until you see its condition disintegrating clearly within the mind  disintegrating until it returns to its original condition as the elements of earth water wind and fire
Once the body in the image returns to its original elements the mind then withdraws inward leaving nothing but simple awareness
Feelings all disappear at this stage
Sañña sankhara and viññana aren't involved
There's simply awareness sufficient for the mind's state at that moment
It enters a really solid stillness leaving only simple awareness
The body sitting here disappears entirely
This is something that can occur in the course of investigating but please don't plan on it
Simply listen now for the sake of becoming absorbed and gladdened while listening
This will give rise to the benefits of listening that you will actually see for yourself
What will happen when you investigate in line with your own personal traits is a completely individual matter that will appear in keeping with your temperament
As for what occurs with other people you can't make yourself experience what they do know the way they know or see the way they see
This is something that depends on each person's individual traits
Let things follow your own inner nature in line with the way you are able to investigate and to know
This is one point I want to explain
A second point When investigating the body in terms of inconstancy stress and notself then  whether or not you think 'inconstancy stress and notself'  when discernment makes clear contact with the bodily khandha it will be able to know these things on its own because things that are inconstant stressful and notself are things that deserve to be relinquished that inspire dispassion and disenchantment step by step until you let go
When the mind has investigated so that it fully understands it lets go of its own accord without being forced because each part each aspect of the body or of the khandha being investigated is simply an individual truth
When the mind investigates clearly in this way it makes the break automatically because a truth has encountered a truth The mind is the mind and each of these individual conditions is a separate condition that hasn't come to involve itself with the mind at all
The mind will then turn around to see its own fault in being attached
'Here I've really been deluded
Actually things are like this and this' This is one stage When the mind hasn't yet made a complete break  when it doesn't yet have adequate strength  it will start out by knowing at intervals in this way
The next time you investigate you know in this way again and it keeps seeping in seeping in until your knowledge on this level becomes adequate and lets go
Like duckweed that keeps moving in moving in to cover the water After you spread it apart the duckweed comes moving in again and you spread it apart again
This is how it is when discernment investigates these things making forays into these things or unraveling them
As soon as discernment retreats subtle defilements come moving in again but after you have investigated many many times the duckweed  the various types of defilement  begins to thin out
Your investigation of these phenomena becomes more and more effortless more and more proficient more and more subtle step by step until it reaches a point of sufficiency and the mind extricates itself automatically as I have already explained
The mind  when its mindfulness and discernment are sufficiently strong  can extricate itself once and for all
This knowledge is clear to it without any need to ask anyone else ever again
The heart is sufficient in and of itself and sees clearly as 'sanditthiko' in the full sense of the term as proclaimed by the Dhamma without any issues to invite contradiction
A third point Sometimes when investigating the body the mind makes contact with a feeling of pain and so turns to investigate it
This all depends on the mind's temperament
In the same way when we turn to investigate the feeling the mind sends us back to the body
This is because the body and the feeling are interrelated and so must be investigated together at the same time depending on what comes naturally to us at that particular time that particular feeling and that particular part of the body
When the mind investigates a feeling of pain the pain is nothing more than 'a pain' The mind looks at it fixes its attention on it examines it and then lets it go right there turning to look at the body
The body is the body
The feeling is a feeling
Then we turn to look at the mind The mind is the mind
We investigate and experiment to find the truth of the body the feeling and the mind  all three of which are the troublemakers  until we have a solid understanding of how each has its own separate reality
When the mind pulls back from the body and the feeling neither the body nor the feeling appears
All that appears is simple awareness
When a mental current flashes out to know the feeling then appears as a feeling
These currents are the means by which we know what phenomenon has appeared because this knowledge gives a meaning or a label to the phenomenon as being like this or like that
If we're going to think in a way that binds us to 'ourself'  in other words in the way of the origin of stress  we have to make use of this act of labeling as what leads us to grasp to become attached to make various assumptions and interpretations
If we're going to think in the way of discernment we have to make use of the discernment that is this very same current of the mind to investigate contemplate until we see clearly by means of discernment and can withdraw inwardly in a way that is full of reason  not in a way that is lazy or weak or that is groveling in abject surrender with no gumption left to fight
In investigating feeling when a sañña flashes out mindfulness is alert to it
If our investigation of feeling has become refined and precise then when a sañña simply flashes out we know
When sankharas form they are just like fireflies blip
If no sañña labels them or picks up where they leave off they simply form  blip
blip
 and then vanish vanish
No matter what they form  good thoughts bad thoughts crude thoughts subtle thoughts neutral thoughts whatever  they are simply a rippling of the mind
If they occur on their own when nothing is making contact with the mind they're called sankhara
If they occur when something is making contact they're called viññana
Here we're talking about the sankharas that form on their own without anything else being involved
They form  blip  and then vanish immediately
Blip  and then vanish immediately
We can see this clearly when the mind converges snugly in the subtle levels of concentration and discernment
The snugness of the mind's convergence won't have anything else involved with it at all
All that remains is simple awareness
When this simple awareness remains stable this way we will see clearly that it isn't paired with anything else
When the mind begins to withdraw from this state to return to its awareness of phenomena  returning to its ordinary state of mind that can think and form thoughts  there will be a rippling  blip  that vanishes immediately
It will then be empty as before
In a moment it will 'blip' again
The mind will form just a flash of a thought that doesn't yet amount to anything just a rippling that vanishes immediately the instant it's known
As soon as there's a rippling we are alert to it because of the power of mindfulness keeping watch at the moment  or because of the strength of concentration that hasn't yet dissipated
But after these ripples have formed two or three times they come more and more frequently and soon we return to ordinary consciousness just as when a baby awakens from sleep At first it fidgets a bit and then after this happens a number of times it finally opens its eyes
The same is true of the mind
It has calm Here I'm talking about concentration when discernment is there with it
The various ways of investigating I have mentioned are all classed as discernment
When we have investigated enough the mind enters stillness free from mental formations and fashionings and from any sort of disturbance
All that appears is awareness
Even just this has the full flavor of a centered mind which should already be enough to surpass all other flavors
We never tire of delighting in this stillness
We feel a constant attraction to this stillness and calm in the heart
Wherever we go wherever we stay the mind has its own foundation
The heart is at ease quiet and calm so that now we must use discernment to investigate the elements and khandhas
The important point to notice is the act of formation in the mind
Once something is formed sañña immediately labels it  as if sankhara were forming things to hand on to sañña which takes up where the sankhara leaves off
It then interprets these things from various angles  and this is where we get deluded
We fall for our own assumptions and interpretations for our own shadows which paint picture stories that have us engrossed or upset both day and night
Why are we engrossed
Why are we upset
Engrossed or upset it's because of the mind's shadows acting out stories and issues
This story
That story
Future issues
Things yet to come
Things yet to exist  nothing but the mind painting pictures to delude itself
We live in our thoughtformations our picturepainting  engrossed and upset by nothing but our own thoughtformations our own picturepainting
In a single day there's not a moment when we're free from painting imaginary pictures to agitate and fool ourselves
Wise people though can keep up with the tricks and deceits of the khandhas which is why they aren't deluded
The moment when mindfulness and discernment really penetrate down is when we can know that this is actually the way the mind usually is
Like people who have never meditated When they start meditating they send their minds astray without anything to hold on to
For example they may have a meditation word like 'buddho' and there they sit  their eyes vacant looking at whoknowswhat
But their minds are thinking and painting pictures with endless captions
They then become engrossed with them or wander aimlessly in line with the preoccupations they invent for themselves falling for their preoccupations more than actually focusing on their meditation
They thus find it hard to settle their minds down because they don't have enough mindfulness supervising the work of meditation to make them settle down
Once we have used our alertness and ingenuity in the areas of concentration and discernment we will come to know clearly that these conditions come from the mind and then delude the mind whose mindfulness and discernment aren't quick enough to keep up with them
The heart causes us to follow after them deludedly so that we can't find any peace of mind at all even though our original aim was to meditate to find peace of mind
These deceptive thoughts engender love hate anger irritation without letup no matter whether we are meditators or not  because as meditators we haven't set up mindfulness to supervise our hearts and the result is that we're just as insane with our thoughts as anyone else
Old Grandfather Boowa has been insane this way himself and that's no joke
Sometimes no matter how many years in the past a certain issue may lie this aimless drifting heart wanders until it meets up with it and revives it
If it was something that made us sad we become sad about it again all on our own
We keep it smoldering and think it back to life even though we don't know where the issue lay hidden in the meantime
These are simply the mind's own shadows deceiving it until they seem to take on substance and shape
As what
As anger greed anxiety pain insanity all coming from these shadows
What sort of 'path' or 'fruition' is this
Paths and fruitions like this are so heaped all over the world that we can't find any way out
So in investigating the acts of the mind the important point is that discernment be quick to keep up with their vagrant ways
When mindfulness and discernment are quick enough then whatever forms in the mind we will see that it comes from the mind itself which is about to paint pictures to deceive itself about to label and interpret sights sounds smells and tastes of various kinds
The heart is then up on these preoccupations and when it is up on them they vanish immediately with no chance of taking on substance or shape of becoming issues or affairs
This is because mindfulness and discernment are wise to them and so the issues are resolved
Ultimately we come to see the harm of which the mind is the sole cause
We don't praise or blame sights sounds smells tastes or tactile sensations at all
The heart turns and sees the harm that arises in the mind that deceives itself saying 'That's worth praising worth criticizing worth getting glad about worth getting sad about' It sees that the blame lies entirely with the mind
This mind is a cheat a fraud a deceiver
If we study it and keep watch of its ways through meditation we will gain a thorough knowledge of its good and evil doings until it lies within our grasp and can't escape us at all
This is how we investigate when we investigate the mind
Ultimately other things will come to have no meaning or importance for us
The only important thing is this deceiving mind so we must investigate this deceiver with mindfulness and discernment so that we can be wise to its tricks and deceits
In fixing our attention on the mind we have to act as if it were a culprit
Wherever it goes we have to keep watch on it with mindfulness and discernment
Whatever thoughts it forms mindfulness and discernment have to keep watch so as to be up on events
Each event  serious or not  keeps vanishing vanishing
The heart knows clearly 'This mind and nothing else is the real culprit'
Visual objects aren't at fault
They don't give benefits or harm
Sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations don't give benefits or harm because they themselves aren't benefits or harm
Only the mind is what fashions them and dresses them up so as to deceive itself into being gladdened or saddened pleased or pained through the power of the preoccupations that arise only from the heart
Mindfulness and discernment see more and more clearly into these things step by step and then turn to see that all the fault lies with the mind
They no longer praise or blame other things as they used to
Once they have focused solely on the mind which at the moment is the culprit the time won't be long before they can catch the culprit and put an end to all our concerns
So then
Whatever thoughts that may be formed are all an affair of the mind
The 'tigers and elephants' it forms are simply sankharas it produces to deceive itself
Mindfulness and discernment are up on events every time
Now the current of the cycle keeps spiraling in day by day until we can catch the culprit  but we can't yet sentence him
We are now in the stage of deliberation to determine his guilt
Only when we can establish the evidence and the motive can we execute him in accordance with the procedures of 'Dhamma Penetration' This is where we reach the crucial stage in mindfulness and discernment
In the beginning we used the elements and khandhas as our objects of investigation cleansing the mind with elements using them as a whetstone to sharpen mindfulness and discernment
We cleansed the mind with sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations using them as a whetstone to sharpen mindfulness and discernment and we cleansed the mind itself with automatic mindfulness and discernment
Now at this stage we circle exclusively in on the mind
We don't pay attention to matters of sights sounds smells or tastes because we have already understood and let go of them knowing that they aren't the causal factors
They aren't as important as this mind which is the primary instigator  the culprit renowned throughout the circles of the cycle the agitator the disturber of the peace creating havoc for itself only right here inside
Mindfulness and discernment probe inward and focus right here
Wherever this mind goes it's the only thing causing harm
So we watch patiently over this culprit to see what he will do next  and aside from being alert to what he will do we also have to use discernment to penetrate in and see who is inciting him
Who stands behind him so that he must be constantly committing crimes
He keeps creating deceptive issues without pause  why
Mindfulness and discernment dig in there not simply to pounce on or lay siege to his behavior but also to go right into his lair to see what motivating force lies within it
What is the real instigator
There has to be a cause
If there's no cause no supporting condition to spin the mind into action the mind can't simply act on its own
If it simply acts on its own then it has to be a matter of khandhas pure and simple  but here it's not pure and simple
Whatever behavior the mind displays whatever issues it forms all give rise to gladness or sadness
This shows that these conditions aren't 'simply' coming out
There's a cause
There's an underlying condition that sends them out making them give rise to real pleasure and pain when we fall for them
While we are exploring inward at this point we have already seen that the mind is the culprit so we must consider letting go of all external things
Our burdens grow less and less
There remain only the issues of the mind and the issues of formation and interpretation that arise solely from the mind
Mindfulness and discernment spin whizzing around in there and ultimately come to know what it is that causes the mind to form so many thoughts giving rise to love anger and hate
As soon as it appears the heart knows it and when the heart knows it the 'Lord of Conventional Reality' which is blended with the mind dissolves away
At this point the cycle has been destroyed through mindfulness and discernment
The mind is no longer guilty and turns into a mind absolutely pure
Once the problem of the cycle is ended there is no way that we can find fault with the mind
When we could find fault that was because the fault was still in the mind
It was hiding in the mind
Just as when criminals or enemies have taken up hiding in a cave We have to destroy the cave as well and can't conserve it out of affection for it
Avijja  unawareness  is the lord of the three levels of existence that has infiltrated the mind and thus we have to consider destroying the entire thing
If the mind isn't genuine it will dissolve together with unawareness
If it's genuine in line with its nature it will become a pure mind  something peerless  because all things counterfeit have fallen away from it through the use of mindfulness and discernment
When the counterfeit things that are like rust latching firmly onto the mind finally dissolve away through the power of mindfulness and discernment the mind becomes genuine Dhamma
You can call it 'the genuine mind' or 'the genuine Dhamma' There's no contradiction because there is no more reason for contradiction which is an affair of defilement
You can say  that the flavor of the Dhamma has surpassed all other flavors
When the mind is pure Dhamma it has had enough of all other things
It is absolutely no longer involved with anything else at all
It's one mind one Dhamma
There is only one
There is only one genuine Dhamma
The mind is Dhamma the Dhamma is the mind
That's all that can be said
I ask each of you to take this and contemplate it
This is the basis for the truth of the teachings that the Lord Buddha taught from the beginning until the moment of his total nibbana
The purity of his mind was a deeply felt Dhamma that he experienced with his full heart
He then proclaimed that Dhamma with the benevolence of his full heart teaching the world up to the present
To call his teachings 'the benevolence of the Lord Buddha' shouldn't be wrong because he taught the world with true benevolence
When we take those teachings and put them into practice in a way that goes straight to the heart we will come to see things we have never seen before never known before within this heart step by step until we reach the full level of practice know the full level of knowledge and gain release from suffering and stress with our full hearts with nothing left latching on
This is called wiping out the cemeteries  the birth and death of the body and mind  for good
What a relief
And now that we've reached this point I don't know what more to say because I'm at a loss for words
I ask that you as meditators practice train yourselves and explore all Dhammas until you too are at a loss of words like this speaker at his wits' end
Even though we may be stupid infinitely stupid I'll ask to express my admiration straight from the heart
In the Discourse on Good Omens the Buddha teaches us to associate with sages and not with fools
The first and foremost fool here is our own heart
In other words there are fools outside and fools inside and for the most part the fools inside are the ones who keep stirring up trouble all the time
When we live with meditation masters which is called associating with sages we keep gaining lessons from sages because that's what they are
They are wise in the various tactics they teach us
They have practiced and gained knowledge of everything from experience
Their teachings are thus correct precise and convincing to those who listen to them with no room for any doubt
In particular Venerable Acariya Mun There never was a time when he would teach saying 'It seems to be like this
It seems to be like that' There was nothing but 'This is the way it is for sure for sure'  and we were sure because he spoke only the absolute truth taken right from a heart that had already known and seen and from his own wellconducted practice
Especially in the case of illness If there were any weakwilled cases he would tell them 'Whoever is weak whoever cries and moans can take his moans as his medicine
There's no need to search out medicine anywhere no need to have anyone to look after him
His moans are his medicine
If moaning serves any purpose then why search for medicine to treat the disease'
Then he would add 'Keep moaning
Everyone can moan
Even children can moan  if it serves a purpose
But here it doesn't serve any purpose at all other than to annoy those good people who are unflinching in the practice
So you shouldn't moan out of weakness
You're a meditation monk
When you act like this who can bear to see it
If you were a child or an ordinary person there wouldn't be anything wrong with it because they haven't received any training
They don't have any knowledge or understanding of the various ways to contend with the pain such as contemplating it
'But you you already know everything of every sort
Yet when trouble comes such as illness you can't find any methods or tactics to care for yourself
You just go all to pieces
This won't do at all
You're a shame to yourself and your fellow meditators'
Venerable Acariya Mun was very talented in teaching the heart
When those of his disciples who were intent on studying with him would listen to anything he'd say it would go straight to the heart
Straight to the heart
The things we should put into practice we would put into practice
The things we should understand right then dealing with internal matters we would understand  every time step after step
When we were ill he would teach us how to contemplate
'When you have a fever where did you get it from' He'd say this so as to serve a purpose as food for thought for meditators
'From where did you drag out the fever and chills
They arise in this body don't they
When they disappear where do they go if not back to where they came from
Even if they don't disappear they die together with each of us There are no exceptions at all in this body
Investigate it so as to know it
'All stress all pains are Noble Truths
If we don't investigate them what are we going to investigate
The Buddha gained Awakening with the Noble Truths his disciples gained Awakening with the Noble Truths  so are we going to gain Awakening with weakness
Would that be in keeping with the Dhamma of the Buddha
Then we've come to resist the Dhamma
'Where does the pain arise
In which part
Ask so as to find out
When it hurts here and aches there who is it that hurts
Who is it that aches
Probe on in to find what instigates it
Where does it come from
Where does it hurt
What causes it to hurt
What perceives it as pain
When the body dies and they cremate it does it hurt
Who is it that deceives itself into thinking that this hurts or that aches
Investigate so as to find its initial causes
'If you're a meditator who doesn't know initial causes and doesn't know their effects  this heap of suffering  then how are you going to cure suffering
What is your discernment for
Why don't you think
Why don't you find it and put it to use
'Your mindfulness and discernment are for keeping things in mind and investigating them  things such as feelings of pain that exist in your body and mind'
He would keep stressing his points step by step
If the person listening was intent on listening  and especially if he had any fighting spirit  he'd find it easy to grasp the point and it would appeal to him immediately
Immediately
When we'd leave Venerable Acariya Mun to live in any spot suitable for the practice his teachings would seem to reverberate through the heart
You could remember every facet of his teachings every important point that should be used as a tool in the practice
For example if you were staying in a challenging place it was if he were right there in the heart
The heart would be really audacious and exultant in practicing knowing the Dhamma seeing it understanding it
You would understand with audacity and with a warrior's spirit  not by being discouraged irresolute or beating a retreat
That's not the way to make the defilements fear you and disappear from the heart
That's not at all the way to cure defilement to know the affairs of defilement or to be able to remove them
This is the religion
There is nothing to compare with it in being so correct so precise so genuine so true so indisputable
If we all were to follow the principles of the religion there would be no need for prisons or jails
What need would they serve
Nobody would be doing any wrong
People would see in line with reason and acknowledge their rightness and wrongness their good and their evil using the principles of reason as their standard
We human beings would then be able to live with one another
The reason we need laws prisons and jails is because we don't admit our wrongs
When we're wrong we don't admit that we're wrong
Even the moment after we see ourselves do something wrong we won't admit to it
Even when we're put in jail and are asked we still say 'They accused me of stealing this and stealing that'  even though we ourselves actually stole it
This is simply an unwillingness to admit to things in line with reason in line with the truth
Even within the heart with things that concern us exclusively the same holds true We don't admit to them which is why we receive so much pain and suffering
If we admit to the principles of the truth the things that appear in line with the truth can be resolved through the truth
For example even when pain arises in the body it won't disrupt the mind because our knowledge is wise to it
As the principles of the Dhamma say pains have been appearing in our body and mind ever since we first became aware of things
There is no reason for us to get excited frightened or upset by them to the point where they disease the mind
This is why mental development or meditation is an excellent science for gaining knowledge on all fronts Those who practice consistently are not upset when pain arises in the body
They can even focus on the spot where the pain arises so as to investigate and analyze it in line with its truth until gaining skillful and courageous tactics for dealing with it admirably
The important point is to associate with sages wise people those who are sharp and astute
If we aren't yet able to depend on ourselves we have to depend on our teachers to instruct us
If we listen often their teachings gradually seep into us and blend with our temperament until our mind becomes a mind with Dhamma
Our mind becomes a sage a wise person and can eventually take care of itself becoming 'atta hi attano natho'  its own mainstay
So in every activity where we aren't yet capable we first have to depend on others
In living with those who are good we are bound to find peace and happiness
Our traits come to mesh with theirs  this is important  until our own traits become good and admirable as well
It's the same as if we were to associate with bad people At first we aren't bad but as we associate with them for a long time our traits blend themselves with theirs until we become bad without being aware of it
When we are fully bad this makes us even more blind
We feel that we've become even better
No one else can push us around
Otherwise our 'goodness' will jump into action  the 'goodness' of a bad person an evil that wise people everywhere fear
Bad people and good people
Evil and good
These things get turned around in this way
Bad people thus can't see the truth that they are bad and so flatter themselves into thinking 'I'm good
I'm smart
I'm clever
I'm one of the most renowned operators around' That's how they twist things
For this reason associating with meditation masters with sages is important for anyone who is striving to become a good person who is hoping to prosper and be happy because sages will teach us often
Their manners and deportment that we see day after day will gradually seep into and nurture our minds
We can hold to them continually as good examples for everything they do in every way is all Dhamma
Especially if they're people devoid of defilement then there is nothing to compare with them
Like Venerable Acariya Mun I'm certain that he was devoid of defilement
After hearing the Dhamma from him I had no doubts
He himself never said that he was devoid of defilement you know
He never said that he was an arahant or anything but he would say it in his ability to explain the true Dhamma on every level in a way that would go straight to the heart and erase all doubt for all those who came to study with him
This is why I can dare to say unabashedly that Venerable Acariya Mun Bhuridatta Thera is one of the important arahants of our day and age  an age in which arahants are exceedingly rare because it's an age sadly lacking in people practicing the Dhamma for the sake of arahantship
Instead we practice to eliminate arahantship by amassing all kinds of miscellaneous defilements
This holds for all of us so no one is in a position to criticize anyone else
Let's return to the subject of feelings To investigate feelings of pain is very important
This is something I learned from Venerable Acariya Mun
He took this very seriously whenever any of the meditators in his monastery became ill
Sometimes he would go himself and ask 'How are you contemplating your illness' Then he'd really emphasize the Dhamma
'Go probing right there
Wherever there's pain investigate so as to see the truth of the pain' He'd teach how to investigate 'Don't retreat
To retreat is to enhance the pain
'To be a warrior you have to fight using discernment
This is what will bring victory the ability to keep up with the feeling of pain that you hold to be an important enemy
Actually that feeling isn't anyone's enemy
It doesn't have any sense of consciousness at all
It's simply a truth  that's all
So investigate on in
You don't have to anticipate it or concern yourself with whether it's a big pain or a small pain
All that's asked is that you know its truth with your own discernment so that the heart won't deceive you' That's what he would say
Actually our heart is deceit incarnate because that which deceives is within the heart and fools the heart into making assumptions and interpretations
Stupidity has an easy time believing lies
Clever people have an easy time deceiving stupid people
Deceit has an easy time fooling stupidity
The cleverness of the defilements gets along well with our own stupidity
This is why the Dhamma teaches us to ferret things out to investigate down to their truth and then to believe in line with that truth
This is our means of gaining victory step by step
Ferret out the pains that are always with you so as to see them
Don't run away from them
Whether they're big or small investigate right there
Investigate right there
If you're going to concentrate concentrate right there
When you are investigating its causes no matter how great the pain keep probing in
The thing we call pain What does it depend on as its foundation
It depends on the body as its foundation
It depends on our attention as its means of flaring up  in other words the attention that labels it in various ways This is what makes pain flare up
We have to cure this kind of attention by investigating to know both the pain  what it's like  and the place where pain arises in whatever part of the body
Try to know clearly whether or not that spot is really pain
For example if there's pain in the bone in any part of the skin or flesh the skin and the flesh are skin and flesh
The pain is a pain
Even though they dwell together they are separate things not one and the same
The mind  the knower that is aware of these things  is a mind but it's a deluded mind so it assumes that this is pain that's pain and conflates these things into being its 'self' saying 'I hurt here
I hurt there
I don't want myself to be pained
I want the pain to vanish' This desire is a defilement that encourages pain and suffering to arise
The heart is pained
The feeling of pain in the body is pain
The pain in the heart flares up with that pain because it wants it to follow the heart's desires
These things keep feeding each other
This is our own stupidity loading us down with suffering
To be intelligent we have to investigate to watch the feeling of pain in the heart
What does it come from
What does it depend on
It depends on the body
Which part of the body
From what spot in the body does the pain arise
Look at the body and the feeling Are they one and the same thing
What kind of shape and features do they have
The feeling doesn't have any shape or features or a posture of any kind
It simply appears as a feeling of pain that's all
As for the body it has a shape a color and complexion  and it stays as it was before the pain arose
When the pain arises it stays just as it was
Actually the pain is something separate from this
It simply depends on a malfunction of the body to arise
The mind is what takes notice of it
If the mind has any discernment it should notice it in line with its truth
The mind then won't be affected by it
But if the mind is deluded it latches onto the pain  in other words it pulls that pain in to be its 'self'  and then wants that pain which it says is its self to disappear
This is why we can't analyze it
Once the pain is our self how can we separate it out
If it's simply a pain a separate reality then the body is a separate reality
They aren't one and the same
Each one exists separately
Each is a separate reality in line with its nature
Only when our awareness is like this can we analyze things
But as long as we see the pain as our self then we can analyze it all day long and not get anywhere because once we hold that 'This is myself' how can we analyze it
We haven't separated these things with discernment so we have to keep holding onto them as our self
When the khandhas and the mind blend into one we can't analyze them
But when we try to use mindfulness and discernment to investigate in to see the truth of these things  that each exists separately each has its separate reality which holds true for us and for everyone else  and this realization goes deep into the heart then the pain gradually fades away fades away
At the same time we know what makes the connection from the pain into the heart because the connection comes from the heart
When we investigate the pain it comes retracting into the heart
All the affairs of pain come from the heart that labels or that experiences mental pain because of an insidious connection by way of attachment that we don't yet know
When we investigate so as to see clearly we follow the feeling of pain inward
We come in knowing knowing
The pain keeps retracting and retracting into the heart
Once we know that the heart is what created the attachment making itself construe the pain to be itself creating a great deal of sufferingonce we know this the pain disappears
Or  alternatively  once we know this the pain stays real but the heart doesn't latch onto it
Even though the pain may not disappear the mind is the mind
It doesn't make any connection through attachment
Each is its own separate reality
This is called the mind being its own self  cool calm and collected  in the midst of the pain of the khandhas
This is to know that the mind is a reality just as each khandha is a separate reality
This is the path for those who are practicing so as to become wise to the five khandhas with feelings of pain as their primary focus
But for those who understand all the way to the point of reaching 'the unshakable mind the unshakable Dhamma' that can't be provoked into being anything else there is no problem at all
Whether pain is little or great they have absolutely no problem because their minds are always true
There is never a time when their minds which are already pure can become defiled can become 'worlded' There's no way it could happen
For this reason whatever conditions the khandhas may display such people know them in line with the principles of nature
The khandhas themselves appear in line with the principles of nature and disappear in line with nature
They remain naturally and then disappear naturally
The mind knows in line with its own nature without having to be forced or coerced in any way
The minds of those who know totally allaround are like this
As for those of us who are investigating the khandhas to know them and withdraw from them step by step even though our minds are not yet like that while we are practicing even though our hopes aren't yet fulfilled still our investigation of pain is for the purpose of separating the mind from the pain so that it's not entangled in pain so that whenever pain arises in greater or lesser measure the mind doesn't cling to the pain as being itself
We do this so as not to gather up the pain as being our self  which would be the same as taking fire to burn ourself
When we can do this we can be at our ease
So pain is an excellent whetstone for discernment
However much pain arises set your mindfulness and discernment focused right there
Turn to look at the mind and then expand your awareness to encompass the feeling and the body each of which is already a separate part
The body is one part the feeling is another and the mind another
Keep going back and forth among them investigating with discernment until you understand  and it really goes to the heart  that 'Each khandha is simply and that's all' None of them appears to be any such thing as 'you' or 'yours' They are simply different realities that appear and that's all
When you understand clearly like this the heart becomes its own free and independent self at that moment and it knows that the mind and the khandhas are separate realities neither affecting the other
Even at the moment when you are about to die the heart will be up on events in the immediate present
It won't be shaken by pain and death because it is sure that the mind is the mind a stronghold of awareness
Each khandha is simply a condition
The mind thus doesn't fear death because it is sure of itself that it won't get destroyed anywhere
Even though it may not have yet reached the level where it's absolutely devoid of defilement the mind has still prepared itself using discernment with the khandhas so that it's supreme
In other words it lives with the Noble Truths
It lives with its whetstone for discernment
Discernment will spread its power far and wide
The heart will grow more and more radiant more and more courageous because discernment is what cleanses it
Even if death comes at that moment there's no problem
For one thing if you use mindfulness and discernment to investigate pain without retreating to the point where you understand it then even when you really are about to die you'll know that the pain will disappear first
The mind won't disappear
It will revert into itself knowing exclusively within itself and then pass on at that moment
The phrase 'Mindfulness lapses' doesn't exist for a person who has practiced the Dhamma to this level
We can thus be sure that a person with mindfulness even though he or she may not be devoid of defilement will still be clearly aware at the moment when pain arises in full force to the point where the khandhas can no longer endure and will break apart  will die
The mind will withdraw itself from all that and revert to its 'mindness'  to being its own independent self  and then pass on
This is a very high very refined level of Dhamma
For this reason meditators who are resolute and unflinching for the sake of knowing every level of the Dhamma tend to be earnest in investigating pain
When the time comes for them to know the knowledge goes straight to the heart
They regard their pain as a Noble Truth in line with the Buddha's teaching that all living beings are fellows in pain birth aging illness and death
So when investigating the khandhas so as to know them in line with their truth you shouldn't try to thwart or resist the truth
For example if the body can't endure let it go
You shouldn't cherish it
As for the pain it will go on its own
This is called sugato  faring well
This is the way of investigating the mind and training the heart that gives clear results to those who meditate
They have meditated in the way I've described so that when the time of death is really upon them they don't hope to depend on anyone at all  parents brothers sisters relatives friends anyone
They have to withdraw the mind from all things that entangle and involve it so as to enter that crucial spot where they are engaged in handtohand combat
At a time such as this at the moment when you are about to die take pain as the focal point for investigation
Don't be willing to retreat  come what may
All that's asked is that you know and understand this point
Don't go thinking that if you die while being embroiled in investigating pain like this  while the mind is in the midst of this commotion  you'll go to a bad bourn
Why should you go to a bad bourn
You're embroiled but with a noble task
You're embroiled with knowledge or for the sake of knowledge and not because of delusion
The mind is focused on investigating and probing pain
When the time comes for it really to go this knowing mind  the mind with mindfulness knows  will withdraw instantly into itself
It will let go immediately of the work at hand and withdraw into itself to be itself  the mind and nothing but  and then pass on like a 'sugato' with the full capability of a meditator even though we may not yet be devoid of defilement
This is called having full strength to our full capacity in line with our level of mind and Dhamma
Investigation and mental development are thus important matters matters on which our life and death depend
We needn't hope to depend on anyone else at all  of this we are certain within ourselves
The heart knows within itself how strong mindfulness and discernment are and needn't go asking anyone else
If the heart is able to investigate to the point where it can pass on at that moment all doubts vanish
There are no problems at all
If you think that because you're a woman or because you're a layperson you can't realize nibbana that's your own misconception which is one kind of defilement deceiving you
The Dhamma is a truth and everyone's common property
Whether we are men or women lay or ordained we can all have mindfulness and discernment
We can all cure our defilements
When we are willing any man or woman any monk or layperson can use any of the methods to cure defilement and gain release
We needn't create problems to plague our hearts and waste our time
'Since when do I have the potential to do that' Don't think that
You're developing the merit and potential right now
However much or little you can see it right here in the mind
We should examine ourselves
Wherever we are stupid we should develop intelligence mindfulness and discernment
Only then will we be doing what is genuinely right in terms of the principles of the Lord Buddha's Dhamma
If we criticize ourselves thinking 'That person is on this level or that level while we don't have any level at all wherever we go this person gets ahead of us that person gets ahead of us' actually nobody is getting ahead of us except for the defilements that get ahead of us and deceive us into feeling inferior and depressed into thinking that we have only a little potential
That's simply a misconception aimed at making us discouraged and selfpitying because defilement is looking for a way to kill us without our realizing it
We shouldn't think in those ways
We are full of potential  all of us
And why shouldn't we be
We're meditators
We're all devoted to making merit
Potential isn't something we can set out on the market to compete with one another
Every person has potential within him or herself
We're taught not to belittle one another's potential
Even with animals we're taught not to belittle them  think of that
 because potential lies in the heart of every person and every animal
So when curing defilement you needn't waste time thinking those things
They'll simply ruin your morale and your resolve
To think 'I'm a worthless woman a worthless man a worthless monk a worthless layperson
I don't have any paths or fruitions at all
Other people have them but I don't
I'm ashamed to show them my face'  these are wrong thoughts that will spoil your resolve in developing the various forms of goodness
The right way to think is this 'Right now I'm making an effort with mindfulness and discernment to cure defilement and to develop what is good and meritorious step by step which is the direct way to develop my perfections
I have the potential
I was born in the midst of the Buddha's teachings and have developed the potential and the perfections to my full capacity all along up to the present'
Women can have mindfulness and discernment just like men because women and men both have defilements and defilements are cured with mindfulness and discernment  backed by persistent effort  both by men and by women
And where do they have defilements
They both have defilements in the heart
When mindfulness and discernment are complete women and men can both pass over and beyond  with no question of their having to be ordained
This is the truth of the Noble Truths which are not particular about status nationality or any of the human races and which are not particular about the male or the female sex
All that's asked is that we strive because the Dhamma is common to us all
Women and men lay and ordained we can all listen to it understand it practice it and cure defilement
The defilements don't favor men or women
We all have defilements
Even monks have defilements What do you say to that
Monks thus have to cure their own defilements
If they don't they lie buried in defilement just like people in general who aren't interested in the Dhamma  or even worse than people in general
The Dhamma thus doesn't stipulate that it's only for those who are ordained
What is stipulated is that we cure defilement with persistent effort
This is something very important
We have to be very interested in this point
As for release from suffering and stress where do we gain release
We gain it right here right where there is suffering
If we can cure defilement we gain release from suffering
If we can't then no matter what our sex or status we all have to suffer
Here
This is where the religion lies here in the heart
It doesn't lie anywhere else
If we want to be incapable of it we can be incapable  right here in our heart
Whether lay or ordained we can be incapable  if we make ourselves incapable
Or we can make the religion flourish in our heart  that we can also do
When the religion flourishes where does it flourish
In the heart and nowhere else
The important point is the heart
The important point is our practice the actions the manners we display
When the heart develops the various aspects of our behavior develop beautifully
Admirably
In particular the heart flourishes within itself
It has mindfulness and discernment looking after it constantly
This is called a flourishing heart
The defilements can hardly ever come to damage it That's when the religion flourishes
We should make an effort to examine and straighten things out step by step
The defilements you know are no wider or greater than the limits of our ability to cure and remove them
They're only here in the heart so investigate right here
Whether we're men or women lay or ordained we all have defilements in our hearts
No matter how thick they may be if we consider them we can know them
They're like darkness Even though darkness may have existed for aeons all we have to do is turn on a light and the darkness disappears completely
The darkness doesn't have any way to brag saying 'I've been dark for aeons so there's no way that this puny light can chase my darkness away' When the causes are ready the darkness has to disappear completely and brightness appears in its place
Even though the darkness may have existed for aeons it all vanishes in that instant
Even though the defilements may be thick and may have been lording it over our heart for a long time we should investigate them thoroughly with mindfulness and discernment
When mindfulness and discernment are capable they immediately become allaround
The defilements even though they may have been in the heart for aeons will immediately disintegrate in the same way that the darkness that had existed vanishes as soon as a light is lit
Brightness arises instead through the power of mindfulness and discernment
Within the heart it is dazzlingly bright at that moment with 'dhammo padipo'  the light of the Dhamma
This is all there is
This is the important point we have to investigate
Be sure to see it
The religion is marvelous  where is it marvelous
The religion flourishes  where does it flourish
The Buddha says to gain release from stress  where is it gained
It exists only here in the heart
To analyze it there are the four Noble Truths stress its origin its cessation and the path
Stress We know it's stress because we aren't dead
The origin of stress This is what fosters or produces stress
What forms does it take
We're taught 'Craving embued with passion and delight relishing now here and now there ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for being craving for notbeing' This we know
Whatever the mind may love or crave we should try to straighten it out
It loves and craves the five khandhas and especially the five khandhas that it says are 'me' So try to become wise to these things step by step
And then there's more love and craving love and craving for the mind attachment to the mind cherishing the mind
So straighten out the mind
Wherever it feels love that's where defilement is
Keep going in straightening things out until you've reached the truth
Then the heart will have no love or hate because they are all gone
The defilements are all gone
The mind has no love no hate no anger
It's a pure principle of nature within itself
This is the nature we truly want
Investigating for the sake of Dhamma This is the path with mindfulness and discernment its important factors
The cessation of stress Stress stops step by step until the path is fully capable and nirodha stops all stress in the heart without leaving a trace
When nirodha has finished stopping stress that which knows that stress has stopped and defilement has stopped that which knows is 'the pure one' This pure one lies beyond the Noble Truths as a marvelous extraordinary Dhamma
The Noble Truths are activities conditions conventions
Even nirodha is a convention
It's the activity of stopping stress
It's a conventional reality
When stress is completely stopped nothing remains
All that remains is an entirely pure awareness
This is not a Noble Truth
It's the purity of the mind
If you want you can call it nibbana
There's nothing against calling it whatever you want
When we reach this level there are no conflicts  no conflicts no disagreements with anyone at all
We don't conflict with ourselves we don't conflict with anything
Our knowledge is wise to everything so we can say what we like
There are no problems at all
All I ask is that you know this marvelous extraordinary Dhamma
Its excellence exists of its own accord without our having to confer titles
This then is the genuine religion
Probe right here
Probe on in
When in the practice of the religion we come to know we'll know right here
If the religion is to flourish it will flourish right here
The Buddha in teaching the beings of the world to gain release from suffering taught right here  and release is gained right here nowhere else
We qualify as beings of the world and lie within the net of the Buddha's teachings
We're in the Buddha's following
Each of us has the right to practice and remove defilement so as to go beyond suffering and stress
All of us in the four groups of the Buddha's following have the right to realize ourselves and reach nibbana
So
I ask that you contemplate
Investigate
Be brave in fighting the things that should be fought within the heart
Develop courage
Develop mindfulness and discernment until they are sufficient
Search for various tactics for probing These we should develop within ourselves
To probe on our own is the right way
It's our own wealth
Teachers lend us bits and pieces which are merely fragments to serve as hints or as leads for us to contemplate so that they'll grow and branch out into our own wealth
Any Dhamma that's a wealth coming from our own tactics That's truly our own wealth
We'll never exhaust it
If we can think and probe cunningly in removing defilements until they fall away completely using the tactics we develop on our own from the ideas our teachers lend us as starting capital that's our own Dhamma
However much may arise it's all our own Dhamma
What we derive from the texts is the Buddha's  and we borrow it from him
What we get from our teachers we borrow from them  except when we are listening to them teach and we understand the Dhamma and cure defilement at that moment That's our wealth while we are listening
After that we take their tactics to contemplate until they branch out through our own ingenuity
This is our own wealth in terms both of the causes  our contemplation  and of the outcome the satisfactory results we gain step by step all the way to release from suffering and stress  and that's entirely ours
It stays with us and no one can come to divide up any of our share at all
This is where the excellence becomes excellent
It doesn't become excellent anywhere else
So try to find the excellence the peerlessness that lies within you by striving and being energetic
Other than this awareness there's no excellence at all
But at present the heart is concealed by things that are filthy and worthless and so it too has become something that lacks its proper worth
Right now we are washing it peeling away the various kinds of defilement step by step
When we have used our full strength to peel them all away until there aren't any left in the heart then the heart is fully pure
Excellence appears here in this heart  and so the excellence is excellent right here
We don't have to search anywhere for anything more for we have fully reached the 'land of enough'
So then
I'll ask to stop here
We human beings are like trees If we water a tree fertilize it and keep looking after it it will be fresher and grow faster than it normally would if we let it fend for itself without our help
The mind when we keep looking after it will become more and more radiant and peaceful step by step
If it isn't trained it's like a tree that isn't looked after
Whenever it lacks training it begins to act tarnished and defiled because the things that tarnish and defile it are already there inside it
When we look after the mind continually with meditation it will gradually become more and more calm
When it's calm it will begin to develop radiance along with its calm
And once it's calm then when we contemplate anything we can penetrate into the workings of cause and effect so as to understand in line with the truths that appear both within us and without
But if the mind is clouded and confused its thoughts are all worthless
Right becomes wrong and wrong becomes progressively even more wrong
Thus we are taught to train the mind so that it will be quiet calm and radiant able to see its shadows just as when water is limpid and clear We look down into the water and can see clearly whatever plants or animals there are
But if the water is muddy we can't see anything when we look down into it
No matter what's there in the water  plants animals or whatever  we can't see them at all
The same holds true with the mind
If it's clouded then we can't see the harm of whatever  big or small  is hidden within it even though that harm has been bad for the mind all along
This is because the mind isn't radiant
For this reason a mind clouded with muddy preoccupations can't investigate to the point of seeing anything which is why we have to train the mind to make it radiant and then it will see its shadows
These shadows lie buried in the mind
In other words they're the various conditions that come out of the mind
They're called shadows  and we're forever deluded into being attached to these shadows that come from the thoughts constantly forming and coming out of the mind at all times
They catch us off guard so that we think 'this' is us 'that' is us anything at all is us even though they are simply shadows and not the real thing
Our belief or delusion though turns them into the 'real thing' As a result we end up troubled and anxious
At present the great respected meditation masters on whom we depend in the area of the practice and in the area of the mind are falling away one by one
Those who are left can barely take care of themselves
Physically they are wearing out step by step  like Venerable Acariya Khao
To see him is really heartrending
When the body reaches its final extremity it's as if it had never been strong or in radiant health
To lie down is painful to sit is painful  whatever the position it's painful
When the time comes for pain to come thronging in the khandhas are nothing but pain
But for people like this it's simply a matter of the body and the khandhas
In the area of the mind they have no more problems about the behavior of the body or the khandhas at all
But as for us well we're always there welcoming such problems
No matter whether it's the body or the thoughts of the mind that are acting adversely the mind begins to act adversely as well
For example if the body is malfunctioning the mind begins to malfunction too even though there is nothing really wrong with it
This is due to the mind's own fear caused by the fact that mindfulness and discernment aren't up on the events surrounding the mind
This is why we're taught to train our mindfulness and discernment to be capable and bold alert to events arising within the mind and around it  namely in the various aspects of the khandhas when they behave in adverse ways
We have to be alert to these things
All that's needed is for the mind not to be alert or for it to be deluded by these things and it will create stress and pain for itself without ceasing
Pain will have to come pouring in to overwhelm it
Even though the body may be pained simply in accordance with its own affairs in accordance with the principles of nature the mind will still grab hold of it to cause pain for itself to burn itself if it hasn't investigated to see through these things
If the mind has mindfulness constantly governing and guarding it then whatever damage arises will be minor because it arises in a single spot  within the mind  and mindfulness is there at the same spot alert to the fact that this is arising that is arising good or evil is arising within
Discernment is what unravels contemplates investigates and remedies the different preoccupations arising in the mind
Things then begin to calm down
But if mindfulness is lacking things begin to get drawn out
Even though thoughtformations may arise and vanish one after another countless times sañña  labels and interpretations  don't vanish
They connect things into long stretches
Stress and pain will then have to connect into long stretches and gather into the heart
The heart is what then reaps all this suffering by itself because of the acts that sañña and sankhara fashion
The heart is the primary vessel for receiving both pleasure and pain  and for the most part it receives pain
If it lacks mindfulness and discernment it receives only fakes and scraps
Rubbish
Things toxic and dangerous
But if it's mindful and discerning it can pick and choose
Whatever isn't good it picks out and throws away leaving only the things of substance and worth within the heart
The heart is cooled but not with water
It feels pleasure but not because of external things
It's cool from the Dhamma
It feels pleasure in the Dhamma  and the reason is because mindfulness and discernment are looking after it
To attend to other things is not as difficult as attending to the heart
All the burdens of the world converge at the heart and so to remove the things that have long been buried within us is very difficult work
We may even become discouraged because we see almost no results when we first begin
This is because the mind is still drifting while we work
It doesn't really focus on taking its work seriously and so results don't appear as they should
This makes us discouraged weak and dejected
We give up thinking 'It'd be better to stop because we're not getting anywhere'  even though once we have stopped it's not any better except that the mind has a better chance of filling itself with evil after we've stopped striving toward the good
The assumption that says 'better' is the work of the defilements which are all deceivers tricking us into being discouraged and weak
Actually even while we are striving things aren't yet getting good even though we are practically dying to make them good
Our heart is ready to burst because of the effort  so how can things become good once we stop
If as we think things were to get good once we stop then no one should have to do work of any sort any more
Once we stop everything of every sort would become good on its own
Both within and without things would have to be good
We won't have to do much work
It's better to stop
The Dhamma isn't like the defilements
The defilements say 'It's better to stop' It's better all right  better for the sake of defilement not for the sake of the Dhamma
The Dhamma is something with which we have to keep persevering until it's good and then better and then even better continually because we don't stop
This work is our work which we do for the sake of Dhamma
It's not lazy work which is the work of the defilements
The results of the work will then appear step by step because we do it without ceasing
This is how it is with the work of meditation
When it's easy we do it when it's hard we do it  because it's work that ought to be done
If we don't do it who will do it for us
When the fires of pain and suffering are consuming the heart because of the thoughts we form and accumulate why don't we complain that it's hard
When we accumulate defilement to cause stress and anxiety to the heart why don't we feel that it's difficult
Why don't we complain about the stress
Because we're content to do it
We're not bothered with whether it's easy or hard
It simply flows  like water flowing downhill
Whether it's hard or not it simply flows on its own so that we don't know whether it's hard or not
But when we force ourselves to do good it's like rolling a log uphill
It's hard because it goes against the grain
In relinquishing the sufferings big and small to which the mind submits in the course of the cycle of rebirth some of the work just naturally has to be difficult
Everyone  even those who have attained the paths the fruitions and nibbana easily  has found it hard at first
When we reach the stage where it should be easy it'll have to be easy
When we reach the stage we call hard it'll have to be hard but it won't always be hard like this
When the time comes for it to be light or easy it's easy
And especially when we've come to see results appearing step by step the difficulty disappears on its own because we're completely ready for it with no concern for pleasure or pain
We simply want to know to see to understand the things on which our sights are set
Study
We should study the elements and khandhas
We should keep watch on the elements and khandhas coming into contact with us
This is an important principle for all meditators
We should keep watch on them all the time because they keep changing all the time
They're 'aniccam' all the time 'dukkham' all the time without respite without stop
Investigate
We should keep trying to see their affairs as they occur within us until we're adept at it
As we keep investigating again and again the mind will gradually come to understand more and more profoundly straight to the heart
The heart will gradually let go of its own accord
It's not the case that we investigate once and then stop waiting to rake in the results even though the causes aren't sufficient
That's not how it works
All forms of striving for the good  such as meditating  have to go against the grain of the defilements
All of the great meditation masters before becoming famous and revered by the world survived death through great efforts
If this were easy work how could we say they survived death
It had to be heavy work that required that they exert themselves to the utmost
Most of these masters have since passed away
Only a few are left
We hope to depend on them but their bodies are 'aniccam' We can depend on them only for a period only for a time and then we are parted as we have seen at present
So we should try to take their teachings inward as our masters always teaching us inside
Whatever they have taught we should take inward and put into practice
This way we can be said to be staying with our teachers at all times just as if we were to be with the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha everywhere and always
Our own practice is the primary mainstay on which we can rely with assurance
Depending on a teacher isn't certain or sure
We are bound to be parted
If he doesn't leave we leave
If he doesn't go we go  because he and we all live in the same world of inconstancy
There is no difference among us
What we can hold to though are the basic principles of his teaching
We hold to them and earnestly put them into practice so as to see the results so as to seize victory within the heart
Victory of this sort is the supreme victory unsurpassed in all the world
No other victory is its equal
We grapple to take victory over ourselves  over the defilements that we have believed to be 'ourselves' 'us' 'ours' for aeons and aeons
This is an enormous undertaking
If you play at it like children playing with dolls the defilements will crush you to bits in no time because you've been holding onto them for so long
So don't delay
Investigate so as to know clearly and let go so that the mind will be clear and free of suffering and stress and not forever in disarray
We've been accumulating the words 'us' and 'ours' for countless aeons
If the defilements were material objects what in the world could we take for comparison that would be larger than the pile of defilement craving and mental effluents the pile of 'us' the pile of 'ours' we've been accumulating for so long
There's so much of it that it would be beyond our strength to drag it out for comparisons
If we were to drag it out just to pass the time between eating and sleeping  to chip at it hack at it poke at it or slash at it once or twice hoping to break through it  we wouldn't get anywhere at all
We'd simply be grabbing at handfuls of water one after another
So we have to give it our all This is where we will gain our victory
We're meditators
We can't back away from the fight with the defilements lying within us
The word 'defilement' means simply this 'hunk of us' The defilements are 'us' 'ours' Everything that's 'us' is actually a pile of defilements
There's no need to doubt this
If we want to separate them out so as to see them piece by piece for what they actually are in line with their true nature we have to separate them using persistent effort in the area of mindfulness and discernment as our means of investigating and evaluating them
We separate the elements the four elements
Everyone in the world knows of the four elements but if we want our knowledge to go straight to the heart it has to come from the practice
If we investigate using discernment until we see distinctly it will penetrate the heart of its own accord
Once it has reached the heart you don't have to say anything The heart will let go of its own accord
Once the knowledge goes straight to the heart relinquishment comes straight from the heart
For us to know straight to the heart and let go straight from the heart we have to investigate over and over again and again until we understand
Don't assume that 'This we've already investigated that we've already investigated' by setting up expectations counting the times without seeing deeply enough to the level of letting go
The work isn't done with
It really has to reach the level of 'done with' felt deeply within the heart which then lets go
If it's really done with there's no need to investigate again because the heart has understood and can let go completely
The elements are already elements
Cognizance is an element
The things that make contact are also elements
Sights are elements sounds are elements all these things are already elements
As for the khandhas within us the body is a khandha feelings are a khandha labels are a khandha thoughtformations are a khandha cognizance is a khandha
They're groups aggregates heaps bits pieces all by their very nature
As for the mind know that it's the 'knower' we have to test and comprehend in the same way as the elements and khandhas so that we won't grab hold of it as the self or as belonging to the self which would simply be creating a heavier burden
We must investigate it with discernment so as to see it for what it truly is in just the same way
But as I've explained the investigation of the mind in a number of talks already you should have a fair understanding of the matter by now
In particular when a pain arises in the body we should know distinctly that 'This is a feeling' That's all
Don't go labeling or interpreting it saying that the feeling is us the feeling is ours or that anything is ours for that would simply foster more and more defilements and bring more and more pain in to smother the heart
Then when the feeling doesn't vanish that would cause even more pain in the heart and what could we possibly find to bear it
Pains arise in the body
They've been arising ever since the day we were born
The moment we came from our mother's womb the pain was excruciating
Only by surviving this death did we become human beings
If you don't call that pain what will you call it
Pains have existed ever since way back when
You can't force them to change their ways
The way of pain in the body is that it continually has to show itself
Once it arises it remains and then vanishes
That's all there is to it  arises remains vanishes  regardless of whether it's an external feeling or an internal feeling namely a feeling or mood in the mind
In particular feelings in the body Investigate them so as to see them clearly
The body is the body
We've seen it clearly known it clearly ever since the day we were born
We can conjure it into anything  us ours a prince a king nobility whatever however we want to conjure it  but its truth is simply a truth fixed and unalterable
It doesn't change in line with what we conjure it up to be
The body is simply the physical khandha
It has four elements  earth water wind and fire  gathered together and called a person a woman a man classified in endless ways given this name and that but what stays the same is the body the 'physical heap' All the parts taken together are called the physical heap which is one reality
Take out any of the parts and each of them also has its reality
When they're gathered together the skin is skin the flesh is flesh and the same holds true for the tendons bones and so forth
Even though they have names don't fall for their names
See them simply as individual realities as a physical heap
As for the heap of feelings it's not the body
The body isn't a feeling such as pain
Feeling is feeling
Whether pleasure appears or pain or a neutral feeling appears it's simply a separate feeling that you can see clearly
These two khandhas  the body and feeling  are more prominent than sañña sankhara and viññana which arise at intervals and immediately vanish
Feelings however even though they vanish have a period in which they remain
This you can clearly see in the practice
When pain arises focus on it as your target as the point to investigate
Don't see the pain as being yourself for that would be going against the true nature of feelings and the method of investigation and you won't be able to know the truth of the feeling as you should with your discernment
When you don't know the truth and persist in assuming the pain to be yourself you'll increase the pain enormously within the mind because you are going against the principles of nature which are the principles of truth the Lord Buddha taught
He taught us to investigate so as to see pain  in whichever part of the body it may arise  simply as a phenomenon that arises remains and then vanishes in its own due course
Don't get entangled in it
Don't fashion or conjure it into being this or that if you don't want to be forever burdened with pain with never a moment to put it down
See its truth the moment it arises remains and vanishes
That's all there is to feeling
Ferret it out so as to see it clearly with mindfulness and discernment
When you have focused on a feeling turn and look at the mind to see if the mind and the feeling are one and the same thing
Then look at the body and the mind Are they one and the same
Look at them so as to see them clearly
While you are investigating don't send the mind out anywhere else
Keep it right at that one spot
For example when investigating focus on the pain so as to see it distinctly
Then turn to look at the mind so as to see this awareness distinctly
Are they one and the same
Compare them
This awareness and that feeling Are they the same
Can you make them one and the same
And is the body like the mind
Is it like the feeling
Is it similar enough to be one and the same
There
This is the way we're taught to separate things so as to see them clearly
The body is the body  how can it be like the mind
The mind is a mental phenomenon a nature that knows but the elements of the body are elements that don't know
The earth elements doesn't know the water element doesn't know the wind element doesn't know the fire element doesn't know  but this mental element knows
This being the case how can they be one and the same
Similarly with the pain It's an element that doesn't know
It's a phenomenon
These two unknowing elements are also different The feeling and the body are different sorts of things
They aren't one and the same
How could you make them one and the same
In making distinctions while investigating look so as to see clearly the way things actually are
There's no need to fear death
There is no death to the mind
Don't create snares to catch yourself and hurt yourself
There is no death ie no death to the mind
There is nothing but awareness pure and simple
Death doesn't exist in the mind which is something  unalterable and sure
Death is an assumption that has been conjured up for the mind through the power of the mind's own delusion
The mind has conjured it up to deceive itself
So once we've investigated in line with the truth  that the mind is not something that dies  what reason will we have to fear death
What is 'death'
We know that the elements and khandhas fall apart
We human beings when we've stopped breathing are called 'dead people' At that moment the 'knower' separates from the elements so that nothing is left but physical elements with no feelings That's a 'dead person'
But actually the knower doesn't die so we have to investigate in order to see this clearly with discernment
We needn't create the issue of death to stab or snare the heart or to obstruct the path we are following for the sake of seeing and knowing the truth through investigation
No matter how great or how little the pain keep your attention well fixed on the affairs of that pain
Use the pain as a whetstone for sharpening discernment
Separate the pain from the mind
Separate the mind from the pain
Be able to compare their every aspect
Be careful not to let your attention wander while investigating so that you'll be able to see and know the truth while in handtohand combat with that particular khandha
Now if it should happen that the mind dies as the world supposes  if it should die while you're making your investigation  then make sure you know what dies first and what dies after
When does the feeling vanish
When does the mind vanish
Where does it vanish to
Actually the mind by nature is not something that vanishes
How can anyone come and make it vanish
Investigate carefully between the mind and the khandha until the truth is absolutely clear to the heart and your doubts vanish
This is called training discernment developing discernment so as to see the truth
No matter how great the pain arising at that moment it won't have the power to affect the mind at all
Once we see the mind as the mind the feeling as feeling  once discernment has seen clearly in this way that the khandhas and the mind are real in their own separate ways  they won't infringe on one another at all
The body is simply the body and stays as it is
When the pain appears the body is still there
When the pain vanishes every part of the body remains in accordance with its own nature
If the feeling arises that's the feeling's business
If it remains that's the feeling's business
If it vanishes that the feeling's business
The mind is the one who knows that the pain arises remains and vanishes
The mind isn't the one who arises remains and vanishes like the body or the feeling
Once you have investigated this way until you're adept then when the chips are down investigate in the same way
You needn't fear death because you're a warrior
Fear of death is not the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha
The Dhamma is a matter of courage in the face of the truth
This is the basic principle of the svakkhata dhamma the welltaught teaching
Follow in the path of this truth
If the time comes to die be ready to die
There is no need to fear because the mind doesn't die  but be sure to know clearly what is appearing at that moment
For example the pain What is it like
Look at it so as to know its truth
Once you have seen its truth then the pain is simply a phenomenon
It doesn't have any meaning good or bad at all
And it doesn't act as anyone's enemy
It's simply its own full reality displaying itself in line with natural principles
The body is also its own reality appearing in line with its own principles
The mind is a separate phenomenon that constantly knows and doesn't intermingle with anything else
When you have investigated so as to know allaround the mind extricates itself to be its own reality in full measure
The pain has its own fullness in line with its nature the body has its own fullness in line with its nature in that the mind doesn't create any turmoil trying to lay claim to anything of theirs
This being the case nothing disturbs anything else
Pain no matter how great has no impact on the mind
You can smile even while great pain is arising  you can smile
 because the mind is something separate not involving itself with the feeling
It doesn't intermingle with the pain so as to burn itself
This way the heart is at ease
This then is the investigation of pain so as to comprehend it by taking pain as your battlefield as a whetstone for discernment as the place where you temper and sharpen discernment by investigating and dissecting the pains that arise
Single out the body and single out the feeling
Which will vanish first which will vanish after try to know in accordance with their truth
Arising and vanishing have always been a part of their nature from time immemorial
Regardless of whether or not you've been aware of it these have been their inherent characteristics
All you need to do is to investigate so as to see in line with their truth so as not to resist the Dhamma and you can live at ease
So
If the time comes to die let the body die  as the conventions of the world understand 'dying' The body falls apart so let it fall apart
Whatever is going to disintegrate let it go  but that which doesn't disintegrate remains
That which doesn't disintegrate is this mind
This mind once it has developed discernment as a standard within itself is really like this with no flinching in the face of illness or death
The mind is courageous and capable
There then
This is how we investigate our affairs  the affairs of the mind
We needn't fear death
Why fear it
The Buddha taught us not to fear
The Dhamma doesn't teach us to fear
The truth is nothing frightening because it's the truth
What's frightening or emboldening about it
Courage
There's nothing that calls for courage
Fear
There's nothing that calls for fear
Here I'm talking about the level where we have reached pure truth
There's no trace of the words 'courage' or 'fear' left in the heart at all
There's only purity
But while investigating so as to reach the truth we need to have courage
When we are going to seize victory for ourselves we can't not have courage
Otherwise we'll lose
This is because we're following the path
We need courage and daring with no fear or intimidation in the face of anything at all
Whatever comes our way we must investigate so as to know and understand it without growing discouraged or weak so as to be intent on knowing and seeing it in line with its truth  everything of every sort that comes into the range of our awareness
This is called being a warrior in the combat between the mind and khandhas or between the Dhamma and the defilements
Courage of this sort is proper and right
Once we've reached the goal fear disappears courage disappears because we have gained full victory
Fear and courage are no longer an issue
But right now fear and courage are a critical issue for those still on the way
Develop courage with discretion in the areas that call for courage
Be a fighter with the things that call for fight  such as feelings of pain  so as to see in line with their truth
Don't be afraid
The Buddha taught us not to fear
Fear has the same value as death
When the time comes things have to fall apart
That's what's called 'death' But in any event meditators have to come to know with discernment before these things undergo their transformation
Spread a net of discernment around yourself on all sides
Whatever appears will be caught in the net of discernment so what is there to fear
What is there to be anxious about
What is there to knock you off balance
Everything simply follows its truth which you have already investigated
This is how 'warriors' investigate
Even though they're in the midst of khandhas that are a solid mass of flame they're calm and at ease with the normalcy of a mind that has completely comprehended without being deluded by any phenomenon
This is what's meant by one who 'knows all around'
Whatever the symptoms displayed by the body if they are endurable we endure them
We care for the body look after it nourish it make it eat make it sleep make it drink take care of it in accordance with its nature
If its symptoms are unendurable and it's simply going to go then just let it go in accordance with the ways of nature
It's a truth so how can you thwart it
Let it go in line with the truth
This is called letting go with knowledge that accords with the truth
The mind feels no attachment no regrets
This is the basic principle of practice for one who has attained or is about to attain victory within the heart
Previously the mind has always lost out to defilement and craving
It has never until now defeated them
For aeons and aeons it has lived entirely under the sway of the defilements to the point where it has forgotten to realize that 'The defilements are the boss
We're their servant'
But now we're going to turn over a new us using the principles of the Dhamma as means to subjugate the defilements and mental effluents that have been subjugating us or that have been the ruling elite the big bosses of the cycle of rebirth forcing the mind to go here and there for so long
Now we're going to set our hearts on contending with the defilements for victory so as to see the truth of everything of every sort with nothing to obscure our discernment at all
At the same time we will take victory for our own  after having been defeated for so long  using the power of unflagging mindfulness discernment conviction and perseverance
Those who have reached the realm of excellence through perseverance have a dignity that outshines that of others
At the same time they can take pride in their own perseverance
Those who have reached the realm of excellence through gaining victory over themselves and no one else are supreme within themselves with no creation of animosity  unlike victory in war with which the world creates endless animosities like links in a chain
To gain victory over oneself though is to gain the foremost victory
As the Dhamma says
The things that have created turmoil for the heart causing it suffering and stress in the past now come to an absolute stop
In what I have been saying don't forget that perseverance is the important factor the factor that supports mindfulness and discernment as the trailblazers for the sake of progress in our work
Discernment is very important for investigating and exploring so as to see causes and effects
Mindfulness supervises the work to keep our attention from straying
When discernment has investigated so as to see the truth of such things as the five khandhas the defilements will have no place to hide and so will come pouring together into one place  into the heart
They have no other place to hold onto no other place to attach themselves because all such places have been obliterated by discernment
The next stage is to lay siege to the heart where the enemies lie gathered so as to disperse them from it until nothing is left
There
That's called the death of the defilements
They die right there right there in the heart where they've always been
They've lived there and when they die they die there through the power of the most uptotheminute 'supermindfulness' and 'superdiscernment' This is called full victory
The supreme victory is won right here
The teachings of the religion all converge at this point
The final stage in their practice comes to an end right here
We finish our task right here
When we reach the realm of release from suffering and stress we reach it right here
Aside from this there is nothing no time no place no future no past
As for the present we are wise to everything of every sort
We have no more issues no more disputes
There are no more cases in court between defilement and the mind
Supermindfulness and superdiscernment have sat on the bench and handed down a death sentence for defilement and all its tribe
There is nothing left to carry on the lineage of birth and being
At that moment defilement and all its tribe sink out of sight
This is called reaching nibbana a heart truly constant and sure
All the various conditions that used to deceive the mind no longer exist
All that remains is pure awareness
Even though the khandhas  rupa vedana sañña sankhara and viññana  may form in accordance with their nature they simply go their own way which has no meaning in terms of defilement at all
The body behaves in its 'body way' Feelings  pleasure pain neither pleasure nor pain which appear in the body  behave in the way of feelings
Sañña  labels acts of recognition  behave in their own way
Sankhara  the various thoughtformations  behave in line with their own nature
Viññana  acts of noticing when external objects come into contact with the eye ear nose tongue body and mind  notice and vanish notice and vanish in line with their nature without being able to provoke the mind as before because the things that cause provocation have all been destroyed without leaving a trace
These are thus called 'khandhas pure and simple' The mind has reached nibbana in the midst of khandhas pure and simple
This is to reach living nibbana the mind purified of defilement
Those who have reached this point you know don't ask where nibbana is
And why should they
What is nibbana actually
The word nibbana is a name
The nature we call nibbana is the actual thing
When you reach the actual thing why ask the name
Why ask for traces and signs
What is there left to grope for
Those who really know don't grope aren't hungry don't lack  because they have reached 'enough' completely of everything of every sort
So
That should be enough explanation for now
I ask that we as meditators take this and contemplate it so as to see the truth I have mentioned
We will then be complete in our hearts as I have described without a doubt
So I'll ask to stop here
To practice is to search for principles leading to the truth
To study is like studying a plan  although people for the most part don't follow the plan  but outer plans and inner plans are worlds apart
With outer plans  like blueprints of a house or a building or maps that tell where roads and places are located  the builder examines the blueprint and follows it the traveler follows the routes that appear on the map but if he gets a map that's outofdate there are bound to be things that have come into being or been torn down that don't show on the map
This can cause him to misunderstand and to follow the wrong route
Inner plans though  such as the parts of the body the elements and the khandhas which the Buddha taught us to study and to put into practice so as to derive benefits from them  are fixed truths unchanged from the Buddha's time to the present
But with these plans within the mind we can't act like a builder who follows the blueprint in his hands because that would go against the principle of the present which is where the Dhamma arises
For example when we study and understand in line with the texts and then practice it's hard not to speculate in reference to the texts and so when we practice or try to develop concentration in the mind we'll find that the mind has trouble growing still because of the disturbance
If while practicing the Dhamma we contemplate or reflect on whatever Dhamma we have studied it's bound to get all confused because the mind's state is not such that these things can be contemplated pondered or compared with the mind at the moment it's gathering itself together to gain strength
This is why we shouldn't bring anything in to disturb it at all
Let there simply be the 'Dhamma theme' the meditation theme we bring in to supervise the mind as if we were charging the mind so as to give it inner strength  in other words so as to make it still
When the mind is still it gains inner strength
Regardless of how much or how little knowledge it has no trouble or confusion results because the mind has its footing
It's secure
Calm
Peaceful within itself  all because of the stillness which is a gathering of energy
This isn't in the plan at all  because while we are practicing we aren't concerned with the texts
We're intent solely on developing concentration in the present until we gain results  peace wellbeing and various other satisfactory states  there in that moment
If this is in the plan it's in the part that says 'Try to make the mind stay with just a single Dhamma theme  its meditation word' Don't get involved with other topics at that moment
If you let it think of the texts while practicing concentration it won't be willing to stick just with that practice
A great deal of extraneous knowledge will interfere disrupting the mind until everything is a turmoil and no stillness will result
This is called going against the plan taught by the Buddha
Whatever plans we've been given however many however much Dhamma the Buddha taught we gather it all to our own confusion
It's as if we were building a hut and yet went around to gather up plans for hundredstory buildings and spread them out for a look
They just don't go together
The plan for a building and the plan for a hut are as different as earth and sky and yet here we are going to gather the mind into one point which is like building a hut
Only after we have the strength can we then begin enlarging it into a building
When we ultimately reach the level where we are ready to investigate there are no limits as to how broad or restricted it should be
The mind can investigate everything throughout the cosmos
When we reach the level where we should investigate that's the level where we'll gain firm confirmation in the mind
We'll gain knowledge and all kinds of insights from our own investigation
This is where the fun lies  sifting choosing with our discernment what is right and what is wrong
We'll go back exploring through the Dhamma we have already studied and compare it with the causes and results in our practice until they agree and then we can set the matter to rest
Even though we may have already understood clearly we still have to gain confirmation to give it further support for the sake of full conviction and certainty
This is what's meant by discernment
It's not the case that if we have no doubts then there's no reason to make comparisons
The Dhamma of the doctrine is one thing the Dhamma of the practice is another
We take the Buddha's wealth and compare it with our own wealth gained from our practice
If they match we can accept the matter and put it aside with no more concern
In particular when we practice in line with the four Noble Truths or the four foundations of mindfulness these are things that the Buddha described as being interconnected
If we practice them one by one in line with the texts  investigating the body and then feeling and then the mind and then mental events  we'll be wrong the livelong day because these things by their nature are interconnected at all times
We can investigate whichever aspect we want
Whichever aspect feels most natural to us we should start with that one first
By and large we start out by investigating the body
But when a pain appears we have to let go of the body and focus on the pain
We then consider the pain in relation to the body distinguishing between the two so that we understand them clearly
Then we distinguish between the pain in the body and the pain in the mind comparing them and distinguishing between them again
Body feeling mind and mental events lie together in the same moment
So we separate out the body  in other words investigate it  and then separate out the feeling so as to know whether or not the body and feeling are one and the same
Then we separate the mind from the mental events within the mind so as to see that each of these events is not the same thing as the mind
To say just this much covers all four of the foundations of mindfulness
We can't divide these things and deal with them one at a time one after another the way we take one step after another while walking
To do so is wrong
This is the way it is with the practice When we investigate one aspect or another of the four foundations of mindfulness or the four Noble Truths they all become involved of their own accord  because they are interconnected phenomena
The Buddha says for example
Now the phrase 'the body within the body' means to start out with any one of the many parts of the body
Once we have contemplated that part until we gain an understanding our investigation then permeates further of its own accord making us curious about this part and that
This keeps spreading and spreading until it reaches everything in the body
In other words it covers everything and understands everything
'The body within the body'  for example kesa hair of the head Even though we may contemplate only one hair on the head it has an impact on our understanding of how may hairs on the head
And then connects up with how many parts of the body
It affects everything
It permeates everything because everything is interrelated
No matter what we investigate this is the way it goes in line with the principles of investigation in the area of the practice that the Noble Ones have followed
'Feeling' It arises in our body
Focus on whichever one point is very pronounced
Investigate it  whichever point is more painful than the rest
When we focus on that as a starting point our investigation will spread to all other feelings because no matter where they arise they all become involved with the one mind
As soon as we investigate a feeling the mind and the feeling immediately fly toward each other and then we separate them out because the four foundations of mindfulness  contemplation of body feelings mind and mental events  are interrelated in this way
'External feelings' refer to physical feelings feelings of pleasure pain and neither pleasure nor pain in the various parts of the body
'Internal feelings' refer to the feelings of pain pleasure and neither pleasure nor pain in the heart
These are also counted as feelings that occur in the hearts of ordinary people everywhere
These three kinds of feelings Even when we're meditating and the mind enters into stillness it still has a feeling of pleasure
But ordinarily people usually have feelings of pain and discontent within the heart
If we don't investigate  for example if we've never practiced the Dhamma  these three feelings also exist but they're worldly feelings not the feelings connected with the Dhamma of those who practice meditation
When we practice and the mind is still and calm there is a feeling of pleasure
If the mind doesn't settle down and grow still as we want it to feelings of bodily and mental pain or distress arise
Sometimes the mind is vacant drifting indifferent something of the sort
You can't call it pleasure or pain
It's simply vacant and drifting  something like that  in the mind of the meditator
This doesn't mean vacant and drifting in the sense of someone completely oblivious
It's simply a state in the mind
This is called a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain
At present we aren't yet aware of these things  even now when they're very pronounced
We aren't yet aware because we don't yet have the discernment
When the mind becomes more refined then whatever appears whatever state arises we are bound to know and to know increasingly in line with the strength of our own mindfulness and discernment
Actually these things are the bosses lording it over the heart Okay for once let's call them what they are because that's what they've actually been all along
The heart is their vessel their seat
That's where they sit
Or you could say it's their toilet because that's where they defecate
Whichever one comes along it gets right up there on the heart
Now pain jumps up there and defecates
Now pleasure gets up there and defecates
Now a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain gets up there and defecates
They keep defecating like this and the heart is content to let them do this because it doesn't have the mindfulness or discernment to shake them off and not let them defecate
This is why we have to develop a great deal of mindfulness and discernment so that we can fight them off
Mindfulness is crucial
It has to keep track constantly because it's the supervisor of the work
No matter where discernment goes scrutinizing no matter what it thinks about mindfulness sticks right with it
Discernment contemplates and mindfulness follows right along with it
This is why it doesn't turn into sañña
As soon as we let mindfulness lapse discernment turns into sañña in accordance with the weakness of the mind just learning how to explore
But once we become more proficient in the areas of both mindfulness and discernment the two stick so close together that we can say that there's never a moment when the mind's attention lapses  except when we sleep at which time mindfulness and discernment don't have to work and even the defilements take a rest
Once we reach this level there is never a moment where the mind's attention lapses
This is thus called supermindfulness and superdiscernment
How could it lapse
It stays right with 'what knows ' at all times
Mindfulness and discernment exist together in this one mind and have become one and the same thing
So where could they lapse
Once mindfulness and discernment are continuous we can speak in this way
Before we were never able to know how much the mind scrambled stumbled and fell
But when we reach the level where these things become one and the same then as soon as there's a rippling in the mind we are right there up on it
Instantly
Instantly
Whatever gets thought we are progressively more and more up on it
And especially if it's a matter of defilement then mindfulness and discernment are extra quick
But if the mind is an ordinary mind it doesn't know
Even if defilements climb up and defecate on our head from dawn to dusk and from dusk to dawn we can't be aware of them
In the area of the practice we practice on our own and know on our own
That's when things become clear
Let's see right and wrong clearly within ourselves
Let's know things clearly within ourselves
Only then can we be certain
Once we have practiced and come to know we can be courageous in what we say and courageous within the heart with no fear that we might be speaking wrongly or venturing guesses
We are sure of ourselves from having practiced
To strip away the things that bind the heart has to be difficult
For those who are weakwilled it's especially difficult
There is no way they can succeed because they keep creating obstacles for themselves whenever they are about to develop goodness or break away the binding of unawareness and craving from around the heart
To break open the binding of the wheel of rebirth depends mainly on our being earnest and intent That's what will clear our way
This is why living beings don't want to touch that binding don't want to break it open
Our earnest intent is what will lead us to know exactly how extraordinary the things taught by the Buddha really are
When we have this kind of earnest intent toward the Dhamma filling the heart then no matter how difficult things become we won't let that difficulty bother us or become an obstacle
We want solely to know to see to understand
We feel motivated solely to think ponder and investigate in line with the aspects of the Dhamma we want to know and see
This has us engrossed day and night  engrossed in our desire to know and see engrossed in the results we obtain step by step engrossed in probing and cutting away the defilements and mental effluents
These lie nowhere but in the heart  except when the heart grabs hold of external things that are harmful and toxic and brings them inward to overpower itself to no purpose
The mind thus has to probe investigate remedy and slash away inside itself because these are the things that bind the heart
The heart is what makes itself unruly and reckless roaming about collecting these things to burn itself because it doesn't have the good sense to avoid them or remedy them
For this reason we need to develop a great deal of mindfulness and discernment
The Buddha was always teaching mindfulness and discernment
nisamma karanam seyyo
'Use discernment to consider before doing anything' in order to guard against error
Both in inner and outer activities mindfulness and discernment are always important
But usually when the mind thinks of doing anything we don't consider it first
Even if we don't consider things while we think of doing them we should at least consider them when the mind has made contact with one matter or another and trouble arises as a result
But usually we don't see the harm of our own recklessness and this is why we never learn
So we keep thinking and acting in our old ways repeatedly and the results are thus unceasing stress
We shouldn't guess we shouldn't anticipate what the practice will be like
Where is heaven
Don't guess about it
Where are the Brahma worlds
Don't waste your time anticipating
Where is stress
Its cause
Its cessation
The path
Don't anticipate their being anywhere outside the body and mind that are in contact with each other and with these various things at all times
Focus right here so as to see the truth in line with the principles of the Dhamma
You'll know what's outside you'll know what's inside
Especially when you know what's inside that's when you'll gain insight into everything that exists in line with your temperament and abilities without your anticipating it
The mind will simply know of its own accord
Your basic problem is that you don't yet know yourself inside and simply want to know what's outside
This will only make you agitated and confused without serving any purpose
If you want to gather matters into yourself so as to see the truth then What is hell
And where is it
If you want to know hell then go ahead
Where is it
Where is the suffering that the defilements dig up the suffering they produce in ascending stages
If it doesn't lie in the body and mind where does it lie
If when you let yourself fall into hell and the fires of hell burn you day and night you still don't know where hell is then where else are you going to look for it
Bring things inward in this way so as to know the truth the Noble Truths that lie within you
Once you know the Noble Truths you'll understand every pit in hell without having to ask anyone
Think of how much the Buddha and his Noble Disciples knew about hell  and yet who told them about it
How is it that they were able to know and see to the point of teaching us into the present
'Heaven' is the enjoyment the sense of exhilaration in the Dhamma in the goodness and merit that lie within the heart causing it to be calm and at peace
This is your 'heavenly treasure' The Brahma worlds lie with the levels of the mind
No matter which level of the Brahma worlds you want to reach they are all levels of the mind that indicate on their own that this mental state corresponds to this level or that and that have the characteristics of those levels
For this reason you have to put 'this one'  the mind  into good shape into proper shape
Don't go concerning yourself with anything other than this
Every day every night we should probe into our own minds together with the things that become involved with them
The important factors are the body  this is very important  and the five khandhas
These things are always making contact because they have been together with us since way back when
Things outside  sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations  sometimes subside but the five khandhas and the heart are always together and always at issue with one another
There is no one who can decide these issues and put an end to them unless we use mindfulness and discernment as our judges to make a decision that will put the case to rest
Normally rupa vedana sañña sankhara and viññana lie right with us with the heart
They are interconnected and interrelated to the point where no one can untangle the case and pass a verdict because we don't have the discernment to deliberate and decide what verdict to pass
So we simply let issues arise all the time 'That hurts
This aches
I'm afraid I'll faint
I'm afraid I'll die' We really are afraid  as if by fearing to the utmost straight to the heart we could somehow escape death
This fear of death We really fear it and yet we don't know what death is or who dies
As long as we haven't investigated down to the 'foundation of death' we'll have to fear it all the livelong day
But once we have investigated down to the foundation of death what is there to fear
 because nothing in the world dies
There is simply the change the exchange of the various elements and that's all
Change is something we already know
The Dhamma has taught us 'Inconstancy'  things are always changing
'Stress'  where is there if not right here
'Notself'  this already tells us  what is there of any substance that's 'us' or 'them'
The Dhamma tells us with every word every phrase and yet we prefer to fly in the face of the Dhamma
We want that to be us we want this to be ours
This wanting is an affair of defilement That's not us it's simply defilement from head to toe  or isn't it
If it were to become our self as we say it is wouldn't it be a heap as big as a mountain
If every defilement of every sort were to be gathered together who knows how many millions of mountains they'd be
We wouldn't be able to carry them at all
What we already have is more than we can handle
So we should investigate these things to see them clearly and then cut them away one mountain at a time
Otherwise we'll be unable to walk because we'll be full of the mountains of every person's every sort of defilement and of every sort of suffering that defilement has created to be borne on top of the heart for such a long long time
We should learn our lessons in line with what the Dhamma has taught us so that we will have some place to put down our burden of suffering
Feelings  these characters These are our enemies
All they offer us are feelings of pain or distress arising in the mind  sometimes on their own with no connection to the body
The body may be perfectly normal but because of our preoccupations feelings of pain can manage to arise in the mind
If we think of something that stabs at the heart a feeling of pain or distress arises
If we think in a way that will extricate us a feeling of pleasure arises
When the mind rests and stays neutral within itself that's a feeling of equanimity
See
We can clearly see them like this  if we reflect so as to see them
If we aren't observant if we don't investigate them we won't see them to our dying day
We will simply die in vain
Don't go thinking that we can gain knowledge and insight and free ourselves of suffering without making an effort to strive and investigate
Many many living beings have died in failure because of their complacency
In investigating don't set up any anticipations that you would like to have your different feelings disappear
That would only be increasing the cause of stress
Simply look inside the feeling itself when it arises
Use your mindfulness and discernment to contemplate without letup
Investigate until you understand
Sañña This is very important
Normally sañña is something very important
When pain arises the pain is important but pain doesn't arise all the time
As for sañña it keeps right on labeling
This is very important very subtle very delicate and refined
It's deceptive which is why it has us deceived
Sankhara is what hands things over to sañña which elaborates on them to the point where they become endless and unstoppable unless we use mindfulness and discernment to act as a block
Viññana is what takes note
As for sañña  labeling and interpreting  it has a big job to do running around stirring up all kinds of trouble throughout the body
Sañña is what hoodwinks the heart making it fall for labels until it can't see the harm they wreak in the five khandhas
Sañña is the primary culprit
Meditation circles are well aware of it which is why they warn us
When the mind has things like this burying it obstructing it and coercing it it can't display even the least little bit of ingenious strategy because they have it overpowered
For this reason we have to force the mind to investigate and unravel its various preoccupations so that it can see its way clear
Its various labels and interpretations are gradually peeled off or removed step by step
Mindfulness and discernment are then freed to think and develop more of their own strength
When we reach the stage where mindfulness and discernment come out to investigate nothing can stay hidden
Mindfulness and discernment will probe into everything into every nook and cranny understanding continually more and more  engrossed in their contemplations and explorations engrossed in the results that keep appearing  because to probe with discernment is a direct way of cutting defilement away so that we see results step by step without pause
Concentration is simply a tactic for herding the various defilements into one focal point so that we can rectify or destroy them more easily
To put it simply concentration is strength for discernment
When the mind gathers in the levels of concentration it is content to work from various angles in the area of mindfulness and discernment
When it's working the results of its work appear
The defilements fall away one after another
The heart becomes engrossed in the results of its work and investigates even more never having its fill like spring water flowing continually throughout the rainy season
So focus right here
Don't go anywhere else
The Noble Truths are right here in the body and heart
Ultimately they come down solely to the heart
Probe down into the heart
How is it that we don't know
Where did the Buddha know
He knew right here in the area of these four Noble Truths
He knew in the area of these four foundations of mindfulness which lie in the bodies and hearts of us all
The Buddha knew right here and he taught right here
So investigate to see clearly right here
Defilement the paths the fruitions and nibbana lie right here
Don't imagine them to be anywhere else
You'll simply be pouncing on shadows outside of yourself and grasping fistfuls of water without ever meeting with the real Dhamma
In focusing your investigation when a feeling arises in the mind  as for feelings in the body we've discussed them at great length already  when a feeling of stress or pain such as a mood of distress arises within the mind focus on that feeling of distress
Take that feeling of distress as the target of your watchfulness and investigation
Keep alert to it
Don't set up any desires for it to vanish once it has appeared in the mind
Make yourself aware that the feeling of distress arising in the mind has to have a cause
It can't just come floating in without a cause
If you don't know its cause focus on the result  the distress itself  as the heart's preoccupation
Keep aware right at the heart
Focus on contemplating and unraveling the feeling of distress right there
Don't let go of that feeling to go looking or investigating elsewhere
Otherwise you will make the mind waver without ever being able to establish a foothold and it will become shiftless and irresolute
However long that distress will have to last keep looking at it to see if it's really constant solid and lasting
Your mind is something more lasting than the feeling so why won't it be able to investigate it
The feeling arises only for a period and then vanishes when its time is up when it no longer has any supporting conditions
Since the mind by its nature is something that knows then even though a feeling of distress arises it still knows
Whether there is a little distress or a lot it knows  so why won't it be able to investigate the distress
It has to endure the distress because the mind is already a fighter and an endurer
So
However great or little the distress fix your attention on that spot
Don't set up any desires for it to disappear
Simply know the truth of the feeling as it arises and changes
Know right there and know its every phase heavy or light great or little until it finally disappears
And when the feeling of distress dissolves away from the heart through your focused investigation know what feeling arises in its place
Keep knowing step by step
Only then can you be called an investigator
Don't hold fast to any feelings  whether of pleasure or of equanimity
Know that they too are feelings and are individual conditions separate from the mind  and so they can change
This one comes in that one dissolves away this one takes its place They keep at it like this in line with the common nature of feelings because the seeds are constantly in the heart enabling these three kinds of feelings to appear
Once the mind has absolutely no more seeds of any sort no feelings or moods of any sort will appear in the mind at all aside from 'paramam sukham'  the ultimate ease that's part of the nature of a pure heart
This doesn't count as a feeling
When the Buddha says 'nibbanam paramam sukham'  nibbana is the ultimate ease  that's not a feeling of ease stress or equanimity and so it's not subject to arising and disappearing
When focusing your investigation on all three of these feelings take the feelings themselves as your battleground
Focus on watching them carefully and in full detail
Keep watching each one as long as it hasn't yet disappeared
Watch it again
Keep watching until you know its truth
Whether or not it disappears isn't important
What's important is that you know the truth of this feeling  the one appearing in the present
This is called contemplating feeling as a foundation of mindfulness
Usually this refers to feelings of distress or pain because these are the ones that are most striking and unsettling to the heart
As for feelings of pleasure they're a waystation for the mind
You could say that they help us or that they are the results that come from investigating feelings of distress until the distress disappears and pleasure appears
This is one of the results that comes from investigating feelings of distress or pain
As for whether or not we should do away with feelings of pleasure as far as I've noticed I've never seen them being eliminated
Feelings of pain or distress are the important ones within the mind
They arise from the seeds of defilement
Once these seeds are lessened step by step the feelings of mental pain become more and more refined more and more refined
They gradually fade away until they disappear without leaving a trace in the mind because the seeds are gone
When these seeds are gone that type of pleasurable feeling also disappears
It disappears because it relies on those seeds to arise
Thus we can say that the feelings of pleasure that arise in the heart from practice or from the basis of the mind  the stillness of the mind the radiance of the mind  qualify as 'viharadhamma' dwelling places for the mind waystations for the mind on its journey
Or we could say that they're the results that come from investigating feelings of pain
Whether or not we investigate this pleasure is not as important as investigating feelings of pain and their causes  which are very important because they are in a direct sense the origin of stress
They give rise to stress as their direct result
In the context of the four Noble Truths the Buddha teaches us to diagnose stress but why doesn't he teach us to diagnose pleasure
What does pleasure come from
He doesn't say  because it arises from the path doing its duty until the cause of stress disintegrates and pleasure arises in its stead
Now when the stress that's part and parcel of defilement disappears this type of pleasure disappears as well but another kind of pleasure or ease appears along with the heart that has been purified  and this doesn't disappear with anything at all
Now as for concentration When you're going to make the mind still you really have to make it stay with its theme of tranquillity meditation
Don't go concerning yourself with the topics you've been investigating because the mind has to rest
You can't not let it rest
When the time comes to rest it needs rest
No matter how great the results and accomplishments you get from your practice of investigation the heart can still grow tired and weary
Your work  your thinking and pondering in the area of discernment or whatever  is all work for the mind
When the mind has been thinking pondering and investigating for a long time it can grow weary and so it has to rest
When the time comes to rest you shouldn't involve yourself with any work at all
Set your mind solely on performing your duties for the sake of mental stillness
This is called working without overstepping your boundaries without being worried about what went before or will come after without overflowing your banks
The heart will then have the strength to continue its work with clear insight and discernment
When you want stillness of mind so as to provide strength for discernment you should set your mind on the theme that will make the mind still and then stick right with it until the mind is still right then and there
Once the mind has been still long enough to gain strength you can then withdraw from that stillness
Now you start probing
You don't have to concern yourself with stillness
Your duty is to investigate step by step
This is called the correct way  the appropriate way the uniform way  to follow the path of tranquillity and insight all the way to the goal
All of these are problems I've been through myself
When I would get engrossed in something I'd be so stuck that I'd get addicted and heedless
I'd get addicted to the stillness the sense of comfort and ease in concentration
When I'd get engrossed in investigating I'd be so engrossed that I'd forget myself and wouldn't let the mind rest at all
Neither of these ways is correct
In other words neither is in keeping with what is just right
The right way is that when the mind feels tired and weary from its work we have to let it rest in stillness
When the time comes to investigate we have to investigate
We can't worry about anything else
We have to set our mind on our duties step by step in keeping with the job at hand
This is always the appropriate way to proceed with tranquillity and insight
There is no job in the world bigger than the job of removing defilement of removing oneself from the cycle of wheeling around from birth to death for countless lifetimes
When we think about it it's really dismaying  circling around from birth to death carrying a load of nothing but suffering and stress
No matter what the level the only difference is that the stress is less or more because all levels have stress inasmuch as they contain the defilements that give rise to stress
So how can they not have stress
All living beings have to suffer stress
The Buddha thus taught us to rid ourselves of all defilement until there is nothing left hidden in the mind
Let there simply be the 'pure meat' Don't let there be any bones or they'll be bad for your health
Defilements no matter what the sort need to be cleansed away peeled away until nothing is left
This is why it's called a very big job
There are times when we have to give it our all  all our skill all our mindfulness and discernment even our life  to an extent that we will never forget
'So
If we're going to die then let's die
If not then let's know it' That's all there is
There can be nothing else
This is when the mind is its own mainstay
Atta hi attano natho It can take care of itself
In other words we leave it to the mind's own strength
When the mind is whirling in for the sake of the realm beyond suffering as if nibbana were always just coming into reach while what's behind us keeps pressing in and we realize more and more its danger and harm there's only one way to escape the Great Danger
'If we're going to die then let's die
If not then let's know the Dhamma' Wherever we are we don't want to stay
Wherever we're stuck we don't want to be stuck
It's a waste of our time in gaining release from suffering
We've simply got to reach release from suffering
This is the only thing that can satisfy such a mind at such times
When the mind is this way where is it going to find any weakness or laziness
If things get tough we fight
If they're easy we fight
If we're going to die we still fight until we have no more breath to breathe  and that's when the mind finally stays put
It can't possibly be moved
Once it knows and reaches the goal it stays put on its own
No matter where you chase it it won't go
Discernment  which has been spinning itself in circles even more than a wheel  when the time comes stops on its own
It simply runs out of duties of its own accord without our having to turn it off the way we do with motors
This automatic mindfulness and discernment simply stops or turns off on its own  because it already knows so what else is there to investigate
It has already let go so what else is there to let go
It already knows so what else is there to know
It has had enough so where else is it going to look for enough
It knows all of this within itself
It knows in an instant and is released
In other words it knows for the last time
This is where the big job is finished
The job is big and the results are enormous
Nothing in any of the three worlds can compare
The results of this big job this heavy job you know excel the world  and how could we say that ultimate ease doesn't excel the world
When excellence stands out filling the heart it's far different from defilement standing out filling the heart
Whoever wants to know has to practice for him or herself
No one else can do it for us
When we reach the level of excellence we excel exclusively within without disturbing anyone else
This Dhamma is always timeless
It has been the guarantor of the paths fruitions and nibbana from the time of the Buddha to the present
No one will ever be able to erase it
The Buddha excelled the world because of this Dhamma
The arahant disciples whom we revere as our refuge all excelled because of this Dhamma of purity  and because of this heavy job
When our Teacher has led us to proceed in this way what business do we have shillyshallying around
We can't act only in line with our preferences because our Teacher didn't lead us in that way
Our foremost Teacher was a genius an utterly genuine person unequaled by anyone
But we're a bunch of showoffs doing only what our Teacher criticized and so we keep meeting only with things worth criticizing
Don't we ever think of changing or do we feel we're being stylish and uptodate
Actually the path to cure defilement has to be difficult
The path to accumulate defilement is easy  because our preferences fool us into thinking it's easy
Actually both paths are hard
Whatever the job the important point is which job we prefer
We'll see that job as easy
Light
Comfortable
At first when we were starting out with the job of curing defilement we weren't getting anywhere at all
Even though we were set on curing defilement the work was heavy and we were weak and lazy
Everything bad and worthless was gathered right there
But now that we gradually come to comprehend causes and effects and to understand the Dhamma the results have begun to appear
Where has our laziness gone
All that's left is diligence and persistence
We can contend with anything heavy or light  we can contend with death  because we have begun seeing results
Even though we have been curing defilement all along the difference is that at one stage we don't see results and at another we do  and persistence really arises
So
If things get heavy we fight
We're disciples of the Tathagata and so we have to follow in our Teacher's footsteps
Our Teacher met with difficulties so his disciples will have to meet with difficulties
Our Teacher passed out two or three times
Is there anyone among us who has passed out from the effort of the practice
I don't see anyone who has
So why are we afraid of dying when we've never even passed out
How can we be so stubborn in our fear of death
The Lord Buddha lost consciousness three or four times
What do we have to say to that
When we lose consciousness it's because we are falling asleep
Why aren't we afraid of dying then
So why are we afraid of dying when we practice meditation
Exactly what dies
When we have explored and seen the truth we won't fear death  because nothing in the world dies
All there is is the mind making its assumptions
It deceives itself  'I'm afraid of dying I'm afraid of dying'  but when it knows the truth of everything of every sort it's not afraid
It's not afraid of death
It's not afraid of birth  because it has nothing left to be born
So what is there to fear
Why bother with these empty hollow fears
The mind is now released from birth so why be afraid of birth
There are no more seeds for the birth of a body a man or a woman
There is nothing to fear nothing to be brave about
The mind is even with itself  uniform unchanging  not 'even' in the ordinary sense of 'coming out even' It's 'even' in the sense of a mind that has reached sufficiency 'even' in its excellence
Here I've been talking about a heavy task but also about the results as a means of encouragement as a means of giving the mind something to hold to
The results are superlative in keeping with the difficulties and hardships of the practice
What do we want in our lives
We all want what is good
Even in external things we want what is good so especially in the area of the Dhamma why shouldn't we want what is good
Then step up your efforts
What does it matter if the cemeteries cry because they miss you
You have been crying over the cemeteries so what's wrong with letting the cemeteries cry in turn
They have no more hopes now
You aren't coming back to be born or die
The cemeteries' being without hope is better than your being without hope because there's nothing good about birth and death circling around back and forth with nothing but suffering and stress every lifetime
So work out solutions  and make them succeed
Whatever things are thorns in the heart use mindfulness and discernment to explore to probe on down and remove them completely so that they're all gone
Once they're all gone that's the result of your work
We've talked about how hard the work is What are the results like
Are they worth it
Find out for yourself  and then you are free to live wherever you like
The Buddha says
vusitam brahmacariyam
'The holy life is fulfilled the task of the religion is done' This is now completely apparent in every way
Whatever is stressful is a matter of defilement
When the cause  defilement  is ended the result  stress  is ended as well
That's all there is
From then on there is nothing but ultimate ease which nothing will ever again come to disturb throughout eternity
Wherever there's the religion it's cool and peaceful
Wherever a person practicing the religion is lacking it's hot and troubled
If there's no religion the heart is as hot as fire
Whenever there's the religion  mindfulness and discernment  investigating looking after the heart the heart is cool
When we first begin suppressing the rebels in the heart we suffer  because for the most part we're defeated by them  but at least we still have the strength to fight with them
Even though we may lose out to them sometimes it's better than groveling before them in abject surrender with no way of putting up a fight at all
The practice in the area of the mind falls into stages  and there are bound to be stages where it's complicated and difficult
Especially at the beginning It's difficult in that we can't see beginnings or ends causes or effects
We don't understand anything at all
When we take the rudiments of Dhamma we have gained from the texts or our teachers and put them into practice sometimes right sometimes wrong this is when it's very difficult
The desire to know and see is very strong but the heart isn't willing to comply
This is one kind of anxiety I've been through myself
It overflowed the heart
To put it simply it was as if the desire to see and know the Dhamma in the heart was ready to overflow its banks
But when practicing the heart didn't comply with the desire to know and see  and that had me upset and disappointed
Sometimes I'd be sitting and the tears would flow because of my selfrecriminations 'You don't have any potential to speak of
You've ordained simply to be a dead weight on the religion
Here you are sitting in meditation and can't find a way in or a way out
You're just sitting buried in a heap of suffering' The mind would think in all sorts of ways out of selfpity  that I was a hopeless case that I didn't have any potential to speak of didn't have the potential for the extraordinary levels of Dhamma didn't have any potential at all  total confusion
Actually my practice wasn't yet right
I was aiming at the results  the income  without paying attention to whether I was doing the work right or wrong
The desire was strong but when it wasn't fulfilled it caused suffering
Had I paid some attention to whether my practice was right or wrong I might have come to my senses enough to have evaluated things to have abandoned some of my bullheaded attachments or to have cut back on my desires so that the suffering would have become lighter
But whenever I'd meditate whatever I'd focus on all I wanted was to know and see the paths the fruitions and nibbana in line with what I imagined them to be  heaven was like this the Brahma worlds were like that nibbana was like this
I'd imagine
Speculate
The desire was fierce
I wanted to know to see to gain release from suffering but my practice wasn't making any headway
All there was was simple desire I would simply sit wanting lie down wanting walk wanting stand wanting
I'd sit in meditation  wanting  but the mind wasn't working at its meditation
It just wanted
I'd be doing walking meditation but the mind simply wanted  so much so that I'd forget what I was doing
I wasn't getting any results because there weren't enough of the causes that would bring about the things I aimed for so how could I have reached the goal I aimed for
This is something I've been through
The work of meditation struck me as being more difficult than any other work
I'd be meditating 'buddho buddho buddho' but the desire would always be getting in the way  because I wanted to know I wanted the mind to be like this or that and so I'd get engrossed in my desires and forget my work of meditation until I didn't know where 'buddho' had gone
As a result I didn't get anywhere at all
I was constantly feeling dreary and disappointed
This is the way things always were in the heart
But even so this wasn't anything compared to the stage at which the mind regressed
When the mind regresses it's really upsetting because you used to see results
You used to gain a sense of ease mental stillness and peace appearing clearly as a solid foundation in the heart but now it's deteriorated
This makes the heart really agitated  so much so that there is nothing to hold it in check
Luckily though in spite of my agitation I didn't retreat
I was simply determined to see things through
I wasn't willing to retreat or to slacken my efforts
The reason why the mind regressed and couldn't make a comeback was the same sort of thing desire nothing mysterious
The mind wanted to know and see as it had before but its work wasn't coordinated or continuous
All there was was desire
No matter how much you desire it doesn't give any results because that would go against the principle of causality
If you don't make the causes as complete as they should be how can you expect to know as you want
You can't
Sitting I'd be agitated
Lying down I'd be agitated
I'd go into the forest into the mountains when the mind had regressed and nothing was any good at all
I couldn't figure it out
Of the anxieties I've felt in my life as a monk the anxiety I felt during that period was the worst
I was agitated because of my desire to attain
I was upset because the mind had regressed and nothing I could do would bring it back
At first it had regressed just a little bit and then it kept regressing regressing until it was all gone
Nothing was left not one red cent
It was as if I had never meditated at all
When I'd sit in this state I was as agitated as if I were on fire  because of the desire
The disappointment that my attainments had floated away and disappeared plus the desire to get them back These two things came thronging in at the same time and so were really strong
Wherever I stayed was unsatisfactory and no help at all
Even though I was suffering I would simply keep suffering
I didn't know any way out
Even though I wanted I would simply keep wanting
I didn't know how to get my concentration back
All there was was desire  regret for the things that had once appeared to my surprise and amazement but now were gone
There was nothing but disappointment filling the heart nothing but simple desire and it couldn't bring back the Dhamma that had disappeared
Finally I came to feel despair  for everything
This was when the mind gave up on its desire
As for the results I had wanted well I had wanted them for a long time
As for the suffering I had suffered immensely because of the desires but hadn't gained anything from them
So now I wouldn't have anything to do with them
I'd throw them all out
If I was going to know I'd know
If not so be it
All I was after was 'buddho' Whatever the mind was going to think I wouldn't be willing to let mindfulness lapse
'Get with it then
Can it really be that I'm not going to know
Whatever's going to happen I'm ready for it'
As soon as I gave up on my desires they were no longer so fierce and so the suffering gradually lessened
I set my mind on my work
Wherever I was I'd keep repeating 'buddho buddho buddho' It had always been a trait with me to be earnest Whatever I'd do I would really do it and wouldn't just play around
Now I got to see this trait in action
I didn't let up in my repetition of 'buddho' Whether walking or doing my chores I wouldn't be willing to let it lapse
I'd keep making the effort
While sweeping the monastery compound I would try to keep up my guard  until the mind let its work lapse for a moment
I was alert to the fact and the mind got right back to work
'There
Now that's the way it should be'
After giving up its desires the mind was no longer involved with the past
It stayed in the circle of the present and would do nothing but repeat or meditate on 'buddho' Whether or not it would get any results would depend on what 'buddho' would grant
Finally the mind became still and 'buddho' was no longer necessary so I could let go of the meditation word at that moment  and at that point the mind was willing to settle down
Before it hadn't been willing
When the mind had settled down in stillness there was no need to repeat the word 'buddho' All that remained was simple awareness  clear and conspicuous  so the mind stayed with that simple awareness
As soon as it withdrew I would start pumping 'buddho' back in
I had no hopes because I had already hoped in the past
I had no hopes for what would happen no hopes for what the results would be
I had already hoped in the past and it hadn't given me any decent results at all
I had seen the harm of hopes  the sort of hollow unreasonable hopes that won't do the work and look only for the results
So now I was going to do nothing but work nothing but work repeating 'buddho' without letting up even for a moment
Once the mind had received proper nourishment and care it became still  gradually more and more still more and more steady until it reached the level it had been before it had visibly regressed
What was strange was that when it reached its old level I still abandoned my hopes
'If it's going to regress let it regress
I've had enough of trying to resist it by using desire which hasn't served any purpose not the least little bit
So however the mind is going to regress let it regress but I won't abandon buddho I'm always going to keep at it'
When it reached the day when it would normally regress it didn't regress
That made me a lot more sure of the causes
So I stepped up the causes  the repetition of 'buddho'  even more without stopping
I would stop only when the mind gathered in stillness
The mind became progressively more and more firm
Wherever I'd sit it would be bright
Light
Completely clear
I was sure of myself 'Now it's not going to regress' After one day two days one month two months it still didn't regress
Before the mind would regress after two or three days
After two or three days it would come down with a crash with nothing left to show for itself
I'd have to keep trying to care for it for or days before it would reach its old level and once it got there it would stay just a day or two and then collapse in a flash with nothing left at all
All that was left was dreariness and disappointment
Now 'If it's going to regress let it regress
I've hoped in the past and it hasn't served any purpose
All I'm after is this just this one thing buddho'
From then on the mind kept progressing
Month after month it became more and more stable more and more firm
As for my meditation word I wasn't willing to let up on it
This kept up until the mind was always prominent
That was when I let the meditation word go
In other words the awareness of the mind was pronounced and that was enough for the mind to depend on so there was no need to rely on any meditation word for further support
The mind fully knew itself and could sustain itself
At this point I didn't have to repeat any meditation word because the mind was prominent at all times
I would focus right there
Wherever I went I focused right there
I knew right there just as I had focused on 'buddho' It could form a fine foundation for the mind
I was sure of myself that
This foundation had become progressively more and more stable until it was more stable than it had been the first time it had progressed and then regressed
As for focusing on awareness when awareness was fully pronounced I should focus on that without letup in the same way I had focused on repeating 'buddho' until the mind became more and more refined
This was a foundation for the mind on which I could depend
From that point on I really stepped up my efforts
The time I started sitting in meditation all night until dawn came from this point
I started to sit one night focusing on in focusing on in and at first the mind had settled down because it was used to settling down
It settled down easily because it 'had a good foundation' I kept focusing on in and as long as no enormous pains arose the meditation went quietly
But when I withdrew a number of hours had passed and a huge pain arose to the point where I almost couldn't bear it
The mind that had been quiet was totally overturned
Its 'good foundation' had collapsed completely
All that was left was pain filling the body  but the mind wasn't agitated
Strange
The body was so pained that it was quivering all over
This was the beginning of the handtohand combat in which I was to obtain an important approach  when really severe pain arose unexpectedly that night
I hadn't yet made up my mind to sit until dawn you know
I hadn't made any resolutions or anything at all
I was simply sitting in meditation as usual as usual but when the pain arose in full force 'Eh
What's going on here
I'll have to tackle this feeling so as to see results tonight' So I made a resolution in that very moment 'Okay if the time doesn't come to get up I won't get up
I'll fight until the dawn of the new day
Tonight for once I'm going to investigate pain so as to understand it clearly and distinctly
If I don't understand it then even if I die let me die
Let me find out
So dig down' This is when discernment really began to work in earnest
I had never known never imagined never dreamed that discernment would become so sharp when it was at the end of its rope when it was really cornered with no way out
Discernment really started spinning away
It went out digging exploring fighting determined not to withdraw its troops in retreat
When I was at the end of my rope discernment arose
This made me realize 'We human beings aren't fated to be stupid forever
When we're at the end of our rope we're sure to manage to find a way to help ourselves' So it was then When I was cornered overwhelmed by severe pain mindfulness and discernment probed into the pain
When pain arises in full force like this it fills the entire body
At first it started in hot flashes along the backs of my hands and feet which wasn't much to speak of but then when it really flared up into something big the entire body was ablaze
All the bones as they were connected were fuel feeding the fire in every part of the body
It was as if the body were going to fall apart right then and there
The neck bones were going to come apart
Every bone was going to come apart from its connections
My head was going to fall off and hit the floor
When it's pained everything is on a par throughout the body
You don't know where to hold it back enough so that you can breathe because everywhere there's nothing but a mass of fire  pain in full force
When I couldn't find a safe spot in which to place the mind mindfulness and discernment dug down into the pain searching for the spot where the pain was greatest
Wherever the pain was greatest mindfulness and discernment would investigate and explore right there by ferreting out the pain so as to see clearly 'Where does this feeling come from
Who is pained' When they asked each part of the body each of them remained in keeping with its nature
The skin was skin the flesh was flesh the tendons were tendons and so forth
They had been that way from the day of birth but they hadn't been painful all along from the day of birth in the same way that they had been flesh and skin from the day of birth
'The pain has been arising and vanishing at intervals
It hasn't been lasting like these parts of the body'
I focused on down
'Each part of the body that's a physical form is a reality
Whatever is a reality stays that way
Right now where is the feeling arising
If we say that all these things are painful why is there one point where it's really severe' So I separated things out
At this point mindfulness and discernment couldn't slip away anywhere else
They had to run along the areas that hurt whirling around themselves separating the feeling from the body observing the body observing the feeling and observing the mind These three are the important principles
The mind seemed comfortable
No matter how much pain was arising the mind wasn't writhing or suffering or anything
But the pain in the body was clearly very strong
The nature of pain and of whatever defilements we have is that they join together
Otherwise the mind won't be troubled or affected by the physical pain that's really severe at that moment
So discernment kept digging down until the body the feeling and the mind were all clear each in line with its individual truth
The mind was what labeled the feeling as being this or that This I could see clearly
As soon as this was really clear in this way the feeling disappeared in a flash
At that moment the body was simply the body in line with its reality
The feeling was simply a feeling and it disappeared in a flash into the mind
It didn't go anywhere else
As soon as the feeling disappeared into the mind the mind knew that the pain had vanished
The pain had vanished as if it had been snapped off and thrown away
In addition the body disappeared from my sense of awareness
At that moment the body didn't exist in my awareness at all
All that was left was simple awareness because there was only one thing  awareness  and it was simply aware
That's all
The mind was so refined that you could hardly describe it
It simply knew because it was extremely delicate and refined within itself
The body had completely disappeared
Feelings had disappeared
No physical feelings were left at all
The body sitting right there in meditation had disappeared from my awareness
All that was left was 'simple knowingness' without any thoughts being fashioned about this or that
At that point the mind wasn't forming any thoughts at all
When it doesn't form thoughts we say that nothing at all makes the slightest move
The mind is fixed  firmly fixed in its own solitude
It's a mind in its simple form on the level of a mind centered in stillness  but mind you this doesn't mean that there was no unawareness
Unawareness had infiltrated right there because the mind hadn't withdrawn from unawareness
The mind and unawareness were quiet together because unawareness didn't get out to work
When discernment has it surrounded unawareness shrinks in and hides out quiet in the heart like the sediment in the bottom of a water jar
At that point I began to feel amazed
There was no pain left
The body had disappeared
Only one thing hadn't disappeared an awareness so refined I couldn't describe it
It simply appeared there
You couldn't say anything else about it
The thing that simply appeared there That was the great marvel at that moment
There was no motion in the heart no rippling nothing of anything at all
It stayed fixed and still like that until enough time had elapsed and then it moved
The mind began to withdraw and rippled  blip  and then was quiet
This rippling happens on its own you know
We can't intend it
If we intend it the mind withdraws
What happens is that the mind has had enough of its own accord
When it ripples in a 'blip' like this it's aware of the fact
As soon as the 'blip' appears it vanishes
After a moment it ripples  blip  again and disappears in the same instant
Then the rippling gradually becomes more and more frequent
When the mind withdraws after having fully settled down to its foundation it doesn't withdraw all at once
I could clearly see this at that moment
The mind rippled slightly A sankhara formed in a 'blip' and then disappeared before it had amounted to anything at all
It rippled  blip  and disappeared right then and there
After a moment it rippled  blip  again
Gradually it became more and more frequent until finally I came back to ordinary consciousness to the ordinary level of the mind
I was aware of the body but the pain was still gone
When the mind came back out there was still no pain
It was still quiet until time came for the pain to reappear
This is where I got my standard and my certainty
I realized that I had arrived at a basic principle in contending with pain 'So this is how it is
Pain is actually something separate
The body is separate
The mind is separate but because of one thing  delusion  all three converge into one and the whole mind becomes delusion the whole mind is the one deluded
Even though pain may simply arise in line with its own nature if we grab hold of it to burn ourselves it's hot  because our labeling makes it hot'
After a fair while the pain returned so I had to tackle it again without retreating
I had to dig on down exploring again as I had explored before but this time I couldn't use the tactics I had used in investigating and remedying the pain the last time around
I needed fresh tactics newly devised by mindfulness and discernment so as to keep up with events
It was pain just the same but the tactics simply had to be pertinent to the moment
I couldn't remedy matters by holding to the old tactics I had used to investigate and know in the past
They had to be fresh hot tactics devised in the present to cure the present
The mind then settled down firmly in stillness as it had done before
In that first night the mind settled down three times but I had to go through three bouts of handtohand combat
After the third time dawn came  the end of the final showdown using reason with real mindfulness and discernment
The mind was audacious exultant and had no fear of death
'However great the pain may be that's its own ordinary business
As long as we don't enter in and load ourselves down with it pain has no significance in the heart' The mind knew clearly that the body has no significance in terms of itself in terms of the feeling or in terms of us  unless the mind gives it a significance and then gathers in the suffering to burn itself
There's nothing else that can come in and make the mind suffer
Getting up that morning I felt audacious in an extraordinary way
I wanted to tell Venerable Acariya Mun of my knowledge and capabilities
This was because I felt daring in a way hard to describe
How was it that things could be so marvelous like this in a way I had never encountered before
Ever since I had begun meditating nothing like this had ever happened
The mind had completely cut off all connection with any objects and had gathered within itself with real courage
It had gathered by investigating all around itself which was why it had calmed itself inwardly like a thoroughbred
When it withdrew it was still full of courage with no fear of death at all owing to its conviction that 'I investigated like this and this when pain arose
The next time it comes I won't fear it because it's the same old pain
It's pain with the same old face
The body is the same old body
Discernment is the same old discernment we've used before' For this reason the heart felt no fear of death  so much so that it felt all sorts of things hard to describe
To put it in worldly terms it was like defying someone right to his face with no fear of pain or death
See
When the mind is bold it's bold all the way
Daring all the way
It fights without retreating
'Okay I'll take you on' To put it simply and frankly that's just how it feels
When the time comes to die 'Okay I'll take you on' The mind doesn't retreat
'When the time comes to die where will death find any pain for us greater than this
There's no such thing
The only pain is the pain in the khandhas
It can be great or small but we know it here in the khandhas
No matter how much or how heavy the pain may be it can't outstrip our knowledge and capabilities
It can't outstrip our mindfulness and discernment
Mindfulness and discernment are capable of keeping track of it all as they have already known and removed it in the past' This is what made me feel really bold
When the time would come to die I didn't see that there would be any problem with mindfulness and discernment all around me like this
If the time came to die then let me die
Birth and death come in a pair
You can't separate death from birth so as not to die because they are equal truths
The next time around I took on the pain again and knew in the same way
I kept on knowing in the same way and winning every time
Once I had given it all my strength in that way there was never a day in which I'd say 'Last night I stayed up in meditation all night until dawn and didn't get anything out of it' But any night in which the mind had difficulty investigating and settling down I would come out feeling battered all over my body
I'd be all stiff and sore
But as for getting tactics and strength of mind I'd get them every time until I no longer had any fear of death at all  and where would I get any fear
Death was something ordinary
In other words discernment had analyzed down to 'What dies' Hair nails teeth skin flesh bones They're simply their original element  solidity the earth element
Since when did the earth element ever die
When they disintegrate what do they become
If we focus on down we see that they return to their original properties
The water element returns to its original property
The wind and fire elements simply return to their own original properties
Nothing is annihilated
The elements have simply come together in a lump and the mind comes in and animates it  this superdeluded one comes in and animates it that's all  and then carries the entire burden 'This is my self' It lays its claims 'This is me
This is mine' And so it rakes in every kind of suffering as if contracting for the whole mass using those assumptions simply to burn itself and nothing else
The mind itself is the culprit
The five khandhas aren't the culprits
They aren't our enemies or anything
They simply have their own reality but we make assumptions and carry then as a burden
This is why there's suffering and stress
We manufacture it ourselves
These things don't manufacture it for us
'There is nothing that comes and gives us suffering' This is how the mind came to understand things
We are the ones who misconstrue things
We are the ones who suffer because we misconstrue things
This produces suffering to burn and trouble the heart
I could clearly see that nothing dies
The mind doesn't die
It becomes more pronounced
When we fully investigate the four elements  earth water wind and fire  down to their original properties the mind becomes even more pronounced and clear
So where is there any death
What dies
None of these conditions die
The four elements  earth water wind and fire They don't die
And as for the mind how can it die
It becomes more aware
More pronounced
More conspicuous
This doesn't die so why does it fear death
We've been fooled all along fooled for aeons and aeons for actually nothing dies
Now the word 'fooled' doesn't mean that anyone intended to fool us
We've been fooled simply because of our own delusion  fooled into fearing death
Now we see This is how the world fears death  from not having explored down to its truth from not knowing what dies
Because look Nothing dies
Each thing simply has its separate reality
I saw this clearly
The mind proclaimed itself by its very nature
I saw its marvelousness clearly every time
Even when the pain was as hot as fire in the body and seemed ready to reach the clouds it would vanish clear away with nothing left due to the power of mindfulness and discernment even the body would vanish from my sense of consciousness and wouldn't appear at all
When everything disbanded completely as the result of my investigation all that remained was simple awareness as if floating in midspace
It was completely empty but the awareness knew clearly
There was only one thing
There was only one strange thing in the world the heart
Earth water wind and fire made no contact with the heart
The heart thus had no sense of earth water wind fire or any part of the body
All that remained was a solitary awareness an awareness not involved with anything at all  an amazing awareness coming from having investigated things with circumspection and then having withdrawn from them
Clear
Outstanding
Astounding
Once the mind can be settled down like this  for no matter how many days or nights it may last  it has no sense of pain that the body will fall apart that it hurts here or aches there no sense of any of this at all
And what would give it any sense of this
Time and place don't exist in that mental state
This called to mind how the Buddhas Pacceka Buddhas and arahant disciples could enter the cessation of feeling and perception for seven days at a time
They could enter for as many days as they liked
If their minds settled down like this to the extent of not being involved with anything at all leaving just plain awareness without any involvement with time or place then they could sit for aeons if they liked
Even if the body couldn't endure if it were to break apart it would simply do so without having any impact on this nature at all
This was when my mind accepted  really believed in  the ability of those extraordinary people who enter the cessation of feeling and perception for soandso many days
If their minds reached this level without withdrawing back out to anything outside then for days or months they wouldn't have any perception of anything at all
Where would there be pain and pleasure in their bodies
There wouldn't be any at all
They wouldn't have any sense of the body
They wouldn't have any awareness of feelings
All that would remain would be plain awareness
They could sit for aeons if they liked as long as the mind was like this
This made me believe in the stories of the Pacceka Buddhas who entered the cessation of feeling and perception
So I took this as a confirmation in my mind
Whoever says I'm crazy can go ahead and say so
They have mouths we have ears
If we want to listen we can
If we don't we can keep still
We are all free to have our opinions on this matter and that
No one has a monopoly on knowing and seeing
Even though I didn't sit for a long time the state of mind that had grown still to that extent for a spell of time was enough to serve as confirmation of those who entered the cessation of feeling and perception for long periods of time because it had the same characteristics not involved with anything at all
The body would simply be a body
If it were to fall apart if it couldn't last  after all the body is inconstant stressful and notself  then it would simply fall apart without the mind's being aware
This is a level attained through mindfulness and discernment
It's a level where discernment fosters concentration
The mind reaches the full extent of concentration like this because discernment has fully investigated down to causes and effects
It then gathers with courage and great refinement
Ordinarily when the mind filled with just the power of concentration focuses and settles down it is simply unmoving and nothing else
It isn't as profound and refined as this
But the mind stilled through the power of discernment is refined each time
Once we have gone through handtohand combat in this way to the point where we get results the mind has to be absolutely quiet just like this
This was the basis or the starting capital for my courage the primary seed for my firm conviction in the affairs of the mind
No matter how much anything else might be annihilated this knowing nature would not be annihilated
I could see this clearly
I saw it clearly at the point when nothing else was involved in my sense of awareness
There was simply that single awareness and so it was very pronounced
I couldn't really say whether this was on the level of concentration or of discernment
When the mind actually was that way that's how it was
From that point on I kept at it
I kept investigating out in the area of discernment ranging out widely then circling back in again
As soon as I would understand step by step the mind would let go and circle inward in an evernarrowing sphere investigating the khandhas and elements separating the khandhas and elements
This is where it began to be 'samucchedapahana'  absolute relinquishment arising from the investigation in the period that followed
As long as the investigation hadn't been absolute it would win out for only a period of time just enough to serve as evidence and proof
It still wasn't absolute relinquishment
But when discernment came to a really clear understanding while investigating then it pulled out and severed all ties step by step  severed things so that there were no connections left severed them step by step leaving just plain awareness
The body was severed from attachment
Vedana sañña sankhara and viññana were severed from attachment
Or you could say that the 'heart' was severed from 'them' Things kept being severed until only awareness was left  in other words the mind with unawareness buried inside it
So I probed on in smashed things to bits slashed them to smithereens with uptotheminute mindfulness and discernment
The mind of unawareness broke apart and when the mind of unawareness broke apart that was all
That was when I came to know that all of the marvels I have mentioned here were simply an affair of unawareness
They had simply been a support a waystation a seed that had produced conviction step by step but after that  if you were to say they were good they were good but if you're aiming at the subtle Dhamma this goodness is the goodness of unawareness
It's not genuine goodness not pure goodness
It's goodness mixed with evil with suffering and stress because stress still has a chance to arise
We have to keep slashing in slashing in until everything is smithereens in the heart
Whatever is a seed of anything counterfeit in the heart wash it away scrub it away until nothing is left and that's all
The entire mind that is assumed to be 'this' or 'that' is all gone
This is where the mind reaches absolute purity where it reaches complete freedom from all conventional realities
That's really 'all'
It's astounding
If it weren't astounding it wouldn't be release from stress
This is a Dhamma apart  a Dhamma beyond conventions
Whether what I've described here is difficult or not consider it for yourselves
Sometimes I'd feel ready to pass out
Sometimes I'd feel as if the entire body were on fire
When the pain was really fierce it seemed to fill the entire body
But ultimately I was able to pass through these things to resolve them using mindfulness and discernment
So if we put them to use mindfulness and discernment are never at the end of their rope
We human beings aren't fated always to be stupid you know
When we come to the end of our rope we're sure to be able to save ourselves
Who should be willing to go under when we have the mindfulness and discernment to remedy things or when there's an opening through which we can escape through which we can force our way out
Who would willingly be buried to death
We can't help but manage to find a way out
When the pain is so piled on that we can't see any way to cure it other than using mindfulness and discernment to explore and find a way out discernment doesn't depend on this person or that
When the time comes for the mind to investigate when it's cornered it gathers its forces and manages to save itself
The Buddha thus taught us to live in 'crucial' places  places where we're cornered at the end of our rope  where we live simply so that mindfulness and discernment can work full steam ahead and see their own capabilities rather than simply waiting for help from others
Time and place can help give rise to mindfulness and discernment
If we live in a scary place mindfulness is strong
Discernment is sharp
Whatever we investigate they are adroit and audacious
If we live in a comfortable place we get lazy
We eat a lot and sleep a lot
This is the way it is with the mind
If we live in ordinary circumstances we're very lazy very inert very apathetic and listless
If we live in places that aren't scary we become heedless and revert to being complacent to sleeping like pigs
If we live in a scary place we're always alert
When we're alert we're always selfaware because alertness is what it means to be mindful
Mindfulness appears within us always selfaware always engaged in persistent effort
Whatever makes contact we understand because we're not complacent because we're always alert
This is why we're taught to live in whatever places are appropriate because they can give good encouragement or support to our persistent effort
If we have comfortable huts in which to live  as we have here  everything cares for our every need
Food overflows our bowls
We're flooded day and night with fruit juice soft drinks cocoa and coffee
