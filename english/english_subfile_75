Then at that time those yogis who wanted to tend the sacred fires
were not able to chop the firewood
Then this occurred to those yogis
No doubt it is because of the Great Ascetics psychic power
that we are not able to chop the firewood
Then the Fortunate One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Let the firewood be chopped
Let it be chopped Great Ascetic
and more than five hundred pieces of firewood were chopped
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
since on his say so firewood can be chopped
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then at that time those yogis who wanted to tend the sacred fires
were not able to light the fires
Then this occurred to those yogis
No doubt it is because of the Great Ascetics psychic power
that we are not able to light the sacred fires
Then the Fortunate One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Let the sacred fires be lit Kassapa
Let them be lit Great Ascetic
and more than five hundred sacred fires were lit
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
since on his say so sacred fires can be lit
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then at that time those yogis after tending the sacred fires
were not able to put the sacred fires out
Then this occurred to those yogis
No doubt it is because of the Great Ascetics psychic power
that we are not able to put out the sacred fires
Then the Fortunate One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Let the sacred fires be put out Kassapa
Let them be put out Great Ascetic
and more than five hundred sacred fires were put out
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
since on his say so sacred fires can be put out
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then at that time monks from various districts from various states
were bringing those seeking the goingforth and seeking the full ordination thinking
The Fortunate One will give these the goingforth will give them full ordination
and therefore the monks became tired as did also those seeking the goingforth and seeking the full ordination
Then when the Fortunate One had gone into solitude into seclusion
this reflection arose in his mind
Now monks from various districts from various states
bring those seeking the goingforth and seeking the full ordination thinking
The Fortunate One will give these the goingforth will give them full ordination
and therefore the monks become tired as do also those seeking the goingforth and seeking the full ordination
What if I were to give permission to the monks saying
Now you monks in whatever district in whatever state
may give the goingforth may give the full ordination'
Then the Fortunate One having risen from seclusion in the evening time
for this cause for this reason after assembling the Community of monks
and giving them a talk on Dhamma addressed the monks saying
Here monks having gone into solitude into seclusion
this reflection arose in my mind
Now monks from various districts from various states
bring those seeking the goingforth and seeking the full ordination thinking
The Fortunate One will give these the goingforth will give them full ordination
and therefore the monks became tired as also do those seeking the goingforth and seeking the full ordination
What if I were to give permission to the monks saying
Now you monks in whatever district in whatever state
may give the goingforth may give the full ordination
Now I give permission to you monks in whatever district in whatever state
you may give the goingforth may give the full ordination
And in this way monks you should give the goingforth should give the full ordination
first after making them shave off hair and beard don brown garments
arrange the upper robe on one shoulder worship the monks feet
sit on their heels and holding their hands in respectful salutation
you should say to them speak thus
I go to the Buddha for refuge
I go to the Dhamma for refuge
I go to the Sangha for refuge
For a second time I go to the Buddha for refuge
For a second time I go to the Dhamma for refuge
For a second time I go to the Sangha for refuge
For a third time I go to the Buddha for refuge
For a third time I go to the Dhamma for refuge
For a third time I go to the Sangha for refuge
I give permission monks for the goingforth and the full ordination through going to the three refuges
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he announced the time saying
It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
You go ahead Kassapa I am coming
After sending away the yogi Uruvelakassapa
picking a fruit from a Yellow Myrobalan tree not far from the RoseApple tree after which the RoseApple Island is named
and arriving earlier he sat down in the sacrificial firehouse
The yogi Uruvelakassapa saw the Fortunate One sitting in the sacrificial firehouse
and after seeing him he said this to the Fortunate One
By what path Great Ascetic did you come
I set out earlier than you
but you arriving earlier are already sitting down in the sacrificial firehouse
Here Kassapa after sending you away
picking a fruit from a Yellow Myrobalan tree not far from the RoseApple tree after which the RoseApple Island is named
and arriving earlier I sat down in the sacrificial firehouse
This is the Yellow Myrobalan fruit Kassapa
endowed with good colour scent and taste
if you wish you can eat it
Enough Great Ascetic you surely brought it you should surely eat it
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
since after sending me away earlier
picking a fruit from a Yellow Myrobalan tree not far from the RoseApple tree after which the RoseApple Island is named
and arriving earlier he can sit down in the sacrificial firehouse
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Fortunate One having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapas food
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket
Then Sakka the Lord of the Gods
having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with his surpassing beauty
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he stood at one side
like a great mass of fire
having colours more brilliant and more excellent than the former colours
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he said this to the Fortunate One
It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
Who was that Great Ascetic towards the end of the night who
having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with his surpassing beauty
approached you and after approaching and worshipping you
stood at one side like a great mass of fire
having colours more brilliant and more excellent than the former colours
That Kassapa was Sakka the Lord of the Gods
who approached me to listen to the Dhamma
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
since even Sakka the Lord of the Gods will approach him to listen to the Dhamma
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Fortunate One having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapas food
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he announced the time saying
It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
You go ahead Kassapa I am coming
After sending away the yogi Uruvelakassapa
going to the Tāvatisa Heaven picking a Coral tree flower
and arriving earlier he sat down in the sacrificial firehouse
The yogi Uruvelakassapa saw the Fortunate One sitting in the sacrificial firehouse
and after seeing him he said this to the Fortunate One
By what path Great Ascetic did you come
I set out earlier than you
but you arriving earlier are already sitting down in the sacrificial firehouse
Here Kassapa after sending you away
going to the Tāvatisa Heaven picking a Coral tree flower
and arriving earlier I sat down in the sacrificial firehouse
This is the Coral tree flower Kassapa
endowed with good colour and scent
if you wish you can take it
Enough Great Ascetic you surely brought it you should surely take it
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
since after sending me away earlier
going to the Tāvatisa Heaven picking a Coral tree flower
and arriving earlier he can sit down in the sacrificial firehouse
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then with the passing of seven days the Fortunate One
after arising from that concentration
approached the Goatherds Banyan tree
he sat in one crosslegged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of liberation
Then a certain brāhmaṇa who was a grumbler by nature
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he exchanged greetings with the Fortunate One
and after exchanging courteous talk
While standing on one side that brāhmaṇa said this to the Fortunate One
To what extent dear Gotama is one a brāhmaṇa
And again what things make one a brāhmaṇa
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
That brāhmaṇa who has barred wickedness
Not grumbling free from blemish selfrestrained
With perfect understanding and the spiritual life accomplished
Righteously he might speak a word about the Brahman
For him there is no arrogance
Then at that time many wellknown
sons of good families from Magadha were living the spiritual life under the Fortunate One
People were grumbling moaning cursing
The Ascetic Gotamas method is making families childless
the Ascetic Gotamas method is causing breakage and loss
the Ascetic Gotamas method is familysmashing
now through him a thousand yogis have gone forth
and these twohundred and fifty of Sañjayas wanderers have gone forth
and these many wellknown sons of good families from Magadha
are all living the spiritual life under the Ascetic Gotama
and having seen the monks they scolded them with this verse
The Great Ascetic has come to Giribbaja
After leading off all those under Sañjaya who will he lead off now
The monks heard those people
grumbling moaning cursing
Then those monks informed the Fortunate One of it
This noise will not last long monks it will last for only seven days
and with the passing of seven days it will disappear
Therefore monks whoever scolds you with this verse
The Great Ascetic has come to Giribbaja in Magadha
After leading off all those under Sañjaya who will he lead off now
you scold them back with this verse
The Great Heros the Realised Ones lead with the True Dhamma
By the Dhamma
Then at that time people after seeing the monks scolded them with this verse
The Great Ascetic has come to Giribbaja in Magadha
After leading off all those under Sañjaya who will he lead off now
and the monks scolded those people back with this verse
The Great Heros the Realised Ones lead with the True Dhamma
By the Dhamma they are leading why be jealous of the wise
It seems the people and ascetics are led with Dhamma by the Sakyan son
they are not led by what is not Dhamma
That noise lasted only seven days and with the passing of those seven days it disappeared
Then at that time there was a ragrobe that had arisen to the Fortunate One
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
Now where can I wash this ragrobe
Then Sakka the Lord of the Gods
knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the Fortunate Ones mind
having dug a lake with his hand said this to the Fortunate One
May the Fortunate One venerable Sir wash the ragrobe here
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
Now on what can I beat this ragrobe
Then Sakka the Lord of the Gods
knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the Fortunate Ones mind
set up a great rock saying
May the Fortunate One venerable Sir beat the ragrobe here
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
Now having grabbed hold of what can I emerge from the lake
Then a god who was living in an Arjuna tree
knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the Fortunate Ones mind bent down a branch saying
May the Fortunate One venerable Sir having grabbed hold here emerge from the lake
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
Now on what can I stretch out this ragrobe for drying
Then Sakka the Lord of the Gods
knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the Fortunate Ones mind
set up a great rock saying
May the Fortunate One venerable Sir stretch out the ragrobe here
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he said this to the Fortunate One
It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
Now how is it Great Ascetic
this lake was not here formerly and yet this lake is here
This rock was not set up here formerly this rock was set up by whom
This branch of the Arjuna tree was not bent down formerly and yet this branch is bent down now
Here Kassapa a ragrobe arose to me
Then Kassapa this occurred to me
Now where can I wash this ragrobe
Then Sakka the Lord of the Gods Kassapa
knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in my mind
having dug a lake with his hand said this to me
May the Fortunate One venerable Sir wash the ragrobe here
the lake was dug by the divine being himself with his own hand
Then this Kassapa occurred to me
Now on what can I beat this ragrobe
Then Sakka the Lord of the Gods Kassapa
knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in my mind set up a great rock saying
May the Fortunate One venerable Sir beat the ragrobe here
the rock was set up by the divine being himself
Then Kassapa this occurred to me
Now having grabbed hold of what can I emerge from the lake
May the Fortunate One venerable Sir having grabbed hold here emerge from the lake
this Arjuna treespirit gave a hand himself
Then Kassapa this occurred to me
Now on what can I stretch out this ragrobe for drying
Then Kassapa Sakka the Lord of the Gods
knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in my mind set up a great rock saying
May the Fortunate One venerable Sir stretch out the ragrobe here
the rock was set up by this divine being himself
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
since even Sakka the Lord of the Gods does him service
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Fortunate One having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapas food
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket
Then at that time a great cloud poured down out of season
and a great floodwater arose
and in that area where the Fortunate One was living the whole place became submerged with water
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
Now what if I having risen above the water on all sides
were to walk on an island in the middle on dusty ground
Then the Fortunate One having risen above the water on all sides
walked on an island in the middle of dusty ground
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa thinking
May the Great Ascetic not be carried away by water
with a boat and a great many yogis
went to that place in the area where the Fortunate One was living
The yogi Uruvelakassapa saw that the Fortunate One having risen above the water on all sides
Are you here Great Ascetic
It is I Kassapa
and after rising up into the sky he reappeared in the boat
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
since even the water cannot carry him away
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Fortunate One not far from the yogi Uruvelakassapas ashram
dwelt in a certain jungle thicket
Then the Four Great Kings
having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with their surpassing beauty
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One
they stood at the four directions like a great mass of fire
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he said this to the Fortunate One
It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
Who were those Great Ascetic towards the end of the night who
having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with their surpassing beauty
approached you and after approaching and worshipping you
stood at the four directions like a great mass of fire
Those Kassapa were the Four Great Kings
who approached me to listen to the Dhamma
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
since even the Four Great Kings will approach him to listen to the Dhamma
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Fortunate One having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapas food
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket
Then the Fortunate One addressed the groupoffive monks saying
There are these two extremes monks that one who has gone forth ought not to associate with
which is this devotion and clinging to the pleasure in sense pleasures
which is low vulgar worldly ignoble and not connected with the goal
and this devotion to selfmortification
which is painful ignoble and not connected with the goal
Not having approached either of these two extremes monks the middle practice
was awakened to by the Realised One which produces vision produces knowledge
and which leads to peace deep knowledge Complete Awakening and Emancipation
Now what is this middle practice monks
that was awakened to by the Realised One which produces vision
and which leads to peace deep knowledge Complete Awakening and Emancipation
It is this Eightfold Noble Path as follows
right view
right thought
right speech
right action
right livelihood
right endeavour
right mindfulness
right concentration
This is the middle practice monks
that was awakened to by the Realised One which produces vision produces knowledge
and which leads to peace deep knowledge Complete Awakening and Emancipation
Now this monks is the noble truth of suffering
birth is suffering
also old age is suffering
also sickness is suffering
also death is suffering
being joined to what is not dear is suffering
being separated from what is dear is suffering
also not to obtain what one longs for is suffering
in brief the five constituent parts of mind and body that provide fuel for attachment are suffering
Now this monks is the noble truth of the arising of suffering
it is that craving which leads to continuation in existence
which is connected with enjoyment and passion greatly enjoying this and that as follows
craving for sense pleasures
craving for continuation
craving for discontinuation
Now this monks is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering
it is the complete fading away and cessation without remainder of that craving 
liberation letting go release and nonadherence
Now this monks
is the noble truth of the practice leading to the end of suffering
it is this Eightfold Noble Path as follows
right view
right thought
right speech
right action
right livelihood
right endeavour
right mindfulness
right concentration

to me monks regarding these previously unheardof things
vision arose knowledge arose wisdom arose understanding arose light arose
Now that to which this is the noble truth of the practice leading to the end of suffering refers has been developed 
to me monks regarding these previously unheardof things
vision arose knowledge arose wisdom arose understanding arose light arose
For as long as to me monks in regard to these four noble truths
knowledge and insight as it really is was not quite clear
for that long monks I did not declare to the world with its gods Māra and Brahmā
to this generation with its ascetics and brāhmaṇas princes and men
that I was a Full and Perfect Sambuddha with unsurpassed complete awakening
But when to me monks in regard to these four noble truths
knowledge and insight as it really is was quite clear
then monks I did declare to the world with its gods Māra and Brahmā
to this generation with its ascetics and brāhmaṇas princes and men
that I was a Full and Perfect Sambuddha with unsurpassed complete awakening
To me knowledge and insight arose
Sure is my liberation of mind
this is my last birth
now there is no continuation of existence
The Fortunate One said this
and the groupoffive monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Fortunate One
Moreover as this sermon was being given to the venerable Koṇḍañña
the dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma arose
Whatever has the nature of arising
all that has the nature of ceasing
Now when the Dhamma Wheel was set rolling by the Fortunate One
the Earth gods
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world
Having heard the cry of the Earth gods
the gods called the Four Great Kings let loose a cry
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world
Having heard the cry of the gods called the Four Great Kings
the Tāvatisa gods let loose a cry
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world
Having heard the cry of the Tāvatisa gods
the Yāma gods let loose a cry
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world
Having heard the cry of the Yāma gods
the Tusita gods let loose a cry
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world
Having heard the cry of the Tusita gods
the Nimmāṇarati gods let loose a cry
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world
Having heard the cry of the Nimmāṇarati gods
the Paranimmitavasavatti gods let loose a cry
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world
Having heard the cry of the Paranimmitavasavatti gods
the Brahmakāyika gods
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world
Thus at that moment at that second
that cry reached as far as the Brahmā worlds
and this tenthousand worldelement moved wavered and shook
and great and measureless light became manifest in the world
transcending the godly power of the gods
Then the Fortunate One uttered this inspired utterance
Koṇḍañña surely knows
Koṇḍañña surely knows
Thus to the venerable Koṇḍañña
came the name Aññā Koṇḍañña Koṇḍañña hewhoknows
Then the young man Yasas mother having ascended the palace
and not finding
and after approaching the merchant householder she said this
Your son Yasa householder cannot be found
Then the merchant householder after sending scouts on horses to the four directions
himself approached the Deer Park at Isipatana
The merchant householder saw the castoff golden sandals
and after seeing them he went after him
The Fortunate One saw the merchant householder coming while still far away
and after seeing him this occurred to the Fortunate One
Now what if I were to so arrange it with my psychic powers
that while the merchant householder is sitting here
he could not see the young man Yasa sitting here
Then the Fortunate One so arranged it with his psychic powers
Then the merchant householder approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he said this to the Fortunate One
Has the Fortunate One venerable Sir seen the young man Yasa
Sit householder and it may be that while you are sitting here
you will see the young man Yasa sitting here
Then the merchant householder thought It seems that while sitting here
I will see the young man Yasa sitting here
and joyful uplifted after worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
To the merchant householder sitting at one side
the Fortunate One spoke about the gradual teaching
that is to say talk about giving talk about virtue talk about heaven
the danger degradation and defilement of sensual desires
and the advantages of renunciation these he explained
When the Fortunate One knew that the merchant householder
had a ready mind a pliable mind an open mind an uplifted mind a confident mind
he explained to him the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves
Suffering Origination Cessation Path
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain
will take the dye well
just so to the merchant householder on that very seat
the dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma arose
Whatever has the nature of arising
all that has the nature of ceasing
Then the merchant householder having seen the Dhamma attained the Dhamma
understood the Dhamma penetrated the Dhamma crossed over uncertainty being without doubts
having attained full confidence having become independent of others in the Teachers teaching said this to the Fortunate One
Excellent venerable Sir Excellent venerable Sir
Just as venerable Sir one might set upright what has been overturned
or open up what has been closed or show a path to one who is lost
or carry an oil lamp into the darkness thinking those with vision will see forms
just so has the Dhamma been explained by the Fortunate One in countless ways
I go venerable Sir to the Fortunate One for refuge
and to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks
Please bear it in mind Fortunate One that I am a lay follower
who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I have the breath of life
and he became the first lay disciple in the world with the threerefuge formula
Then while Dhamma was being taught to the young man Yasas father
as Yasa was reflecting on the stage he had reached just as it was seen as it was understood
his mind was liberated from the pollutants without attachment
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
While Dhamma was being taught to the young man Yasas father
as Yasa was reflecting on the stage he had reached just as it was seen as it was understood
his mind was liberated from the pollutants without attachment
It is impossible that the young man Yasa could go back to enjoying the low life of sensual pleasures
in the way he formerly did when he was at home
Now what if I were to allay my psychic powers
Then the Fortunate One allayed his psychic powers
Then the merchant householder saw the young man Yasa sitting there
and after seeing him he said this to the young man Yasa
Your Mother dear Yasa is taken up with lamenting and grieving give life to your Mother
Then the young man Yasa looked up at the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One said this to the merchant householder
What do you think of this householder
for the young man Yasa with a trainees knowledge with a trainees insight
who saw the Dhamma just as you have
but as he was reflecting on the stage he had reached just as it was seen as it was understood
his mind was liberated from the pollutants without attachment
Is it possible that he could go back to enjoying the low life of sensual pleasures
in the way he formerly did when he was at home
Certainly not venerable Sir
But for the young man Yasa householder with a trainees knowledge with a trainees insight
he saw the Dhamma just as you have
and as he was reflecting on the stage he had reached just as it was seen as it was understood
his mind was liberated from the pollutants without attachment
It is impossible that the young man Yasa could go back to enjoying the low life of sensual pleasures
in the way he formerly did when he was at home
It is a gain for the young man Yasa venerable Sir it is a great gain venerable Sir for the young man Yasa
that the young man Yasas mind is liberated from the pollutants without attachment
May the Fortunate One venerable Sir consent to me offering him a meal today together with
the young man Yasa as the ascetic who attends on him
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence
Then the merchant householder having understood the Fortunate Ones consent
having worshipped and circumambulated the Fortunate One went away
Then the young man Yasa not long after the merchant householder had gone away
said this to the Fortunate One
May I receive the goingforth venerable Sir in the presence of the Fortunate One
may I receive the full ordination
Come monk said the Fortunate One the Dhamma has been wellproclaimed
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering
That was this venerable ones full ordination
and at that time there were seven Worthy Ones in the world
Then the Fortunate One addressed the groupoffive monks saying
Bodily form monks is not Self
for if this bodily form monks were Self
this bodily form would not lead to affliction and regarding bodily form it might be possible to say
Let my bodily form be thus let my bodily form be not thus
But because bodily form monks is not Self
therefore bodily form does lead to affliction and regarding bodily form it is not possible to say
Let my bodily form be thus let my bodily form be not thus
Feeling is not Self
for if this feeling monks were Self
this feeling would not lead to affliction and regarding feeling it might be possible to say
Let my feeling be thus let my feeling be not thus
But because feeling monks is not Self
therefore feeling does lead to affliction and regarding feeling it is not possible to say
Let my feeling be thus let my feeling be not thus
Perception is not Self
for if this perception monks were Self
this perception would not lead to affliction and regarding perception it might be possible to say
Let my perception be thus let my perception be not thus
But because perception monks is not Self
therefore perception does lead to affliction and regarding perception it is not possible to say
Let my perception be thus let my perception be not thus
Mental processes
for if these mental processes monks were Self
these mental processes would not lead to affliction and regarding mental processes it might be possible to say
Let my mental processes be thus let my mental processes be not thus
But because mental processes monks are not Self
therefore mental processes do lead to affliction and regarding mental processes it is not possible to say
Let my mental processes be thus let my mental processes be not thus
Consciousness is not Self
for if this consciousness monks were Self
this consciousness would not lead to affliction and regarding consciousness it might be possible to say
Let my consciousness be thus let my consciousness be not thus
But because consciousness monks is not Self
therefore consciousness does lead to affliction and regarding consciousness it is not possible to say
Let my consciousness be thus let my consciousness be not thus
Is bodily form permanent or impermanent
Impermanent venerable Sir
But that which is impermanent is that unpleasant or pleasant
Unpleasant venerable Sir
But that which is impermanent unpleasant and changeable
is it proper to regard it thus
This is mine this I am this is my Self 
Certainly not venerable Sir
Is feeling permanent or impermanent
Impermanent venerable Sir
But that which is impermanent is that unpleasant or pleasant
Unpleasant venerable Sir

Therefore monks whatever bodily form there is in the past future or present
internal or external gross or fine inferior or excellent
whether far or near regarding all form
This is not mine I am not this this is not my Self
in just this way as it really is it should be seen with full wisdom
Whatever feeling there is in the past future or present
internal or external gross or fine inferior or excellent
whether far or near regarding all feeling
This is not mine I am not this this is not my Self
in just this way as it really is it should be seen with full wisdom
Whatever perception there is in the past future or present
internal or external gross or fine inferior or excellent
whether far or near regarding all perception
This is not mine I am not this this is not my Self
in just this way as it really is it should be seen with full wisdom
Whatever mental processes there are in the past future or present
internal or external gross or fine inferior or excellent
whether far or near regarding all mental processes
This is not mine I am not this this is not my Self

Whatever consciousness there is in the past future or present
internal or external gross or fine inferior or excellent
whether far or near regarding all consciousness
This is not mine I am not this this is not my Self
in just this way as it really is it should be seen with full wisdom
Seeing in this way monks the learned Noble disciple grows weary of bodily form
and weary of feeling and weary of perception
and weary of mental processes and weary of consciousness
through weariness he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is liberated
in liberation there is the knowledge that such is liberation
Destroyed is rebirth
accomplished is the spiritual life
done is what ought to be done
there is no more of this mundane state  this he knows
and the groupoffive monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Fortunate One
Moreover as this sermon was being given
the groupoffive monks minds were liberated from the pollutants without attachment
and at that time there were six Worthy Ones in the world
Then the Fortunate One having dwelt at Uruvelā for as long as he liked
left on walking tour for Gayās Head
together with a great Community of monks
with a thousand monks all of whom were formerly yogis
There the Fortunate One dwelt near Gayā
on Gayās Head together with a thousand monks
There the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
All is burning monks
What all is burning monks

Seeing this monks the learned Noble disciple
grows weary of the eye grows weary of forms
grows weary of eyeconsciousness grows weary of eyecontact
and whatever feeling that arises dependent on eyecontact
whether pleasant unpleasant or neitherunpleasantnorpleasant he also grows weary of that
He grows weary of the ear grows weary of sounds

He grows weary of the mind grows weary of thoughts

through weariness he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is liberated
in liberation there is the knowledge that such is liberation
Destroyed is rebirth
accomplished is the spiritual life
done is what ought to be done
there is no more of this mundane state  this he knows
Moreover as this sermon was being given
those one thousand monks minds were liberated from the pollutants without attachment
Then with the passing of seven days the Fortunate One
after arising from that concentration
approached the Royal tree
and after approaching the root of the Royal tree
he sat in one crosslegged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of liberation
Then at that time the merchants Tapussa and Ballika
were in that district travelling along the highway from Ukkalā
Then a god who had formerly been a blood relative
said this to the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika
The Fortunate One Sirs is dwelling at the root of the Royal tree in the first period after the complete and perfect Awakening
Go and wait upon the Fortunate One with milkrice and honeyballs
and for a long time
Then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika having taken milkrice and honeyballs
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One they stood at one side
While standing on one side the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika said this to the Fortunate One
Please accept our milkrice and honeyballs venerable Sir Fortunate One
that for a long time will be for our benefit and happiness
Then it occurred to the Fortunate One
Realised Ones
now how can I accept the milkrice and honeyballs
Then the gods called the Four Great Kings knowing with their minds the reflection in the mind of the Fortunate One
brought from the four directions four bowls made of green stone
Please accept venerable Sir Fortunate One the milkrice and honeyballs here in the bowls
The Fortunate One accepted in the new bowl
the milkrice and honeyballs and having accepted it he ate
Then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika said this to the Fortunate One
We venerable Sir are those who go to the Fortunate One for refuge and to the Dhamma
please bear in mind that we are lay disciples who have gone for refuge from today forward for as long as we have the breath of life
and they became the first lay disciples in the world with the tworefuge formula
Then with the passing of seven days the Fortunate One
after arising from that concentration
approached the Goatherds Banyan tree from the root of the Royal tree
and there the Fortunate One dwelt at the root of the Goatherds Banyan tree
Then when the Fortunate One had gone into solitude into seclusion
this reflection arose in his mind
This Dhamma I have attained is deep hard to see hard to understand
peaceful excellent beyond the sphere of logic profound understandable only to the wise
But this generation delights in desire
and for a generation delighting in desire devoted to desire gladdened by desire
this thing is hard to see that is to say conditionality and conditional origination
This thing also is very hard to see that is to say
the tranquilising of all processes the letting go of all bases for cleaving
the end of craving dispassion cessation Emancipation
But if I were to teach the Dhamma and others did not understand me
that would be tiring for me that would be troublesome to me
Further these truly wonderful verses
Now is it suitable
For those overcome by passion and hatred this Dhamma is not easily understood
Going against the stream
Those delighting in passion
Such was the Fortunate Ones reflection
and his mind inclined to inaction
Then to Brahmā Sahampati
knowing with his mind the reflection in the mind of the Fortunate One this thought occurred
The world is surely going to destruction the world is surely going to complete destruction
wherever the Realised One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddhas
mind inclines to inaction not to teaching the Dhamma
Then Brahmā Sahampati just as a strong man
might stretch out a bent arm or bend in an outstretched arm
so did he vanish from the Brahmā world and appear in front of the Fortunate One
Then Brahmā Sahampati after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder
placing his right knee on the earth
and raising his hands in respectful salutation said this to the Fortunate One
Let the Fortunate One preach the Dhamma venerable Sir let the Happy One preach the Dhamma
there are beings with little dust
there will be those who understand the Dhamma
Brahmā Sahampati said this and after saying this he said something more
Formerly there appeared amongst the Magadhans
An impure Dhamma invented by those still stained
Open this door
Let them hear the Dhamma understood by the Pure One
As one who is standing on a rock on the top of a mountain
Can see the people on all sides
In the same way One of Great Wisdom having ascended
The Palace made from Dhamma Visionary One
Look down on the people overcome by grief
One Free of Grief on those overcome by birth and oldage
CaravanLeader Debtless One travel through the world
Let the Fortunate One teach the Dhamma there will be those who understand
After this was said the Fortunate One said this to Brahmā Sahampati
This occurred to me Brahmā
This Dhamma I have attained is deep hard to see hard to understand
peaceful excellent beyond the sphere of logic profound understandable only to the wise
But this generation delights in desire is devoted to desire gladdened by desire
and for a generation delighting in desire devoted to desire gladdened by desire
this thing is hard to see that is to say conditionality and conditional origination
This thing also is very hard to see that is to say
the tranquilising of all processes the letting go of all bases for cleaving
the end of craving dispassion cessation Emancipation
But if I were to teach the Dhamma and others did not understand me
that would be tiring for me that would be troublesome to me
Further these truly wonderful verses unheard previously in the past Brahmā occurred to me
Now is it suitable for me to explain what was attained with difficulty
For those overcome by passion and hatred this Dhamma is not easily understood
Going against the stream it is profound deep hard to see subtle
Those delighting in passion obstructed by darkness will not see it
Such was my reflection
and my mind inclined to inaction not to teaching the Dhamma
For a second time Brahmā Sahampati said this to the Fortunate One
there are beings with little dust on the eyes who are perishing through not hearing the Dhamma
there will be those who understand the Dhamma
Brahmā Sahampati said this and after saying this he said something more
Formerly there appeared amongst the Magadhans
An impure Dhamma invented by those still stained
Open this door to the Deathless
Let them hear the Dhamma understood by the Pure One
As one who is standing on a rock on the top of a mountain
Can see the people on all sides
In the same way One of Great Wisdom having ascended
The Palace made from Dhamma Visionary One
Look down on the people overcome by grief
One Free of Grief on those overcome by birth and oldage
Rise up O Hero Victorious in Battle
CaravanLeader Debtless One travel through the world
Let the Fortunate One teach the Dhamma there will be those who understand
For a second time the Fortunate One said this to Brahmā Sahampati
This occurred to me Brahmā
This Dhamma I have attained is deep hard to see hard to understand
peaceful excellent beyond the sphere of logic profound understandable only to the wise
But this generation delights in desire is devoted to desire gladdened by desire
and for a generation delighting in desire devoted to desire gladdened by desire
this thing is hard to see that is to say conditionality and conditional origination
This thing also is very hard to see that is to say

But if I were to teach the Dhamma and others did not understand me

Further these truly wonderful verses unheard previously in the past Brahmā occurred to me
Now is it suitable for me to explain what was attained with difficulty
For those overcome by passion and hatred this Dhamma is not easily understood
Going against the stream it is profound deep hard to see subtle
Those delighting in passion obstructed by darkness will not see it
Such was my reflection
and my mind inclined to inaction not to teaching the Dhamma
For a third time Brahmā Sahampati said this to the Fortunate One
there are beings with little dust on the eyes who are perishing through not hearing the Dhamma
there will be those who understand the Dhamma
Brahmā Sahampati said this and after saying this he said something more
Formerly there appeared amongst the Magadhans
An impure Dhamma invented by those still stained
Open this door to the Deathless
Let them hear the Dhamma understood by the Pure One
As one who is standing on a rock on the top of a mountain

One Free of Grief on those overcome by birth and oldage
Rise up O Hero Victorious in Battle
CaravanLeader Debtless One travel through the world
Let the Fortunate One teach the Dhamma there will be those who understand
Then the Fortunate One having understood Brahmās request
out of kindness looked at beings around the world with his Buddhaeye
While looking around the world with his Buddhaeye the Fortunate One saw
beings having little dust on the eyes having great dust on the eyes having sharp faculties having undeveloped faculties
having good conditions having poor conditions easy to instruct hard to instruct
and only some who dwelt seeing danger in what is blameworthy and in the next world
Just as with waterlilies or lotuses or white lotuses
some of those waterlilies or lotuses or white lotuses
born in the water flourishing in the water not rising above water are nourished from inside the depths
some of those waterlilies or lotuses or white lotuses
born in the water flourishing in the water stand level with the water
some of those waterlilies or lotuses or white lotuses
born in the water flourishing in the water stand above the water
and are untouched by the water
Even so while looking around the world with his Buddhaeye the Fortunate One saw
beings having little dust on the eyes having great dust on the eyes having sharp faculties having undeveloped faculties
having good conditions having poor conditions easy to instruct hard to instruct
and only some who dwelt seeing danger in what is blameworthy and in the next world
and having seen it he recited this verse to Brahmā Sahampati
Open for you are the doors to the Deathless
Whoever has ears let them release their faith
About what was hardlearned the excellent Dhamma
Then Brahmā Sahampati thought
I have obtained consent for the Fortunate One to teach the Dhamma
and after worshipping the Fortunate One and circumambulating him he vanished right there
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he announced the time saying
It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
You go ahead Kassapa I am coming
After sending away the yogi Uruvelakassapa
picking a fruit from an Emblic Myrobalan tree not far from the RoseApple tree after which the RoseApple Island is named
and arriving earlier he sat down in the sacrificial firehouse
The yogi Uruvelakassapa saw the Fortunate One sitting in the sacrificial firehouse
and after seeing him he said this to the Fortunate One
By what path Great Ascetic did you come
I set out earlier than you
but you arriving earlier are already sitting down in the sacrificial firehouse
Here Kassapa after sending you away
picking a fruit from an Emblic Myrobalan tree not far from the RoseApple tree after which the RoseApple Island is named
and arriving earlier I sat down in the sacrificial firehouse
This is the Emblic Myrobalan fruit Kassapa
endowed with good colour scent and taste
if you wish you can eat it
Enough Great Ascetic you surely brought it you should surely eat it
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
since after sending me away earlier
picking a fruit from an Emblic Myrobalan tree not far from the RoseApple tree after which the RoseApple Island is named
and arriving earlier he can sit down in the sacrificial firehouse
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Fortunate One having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapas food
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket
Then at that time the yogi Uruvelakassapa had arranged for a great sacrifice
and almost the whole population of Aṅga and Magadha
having gathered abundant food and drinks had a desire to attend
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Now I have arranged for a great sacrifice
and almost the whole population of Aṅga and Magadha
having gathered abundant food and drinks will attend
If the Great Ascetic performs a powerful miracle in the midst of the people
his gain and honour will increase
and my gain and honour will decrease
Surely the Great Ascetic should not come on the morrow
Then the Fortunate One knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the yogi Uruvelakassapas mind
after approaching Northern Kuru gathering alms from there and eating them at lake Anotatta
made his dwelling right there for the day
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he said this to the Fortunate One
It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
Why did you not come yesterday Great Ascetic
We remembered you thinking
Why does the Great Ascetic not come
A portion of the food and drinks was set aside for you
Didn't this occur to you Kassapa
Now I have arranged for a great sacrifice
and almost the whole population of Aṅga and Magadha
having gathered abundant food and drinks will attend
If the Great Ascetic performs a powerful miracle in the midst of the people
his gain and honour will increase
and my gain and honour will decrease
Surely the Great Ascetic should not come on the morrow'
Then I Kassapa knowing with my mind the reflection that had arisen in your mind
after approaching Northern Kuru gathering alms from there and eating them at lake Anotatta
made my dwelling right there for the day
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
since he can even know my mind with his mind
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Fortunate One having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapas food
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket
Near the river Nerañjarā the Fortunate One said this to Uruvelakassapa
If it is not troublesome to you Kassapa we would live for this moonlight night in the fire shelter
It is not troublesome to me Great Ascetic but seeking your comfort I would prevent you
For there is a fierce venomous poisonous DragonKing here having psychic power  he should not be allowed to harass you
It is all right he will not harass me come now Kassapa allow me the sacrificial firehouse
Having understood that permission is given not daunted he entered unafraid
Having seen the Seer enter the SnakeDragon depressed belched out smoke
With intent and gladdened mind the HumanDragon also belched out smoke right there
Unbearably angry the SnakeDragon blazed forth like fire
Skilled in the fireelement the HumanDragon also blazed forth right there
They both burned so brightly that the yogis surveying the sacrificial firehouse said
The Great Ascetic is surely intelligent but he is harassed by the Dragon
With the passing of the night the Dragons flames were destroyed
But the multicoloured flames of the One of Psychic Power remained
Then there were blue red crimson yellow and quartzcoloured
Multicoloured flames on the body of Aṅgirasa
After putting him in his bowl he showed the SnakeDragon to the brāhmaṇa saying
This is your Dragon Kassapa his psychic power was overcome by my power
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa
convinced by this psychic miracle of the Fortunate One said this to the Fortunate One
Live right here Great Ascetic I will give a constant supply of food to you
Then at that time those yogis
in the cold Winter nights in between the eights
in the river Nerañjarā were plunging in and plunging out
were plunging in and out
Then the Fortunate One created about five hundred coalpans
where those yogis after emerging warmed themselves
Then this occurred to those yogis
No doubt it is because of the Great Ascetics psychic power
that these coalpans were created
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
since he can create so many coalpans for them
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
sons of the traditional leading families
The young man Yasa it seems after shaving off his hair and beard
and donning brown garments has gone forth from the home to the homeless life
After hearing it this occurred to them
This is not an inferior Dhamma and Discipline not an inferior goingforth
in which the young man Yasa after shaving off his hair and beard
and donning brown garments has gone forth from the home to the homeless life
They approached the venerable Yasa
and after approaching and worshipping the venerable Yasa they sat down on one side
Then the venerable Yasa took those fifty householder friends
and approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side the venerable Yasa said this to the Fortunate One
These venerable Sir are about fifty of my householder friends
sons of the traditional leading families in the State
please advise them Fortunate One please instruct them
The Fortunate One spoke about the gradual teaching to them
that is to say talk about giving talk about virtue talk about heaven
the danger degradation and defilement of sensual desires
and the advantages of renunciation these he explained
When the Fortunate One knew that they had ready minds pliable minds
open minds uplifted minds confident minds
he explained to them the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves
Suffering Origination Cessation Path
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain
will take the dye well
just so to them on that very seat
the dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma arose
Whatever has the nature of arising
all that has the nature of ceasing
They having seen the Dhamma attained the Dhamma
understood the Dhamma penetrated the Dhamma crossed over uncertainty being without doubts
having attained full confidence having become independent of others in the Teachers teaching said this to the Fortunate One
May we receive the goingforth venerable Sir in the presence of the Fortunate One
may we receive the full ordination
Come monks said the Fortunate One the Dhamma has been wellproclaimed
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering
That was these venerable ones full ordination
Then the Fortunate One gave advice and instruction with a Dhamma talk to those monks
As the Fortunate One gave advice and instruction with a Dhamma talk
their minds were liberated from the pollutants without attachment
and at that time there were sixtyone Worthy Ones in the world
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he announced the time saying
It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
You go ahead Kassapa I am coming
After sending away the yogi Uruvelakassapa
picking a fruit from a Mango tree not far from the RoseApple tree after which the RoseApple Island is named
and arriving earlier he sat down in the sacrificial firehouse
The yogi Uruvelakassapa saw the Fortunate One sitting in the sacrificial firehouse
and after seeing him he said this to the Fortunate One
By what path Great Ascetic did you come
I set out earlier than you
but you arriving earlier are already sitting down in the sacrificial firehouse
Here Kassapa after sending you away
picking a fruit from a Mango tree not far from the RoseApple tree after which the RoseApple Island is named
and arriving earlier I sat down in the sacrificial firehouse
This is the Mango fruit Kassapa
endowed with good colour scent and taste
if you wish you can eat it
Enough Great Ascetic you surely brought it you should surely eat it
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
since after sending me away earlier
picking a fruit from a Mango tree not far from the RoseApple tree after which the RoseApple Island is named
and arriving earlier he can sit down in the sacrificial firehouse
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Fortunate One having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapas food
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket
Then the venerable Aññā Koṇḍañña having seen the Dhamma attained the Dhamma
understood the Dhamma penetrated the Dhamma crossed over uncertainty being without doubts
having attained full confidence having become independent of others in the Teachers teaching said this to the Fortunate One
May I receive the goingforth venerable Sir in the presence of the Fortunate One

Come monk said the Fortunate One the Dhamma has been wellproclaimed

That was this the venerable ones full ordination
Then the Fortunate One gave advice and instruction with a Dhamma talk to the remaining monks
Then to the venerable Vappa and to the venerable Bhaddiya
as the Fortunate One gave advice and instruction
the dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma arose
Whatever has the nature of arising
all that has the nature of ceasing
They having seen the Dhamma attained the Dhamma

That was these venerable ones full ordination
Then the Fortunate One living on those three monks food
gave advice and instruction with a Dhamma talk to the remaining monks
and the six monks subsisted on whatever after walking for almsfood the three monks brought them
Then to the venerable Mahānāma and to the venerable Assaji
as the Fortunate One gave advice and instruction with a Dhamma talk
the dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma arose

That was these venerable ones full ordination
The yogi Nadīkassapa saw the hair locks
pole and basket and sacred fire equipment floating in the water
and after seeing them this occurred to him
Let there be no danger for my brothers
and he sent yogis saying Go and find out about my brothers
and he together with three hundred yogis approached the venerable Uruvelakassapa
and after approaching he said this to the venerable Uruvelakassapa
Is this better Kassapa
Yes friend this is better 
pole and basket and sacred fire equipment into the water

That was these venerable ones full ordination
Through
that were not chopped were chopped
fires that were not lit were lit
that were not put out were put out
and five hundred coalpans were created
In this way there were three and a half thousand miracles
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
For a long time this will occur to that foolish fellow
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Now what if I were to cause spiritual anxiety to this yogi
Then the Fortunate One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
You are certainly not a Worthy One Kassapa
Nor have you entered the path to Worthiness
This practice of yours is not one whereby you could be a Worthy One
or one who has entered the path to Worthiness
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa having fallen with his head at the Fortunate Ones feet
said this to the Fortunate One
May I receive the goingforth venerable Sir in the presence of the Fortunate One
may I receive the full ordination
guide chief director and instructor of five hundred yogis

known as Uruvelakassapa Nadīkassapa and Gayākassapa
guide chief director and instructor of five hundred yogis
guide chief director and instructor of three hundred yogis
guide chief director and instructor of two hundred yogis
Then the Fortunate One approached the yogi Uruvelakassapas ashram
and after approaching he said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
If it is not troublesome to you Kassapa we
It is not troublesome to me Great Ascetic
but there is a fierce venomous poisonous DragonKing here having psychic power
he should not be allowed to harass you
For a second time the Fortunate One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
If it is not troublesome to you Kassapa we would stay for one night in the sacrificial firehouse
It is not troublesome to me Great Ascetic
but there is a fierce venomous poisonous DragonKing here having psychic power
he should not be allowed to harass you
For a third time the Fortunate One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
If it is not troublesome to you Kassapa we would stay for one night in the sacrificial firehouse
It is not troublesome to me Great Ascetic
but there is a fierce venomous poisonous DragonKing here having psychic power
he should not be allowed to harass you
It is all right he will not harass me come now Kassapa allow me the sacrificial firehouse
Dwell there Great Ascetic according to your pleasure
Then the Fortunate One after entering the sacrificial firehouse and preparing a grass covering sat down
folded his legs crosswise set his body straight and established mindfulness at the front
Then the Dragon saw that the Fortunate One had entered
and after seeing him pained depressed he belched out smoke
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
Now what if I without having destroyed
flesh muscle bone or bonemarrow
were to overcome the Dragons power with my power
Then the Fortunate One so arranged it with his psychic powers that he also belched out smoke
Then that Dragon unbearably angry blazed forth
The Fortunate One having attained the fireelement also blazed forth
and both of them burned so bright that it was as if the sacrificial firehouse on fire
in flames was burning down
Then those yogis having surrounded the sacrificial firehouse said this
The Great Ascetic is surely intelligent
Then the Fortunate One with the passing of that night
without harming that Dragons tegument skin
flesh muscle bone or bonemarrow
after overcoming the Dragons power with his own power and dropping him into his bowl
showed him to the yogi Uruvelakassapa saying
This is your Dragon Kassapa his power was overcome by my power
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
psychic power with his own power
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Fortunate One while walking gradually on walking tour
approached Bārāṇasī and the groupoffive monks
at the Deer Park in Isipatana
The groupoffive monks saw the Fortunate One coming from afar
and after seeing him they resolved among themselves on this course of action
This Ascetic Gotama who is coming friends is given to luxury
forsaking the striving he has gone back to luxury
He should certainly not be worshipped or stood up for
nor should his bowl and robe be taken
however we can prepare a seat  if he wishes he will sit down
As the Fortunate One approached the groupoffive monks
the groupoffive monks were unable to continue with their own agreement
and after going out to meet the Fortunate One one of them took the Fortunate Ones bowl and robe
one prepared the seat
one placed the water for washing the feet the footstool and the footstand
and the Fortunate One sat down on the prepared seat
and while sitting the Fortunate One washed his feet
Then they addressed the Fortunate One by name and by the word friend
After this was said the Fortunate One said this to the groupoffive monks
Do not address the Fortunate One by name monks and by the word friend
the Realised One is a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha
lend an ear monks I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless
I will teach the Dhamma and following the path as it has been preached
after no long time you will attain that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
and will dwell having known experienced and attained it yourselves in this very life
After this was said the groupoffive monks said this to the Fortunate One
But you friend Gotama
that practice that difficult way of living
did not arrive at a state beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
So how can you now given to luxury
forsaking the striving gone back to luxury attain
a state beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
After this was said the Fortunate One said this to the groupoffive monks
The Realised One monks is not given to luxury
is not forsaking the striving and has not gone back to luxury
The Realised One is a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha
lend an ear monks I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless
I will teach the Dhamma and following the path as it has been preached
after no long time you will attain that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
and will dwell having known experienced and attained it yourselves in this very life
For a second time the groupoffive monks said this to the Fortunate One
But you friend Gotama by that ascetic lifestyle
that practice that difficult way of living
did not arrive at a state beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
So how can you now given to luxury
forsaking the striving gone back to luxury attain
a state beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
For a second time the Fortunate One said this to the groupoffive monks
The Realised One monks is not given to luxury
is not forsaking the striving and has not gone back to luxury
The Realised One is a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha
lend an ear monks I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless
I will teach the Dhamma and following the path as it has been preached
after no long time you will attain that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
and will dwell having known experienced and attained it yourself in this very life
For a third time the groupoffive monks said this to the Fortunate One
But you friend Gotama by that ascetic lifestyle
that practice that difficult way of living
did not arrive at a state beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
So how can you now given to luxury
forsaking the striving gone back to luxury attain
a state beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
After this was said the Fortunate One said this to the groupoffive monks
Are you aware of my having spoken to you like this before
Certainly not venerable Sir
The Realised One is a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha
lend an ear monks I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless
I will teach the Dhamma and following the path as it has been preached
after no long time you will attain that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
and will dwell having known experienced and attained it yourself in this very life
and the Fortunate One was able to persuade the groupoffive monks
Then the groupoffive monks listened to the Fortunate One
they lent an ear so as to attend with their mind to deep knowledge
Then the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
I am liberated from all snares monks both divine and human
you are also liberated from all snares monks both divine and human
Go on a walk
out of compassion for the world for the welfare benefit and happiness of gods and men
Do not let two go by one way
which is good in the beginning good in the middle good in the end with its meaning with its proper phrasing
explain the spiritual life which is complete full and pure
there are beings with little dust on the eyes who are perishing through not hearing the Dhamma
there will be those who will understand the Dhamma
I will go monks to Uruvelā and Senāni Village
in order to teach the Dhamma
Then the Wicked Māra approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching the Fortunate One he spoke this verse
You are bound with all the snares both divine and human
You are bound in great bonds you are not free from me ascetic
I am liberated from all snares both divine and human
I am liberated from the great bonds you are brought low EndMaker
The snare is in the very space the mind travels through
Therefore it is in bondage you are not free from me ascetic
Forms sounds scents tastes tangibles delight the mind
But for me there is no desire you are brought low EndMaker
Then the Wicked Māra understood The Fortunate One knows me the Happy One knows me
and pained depressed he vanished right there
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he announced the time saying
It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
You go ahead Kassapa I am coming
After sending away the yogi Uruvelakassapa
picking a fruit from the RoseApple tree after which the RoseApple Island is named
and arriving earlier he sat down in the sacrificial firehouse
The yogi Uruvelakassapa saw the Fortunate One sitting in the sacrificial firehouse
and after seeing him he said this to the Fortunate One
By what path Great Ascetic did you come
I set out earlier than you
but you arriving earlier are already sitting down in the sacrificial firehouse
Here Kassapa after sending you away
picking a fruit from the RoseApple tree after which the RoseApple Island is named
and arriving earlier I sat down in the sacrificial firehouse
This is the RoseApple fruit Kassapa
endowed with good colour scent and taste
if you wish you can eat it
Enough Great Ascetic you surely brought it you should surely eat it
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
since after sending me away earlier
picking a fruit from the RoseApple tree after which the RoseApple Island is named
and arriving earlier he can sit down in the sacrificial firehouse
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Fortunate One having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapas food
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket
Then the Fortunate One after dressing in the morning time and picking up his bowl and robe
went with the venerable Yasa as the ascetic who attends on him
to the merchant householders home
and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat
Then the venerable Yasas Mother
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
The Fortunate One spoke about the gradual teaching to them
that is to say talk about giving talk about virtue talk about heaven
the danger degradation and defilement of sensual desires
and the advantages of renunciation these he explained
When the Fortunate One knew that they had ready minds pliable minds
open minds uplifted minds confident minds
he explained to him the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves
Suffering Origination Cessation Path
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain
will take the dye well
just so to them on that very seat
the dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma arose
Whatever has the nature of arising
all that has the nature of ceasing
They having seen the Dhamma attained the Dhamma
understood the Dhamma penetrated the Dhamma crossed over uncertainty being without doubts
having attained full confidence having become independent of others in the Teachers teaching said this to the Fortunate One
Excellent venerable Sir Excellent venerable Sir
Just as venerable Sir one might set upright what has been overturned
or open up what has been closed or show a path to one who is lost
or carry an oil lamp into the darkness thinking those with vision will see forms
just so has the Dhamma been explained by the Fortunate One in countless ways
We go venerable Sir to the Fortunate One for refuge
and to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks
Please bear it in mind Fortunate One that we are female lay followers
who have gone for refuge from today forward for as long as we have the breath of life
and they became the first female lay disciples in the world with the threerefuge formula
Then Yasas Mother and Father and former wife
the Fortunate One and the venerable Yasa with excellent food and drinks
when the Fortunate One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl sat down on one side
Then the Fortunate One after Yasas Mother and Father and former wife
o had been instructed roused enthused and cheered
with a Dhamma talk having risen from the seat went away
Then the Fortunate One having dwelt in Bārāṇasī as long as he liked
left on a walking tour for Uruvelā
Then the Fortunate One having gone down from the road
approached a certain jungle thicket
and after approaching and entering that jungle thicket
he sat down at the root of a certain tree
Then at that time a group of thirty good friends
were amusing themselves in that jungle thicket
One who was not married
Then that harlot while they were amusing themselves heedlessly
having taken his belongings ran away
Then those friends doing their friend a service
were searching for that woman and wandering around in that jungle thicket
They saw the Fortunate One sitting at the root of a certain tree
and after seeing him they approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching they said this to the Fortunate One
Can the Fortunate One venerable Sir see a woman
But why young men look for a woman
Here venerable Sir we a group of thirty good friends together with our wives
were amusing ourselves in this jungle thicket
One who was not married had for that reason brought along a harlot
Then that harlot venerable Sir while we were amusing ourselves heedlessly
having taken his belongings ran away
Therefore we venerable Sir doing our friend a service
are searching for that woman and wandering around in this jungle thicket
What do you think of this young men what is better for you
that you should search for a woman or that you should search for yourselves
This is better for us venerable Sir that we should search for ourselves
Then young men be seated I will teach the Dhamma to you
Certainly venerable Sir said that group of good friends
and after worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
The Fortunate One spoke about the gradual teaching to them
that is to say talk about giving talk about virtue talk about heaven
the danger degradation and defilement of sensual desires
and the advantages of renunciation these he explained
When the Fortunate One knew that they had ready minds pliable minds
open minds uplifted minds confident minds
he explained to them the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves
Suffering Origination Cessation Path
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain
will take the dye well
just so to them on that very seat
the dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma arose
Whatever has the nature of arising
all that has the nature of ceasing
They having seen the Dhamma attained the Dhamma
understood the Dhamma penetrated the Dhamma crossed over uncertainty being without doubts
having attained full confidence having become independent of others in the Teachers teaching said this to the Fortunate One
May we receive the goingforth venerable Sir in the presence of the Fortunate One
may we receive the full ordination
Come monks
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering
That was these venerable ones full ordination
The Tale of the Good Group of Friends is Finished
Then Brahmā Sahampati
having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with his surpassing beauty
approached the Fortunate One and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One
he stood at one side like a great mass of fire
having colours more brilliant and more excellent than the former colours
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa with the passing of that night
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he said this to the Fortunate One
It is time Great Ascetic the meal is ready
Who was that Great Ascetic who towards the end of the night
having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with his surpassing beauty
approached you and after approaching and worshipping you
stood at one side like a great mass of fire
having colours more brilliant and more excellent than the former colours
That Kassapa was Brahmā Sahampati
who approached me to listen to the Dhamma
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa
Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic
since even Brahmā Sahampati will approach him to listen to the Dhamma
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am
Then the Fortunate One having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapas food
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket
Then at that time at Bārāṇasī
there was a delicate young man of good family Yasa by name
There were three palaces for him one for the winter time one for the summer time and one for the rainy season
During the four months in the rainy season palace while a female
he did not descend to the bottom of the palace
Then while the young man Yasa
possessed of and endowed with the five strands of sensual pleasure was being entertained
he fell asleep first and his retinue fell asleep afterwards
and all night an oillamp burned
Then the young man Yasa after waking first
saw his retinue sleeping one with a lute in her armpit
another with a small drum on her neck another with a drum on her chest
another with hair dishevelled another dribbling another muttering
so that it seemed as if there was a cemetery close at hand
Having seen this the danger became clear to him and his mind was established in worldweariness
Then the young man Yasa uttered this exalted utterance
Tribulation indeed ruination indeed
Then the young man Yasa after donning his golden slippers
went to the door of his dwelling
Divine beings
o Let there be no obstacle to the goingforth of the young man Yasa
from the home to the homeless life
Then the young man Yasa went to the city gate
Divine beings opened the gate thinking
o Let there be no obstacle to the goingforth of the young man Yasa
from the home to the homeless life
Then the young man Yasa approached the Deer Park at Isipatana
Then at that time towards the time of dawn after rising the Fortunate One
was walking in the open air
The Fortunate One saw the young man Yasa coming while still far away
and after seeing him and descending from the walkway he sat down on the prepared seat
Then the young man Yasa not far from the Fortunate One uttered this exalted utterance
Tribulation indeed ruination indeed
Then the Fortunate One said this to the young man Yasa
This Yasa is not tribulation this is not ruination
come Yasa sit down and I will teach Dhamma to you
Then the young man Yasa thinking It seems this is not tribulation this is not ruination
joyful uplifted after taking off his golden slippers approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
To the young man Yasa sitting at one side
the Fortunate One spoke about the gradual teaching
that is to say talk about giving talk about virtue talk about heaven
the danger degradation and defilement of sensual desires
and the advantages of renunciation these he explained
When the Fortunate One knew that the young man Yasa
had a ready mind a pliable mind an open mind an uplifted mind a confident mind
he explained to him the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves
Suffering Origination Cessation Path
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain
will take the dye well
just so to the young man Yasa on that very seat
the dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma arose
Whatever has the nature of arising
all that has the nature of ceasing
Then the Fortunate One having dwelt at Gayās Head for as long as he liked
left on walking tour for Rājagaha
together with a great Community of monks
with a thousand monks all of whom were formerly yogis
Then the Fortunate One walking gradually on walking tour
went and entered Rājagaha
There the Fortunate One dwelt near Rājagaha
by the Suppatiṭṭha Shrine in the Palmyra Wood
The Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra heard
The ascetic Gotama the Sakyan Son who has gone forth from the Sakya family
has arrived in Rājagaha and is dwelling near Rājagaha
by the Suppatiṭṭha Shrine in the Palmyra Garden
But about that Fortunate One Gotama
this beautiful report has gone round
Such is he the Fortunate One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
the one endowed with understanding and good conduct the Happy One the one who understands the worlds
the unsurpassed guide for those people who need taming
the Teacher of gods and men the Buddha the Fortunate One
This world with its gods Māra and Brahmā
this generation with its ascetics and brāhmaṇas princes and men
he makes known after gaining deep knowledge for himself
He teaches the Dhamma which is good in the beginning
good in the middle good in the end with its meaning with its proper phrasing
and explains the spiritual life which is complete full and pure
But the sight of such Worthy Ones is good
Then the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra
surrounded by twelve myriads
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down at one side
Of those twelve myriads of brāhmaṇas and householders from Magadha
some after worshipping the Fortunate One sat down on one side
Some exchanged greetings with the Fortunate One
and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings sat down on one side
Some after raising their hands in respectful salutation to the Fortunate One sat down on one side
Some after announcing their name and family to the Fortunate One sat down on one side
Some while keeping silent sat down on one side
Then this occurred to those twelve myriads
of brāhmaṇas and householders from Magadha
How is it does the Great Ascetic live the spiritual life under Uruvelakassapa
or does Uruvelakassapa live the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic
that had arisen in the minds of the Magadhan brāhmaṇas and householders
addressed the venerable Uruvelakassapa with a verse
 Having seen what did you one of Uruvelā
Who spoke of austerity
I ask you the reason for this Kassapa
Why did you give up the fire sacrifice
 The sacrifices speak of forms sounds
And also tastes sensuality and women
Having understood that in the attachments this is a stain
I therefore take no delight in offerings and sacrifices
If your mind takes no delight Kassapa said the Fortunate One
In forms sounds and also tastes
Then where in the world with its gods and men
Does your mind take delight Kassapa speak about this
Having seen the state of peace free of attachments
That nothingness unattached to the sensual realm
The Unchangeable
I therefore take no delight in offerings and sacrifices
Then the venerable Uruvelakassapa after rising from his seat
arranging his outer robe on one shoulder
and falling with his head at the feet
said to the Fortunate One
The Fortunate One is my Teacher venerable Sir I am his disciple
the Fortunate One is my Teacher venerable Sir I am his disciple
Then this occurred to those twelve myriads
of brāhmaṇas and householders from Magadha
Uruvelakassapa lives the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic
Then the Fortunate One knowing with his mind the reflection
that had arisen in the minds of the Magadhan brāhmaṇas and householders
spoke about the gradual teaching to them
that is to say talk about giving talk about virtue talk about heaven
the danger degradation and defilement of sensual desires
and the advantages of renunciation these he explained
When the Fortunate One knew that they had ready minds pliable minds
open minds uplifted minds confident minds
he explained to them the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves
Suffering Origination Cessation Path
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain
will take the dye well
just so to eleven myriads of the Magadhan brāhmaṇas and householders
with Bimbisāra at their head on that very seat
the dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma arose
Whatever has the nature of arising
all that has the nature of ceasing
and one myriad of them made known their state as layfollowers
Then the Māgadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra having seen the Dhamma attained the Dhamma
understood the Dhamma penetrated the Dhamma crossed over uncertainty being without doubts
having attained full confidence having become independent of others in the Teachers teaching said this to the Fortunate One
Formerly venerable Sir when I was a boy I had five wishes
which are fulfilled for me now
Formerly venerable Sir when I was a boy this occurred to me
Oh may I be anointed King in the Kingdom 
this was my first wish venerable Sir which has been fulfilled for me now
May a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha enter into my realm 
this was my second wish venerable Sir which has been fulfilled for me now
May I attend on that Fortunate One 
this was my third wish venerable Sir which has been fulfilled for me now
May that Fortunate One teach me the Dhamma 
this was my fourth wish venerable Sir which has been fulfilled for me now
May I understand that Fortunate Ones Dhamma' 
this was my fifth wish venerable Sir which has been fulfilled for me now
Formerly venerable Sir when I was a boy I had these five wishes
and these I am successful in now
Excellent venerable Sir Excellent venerable Sir
Just as venerable Sir one might set upright what has been overturned
or open up what has been closed or show a path to one who is lost
or carry an oil lamp into the darkness thinking those with vision will see forms
just so has the Dhamma been explained by the Fortunate One in countless ways
I go venerable Sir to the Fortunate One for refuge
and to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks
Please bear it in mind Fortunate One that I am a lay follower
who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I have the breath of life
May the Fortunate One consent reverend Sir to me
offering him a meal on the morrow together with the Community of monks
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence
Then the Māgadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra having understood the Fortunate Ones consent
after rising from his seat worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One went away
Then the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra with the passing of that night
having had excellent food and drinks made ready
had the time announced to the Fortunate One saying It is time reverend Sir the meal is ready
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after taking up his bowl and robe entered Rājagaha
together with a great Community of monks
with a thousand monks all of whom were formerly yogis
Then at that time Sakka the Lord of the Gods
having created for himself the form of a young brāhmaṇa
went ahead of the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head
singing these verses
The Tamed One with the Tamed with the former yogis the Liberated One with the Liberated
The Fortunate One who has skin like a golden coin has entered Rājagaha
The Freed One with the Freed with the former yogis the Liberated One with the Liberated
The Fortunate One who has skin like a golden coin has entered Rājagaha
The One Gone Beyond with those Gone Beyond with the former yogis the Liberated One with the Liberated
The Fortunate One who has skin like a golden coin has entered Rājagaha
The Peaceful One with the Peaceful with the former yogis the Liberated One with the Liberated
The Fortunate One who has skin like a golden coin has entered Rājagaha
The One of Ten Abidings Ten Strengths knowing the Ten Things endowed with Ten
The Fortunate One surrounded by the tenhundred has entered Rājagaha
This occurred to the people after seeing Sakka the Lord of the Gods
Handsome indeed is this young brāhmaṇa beautiful indeed is this young brāhmaṇa
pleasing indeed is this young brāhmaṇa
now just who is this young brāhmaṇa
After this was said Sakka the Lord of the Gods addressed those people with a verse
He who is firm tamed in every way pure a person unmatched
A Worthy One a Happy One  I am his attendant in the world
Seniya Bimbisāras residence
and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Community of monks
Then the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra
after serving and satisfying with his own hand the Community of monks
with the Buddha at its head with excellent food and drinks
when the Fortunate One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl sat down on one side
While sittting on one side
this occurred to the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra
Now where can the Fortunate One dwell
that is neither too far from a village nor too near
easy for coming and going approachable for people who desire to hear the Dhamma
uncrowded during the day with little sound at night little noise
which has a lonely atmosphere lying hidden away from men which is suitable for seclusion
Then this occurred to the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra
This Bamboo Wood garden of ours
is neither too far from the village nor too near
easy for coming and going approachable for people who desire to hear the Dhamma
uncrowded during the day with little sound at night little noise
which has a lonely atmosphere lying hidden away from men which is suitable for seclusion
Now what if I were to give the Bamboo Wood garden
to the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head
Then the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra
having taken a golden water vessel dedicated it to the Fortunate One saying
to the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head
The Fortunate One accepted the park
enthusing and cheering the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra with a Dhamma talk
having risen from his seat went away
Then the Fortunate One with this as the basis
after giving a Dhamma talk addressed the monks saying
I allow monks a park
At that time the Awakened One
on the bank of the river Nerañjarā at the root of the Awakening tree in the first period after the complete and perfect Awakening
o Then at that time the Fortunate One sat at the root of the Awakening tree
in one crosslegged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of liberation
Then the Fortunate One for the first watch of the night
applied his mind thoroughly to conditional origination in forward and reverse order
Because of ignorance there are volitional processes
because of volitional processes consciousness
because of consciousness mind and body
because of mind and body the six sense spheres
because of the six sense spheres contact
because of contact feeling
because of feeling craving
because of craving attachment
because of attachment continuation
because of continuation birth
because of birth old age death
grief lamentation pain sorrow and despair all arise
and so there is an origination of this whole mass of suffering
But from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of volitional processes
from the cessation of volitional processes the cessation of consciousness
from the cessation of consciousness the cessation of mind and body
from the cessation of mind and body the cessation of the six sense spheres
from the cessation of the six sense spheres the cessation of contact
from the cessation of contact the cessation of feeling
from the cessation of feeling the cessation of craving
from the cessation of craving the cessation of attachment
from the cessation of attachment the cessation of continuation
from the cessation of continuation the cessation of birth
from the cessation of birth old age death
grief lamentation pain sorrow and despair all cease
and so there is a cessation of this whole mass of suffering
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
When the nature of things
To the ardent meditating brāhmaṇa
Then all his doubts disappear
Since he knows the nature of a thing and its cause
Then the Fortunate One
applied his mind thoroughly to conditional origination in forward and reverse order
Because of ignorance there are volitional processes
because of volitional processes consciousness
because of consciousness mind and body
because of mind and body the six sense spheres
because of the six sense spheres contact

from the cessation of continuation the cessation of birth
from the cessation of birth old age death
grief lamentation pain sorrow and despair all cease
and so there is a cessation of this whole mass of suffering
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
When the nature of things becomes really manifest
To the ardent meditating brāhmaṇa
Then all his doubts disappear
Since the destruction of causes has been understood
Then the Fortunate One for the last watch of the night
applied his mind thoroughly to conditional origination in forward and reverse order
Because of ignorance there are volitional processes
because of volitional processes consciousness
because of consciousness mind and body
because of mind and body the six sense spheres

and so there is a cessation of this whole mass of suffering
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
When the nature of things becomes really manifest
To the ardent meditating brāhmaṇa
He stands dispelling Māras army
Just like the sun lighting up the firmament
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
To whom should I first teach the Dhamma
Who will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly 
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
This ḷāra Kālāma
for a long time he has been one with little dust on his eyes
Now what if I first teach the Dhamma to ḷāra Kālāma
He will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly
Then an invisible god
ḷāra Kālāma died
and this knowledge arose in the Fortunate One ḷāra Kālāma died seven days ago
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
ḷāra Kālāma had great understanding
if he had heard this Dhamma he would have understood it quickly
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
To whom should I first teach the Dhamma
Who will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
This Uddaka Rāmaputta is wise learned intelligent
for a long time he has been one with little dust on his eyes
Now what if I first teach the Dhamma to Uddaka Rāmaputta
He will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly
Then an invisible god informed the Fortunate One
Uddaka Rāmaputta died yesterday evening
and this knowledge arose in the Fortunate One Uddaka Rāmaputta died yesterday evening
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
Uddaka Rāmaputta had great understanding
if he had heard this Dhamma he would have understood it quickly
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
To whom should I first teach the Dhamma
Who will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly 
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
The groupoffive monks
they attended on me when I was striving resolutely
Now what if I first teach the Dhamma to the groupoffive monks
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
Where are the groupoffive monks dwelling now
The Fortunate One saw with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses that of normal men
that the groupoffive monks were dwelling near Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana
Then the Fortunate One having stayed for the Rains Retreat
I monks through wise application of thought through wise endeavour
have attained supreme liberation have experienced supreme liberation
you also monks through wise application of thought through wise endeavour
have attained supreme liberation have experienced supreme liberation
Then the Wicked Māra approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching the Fortunate One he spoke this verse
You are bound with Māras snares both divine and human
You are bound in Māras bonds you are not free from me ascetic
I am liberated from Māras snares both divine and human
I am liberated from Māras bonds you are brought low EndMaker
Then the Wicked Māra understood The Fortunate One knows me the Happy One knows me
and pained depressed he vanished right there
sons of good families of greater and lesser merchants in Bārāṇasī
named Vimala Subāhu Puṇṇaji and Gavampati
The young man Yasa it seems after shaving off his hair and beard
and donning brown garments
After hearing it this occurred to them
This is not an inferior Dhamma and Discipline not an inferior goingforth
in which the young man Yasa after shaving off his hair and beard
and donning brown garments has gone forth from the home to the homeless life
They approached the venerable Yasa
and after approaching and worshipping the venerable Yasa they stood on one side
Then the venerable Yasa took those four householder friends
and approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side the venerable Yasa said this to the Fortunate One
These venerable Sir are four of my householder friends
sons of good families of greater and lesser merchants in Bārāṇasī
named Vimala Subāhu Puṇṇaji and Gavampati
please advise them Fortunate One please instruct them
The Fortunate One spoke about the gradual teaching to them
that is to say talk about giving talk about virtue talk about heaven
the danger degradation and defilement of sensual desires
and the advantages of renunciation these he explained
When the Fortunate One knew that they had ready minds pliable minds
open minds uplifted minds confident minds
he explained to them the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves
Suffering Origination Cessation Path
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain
will take the dye well
just so to them on that very seat
the dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma arose
Whatever has the nature of arising
all that has the nature of ceasing
They having seen the Dhamma attained the Dhamma
understood the Dhamma penetrated the Dhamma crossed over uncertainty being without doubts
having attained full confidence having become independent of others in the Teachers teaching said this to the Fortunate One
May we receive the goingforth venerable Sir in the presence of the Fortunate One
may we receive the full ordination
Come monks said the Fortunate One the Dhamma has been wellproclaimed
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering
That was these venerable ones full ordination
Then the Fortunate One gave advice and instruction with a Dhamma talk to those monks
As the Fortunate One gave advice and instruction with a Dhamma talk
their minds were liberated from the pollutants without attachment
and at that time there were eleven Worthy Ones in the world
Then the Fortunate One having dwelt for as long as he liked
left on walking tour for Bārāṇasī
The Abstainer
going along the highway between the Bodhi tree and Gayā
and after seeing him he said this to the Fortunate One
Your faculties friend
on account of whom friend did you go forth
or who is your teacher or what Dhamma do you prefer
After this was said the Fortunate One addressed the Abstainer Upaka with verses
AllConquering AllWise am I
Undefiled in regard to all things
Having given up everything liberated through the destruction of craving
Having deep knowledge myself who should I point to as Teacher
There is no Teacher for me
There is no person equal to me in the world with its gods
I am a Worthy One in the world I am the Unsurpassed Teacher
I am the One Perfect Sambuddha cool and passionless
I go to Kāsīs city
I will beat the drum of the Deathless in a world that is blind
It is as if you claim friend you are a Worthy One an Infinite Victor
There are surely Victors like me
I have been victorious over all wicked things therefore Upaka I am a Victor
When this was said the Abstainer Upaka after saying It may be so friend
shaking his head and taking the wrong path
Then with the passing of seven days the Fortunate One
after arising from that concentration
approached the Mucalinda tree from the root of the Goatherds Banyan tree
he sat in one crosslegged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of liberation
Then at that time a great cloud arose out of season
bringing seven days of rainy weather cold winds and overcast days
Then the DragonKing Mucalinda
and surrounding the Fortunate Ones body seven times with his coils
stood having placed his great hood above his head thinking
May the Fortunate One not be cold may the Fortunate One not be hot
may the Fortunate One not be affected by gadflies mosquitoes wind the heat of the sun and serpents
Then the DragonKing Mucalinda with the passing of those seven days
having understood that the sky
after unravelling his coils from the Fortunate Ones body
withdrawing his own form
stood in front of the Fortunate One revering the Fortunate One with raised hands
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
There is happiness and detachment for the one who is satisfied who has heard the Dhamma and who sees
There is happiness for him who is free from illwill in the world who is restrained towards breathing beings
The state of dispassion in the world is happiness the complete transcending of sense desires
But for he who has removed the conceit I am
Then at that time the wanderer Sañjaya
together with a great assembly of wanderers
with two hundred and fifty wanderers
Then at that time Sāriputta and Moggallāna
were living the spiritual life under the wanderer Sañjaya
and there was an agreement amongst themselves
Whoever attains the Deathless first he should inform the other
Then the venerable Assaji having dressed in the morning time
after taking up his bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for alms
pleasing in going forwards in going back in looking ahead in looking around
in bending in stretching having downcast eyes and endowed with good posture
The wanderer Sāriputta saw
the venerable Assaji walking for alms in Rājagaha
pleasing in going forwards in going back in looking ahead in looking around
in bending in stretching having downcast eyes and endowed with good posture
and having seen him this occurred to him
Of those in the world who are Worthy or have entered the path to Worthiness
this monk is a certain one of them
Now what if I having approached this monk were to ask
On account of whom friend did you go forth
who is your teacher what Dhamma do you prefer 
Then this occurred to the wanderer Sāriputta
This is the wrong time to ask the monk
he has entered amongst the houses for alms
Now what if I were to follow along closely behind
with a desire to find the path he has found
Then the venerable Assaji after walking for alms in Rājagaha
and taking his alms food went back
Then the wanderer Sāriputta approached the venerable Assaji
and after approaching he exchanged greetings with the venerable Assaji
and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings he stood on one side
While standing on one side the wanderer Sāriputta
said this to the venerable Assaji
who is your teacher what Dhamma do you prefer
There is friend a Great Ascetic a Sakyan Son who has gone forth from the Sakya family
on account of that Fortunate One I went forth
that Fortunate One is my Teacher that Fortunate Ones Dhamma I prefer
But what is the doctrine of the venerables Teacher what does he say
I am new friend one not long gone forth
recently come to this Dhamma and Discipline
I am not able to teach the Dhamma at length
but I can explain the meaning to you in brief
Then the wanderer Sāriputta said this to the venerable Assaji Friend
Speak little or much but tell the meaning to me
The meaning is useful to me what to do with many words
to the wanderer Sāriputta
Whatever things
And also that which is their cessation
Then to the wanderer Sāriputta after hearing this Dhamma instruction
the dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma arose
Whatever has the nature of arising
all that has the nature of ceasing
And he said This really is the Dhamma if you have penetrated the Sorrowless State
unseen through many myriads of past aeons
Then the wanderer Sāriputta approached the wanderer Moggallāna
The wanderer Moggallāna saw
the wanderer Sāriputta coming while still far away
and after seeing him he said this to the wanderer Sāriputta
Your faculties friend are very clear purified is your skin and bright
have you friend attained the Deathless
Yes friend I have attained the Deathless
But how did you friend attain the Deathless
Here friend I saw the monk Assaji walking for alms in Rājagaha
pleasing in going forwards in going back in looking ahead in looking around
in bending in stretching having downcast eyes and endowed with good posture
and having seen him this occurred to me
Of those in the world who are Worthy or have entered the path to Worthiness
this monk is one of them
Now what if I having approached this monk were to ask
On account of whom friend did you go forth
who is your teacher what Dhamma do you prefer
Then this friend occurred to me
This is the wrong time to ask the monk
he has entered amongst the houses for alms
Now what if I were to follow along close behind this monk
with a desire to find out the path
Then friend the monk Assaji after walking for alms in Rājagaha
and taking his alms food went back
Then I friend approached the monk Assaji
and after approaching I exchanged greetings with the monk Assaji
and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings I stood on one side
While standing on one side friend I said this to the monk Assaji

But what is the doctrine of the venerables Teacher what does he say
I am new friend not long gone forth
recently come to this Dhamma and Discipline
I am not able to teach the Dhamma at length
but I can explain the meaning to you in brief
Then friend I said this to the venerable Assaji Friend
Speak little or much but tell the meaning to me
The meaning is useful to me what to do with many words
Then friend the monk Assaji recited this Dhamma instruction
Whatever things have a cause and source their cause the Realised One told
And also that which is their cessation  such is the Great Ascetics doctrine
Then to the wanderer Moggallāna after hearing this Dhamma instruction
the dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma arose
Whatever has the nature of arising
all that has the nature of ceasing
And he said This really is the Dhamma if you have penetrated the Sorrowless State
unseen through many myriads of past aeons
Then the wanderer Moggallāna said this to the wanderer Sāriputta
Let us go friend to the Fortunate One the Fortunate One is the Teacher for us
These two hundred and fifty wanderers friend
are living here depending on us looking to us

Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached those wanderers
and after approaching they said this to those wanderers

We are living here depending on you venerable ones looking to you venerable ones
if you venerable ones will live the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic
all of us will surely live the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic
Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the wanderer Sañjaya
and after approaching they said this to the wanderer Sañjaya
We are going friend to the Fortunate One the Fortunate One is our Teacher
Enough friend don't go the three of us will look after this group
For a second time Sāriputta and Moggallāna said this to the wanderer Sañjaya

For a third time Sāriputta and Moggallāna said this to the wanderer Sañjaya
We are going friend to the Fortunate One the Fortunate One is our Teacher
Enough friend don't go the three of us will look after this group
Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna taking those two hundred and fifty wanderers
approached the Bamboo Wood
But the wanderer Sañjaya right there threw up hot blood from his mouth
The Fortunate One saw Sāriputta and Moggallāna coming while still far away
and having seen them he addressed the monks saying
These two companions who are coming Kolita and Upatissa
will be my pair of Chief Disciples an auspicious pair
After they had attained deep knowledge in the realm of unsurpassed liberation with the destruction of attachments
The Teacher then spoke about them in the Bamboo Wood saying
These two companions who are coming Kolita and Upatissa
Will be my pair of Chief Disciples an auspicious pair
Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and falling with their heads at the feet of the Fortunate One
they said this to the Fortunate One
May we receive the goingforth venerable Sir in the presence of the Fortunate One
may we receive the full ordination
Come monks said the Fortunate One the Dhamma has been wellproclaimed

That was these venerable ones full ordination
Then the Fortunate One after living near Nāḷandā for as long as he liked
addressed venerable nanda saying
Come nanda let us approach Pāṭaligāma
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks
arrived at Pāṭaligāma
The laymen of Pāṭaligāma heard The Fortunate One it seems had reached Pāṭaligāma
Then the laymen of Pāṭaligāma approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sitting on one side the laymen of Pāṭaligāma said this to the Fortunate One
May the Fortunate One consent reverend Sir to stay in our rest house
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence
Then the laymen of Pāṭaligāma having understood the Fortunate Ones consent

 Then the Fortunate One after instructing rousing enthusing and cheering the laymen of Pāṭaligāma

Very well reverend Sir said those laymen of Pāṭaligāma and after replying to the Fortunate One

Then the Wicked Māra not long after venerable nanda had gone
approached the Fortunate One and after approaching he stood on one side
While standing on one side the Wicked Māra said this to the Fortunate One
May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now reverend Sir may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation
now is the time reverend Sir for the Fortunate Ones Final Emancipation
For these words reverend Sir were spoken by the Fortunate One

May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now reverend Sir may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation
now is the time reverend Sir for the Fortunate Ones Final Emancipation
For these words reverend Sir were spoken by the Fortunate One
I will not attain Final Emancipation Wicked One
for as long as this spiritual life of mine has not become successful and prosperous
well spreadout possessed by many become great
until it is wellexplained amongst Divinities and men
But at present reverend Sir the Fortunate Ones spiritual life
is successful and prosperous well spreadout possessed by many become great
it is wellexplained amongst Divinities and men
May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now reverend Sir may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation
now is the time reverend Sir for the Fortunate Ones Final Emancipation
When that was said the Fortunate One said this to the Wicked Māra
You should have little concern Wicked One
in no long time the Realised One will be Finally Emancipated
after three months have passed from now the Realised One will attain Final Emancipation
Then at the Cāpāla shrine the Fortunate One mindfully with full awareness relinquished the lifeprocess
With the relinquishment of the lifeprocess by the Fortunate One there was a great earthquake
and a fearful horrifying crash of the Divinities thunder drum
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Measurable and immeasurable continuity
And the continuationprocess the Sage relinquished
Content in himself and concentrated
He broke continuity of self like a coat of mail
Now at that time venerable Upavāṇa was standing in front of the Fortunate One
fanning the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One dismissed venerable Upavāṇa saying
Depart monk do not stand in front of me
Then venerable nanda thought
This venerable Upavāṇa has been the Fortunate Ones attendant for a long time
living near to him within proximity
Then at the last moment the Fortunate One dismisses venerable Upavāṇa saying
Depart monk do not stand in front of me
What was the reason what was the cause for the Fortunate One dismissing venerable Upavāṇa saying
Depart monk do not stand in front of me
Then venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
This venerable Upavāṇa has been the Fortunate Ones attendant for a long time
living near to him within proximity
Then at the last moment the Fortunate One dismisses venerable Upavāṇa saying
Depart monk do not stand in front of me
What is the reason reverend Sir what is the cause for the Fortunate One dismissing venerable Upavāṇa saying
Depart monk do not stand in front of me
Almost all of the Divinities
have assembled to see the Realised One
everywhere around Kusinārā and the Mallas Sal Wood at Upavattana for as far as
twelve leagues there is no place even so much as a tip of a pricking hair
unpervaded by powerful Divinities
and the Divinities nanda are complaining saying We have come from afar to see the Realised One
only occasionally infrequently do Realised Ones Worthy Ones Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world
and today during the last watch of the night will be the Realised Ones Final Emancipation
and this powerful monk is stood in front concealing the Realised One
and we are not able to see the Realised One at the last moment 
But what beings and Divinities is the Fortunate One thinking of
There are nanda Divinities in the sky perceiving the Earth who having dishevelled hair are weeping
throwing up their arms falling down as though cut down rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off they are crying
Too quickly the Fortunate One will attain Final Emancipation
too quickly the Happy One will attain Final Emancipation
too quickly the Visionary in the world will disappear
There are nanda Divinities on the Earth perceiving the Earth who having dishevelled hair are weeping
throwing up their arms falling down as though cut down rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off they are crying
Too quickly the Fortunate One will attain Final Emancipation
too quickly the Happy One will attain Final Emancipation
too quickly the Visionary in the world will disappear 
But those Divinities who have cut off passion mindfully with full awareness they endure thinking
Impermanent are all processes how can it be otherwise 
Then the Fortunate One after living near Nādika for as long as he liked
addressed venerable nanda saying
Come nanda let us approach Vesālī
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Vesālī
There the Fortunate One lived near Vesālī in Ambapālīs Wood
There the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
Mindfully and with full awareness monks a monk should live this is our advice to you
And how monks is a monk mindful

The courtesan Ambapālī heard The Fortunate One it seems has reached Vesālī
and is living near Vesālī in my Mango Wood
Then the courtesan Ambapālī after having many great and august vehicles prepared
and mounting those great and august vehicles
departed with those great and august vehicles from Vesālī
and after approaching by vehicle to her pleasure garden as far as the ground for vehicles would allow
and descending from the vehicles she approached the Fortunate One by foot
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One she sat down on one side
 While the courtesan Ambapālī was sitting on one side the Fortunate One
instructed roused enthused and cheered her with a talk about the Teaching
Then the courtesan Ambapālī
having been instructed roused enthused and cheered by the Fortunate One with a talk about the Teaching
said to the Fortunate One
May the Fortunate One consent reverend Sir to me
offering him a meal on the morrow together with the Community of monks
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence
Then the courtesan Ambapālī having understood the Fortunate Ones consent
after rising from her seat worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One went away
The Licchavīs from Vesālī heard The Fortunate One it seems had reached Vesālī
and is living near Vesālī in Ambapālīs Wood
Then those Licchavīs after having many great and august vehicles prepared
and mounting those great and august vehicles
departed with those great and august vehicles from Vesālī
There some of the Licchavīs were blue having a blue appearance with blue clothes and blue decorations
some of the Licchavīs were yellow having a yellow appearance with yellow clothes and yellow decorations
some of the Licchavīs were red having a red appearance with red clothes and red decorations
some of the Licchavīs were white having a white appearance with white clothes and white decorations
Then the courtesan Ambapālī rolled alongside the Licchavī youths
axle by axle wheel by wheel and yoke by yoke
Then those Licchavīs said this to the courtesan Ambapālī
Why do you Ambapālī roll alongside the Licchavī youths
axle by axle wheel by wheel and yoke by yoke
Because I have invited the Fortunate One noble sirs
for a meal on the morrow together with the Community of monks
Give us this meal Ambapālī for a hundred thousand kahapanas
If noble sirs you would give Vesālī and its revenues
still I would not give this meal to you
Then the Licchavīs snapped their fingers thinking
We have surely been defeated by a woman we have surely been defeated by a woman
Then the Licchavīs entered Ambapālīs Wood
The Fortunate One saw those Licchavīs coming from afar
and having seen them he addressed the monks saying
 Let those monks who have not seen the Tāvatisa Divinities monks
look at the Licchavī troupe monks
look upon the Licchavī troupe monks
contemplate the Licchavī troupe monks who are like the Tāvatisa Divinities
Then after the Licchavīs had gone as far as the ground for vehicles would allow
and had descended from the vehicles they approached the Fortunate One by foot
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down at one side
 While the Licchavīs were sitting on one side the Fortunate One
instructed roused enthused and cheered them with a talk about the Teaching
Then the Licchavīs
having been instructed roused enthused and cheered by the Fortunate One with a talk about the Teaching
said to the Fortunate One
Please consent to us offering a meal on the morrow together with the Community of monks
I have already consented to the courtesan Ambapālīs meal on the morrow
Then the Licchavīs snapped their fingers thinking
We have surely been defeated by a woman we have surely been defeated by a woman
Then the Licchavīs after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the Fortunate One
rising from their seats worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One went away
Then the courtesan Ambapālī after the night had passed
having had excellent foodstuffs made ready in her own pleasure park
had the time announced to the Fortunate One saying It is time reverend Sir the meal is ready
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe together with the Community of monks
approached the courtesan Ambapālīs residence
and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat
Then the courtesan Ambapālī with her own hand served and satisfied the Community of monks
with the Buddha at its head with excellent foodstuffs
Then the courtesan Ambapālī when the Fortunate One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl
having taken a certain low seat sat down on one side
While sitting on one side the courtesan Ambapālī said this to the Fortunate One
I donate this pleasure park reverend Sir to the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head
The Fortunate One accepted the pleasure park
 Then the Fortunate One after instructing rousing
enthusing and cheering the courtesan Ambapālī with a talk about the Teaching having risen from the seat went away
There also the Fortunate One while living in Vesālī in Ambapālīs Wood
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching saying
Such is virtue such is concentration such is wisdom
when virtue is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration
when concentration is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom
when wisdom is welldeveloped the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants
that is to say the pollutant of sensuality the pollutant of craving for continued existence the pollutant of ignorance

These nanda are the eight assemblies

Then the Fortunate One with a great Community of monks
went to the river Kakutthā
and after going and entering into the river Kakutthā
bathing and drinking and coming back out he approached the mango wood
and after approaching he addressed venerable Cundaka saying
Come now Cundaka prepare the outer robe folded in four for me
I am weary Cundaka and will lie down
Very well reverend Sir said venerable Cundaka and after replying to the Fortunate One
he prepared the outer robe folded in four
Then the Fortunate One lay down on his right side in the lions posture
after placing one foot on the top of the other mindfully with full awareness having applied his mind to the thought of rising
And venerable Cundaka sat down right there in front of the Fortunate One
The Awakened One having gone to the little river Kakutthā
Which had water that was transparent pleasant and clear
The Teacher very weary entered the river
the Realised One who is unmatched here in the world
After washing and drinking the Teacher came out
And in the middle of the Community of monks at the front
The Teacher the Fortunate One having taught the Teaching here
The Great Sage went to the mango wood
He addressed the monk called Cundaka saying
Spread out the robe folded in four for me to lie down on
Cunda urged by the One with Developed Mind
Very quickly spread the robe folded in four
The Teacher very weary lay down
With Cunda sat right there at the front
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
It may be nanda
that someone might cause remorse for the smith Cunda saying
There is no gain for you friend Cunda it is a poor gain for you
in that the Realised One after eating his last almsfood from you attained Final Emancipation
If there is remorse for Cunda the Smith nanda drive it out in this way saying
There is a gain for you friend Cunda it is a good gain for you
in that the Realised One after eating his last almsfood from you attained Final Emancipation
I heard this face to face with the Fortunate One friend Cunda
I learned it face to face
There are these two almsfoods which have the very same excellent fruit have the very same excellent result
that is a greater fruit a greater result than other almsfood
That almsfood which after eating the Realised One
awakens to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening
and that almsfood which after eating the Realised One
attains Final Emancipation in the Emancipationelement which has no basis for attachment remaining
These are the two almsfoods which have the same fruit have the same result
that is an exceedingly greater fruit a greater result than other almsfood
Friend Cunda the Smith has accumulated a good deed that is conducive to long life

friend Cunda the Smith has accumulated a good deed that is conducive to heaven
 friend Cunda the Smith has accumulated

If there is remorse for Cunda the Smith nanda
it should be driven out in this way
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
For the one who gives merit is increased
From restraint hatred is not accumulated
The skilful one gives up what is bad
Through the destruction of passion hatred and delusion he is emancipated
I will teach you a further seven things which prevent decline
listen to it apply your minds well and I will speak
Very well reverend Sir those monks replied to the Fortunate One

Then the Fortunate One after living near Bhoganagara for as long as he liked
addressed venerable nanda saying
Come nanda let us approach Pāvā
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Pāvā
There the Fortunate One lived near Pāvā in Cunda the Smiths
Cunda the Smith heard
The Fortunate One it seems has arrived at Pāvā
and is dwelling near Pāvā in my mango wood
Then Cunda the Smith approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While Cunda the Smith was sitting on one side
the Fortunate One instructed roused enthused and cheered him with a talk about the Teaching
 Then Cunda the Smith
having been instructed roused enthused and cheered by the Fortunate One with a talk about the Teaching
said this to the Fortunate One
May the Fortunate One consent reverend Sir to me
offering him a meal on the morrow together with the Community of monks
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence
Then Cunda the Smith having understood the Fortunate Ones consent
after rising from his seat worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One went away
Then after the night had passed Cunda the Smith
in his own residence having had excellent foodstuffs made ready
and an abundance of tender pork
had the time announced to the Fortunate One saying It is time reverend Sir the meal is ready
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe together with the Community of monks
approached Cunda the Smiths residence
and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat
Having sat down the Fortunate One addressed Cunda the Smith saying
Serve me with the tender pork you have prepared Cunda
 but serve the Community of monks with the other foodstuffs
which have been prepared
Very well reverend Sir said Cunda the Smith and after replying to the Fortunate One
he served the Fortunate One with the tender pork that had been prepared
but served the Community of monks with the other foodstuffs which had been prepared
Then the Fortunate One addressed Cunda the Smith saying
Throw that left over tender pork into a pit Cunda
for I do not see Cunda
in the world with its Divinities Māra and Brahmā
in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins princes and men
one who having eaten it could completely digest it
except for a Realised One
Very well reverend Sir said Cunda the Smith and after replying to the Fortunate One
and throwing what was left over of that tender pork into a pit
he approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side Cunda the Smith
having been instructed roused enthused and cheered by the Fortunate One with a talk about the Teaching
having risen from the seat went away
Then for the Fortunate One after eating Cunda the Smiths food
a painful affliction arose bloody dysentery
and strong feelings occurred such as end in death
There the Fortunate One mindfully with full awareness bore those pains without being troubled
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Come nanda let us approach Kusinārā
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Having eaten Cunda the Smiths food so I have heard
The Firm One experienced a very strong affliction such as ends in death
 For the Teacher who had eaten tender pork
A very strong sickness arose
While still purging the Fortunate One said
I will go to the town of Kusinārā 
Then the Fortunate One not long after the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra had gone
addressed venerable nanda saying
Go nanda and whatever monks there are living in dependence on Rājagaha
assemble them in the Attendance Hall
Very well reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate One
 and assembling whatever monks there were living in dependence on Rājagaha
in the Attendance Hall he approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he stood on one side
While standing on one side venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
The Community of monks have assembled reverend Sir
now is the time Fortunate One for whatever you are thinking
Then the Fortunate One after rising from his seat approached the Attendance Hall
and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat
While sitting the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
I will teach you seven things which prevent decline

For as long monks as the monks will maintain these seven things which prevent decline
and the monks will agree with these seven things which prevent decline
surely growth monks is to be expected for the monks not decline
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe entered Vesālī for alms
After walking for alms in Vesālī when he was returning from the almsround after the meal
after looking at Vesālī with an elephants look
he addressed venerable nanda saying
This is the last time nanda there will be sight of Vesālī for the Realised One
Come nanda let us approach Bhaṇḍagāma
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Bhaṇḍagāma
There the Fortunate One lived near Bhaṇḍagāma
There the Fortunate One said this to the monks
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration monks of four things
both you and I have been wandering and running along in Sasāra for a long time
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration of Noble Virtue
both you and I have been wandering and running along in Sasāra
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration of Noble Concentrated Development
both you and I have been wandering and running along in Sasāra for a long time
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration of Noble Wisdom
both you and I have been wandering and running along in Sasāra for a long time
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration of Noble Freedom
both you and I have been wandering and running along in Sasāra for a long time
But now this Noble Virtue has been understood and penetrated
this Noble Concentrated Development has been understood and penetrated
this Noble Wisdom has been understood and penetrated
this Noble Freedom has been understood and penetrated
Craving for continued existence has been cut off what leads to rebirth has been exhausted there is no continuation in existence
The Fortunate One said this and after saying this the Happy One the Teacher said something more
Virtue Concentration Wisdom and unsurpassed Freedom
These things have been understood by the Famous Gotama
Thus after knowing it deeply the Buddha declared the Teaching to the monks
The SufferingEnder the Teacher the Visionary One
There also the Fortunate One while living in Bhaṇḍagāma
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching saying
Such is virtue such is concentration such is wisdom
when virtue is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration
when concentration is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom
when wisdom is welldeveloped the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants
that is to say the pollutant of sensuality the pollutant of craving for continued existence the pollutant of ignorance
At one time the Fortunate One was living near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak Mountain
Now at that time the Magadhan King Ajātasattu
had a desire to attack the Vajjians
He said this I will annihilate these Vajjians who are so successful so powerful
I will destroy the Vajjians I will bring about the downfall and destruction of the Vajjians
Then the Magadhan King Ajātasattu the son of Lady Wisdom
addressed the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra saying
Go brahmin and approach the Fortunate One
and after approaching worship the Fortunate Ones feet in my name
and ask whether he is free from sickness free from illness in good health and living comfortably and say
The Magadhan King Ajātasattu the son of Lady Wisdom reverend Sir worships with his head at the Fortunate Ones feet
and asks whether you are free from sickness free from illness in good health and living comfortably
The Magadhan King Ajātasattu the son of Lady Wisdom reverend Sir desires to attack the Vajjians
He says this I will annihilate these Vajjians who are so successful so powerful
I will destroy the Vajjians I will bring about the downfall and destruction of the Vajjians
And just what the Fortunate One says to you after learning it well you must inform me
for the Realised Ones do not speak falsely
Very well dear Sir and the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra
after replying to the Magadhan King Ajātasattu the son of Lady Wisdom
and having many great and august vehicles prepared
and mounting a great and august vehicle
departed with those great and august vehicles from Rājagaha
and after approaching by vehicle to the Vultures Peak Mountain as far as the ground for a vehicle would allow
and descending from the vehicle he approached the Fortunate One by foot
and after approaching he exchanged greetings with the Fortunate One
and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra
The Magadhan King Ajātasattu the son of Lady Wisdom dear Gotama
worships with his head at dear Gotamas feet
and asks whether you are free from sickness free from illness in good health and living comfortably
The Magadhan King Ajātasattu the son of Lady Wisdom dear Gotama desires to attack the Vajjians
He says this I will annihilate these Vajjians who are so successful so powerful
I will destroy the Vajjians I will bring about the downfall and destruction of the Vajjians 
Now at that time Pukkasa Mallaputta a disciple of ḷāra Kālāma
was travelling along the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārā
Pukkasa Mallaputta saw the Fortunate One sitting at the root of a certain tree
And having seen him he approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side Pukkasa Mallaputta said this to the Fortunate One
It is wonderful reverend Sir it is marvellous reverend Sir
that those who have gone forth reverend Sir live such a peaceful living
Formerly reverend Sir ḷāra Kālāma
and was dwelling for the day sat not far away at the root of a certain tree
Then reverend Sir about five hundred wagons
passed by very close to ḷāra Kālāma
Then reverend Sir a certain man
who was traveling along behind those wagons
approached ḷāra Kālāma
and after approaching he said this to ḷāra Kālāma
Did you not see reverend Sir about five hundred wagons pass by
I did not see friend
But reverend Sir did you not hear the sound
I did not hear the sound friend
But reverend Sir were you sleeping
I was not sleeping friend
But reverend Sir were you conscious
Yes friend
So you reverend Sir though conscious and awake
when about five hundred wagons passed by very close
neither saw them nor heard a sound
Why reverend Sir even your doublerobe is covered with dust
Yes friend
Then this occurred to that man
Surely it is wonderful surely it is marvellous
that those who have indeed gone forth live such a peaceful living
Because though conscious and awake
when about five hundred wagons passed by very close
he did not see them or hear a sound
And having gained great confidence in ḷāra Kālāma he left
Now what do you think Pukkusa
which is the more difficult to do or the more difficult to come by
that someone though conscious and awake
when about five hundred wagons passed by very close
should neither see them nor hear a sound
or that someone though conscious and awake when the Divinities rain down when the Divinities throw it down
and the lightning flashes and the thunder crashes forth
should neither see it nor hear a sound
Why reverend Sir what to make of fivehundred wagons
sixhundred wagons sevenhundred wagons eighthundred wagons
ninehundred wagons one thousand wagons or onehundred thousand wagons
This is the more difficult to do or the more difficult to come by
that someone though conscious and awake when the Divinities rain down when the Divinities throw it down
and the lightning flashes and the thunder crashes forth
should neither see it nor hear a sound
One day Pukkusa I was living near tumā at the Decorated House
Now at that time the Divinities rained down the Divinities threw it down
and the lightning flashed and the thunder crashed forth
and not far away from the Decorated House two brothers who were farmers died along with four oxen
Then Pukkusa a great crowd of people having departed from tumā
went to the place where the brothers who were farmers and the four oxen had died
Then Pukkusa at that time after leaving the Decorated House
I was walking in the open air near the gate to the Decorated House
Then Pukkusa a certain man from that crowd approached me
and after approaching and worshipping me he stood on one side
While standing there Pukkusa I said to that man
Why friend has that great crowd of people assembled
Just now reverend Sir the Divinities rained down the Divinities threw it down
and the lightning flashed and the thunder crashed forth
and two brothers who were farmers died along with four oxen
and that great crowd of people assembled here
But where were you reverend Sir
I was right here friend
But reverend Sir did you see it
I did not see friend
But reverend Sir did you hear the sound
I did not hear the sound friend
But reverend Sir were you sleeping
I was not sleeping friend
But reverend Sir were you conscious
Yes friend
So reverend Sir though conscious and awake when the Divinities rained down when the Divinities threw it down
and the lightning flashed and the thunder crashed forth
you neither saw it nor heard a sound
Yes friend
Then Pukkusa this occurred to that man
Surely it is wonderful surely it is marvellous
that those who have indeed gone forth live such a peaceful living
Because though conscious and awake when the Divinities rained down when the Divinities threw it down
and the lightning flashed and the thunder crashed forth
he did not see it or hear a sound
And after gaining great confidence in me
worshipping and circumamblating me he left
After this was said Pukkusa Mallaputta said this to the Fortunate One
That faith reverend Sir I have in ḷāra Kālāma
I clear away as with a great wind I wash it away as with a fastflowing river
Excellent reverend Sir Excellent reverend Sir
Just as reverend Sir one might set upright what has been overturned
or open up what has been closed or show a path to one who is lost
or bear an oil lamp in the darkness so that one who has eyes can see forms
just so has the Teaching been made clear by the Fortunate One in more than one way
I go to the Fortunate One reverend Sir for refuge
and to the Teaching and to the Community of monks
Please bear it in mind Fortunate One that I am a lay disciple
who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I am furnished with life
Then Pukkusa Mallaputta addressed a certain man saying
Come my man bring me a pair of polished goldcoloured robes ready to wear
Very well reverend Sir said that man and after replying to Pukkusa Mallaputta
he brought a pair of polished goldcoloured robes ready to wear
Then Pukkusa Mallaputta
offered that pair of polished goldcoloured robes ready to wear to the Fortunate One saying
 Please accept reverend Sir this pair of polished goldcoloured robes ready to wear
out of compassion for me Fortunate One
Then Pukkusa clothe me with one and nanda with the other
Very well reverend Sir said Pukkusa Mallaputta and after replying to the Fortunate One
he clothed the Fortunate One with one and nanda with the other
 Then the Fortunate One instructed Pukkusa Mallaputta
roused enthused and cheered him with a talk about the Teaching
Then Pukkusa Mallaputta
having been instructed roused enthused and cheered by the Fortunate One with a talk about the Teaching
after rising from his seat worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One departed
Then venerable nanda not long after Pukkusa Mallaputta had departed
offered that pair of polished goldcoloured robes ready to wear to the Fortunate One
and when placed on the Fortunate Ones body they appeared to have lost their gleam
Then venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
It is wonderful reverend Sir it is marvellous reverend Sir
how pure and clean is the Realised Ones skincolour reverend Sir
This pair of polished goldcoloured robes ready to wear reverend Sir
when placed on the Fortunate Ones body have lost their gleam
Just so nanda on two occasions nanda
the Realised Ones skincolour becomes exceedingly pure and clean
That night nanda the Realised One perfectly awakens to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening
and that night the Realised One is Finally Emancipated in the Emancipationelement which has no basis for attachment remaining
On these two occasions
the Realised Ones skincolour is exceedingly pure and clean
Today nanda during the last watch of the night
near to Kusinārā in the Mallas Sal Wood at Upavattana
between a pair of Sal trees will be the Realised Ones Final Emancipation
Come nanda let us approach River Kakutthā
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
A pair of polished goldcoloured robes was offered by Pukkusa
Once clothed with it the Teachers golden skin colour shone forth

Then the Fortunate One addressed the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra saying
At one time brahmin I was living near Vesālī near to the Sārandada Shrine
and there I taught the Vajjians these seven things which prevent decline
For as long brahmin as the Vajjians maintain these seven things which prevent decline

After this was said the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra addressed the Fortunate One saying
If the Vajjians dear Gotama were endowed with even one or the other of these seven things which prevent decline
surely growth is to be expected not decline
what to say about having seven things which prevent decline
The Vajjians cannot be overcome dear Gotama by the Magadhan King Ajātasattu the son of Lady Wisdom
by war but only through diplomacy or through the breaking of the alliance
And now dear Gotama we shall go as we have many duties and there is much which ought to be done
Now is the time brahmin for whatever you are thinking
Then the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra
after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the Fortunate One rose from his seat and departed

Then the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
Where monks is nanda
This venerable nanda reverend Sir after entering the living place

Then the Fortunate One addressed a certain monk saying
Go monk and in my name address nanda saying

Very well reverend Sir and after replying to the Fortunate One
he approached venerable nanda
and after approaching he said this to venerable nanda

At one time nanda I was living at Uruvelā

it is wellexplained amongst Divinities and men
May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now reverend Sir may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation

When that was said nanda I said this to the Wicked Māra
You should have little concern Wicked One
in no long time the Realised One will be Finally Emancipated
after three months have passed from now the Realised One will attain Final Emancipation
Now today nanda at the Cāpāla Shrine the Realised One
mindfully with full awareness gave up the lifeprocess
When this was said venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
Let the Fortunate One remain reverend Sir for the lifespan let the Happy One remain for the lifespan
for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people having compassion on the world
for the welfare benefit and happiness of Divinities and men
Enough nanda do not beg the Realised One
now is the wrong time nanda for begging the Realised One
For a second time venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
Let the Fortunate One remain reverend Sir for the lifespan let the Happy One remain for the lifespan
for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people having compassion on the world
for the welfare benefit and happiness of Divinities and men
Enough nanda do not beg the Realised One
now is the wrong time nanda for begging the Realised One
For a third time venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
Let the Fortunate One remain reverend Sir for the lifespan let the Happy One remain for the lifespan
for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people having compassion on the world
for the welfare benefit and happiness of Divinities and men
Do you nanda have faith in the Realised Ones Awakening
Yes reverend Sir
Then why do you nanda harrass the Realised One up and till the third time
Face to face with me reverend Sir face to face I have heard you say
 Whoever has developed nanda
made much of carried on established maintained augmented and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power
could if he wanted remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan
 The Realised One has developed nanda
made much of carried on established maintained augmented and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power
If he wanted nanda the Realised One
could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan 
Do you have faith nanda
Yes reverend Sir
Then nanda there is this wrongdoing for you there is this fault for you
in that you despite such a gross hint being made by the Realised One
such a gross suggestion being made was unable to penetrate it
and did not beg the Realised One saying
May the Fortunate One remain reverend Sir for the lifespan may the Happy One remain for the lifespan
for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people out of compassion for the world
for the welfare benefit and happiness of Divinities and men
If you nanda had begged the Realised One twice the Realised One might have rejected your speech
but would have accepted it on the third occasion
So nanda there is this wrongdoing for you there is this fault for you
Now at that time a wanderer named Subhadda
The wanderer Subhadda heard
Today it seems in the last watch of the night
will be the ascetic Gotamas attainment of Final Emancipation
Then this occurred to the wanderer Subhadda
I have heard this from old elderly wanderers
who are teachers and teachers teachers when they said
Only occasionally rarely do Realised Ones Worthy Ones Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world
Today in the last watch of the night will be the ascetic Gotamas attainment of Final Emancipation
There is a doubt that has arisen for me
and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus
The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching
in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt 
Then the wanderer Subhadda approached the Mallas Sal Wood at Upavattana
and approached venerable nanda
and after approaching he said to venerable nanda
I have heard this from old elderly wanderers dear nanda
who are teachers and teachers teachers when they said
Only occasionally rarely do Realised Ones Worthy Ones Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world
Today in the last watch of the night will be the ascetic Gotamas attainment of Final Emancipation
There is a doubt that has arisen for me
and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus
The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching
in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt
It would be well dear nanda if I was allowed to see the ascetic Gotama
After this was said venerable nanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda
Enough friend Subhadda do not trouble the Realised One the Fortunate One is exhausted
For a second time the wanderer Subhadda said this to venerable nanda
I have heard this from old elderly wanderers dear nanda
who are teachers and teachers teachers when they said
Only occasionally rarely do Realised Ones Worthy Ones Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world
Today in the last watch of the night will be the Realised Ones attainment of Final Emancipation
There is a doubt that has arisen for me
and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus
The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching
in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt
It would be well dear nanda if I was allowed to see the ascetic Gotama
For a second time venerable nanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda
Enough friend Subhadda do not trouble the Realised One the Fortunate One is exhausted
For a third time the wanderer Subhadda said this to venerable nanda
I have heard this from old elderly wanderers dear nanda
who are teachers and teachers teachers when they said
Only occasionally rarely do Realised Ones Worthy Ones Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world
Today in the last watch of the night will be the ascetic Gotamas attainment of Final Emancipation
There is a doubt that has arisen for me
and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus
The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching
in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt
It would be well dear nanda if I was allowed to see the ascetic Gotama
For a third time venerable nanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda
Enough friend Subhadda do not trouble the Realised One the Fortunate One is exhausted
The Fortunate One heard venerable nanda
having this conversation with the wanderer Subhadda
Then the Fortunate One said this to venerable nanda
Enough nanda do not obstruct Subhadda
allow Subhadda to see the Realised One
Whatever Subhadda will ask of me
all of it he will ask of me seeking for deep knowledge and not to trouble me
Whatever question is put I will answer and he will quickly understand it
Then venerable nanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda
Go friend Subhadda the Fortunate One has given you permission
Then the wanderer Subhadda approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he exchanged greetings with the Fortunate One
and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side the wanderer Subhadda said this to the Fortunate One
Those ascetics and brahmins dear Gotama who have a community a group who teach a group
wellknown famous religious founders agreed upon as good for the people
such as Pūraṇa Kassapa Makkhali Gosāla Ajita Kesakambala
Pakudha Kaccāyana Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta
have they all understood according to their own avowal
Have they all not understood
Or have some understood
Or have some not understood
Enough Subhadda stop this
Have they all understood according to their own avowal
Have they all not understood
Or have some understood
Or have some not understood
I will teach the Teaching to you Subhadda
listen to it apply your mind well and I will speak
Very well reverend Sir the wanderer Subhadda replied to the Fortunate One
and the Fortunate One said this
Wherever Subhadda the Noble Eightfold Path is not found in a Teaching and Discipline
there a true ascetic is not found
there a second true ascetic is not found
there a third true ascetic is not found
there a fourth true ascetic is not found
But wherever Subhadda the Noble Eightfold Path is found in a Teaching and Discipline
there a true ascetic is found
there a second true ascetic is found
there a third true ascetic is found
there a fourth true ascetic is found
In this Teaching and Discipline Subhadda the Noble Eightfold Path is found
here a true ascetic is found
here a second true ascetic is found
here a third true ascetic is found
here a fourth true ascetic is found
Void are the outside doctrines of these other ascetics
but if monks should live well
At twentynine years Subhadda
I went forth a seeker of what is good
More than fifty years ago
Wherefore I am truly gone forth Subhadda
Existing in the realm of the right Teaching
Outside of this there is no true ascetic
a second true ascetic is not found
a third true ascetic is not found
a fourth true ascetic is not found
Void are the outside doctrines of these other ascetics Subhadda
but if monks should live well the world will not be void of Worthy Ones
After this was said the wanderer Subhadda said this to the Fortunate One
Excellent reverend Sir Excellent reverend Sir
Just as reverend Sir one might set upright what has been overturned
or open up what has been closed or show a path to one who is lost
or bear an oil lamp in the darkness
so that one who has eyes can see forms
just so has the Teaching been made clear by the Fortunate One in more than one way
I go to the Fortunate One for refuge reverend Sir
and to the Teaching and to the Community of monks
May I receive the goingforth reverend Sir in the presence of the Fortunate One
may I receive the full ordination
Those who were formerly of another sect who in this Teaching and Discipline
desire the goingforth who desire full ordination live on probation for four months
and at the end of four months
the minds of the monks being satisfied they give the goingforth and the full ordination into the monkhood
But I understand there is a distinction between persons in this case
If reverend Sir those who were formerly of another sect who in this Teaching and Discipline
desire the goingforth who desire full ordination live on probation for four months
and at the end of four months
the minds of the monks being satisfied they give the goingforth and the full ordination into the monkhood
then I will live on probation for four years and at the end of four years
the minds of the monks being satisfied they can give the goingforth and the full ordination into the monkhood
Then the Fortunate One said this to venerable nanda
Then nanda give the goingforth to Subhadda
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Then the wanderer Subhadda said this to venerable nanda
There are certainly gains for you friend nanda it is certainly a good gain for you friend nanda
that here face to face with the Teacher you have been consecrated with an attendants consecration
The wanderer Subhadda received
the going forth in the presence of the Fortunate One received full ordination
Then not long after ordination venerable Subhadda
while dwelling solitary secluded heedful ardent and resolute
after no long time attained that good for which young gentlemen
rightly go forth from the house to the houseless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
and dwelt having known experienced and attained it himself in this very life
Destroyed is rebirth
accomplished is the spiritual life
done is what ought to be done
there is no more of this mundane state  this he knew
And venerable Subhadda became another of the Worthy Ones
He was the last direct disciple of the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One after living near Koṭigāma for as long as he liked
addressed venerable nanda saying
Come nanda let us approach the Nādikas
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks arrived at the Nādikas
There the Fortunate One lived near one of the Nādikas in the Brick House
Then venerable nanda approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One

In excess of ninety laymen nanda have died in Nādika

In excess of fivehundred laymen nanda have died in Nādika
who through the complete destruction of three fetters
are StreamEnterers no longer subject to falling into the lower realms and have a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening
But it is not such a wonder nanda that those who have become human should die
but if every time there is a death in this place after approaching the Realised One
you were to ask about it nanda that would be troublesome
Therefore nanda I will teach this presentation of the Teaching called the Mirror of the True Nature of Things
endowed with which a Noble Disciple desiring to do so may declare about himself
Exhausted is birth in Hell exhausted is birth in an animals womb
exhausted is birth in the realm of the Fallen Spirits exhausted is falling into an unhappy destiny in the lower realms
I am a StreamEnterer no longer subject to falling into the lower realms and have a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening
And what nanda is this presentation of the Teaching called the Mirror of the True Nature of Things
endowed with which a Noble Disciple desiring to do so may declare about himself
Exhausted is birth in Hell exhausted is birth in an animals womb
exhausted is birth in the realm of the Fallen Spirits exhausted is falling into an unhappy destiny in the lower realms
I am a StreamEnterer no longer subject to falling into the lower realms and have a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening'
Here nanda a Noble Disciple is endowed with perfect confidence in the Buddha thinking
Such is he the Fortunate One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
the one endowed with understanding and good conduct the Happy One the One who understands the worlds
the unsurpassed guide for those people who need taming
the Teacher of Divinities and men the Buddha the Fortunate One
He is endowed with perfect confidence in the Teaching thinking
The Teaching has been wellproclaimed by the Fortunate One
it is visible not subject to time inviting inspection onward leading
and can be understood by the wise for themselves
He is endowed with perfect confidence in the Community thinking
The Fortunate Ones Community of disciples are good in their practice
the Fortunate Ones Community of disciples are straight in their practice
the Fortunate Ones Community of disciples are systematic in their practice
the Fortunate Ones Community of disciples are correct in their practice
that is to say the four pairs of persons the eight individual persons
this is the Fortunate Ones Community of disciples
they are worthy of offerings of hospitality of gifts and of reverential salutation
they are an unsurpassed field of merit for the world
He is endowed with the lovely Ariyan virtue
unbroken faultless unspotted unblemished productive of freedom
praised by the wise not adhered to leading to concentration
This is the presentation of the Teaching nanda called the Mirror of the True Nature of Things
endowed with which a Noble Disciple desiring to do so may declare about himself
Exhausted is birth in Hell exhausted is birth in an animals womb
exhausted is birth in the realm of the Fallen Spirits exhausted is falling into an unhappy destiny in the lower realms
I am a StreamEnterer no longer subject to falling into the lower realms and have a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening 
There also the Fortunate One while living near Nādika in the Brick House
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching saying
Such is virtue such is concentration such is wisdom
when virtue is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration
when concentration is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom
when wisdom is welldeveloped the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants
that is to say the pollutant of sensuality the pollutant of craving for continued existence the pollutant of ignorance
Then venerable Anuruddha and venerable nanda
spent the rest of the night in talk about the Teaching
Then venerable Anuruddha addressed venerable nanda saying
Go nanda and after entering Kusinārā
inform the Mallas of Kusinārā saying
The Fortunate One has attained Emancipation Vāseṭṭhas now is the time for whatever you are thinking 
Very well reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to venerable Anuruddha
dressing in the morning time and taking his robes and bowl he entered Kusinārā with a companion
Now at that time the Mallas from Kusinārā
were assembled in the Council Hall having some business or other
Then venerable nanda
approached the Mallas from Kusinārā in the Council Hall
and after approaching he informed the Mallas of Kusinārā saying
The Fortunate One has attained Emancipation Vāseṭṭhas now is the time for whatever you are thinking
After hearing this word from venerable nanda
the Mallas the sons of the Mallas the daughtersinlaw of the Mallas and the wives of the Mallas
became miserable depressed with their minds given over to suffering
Some having dishevelled hair were weeping
throwing up their arms falling down as though cut down rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off they were crying
Too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation
too quickly the Happy One has attained Final Emancipation
too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared
Then the Mallas from Kusinārā ordered their men saying
 Now friends gather together perfume and flowers
and all the musicians in Kusinārā
 Then the Mallas of Kusinārā having taken perfumes and garlands and all the musicians
and fivehundred pairs of clothes
approached the Mallas Sal Wood at Upavattana
and the Fortunate Ones body
after approaching the Fortunate Ones body
 through honouring respecting revering and worshipping the body
with dance song music garlands and perfumes
and making cloth canopies and preparing circular pavillions
they made the day pass
Then this occurred to the Mallas of Kusinārā
Today it is too late to burn the Fortunate Ones body
tomorrow we will burn the Fortunate Ones body
Then the Mallas of Kusinārā
 through honouring respecting revering and worshipping the Fortunate Ones body
with dance song music garlands and perfumes
and making cloth canopies and preparing circular pavillions
they made the second day pass
they made the third day pass
they made the fourth day pass
they made the fifth day pass
they made the sixth day pass
Then on the seventh day this occurred to the Mallas of Kusinārā
 While honouring respecting revering and worshipping the Fortunate Ones body
with dance song music garlands and perfumes
after taking it out of the city by the South
on the outside of the City to the South we will burn the Fortunate Ones body
Now at that time eight leaders of the Mallas
having washed their heads and put on clean clothes said
Let us lift the Fortunate Ones body but they were not able to lift it
Then the Mallas of Kusinārā said this to venerable Anuruddha
What is the reason Anuruddha what is the cause
why eight leaders of the Mallas having washed their heads and put on clean clothes and saying
Let us lift the Fortunate Ones body are not able to lift it
You Vāseṭṭhas have one intention and the Divinities have another intention
But what is the Divinities intention reverend Sir
Your intention Vāseṭṭhas is
 We while honouring respecting revering and worshipping the Fortunate Ones body
with dance song music garlands and perfumes
after taking it out of the City by the South
on the outside of the City to the South will burn the Fortunate Ones body
 The Divinities intention Vāseṭṭhas is
We while honouring respecting revering and worshipping the Fortunate Ones body
with the Divinities dance song music garlands and perfumes
after carrying it to the North of the City by the North
and reentering the City by the North Gate
and carrying it to the middle of the City by the middle
and going out by the Eastern Gate
to the East of the City at the Mallas Shrine called the Bonded Coronet
there let us burn the Fortunate Ones body
Let us do according to the Divinities intention reverend Sir
 Now at that time the whole of Kusinārā including the dirty rubbish heaps
was covered kneedeep with Divine Coral Tree flowers
Then the Divinities and the Mallas of Kusinārā
 while honouring respecting revering and worshipping the Fortunate Ones body
with the Divinities and mens dance song music garlands and perfumes
after carrying it to the North of the City by the North
and reentering the City by the North Gate
and carrying it to the middle of the City by the middle
and going out by the Eastern Gate
to the East of the City at the Mallas Shrine called the Bonded Coronet
there set down the Fortunate Ones body
Then the Mallas of Kusinārā said this to venerable nanda
How do we act reverend nanda in regard to the Realised Ones body
As you act Vāseṭṭhas in regard to the Universal Monarchs body
so you should act in regard to the Realised Ones body
But how do we act reverend nanda in regard to the Universal Monarchs body
They wrap the Universal Monarchs body Vāseṭṭhas with clean cloth
and after wrapping with clean cloth they wrap with carded cotton
and after wrapping with carded cotton they wrap with clean cloth
by this means after wrapping the Universal Monarchs body with fivehundred pairs of cloth and cotton
enclosing it in an oil tub made of iron and enclosing it in another iron tub
and putting it on a scented funeral pyre they burn the Universal Monarchs body
and they build a Shrine for the Universal Monarch at the crossroads
So they act Vāseṭṭhas in regard to a Universal Monarchs body
Just as they act Vāseṭṭhas in regard to a Universal Monarchs body
so should they act in regard to a Realised Ones body
and a Shrine should be made for the Realised One at the crossroads
Whoever there prepares flowers incense or powder or
worships or establishes confidence in his mind
that will be for their benefit and happiness for a long time
Then the Mallas of Kusinārā gave orders to their men saying
If it is so then wrap the body with the Mallas carded cloth friends
Then the Mallas of Kusinārā wrapped the Fortunate Ones body with clean cloth
and after wrapping with clean cloth they wrapped with carded cotton
and after wrapping with carded cotton they wrapped with clean cloth
and by this means after wrapping the Fortunate Ones body with fivehundred pairs of cloth and cotton
enclosing it in an oil tub made of iron and enclosing it in another iron tub
and putting it on a scented funeral pyre they put the Fortunate Ones body on the funeral pyre
Now at that time venerable Mahākassapa
was travelling along the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārā
together with a great Community of monks around fivehundred monks
Then venerable Mahākassapa after descending from the path sat down at the root of a certain tree
Now at that time a certain jīvaka
while holding a Mandārava flower
Venerable Mahākassapa saw that jīvaka approaching from afar
and after seeing him he said this to that jīvaka
Do you know our Teacher friend
Certainly friend I know Today is seven days since the Final Emancipation of the ascetic Gotama
therefore I am holding this Mandārava flower
Then those monks there who were not free from passion
some throwing up their arms were weeping
falling down as though cut down rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off they were crying
Too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation
too quickly the Happy One has attained Final Emancipation
too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared
But those monks who were free from passion mindfully with full awareness endured thinking
Impermanent are all processes how can it be otherwise
Now at that time one who had gone forth in old age named Subhadda
was sitting in that group
Then Subhadda who had gone forth in old age said this to those monks
Enough friends do not grieve do not lament
we are now freed from that troublesome Great Ascetic saying
This is allowable for you this is not allowable for you
But now we will do whatever we wish
and we will not do whatever we do not wish
Then venerable Mahākassapa addressed the monks saying
Enough friends do not grieve do not lament
were you not warned by the Fortunate One friends when he declared this
There is alteration in separation from and changeability in all that is dear and appealing
How can it be otherwise friends for that which is obtained
born become in process subject to dissolution
It is not possible to say this It should not dissolve
Now at that time four leaders of the Mallas
having washed their heads and put on clean clothes said
Let us burn the Fortunate Ones funeral pyre but they were not able to burn it
Then the Mallas of Kusinārā said this to venerable Anuruddha
What is the reason venerable Anuruddha what is the cause
why four leaders of the Mallas
having washed their heads and put on clean clothes and saying
Let us burn the Fortunate Ones funeral pyre are not able to burn it
The Divinities
But what is the Divinities intention reverend Sir
The Divinities intention Vāseṭṭhas is
The venerable Mahākassapa is travelling along the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārā
together with a great Community of monks around fivehundred monks
the Fortunate Ones funeral pyre will not burn
while venerable Mahākassapa has not worshipped the Fortunate Ones feet with his head 
Let us do according to the Divinities intention reverend Sir
Then venerable Mahākassapa
approached Kusinārā and the Mallas Shrine called the Bonded Coronet
and the Fortunate Ones funeral pyre
and after approaching and arranging his robe on one shoulder extending his hands in respectful salutation
and circumambulating the funeral pyre three times
and uncovering the feet he worshipped the Fortunate Ones feet with his head
Also fivehundred monks after arranging their robes on one shoulder extending their hands in respectful salutation
and circumambulating the funeral pyre three times
worshipped the Fortunate Ones feet with their heads
After the Fortunate Ones feet had been worshipped by venerable Mahākassapa
and by fivehundred monks the funeral pyre caught fire by itself
Now while the Fortunate Ones body was burning
of the outer skin the inner skin the flesh the sinews the synovial fluid
neither charcoal was evident nor was ash of the body left over
Just as while ghee or oil is burning
there is no charcoal and no ash evident
so when the Fortunate Ones body was burning
of the outer skin the inner skin the flesh the sinews the synovial fluid
neither charcoal was evident nor was ash of the body left over
Only two of those fivehundred pairs of clothes were not consumed
that on the inside and that on the outside
When the Fortunate Ones body was burnt
a shower of water appeared in the sky and the Fortunate Ones funeral pyre was extinguished
Also after water rose from a well
Also the Mallas from Kusinārā extinguished the Fortunate Ones funeral pyre with all types of fragrant water
Then the Mallas of Kusinārā
 after making an enclosure of spears in the Council Hall
and surrounding the Fortunate Ones bodily relics with bows
honoured respected revered and worshipped it
with dance song music garlands and perfumes
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Come nanda let us approach Koṭigāma
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Koṭigāma
There the Fortunate One lived near Koṭigāma
There the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration monks of Four Noble Truths
both you and I have been wandering and running along in Sasāra for a long time
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration monks of the Noble Truth of Suffering
both you and I have been wandering and running along in Sasāra for a long time
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration monks of the Noble Truth of the Arising of Suffering
both you and I have been wandering and running along in Sasāra for a long time
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration monks of the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering
both you and I have been wandering and running along in Sasāra for a long time
 Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration monks
of the Noble Truth of the Practice going to the Cessation of Suffering
both you and I have been wandering and running along in Sasāra for a long time
But now the Noble Truth of Suffering has been understood and penetrated
the Noble Truth of the Arising of Suffering has been understood and penetrated
the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering has been understood and penetrated
the Noble Truth of the Practice going to the Cessation of Suffering has been understood and penetrated
Craving for continued existence has been cut off what leads to rebirth has been exhausted there is no continuation in existence
The Fortunate One said this and after saying this the Happy One the Teacher said something more
Because of not seeing as it really is the Four Noble Truths
we have run along for a long time through various births
Now these have been seen what leads to rebirth is uprooted
the root of suffering has been cut off there is no continuation in existence
There also the Fortunate One while living in Koṭigāma
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching saying
Such is virtue such is concentration such is wisdom
when virtue is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration
when concentration is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom
when wisdom is welldeveloped the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants
that is to say the pollutant of sensuality the pollutant of craving for continued existence the pollutant of ignorance
Then the Fortunate One having gone down from the road
approached the root of a certain tree
and after approaching he addressed venerable nanda saying
Come now nanda prepare the outer robe folded in four for me
I am weary nanda and will sit down
Very well reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate One
he prepared the outer robe folded in four and the Fortunate One sat down on the prepared seat
While sitting the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Come now nanda bring drinking water
I am thirsty nanda and will drink
After that was said venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
Just now reverend Sir five hundred wagons have passed by
and the little water that flows having been churned by the wheels is stirred up and disturbed
The Kakutthā river is not far away
with transparent water agreeable water cool water pure water with beautiful banks a delightful place
there the Fortunate One can drink drinking water and can cool his limbs
For a second time the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Come now nanda bring drinking water
I am thirsty nanda and will drink
For a second time venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
Just now reverend Sir five hundred wagons have passed by
and the little water that flows having been churned by the wheels is stirred up and disturbed
The Kakutthā river is not far away
with transparent water agreeable water cool water pure water with beautiful banks a delightful place
there the Fortunate One can drink drinking water and can cool his limbs
For a third time the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Come now nanda bring drinking water
I am thirsty nanda and will drink
Very well reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate One
and taking the bowl he approached the little river
Then that little river that was flowing which had been churned by the wheels and was stirred up and disturbed
as venerable nanda was approaching flowed transparent clear and undisturbed
Then it occurred to venerable nanda
Surely it is wonderful surely it is marvellous
the Realised Ones great power and great majesty
in that that little river that is flowing which has been churned by wheels and is stirred up and disturbed
as I was approaching flowed transparent clear and undisturbed
After taking a bowl of drinking water he approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he said this to the Fortunate One
It is wonderful reverend Sir it is marvellous reverend Sir
the Realised Ones great power and great majesty
in that that little river that is flowing which has been churned by wheels and is stirred up and disturbed
as I was approaching flowed transparent clear and undisturbed
Please drink the drinking water Fortunate One Please drink the drinking water Happy One
Then the Fortunate One drank the water
Formerly reverend Sir the monks having dwelt for the Rains Retreat used to come to see the Realised One
and we would receive those meditating monks for assembling and seeing the Realised One
But after the Fortunate One has passed way reverend Sir
we will not receive those meditating monks for assembling and seeing the Realised One
There are these four places that can be seen that produce enthusiasm nanda for a faithful man of good family
Thinking Here the Realised One was born
that is a place to be seen that produces enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family
Thinking Here the Realised One awoke to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening
that is a place to be seen that produces enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family
Thinking Here the Realised One set rolling the Wheel of the Teaching
that is a place to be seen that produces enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family
Thinking Here the Realised One was completely Emancipated in the Emancipationelement which has no basis for attachment remaining
that is a place to be seen that produces enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family
 These are the four places nanda
that are to be seen that produce enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family
Faithful monks nuns laymen and laywomen will come thinking
Here the Realised One was born
Here the Realised One awoke to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening
Here the Realised One set rolling the Wheel of the Teaching
Here the Realised One was Finally Emancipated in the Emancipationelement which has no basis for attachment remaining
and whoever nanda will die while on pilgrimage to the Shrines with a confident mind
they will all at the breakup of the body after death rearise in a happy destiny in a heavenly world
How reverend Sir are we to act in regard to women
As though they were not seen nanda
But when seeing them reverend Sir how are we to act
Without conversing nanda
But when conversing reverend Sir how are we to act
You should attend to mindfulness nanda
How should we act reverend Sir in regard to the Realised Ones body
Do not worry nanda about how you are to worshipfully dispose of the Realised Ones body
 Come nanda live striving for the highest good being devoted to the highest good
being heedful of the highest good ardent and resolute
There are nanda wise Nobles wise brahmins wise householders
who have faith in the Realised One
They will worshipfully dispose of the Realised Ones body
How should we act reverend Sir in regard to the Realised Ones body
As you act in regard to the Universal Monarchs body
so you should act in regard to the Realised Ones body
But how do they act reverend Sir in regard to the Universal Monarchs body
They wrap the Universal Monarchs body nanda with clean cloth
and after wrapping with clean cloth they wrap with carded cotton
and after wrapping with carded cotton they wrap with clean cloth
by this means after wrapping the Universal Monarchs body with fivehundred pairs of cloth and cotton
enclosing it in an oil tub made of iron
and putting it on a scented funeral pyre they burn the Universal Monarchs body
and they build a Shrine for the Universal Monarch at the crossroads
So they act in regard to a Universal Monarchs body
and as they act in regard to a Universal Monarchs body
so should they act in regard to a Realised Ones body
and a Shrine should be made for the Realised One at the crossroads
Whoever there prepares flowers incense or powder
or worships or establishes confidence in his mind
that will be for their benefit and happiness for a long time
These four persons nanda are worthy of a Shrine
A Realised One a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha is worthy of a Shrine
an Individual Sambuddha is worthy of a Shrine
a Realised Ones disciple is worthy of a Shrine
a Universal Monarch is worthy of a Shrine
And for what reason or cause is a Realised One a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha worthy of a Shrine
Thinking This is the Shrine of a Realised One a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha
nanda many people purify their mind and after purifying their mind
at the breakup of the body after death they arise in a happy destiny in a Heavenly world
This is the reason or cause nanda
why a Realised One a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha is worthy of a Shrine
And for what reason or cause is an Individual Sambuddha worthy of a Shrine
Thinking This is the Shrine of a Fortunate One an Individual Sambuddha
nanda many people purify their mind and after purifying their mind
at the breakup of the body after death they arise in a happy destiny in a Heavenly world
This is the reason or cause nanda why an Individual Sambuddha is worthy of a Shrine
And for what reason or cause is a Realised Ones disciple worthy of a Shrine
Thinking This is the Shrine of a disciple of a Fortunate One a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha
nanda many people purify their mind and after purifying their mind
at the breakup of the body after death they arise in a happy destiny in a Heavenly world
This is the reason or cause nanda why a Realised Ones disciple is worthy of a Shrine
And for what reason or cause is a Universal Monarch worthy of a Shrine
Thinking This is the Shrine of a Righteous Monarch a Righteous King
nanda many people purify their mind and after purifying their mind
at the breakup of the body after death they arise in a happy destiny in a Heavenly world
This is the reason or cause nanda why a Universal Monarch is worthy of a Shrine
These nanda are the four persons worthy of a Shrine
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
 Come nanda let us approach the further shore of the Golden river
to Kusinārā and to the Mallas Sal Wood at Upavattana
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks
 went to the further shore of the Golden river
to Kusinārā and the Mallas Sal Wood at Upavattana
and after going he addressed venerable nanda saying
 Come nanda prepare
a couch with the head facing north between the Twin Sal Trees for me
I am weary nanda and will lie down
Very well reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate One
he prepared a couch with the head facing north between the Twin Sal Trees
Then the Fortunate One lay down on his right side in the lions posture
after placing one foot on the top of the other mindfully with full awareness
Now at that time the Twin Sal Trees were full of flowering blossoms outside of flowering time
and they were sprinkling down on the Realised Ones body
showering down pouring down on the Realised One in worship
Also the Divine Coral Tree flowers were falling from the sky
and they were sprinkling down on the Realised Ones body
showering down pouring down on the Realised One in worship
Also Divine sandalwood powder was falling from the sky
and was sprinkling down on the Realised Ones body
showering down pouring down on the Realised One in worship
Also Divine music played in the sky in worship of the Realised One
Also Divine songs played in the sky in worship of the Realised One
Then the Fortunate One said this to venerable nanda
The Twin Sal Trees are full of flowering blossoms outside of flowering time
and they are sprinkling down on the Realised Ones body
showering down pouring down on the Realised One in worship
Also the Divine Coral Tree flowers are falling from the sky
and they are sprinkling down on the Realised Ones body
showering down pouring down on the Realised One in worship
Also Divine sandalwood powder is falling from the sky
and is sprinkling down on the Realised Ones body
showering down pouring down on the Realised One in worship
Also Divine music plays in the sky in worship of the Realised One
Also Divine songs play in the sky in worship of the Realised One
But it is not in this way nanda that the Realised One is honoured
respected revered worshipped or esteemed
But that monk nun layman or laywoman nanda
who lives practising the Teaching in accordance with the Teaching correct in their practice living in conformity with the Teaching
he honours respects reveres worships and esteems the Realised One with the highest worship
Therefore nanda thinking Let us live practising the Teaching in accordance with the Teaching
correct in our practice living in conformity with the Teaching this is how you are to train nanda
Now at that time the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
were building up a city at Pāṭaligāma to ward off the Vajjians
Then at that time a great many Divinities thousands upon thousands
were taking possession of grounds at Pāṭaligāma
In that place where the great Divinities took possession of grounds
there the powerful rulers and great royal ministers minds
inclined to building up residences
In that place where the middling Divinities took possession of grounds
there the middling rulers and middling royal ministers minds
inclined to building up residences
In that place where the lower Divinities took possession of grounds
there the lower rulers and lower royal ministers minds
inclined to building up residences
The Fortunate One saw with his Divineeye
which is purified and surpasses that of normal men
that those Divinities thousands upon thousands were taking possession of grounds at Pāṭaligāma
Then towards the time of dawn having risen from his seat the Fortunate One
addressed venerable nanda saying
Now who nanda is building a city at Pāṭaligāma
The Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra reverend Sir
are building up a city at Pāṭaligāma to ward off the Vajjians
It is just as though nanda they are building after consulting with the Tāvatisa Divinities
so nanda are the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
building up a city at Pāṭaligāma to ward off the Vajjians
Here nanda I saw with my Divineeye
which is purified and surpasses that of normal men
that a great many Divinities thousands upon thousands were taking possession of grounds at Pāṭaligāma
In that place where the great Divinities took possession of grounds
there the powerful rulers and great royal ministers minds
inclined to building up residences
In that place where the middling Divinities took possession of grounds
there the middling rulers and middling royal ministers minds
inclined to building up residences
In that place where the lower Divinities took possession of grounds
there the lower rulers and lower royal ministers minds
inclined to building up residences
For as long nanda as there is an Ariyan sphere of influence for as long as there is trade
this basketopening Pāṭaliputta will be the chief city
For Pāṭaliputta nanda there will be three dangers
from fire and from water and from the breaking of an alliance
Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
approached the Fortunate One and after approaching they exchanged greetings with the Fortunate One
and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings they stood on one side
While standing on one side the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
said this to the Fortunate One
May dear Gotama consent to us
offering him a meal today together with the Community of monks
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence
Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
having understood the Fortunate Ones consent approached their own dwelling
and after approaching in their own dwellings
having had excellent foodstuffs made ready
had the time announced to the Fortunate One saying It is time dear Gotama the meal is ready
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe together with the Community of monks
approached the dwelling of the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat
Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
 with their own hands served and satisfied the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head
with excellent foodstuffs
Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
when the Fortunate One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl
having taken a low seat sat down on one side
 While sitting on one side the Fortunate One rejoiced the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
with these verses
 In that place where he makes his dwelling having entertained
The wise and virtuous here the restrained who live the spiritual life
He should dedicate a gift of merit to those Divinities who were in that place
Honoured they pay honour revered they revere him
Thereafter they have compassion on him as a mother on her own son
A man whom the Divinities has compassion on always sees what is auspicious
 Then the Fortunate One after rejoicing the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
with these verses after rising from his seat went away
Now at that time the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
were following close behind the Fortunate One thinking
That gate by which the ascetic Gotama leaves will get the name the Gotama Gate
and that ford by which he crosses the river Ganges will get the name the Gotama Ford
Then that gate by which the Fortunate One left got the name the Gotama Gate
Then the Fortunate One approached the river Ganges
Now at that time the river Ganges was full to the brim and could be drunk from by crows perched on the bank
Some of the people were seeking boats some were seeking floats
and some were binding rafts desiring to go from this shore to the shore beyond
Then the Fortunate One just as a strong man
might stretch out a bent arm or bend in an outstretched arm
so did he vanish from the near bank of the river Ganges
and reappeared on the far bank
The Fortunate One saw those people some seeking boats
some seeking floats
and some binding rafts desiring to go from this shore to the shore beyond
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Those who cross over a sea or a river
Do so after making a bridge and leaving the marshes behind
While people are still binding together a raft
Intelligent people have crossed over
Then it occured to venerable nanda
Surely it is wonderful surely it is marvellous this great earthquake
this very great earthquake and this awful hairraising crash of the Divinities thunder drum
What was the reason what was the cause for the occurrence of this great earthquake
Then venerable nanda approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down at one side
Sitting on one side venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
Surely it is wonderful reverend Sir surely it is marvellous reverend Sir this great earthquake
this very great earthquake
and this awful hairraising crash of the Divinities thunder drum
What was the reason reverend Sir what was the cause for the occurrence of this great earthquake
There are these eight reasons eight causes nanda for the occurrence of a great earthquake
Which eight
This great Earth nanda stands in the water
the water stands in the atmosphere the atmosphere stands in space
There comes a time nanda when great winds blow with the great winds blowing
the waters move the waters having moved the Earth moves
This is the first reason the first cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake
Furthermore nanda when an ascetic or a brahmin
or a Divinity one of great power one of great majesty has through spiritual power attained complete mastery of the mind
and has then developed even a trifling perception of the Earth or an unlimited perception of water
this Earth moves wavers flutters and shakes
This is the second reason the second cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake
Furthermore nanda when the Buddhatobe falls away from the Tusita hosts
and mindfully with full awareness enters his mothers womb
this Earth moves wavers flutters and shakes
This is the third reason the third cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake
Furthermore nanda when the Buddhatobe
mindfully with full awareness exits his mothers womb
this Earth moves wavers flutters and shakes
This is the fourth reason the fourth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake
Furthermore nanda when the Realised One
perfectly awakens to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening
this Earth moves wavers flutters and shakes
This is the fifth reason the fifth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake
Furthermore nanda when the Realised One sets the unsurpassed wheel of the Teaching rolling
this Earth moves wavers flutters and shakes
This is the sixth reason the sixth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake
Furthermore nanda when the Realised One
mindfully with full awareness gives up the lifeprocess
this Earth moves wavers flutters and shakes
This is the seventh reason the seventh cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake
Furthermore nanda when the Realised One
is Finally Emancipated in the Emancipationelement which has no basis for attachment remaining
this Earth moves wavers flutters and shakes
This is the eighth reason the eighth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake
These are the eight reasons the eight causes nanda for the occurrence of a great earthquake
Go nanda and after entering into Kusinārā announce to the Mallas
Today Vāseṭṭhas
come along Vāseṭṭhas come along Vāseṭṭhas
do not regret it afterwards thinking
In the area of our village was the Realised Ones attainment of Final Emancipation
and we did not in the last watch of the night get to see the Realised One 
Very well reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate One
dressing and taking his robes and bowl he entered Kusinārā with a companion
Now at that time the Mallas from Kusinārā were assembled in the Council Hall
having some business or other
Then venerable nanda
went to where the Mallas from Kusinārā were assembled in the Council Hall
and after approaching he said this to the Mallas
Today Vāseṭṭhas in the last watch of the night will be the Realised Ones attainment of Final Emancipation
come along Vāseṭṭhas come along Vāseṭṭhas
do not regret it afterwards thinking
In the area of our village was the Realised Ones attainment of Final Emancipation
and we did not in the last watch of the night get to see the Realised One 
After hearing this from venerable nanda
the Mallas the sons of the Mallas the daughtersinlaw of the Mallas and the wives of the Mallas
became miserable depressed with their minds given over to suffering
Some having dishevelled hair were weeping
throwing up their arms falling down as though cut down rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off they were crying
Too quickly the Fortunate One will attain Final Emancipation
too quickly the Happy One will attain Final Emancipation
too quickly the Visionary in the world will disappear
Then the Mallas the sons of the Mallas the daughtersinlaw of the Mallas and the wives of the Mallas
miserable depressed with their minds given over to suffering
approached the Mallas Sal Wood at Upavattana and approached venerable nanda
Then this occurred to venerable nanda
If I make the Mallas of Kusinārā worship the Fortunate One one by one
before the Fortunate One has been worshipped by the Mallas of Kusinārā
the night will end
Now what if I having segregated the Mallas family by family
made them worship the Fortunate One saying
A Malla named so and so together with his children wife dependents and councillors
worships the Fortunate Ones feet with his head'
Then venerable nanda
having segregated the Mallas family by family
made them worship the Fortunate One saying
A Malla named so and so together with his children wife dependents and councillors
worships the Fortunate Ones feet with his head
Then venerable nanda in this way during the first watch of the night
made the Mallas of Kusinārā worship the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One after living near Bhaṇḍagāma for as long as he liked
addressed venerable nanda saying
Come nanda let us approach Hatthigāma Elephant Village Ambagāma Mango Village
Jambugāma RoseApple Village Bhoganagara Wealthy Village
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Bhoganagara
There the Fortunate One lived near Bhoganagara at the Joyous Shrine
There the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
I will teach these Four Great Referrals
listen to it apply your minds well and I will speak
Very well reverend Sir those monks replied to the Fortunate One
and the Fortunate One said this
Here monks a monk might speak like this
I have heard this directly from the Fortunate One friend directly I learned it
This is the Teaching this is the Discipline this is the Teachers Dispensation 
That monks speech monks is not to be rejoiced over not to be scorned at
Without having rejoiced over it without having scorned it after learning those words and syllables well
they should be laid alongside the Discourses they should be compared with the Discipline
If when these are laid alongside the Discourses compared with the Discipline
they do not fit in with the Discourses they do not compare well with the Discipline
you may here come to this conclusion Certainly this is not the Fortunate Ones word
it is not well learned by that monk and monks you should abandon it
If when these are laid alongside the Discourses compared with the Discipline
they do fit in with the Discourses they do compare well with the Discipline
you may come to this conclusion Certainly this is the Fortunate Ones word

This monks is the first Great Referral you should bear in mind

This is the Teaching this is the Discipline this is the Teachers Dispensation 
Those monks speech monks is not to be rejoiced over not to be scorned at
Without having rejoiced over it without having scorned it after learning those words and syllables well

If when these are laid alongside the Discourses compared with the Discipline

This monks is the fourth Great Referral you should bear in mind
These monks are the Four Great Referrals you should bear in mind
There also the Fortunate One while living near Bhoganagara at the Joyful Shrine
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching saying
Such is virtue such is concentration such is wisdom
when virtue is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration
when concentration is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom
when wisdom is welldeveloped the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants
that is to say the pollutant of sensuality the pollutant of craving for continued existence the pollutant of ignorance
Then the Fortunate One after living near Rājagaha for as long as he liked
addressed venerable nanda saying
Come nanda let us approach Ambalaṭṭhikā
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks
arrived at Ambalaṭṭhikā
There the Fortunate One lived near Ambalaṭṭhikā in the Kings Rest House
There also the Fortunate One while living in Ambalaṭṭhikā in the Kings Rest House
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching saying
Such is virtue such is concentration such is wisdom
when virtue is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration
when concentration is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom
when wisdom is welldeveloped the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants
that is to say the pollutant of sensuality the pollutant of craving for continued existence the pollutant of ignorance
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
It may be nanda that some of you may think in this way
Past is the Teachers word there is now no Teacher for us
But it should not be seen like that nanda
whatever Teaching and Discipline has been taught by me or laid down nanda
that is your Teacher after my passing away
At present nanda the monks address each other with the word friend
but after my passing away they are not to address one another thus
 The elder monk nanda should address the younger monk
by his name or by his clan name or by the word friend
But the younger monk should address the elder monk
as reverend Sir or venerable Sir
Desiring to do so nanda the Community after my passing away
can abolish the minor and subsidiary training rules
The highest penalty nanda after my passing away is to be handed out to the monk Channa
But what is the highest penalty reverend Sir
The monk Channa nanda may say whatever he wishes
but he is not to be spoken to or advised or instructed by the monks
Then the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
It may be monks that for one of the monks there is doubt or confusion
about the Buddha or about the Teaching or about the Community or about the Path or about the practice
Ask monks do not be regretful later thinking
The Teacher was face to face with us
and we didn't ask the Fortunate One directly about the training 
After this was said those monks were silent
For a second time the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
It may be monks that for one of the monks there is doubt or confusion
about the Buddha or about the Teaching or about the Community or about the Path or about the practice
Ask monks do not be regretful later thinking
The Teacher was face to face with us
and we didn't ask the Fortunate One directly about the training 
For a second time those monks were silent
For a third time the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
It may be monks that for one of the monks there is doubt or confusion
about the Buddha or about the Teaching or about the Community or about the Path or about the practice
Ask monks do not be regretful later thinking
The Teacher was face to face with us
and we didn't ask the Fortunate One directly about the training 
For a third time those monks were silent
Then the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
It may be monks that out of respect for the Teacher you do not ask
then one friend monks can inform another friend about his doubts
After this was said those monks were silent
Then venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
It is wonderful reverend Sir it is marvellous reverend Sir
I am confident reverend Sir that in this Community of monks
there is not one of the monks in this Community of monks who has doubt or confusion
about the Buddha or about the Teaching or about the Community or about the Path or about the practice
Out of confidence nanda you speak
but the Realised One nanda has knowledge that
there is not one of the monks in this Community of monks who has doubt or confusion
about the Buddha or about the Teaching or about the Community or about the Path or about the practice
For amongst these five hundred monks nanda
he who is the last monk is a StreamEnterer no longer subject to falling into the lower realms
and has a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening
Then the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
Come now monks for I tell you all conditioned things are subject to decay
strive on with heedfulness
These were the last words of the Realised One
After this was said venerable nanda addressed the Fortunate One saying
 Reverend Sir may the Fortunate One not attain Final Emancipation in this small town
this barren town this branch town
There are reverend Sir other great towns such as
Campā Rājagaha Sāvatthī Sāketa Kosambī Bārāṇasī
let the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation there
There are many wealthy Nobles there wealthy brahmins wealthy householders
who are devoted to the Realised One and will worshipfully dispose of the Realised Ones body
Do not say that nanda do not say that nanda
This small town this barren town this branch town
Formerly nanda there was a King by the name of Mahāsudassana
a Righteous Monarch a Righteous King who was victorious over the four quarters
one who had established a stable country endowed with the seven jewels
This Kusinārā was then named Kusāvatī and was King Mahāsudassanas capital city
Stretching for twelve leagues from East to West
and seven leagues from North to South
the capital city Kusāvatī was prosperous nanda
successful populous full of people with much food
just as nanda the capital city of the Divinities named ḷakamandā is prosperous
successful populous full of people with much food
so the capital city Kusāvatī was prosperous nanda
successful populous full of people with much food
The capital city Kusāvatī was never separated from the ten sounds by day or by night
that is to say the sound of elephants the sound of horses the sound of chariots the sound of drums
the sound of tabours the sound of lutes the sound of songs the sound of cymbals the sound of hand bells
and with eat drink chew as the tenth sound
Then the Fortunate One after living near Ambapālīs Wood for as long as he liked
addressed venerable nanda saying
Come nanda let us approach the little village of Beluva
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks
arrived at the little village of Beluva
There the Fortunate One lived near the little village of Beluva
There the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
 Go monks and undertake the Rains Retreat in the vicinity of Vesālī
living like friends like companions like comrades
and I will spend the Rains Retreat right here at the little village of Beluva
Very well reverend Sir and those monks
 after replying to the Fortunate One undertook the Rains Retreat in the vicinity of Vesālī
living like friends like companions like comrades
But the Fortunate One spent the Rains Retreat right there at the little village of Beluva
Then while dwelling for the Rains Retreat a heavy affliction arose for the Fortunate One
and continued with strong and deathlike feelings
There the Fortunate One dwelt mindfully with full awareness and without being troubled
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One
It is not suitable that I without having addressed my attendants
without having given notice to the Community of monks should attain Final Emancipation
Having energetically dismissed this affliction
I could live on after determining the lifespan
Then the Fortunate One having energetically dismissed that affliction
lived on after determining the lifespan
Then the Fortunate Ones affliction abated
Then the Fortunate One having risen from that sickness
not long after rising departed from the Sick Room
and sat down on the prepared seat in front of that Room
Then venerable nanda approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
I have seen reverend Sir the Fortunate One comfortable
I have seen reverend Sir the Fortunate One bearing up while sick
and my body reverend Sir became faint as it were
and although I could not see straight and things were not clear
it appeared to me reverend Sir that the Fortunate One was sick
but it was some small comfort that the Fortunate One would not attain Final Emancipation
until the Fortunate One had spoken regarding the Community of monks
But what nanda does the Community of monks expect of me
The Teaching has been taught by me nanda without having made a distinction between esoteric and exoteric
for the Realised One there is nothing nanda of a closed teachers fist in regard to the Teaching
To whoever nanda this thought occurs I will lead the Community of monks
or I am the instructer of the Community of monks
let him speak nanda regarding the Community of monks
But to the Realised One nanda this thought does not occur
I will lead the Community of monks
or I am the instructor of the Community of monks
Then why nanda should the Realised One speak regarding the Community of monks
I nanda at present am old elderly of great age
far gone advanced in years I am eighty years old
It is like nanda an old cart which only keeps going when shored up with bamboo
just so nanda I think the Realised Ones body only keeps going when shored up with bamboo
When the Realised One doesn't pay attention nanda to any of the signs
when all feelings have ceased he lives having established the signless mindconcentration
and at that time nanda the Realised Ones body is most comfortable
Therefore nanda live with yourself as an island yourself as a refuge with no other refuge
with the Teaching as an island the Teaching as a refuge with no other refuge
And how nanda does a monk live with himself as an island himself as a refuge with no other refuge
with the Teaching as an island the Teaching as a refuge with no other refuge
Here nanda a monk dwells contemplating the nature of the body in the body
ardent fully aware and mindful after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world
he dwells contemplating the nature of feelings in feelings
ardent fully aware and mindful after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world
he dwells contemplating the nature of the mind in the mind
ardent fully aware and mindful after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world
he dwells contemplating the nature of things in various things
ardent fully aware and mindful after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world
Thus nanda a monk lives with himself as an island himself as a refuge with no other refuge
with the Teaching as an island the Teaching as a refuge with no other refuge
For whoever nanda whether at present or after my passing
lives with himself as an island himself as a refuge with no other refuge
with the Teaching as an island the Teaching as a refuge with no other refuge
those monks of mine nanda will go from darkness to the highest

After this was said the brahmin Doṇa said this to their community and group

Our Buddha was one who spoke about forbearance
 It is not good that there should be a battle
About sharing the relics of the Best Man
 Let us united in concord dear Sirs
With joyful minds make eight shares of the relics
And set up Shrines in every direction
So that many people may gain faith in the Visionary One
 Now brahmin you must divide the Fortunate Ones bodily relics
in eight equal divisions
Certainly dear Sir said Doṇa the brahmin
after replying to that community and group
and dividing the Fortunate Ones bodily relics in eight equal divisions
he said this to that community and group
Please give me this urn dear Sirs
and I also will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the urn
They gave the urn to Doṇa the brahmin

sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārā saying

surely growth monks is to be expected for the monks not decline
For as long monks as the monks in regard to those righteous gains received in accordance with the Teaching 
whatever amount has been received in the bowl 
will divide and share such gains
with those who are virtuous fellow celibates and share them in common
surely growth monks is to be expected for the monks not decline
For as long monks as the monks are endowed with those virtues which are
unbroken faultless unspotted unblemished productive of freedom
praised by the wise not clung to leading to concentration
and will live endowed with virtue amongst their fellow celibates who themselves possess such virtue both in public and in private
surely growth monks is to be expected for the monks not decline
For as long monks as the monks are endowed with that which is Ariyan View which leads out
which leads to the complete destruction of suffering for one who acts thus
and will live endowed with Right View amongst those who themselves possess such Right View
both in public and in private
surely growth monks is to be expected for the monks not decline
For as long monks as the monks will maintain these six things which prevent decline
and the monks will agree with these six things which prevent decline
surely growth monks is to be expected for the monks not decline
There also the Fortunate One while living near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak Mountain
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching saying
Such is virtue such is concentration such is wisdom
when virtue is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration
when concentration is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom
when wisdom is welldeveloped the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants
that is to say the pollutant of sensuality the pollutant of craving for continued existence the pollutant of ignorance
At one time nanda I was living at Rājagaha
I was living right there at Rājagaha near the Gotama Banyan Tree
I was living right there at Rājagaha near the Thieves Precipice
I was living right there at Rājagaha on the side of the Vebhāra mountain in the Seven Leaves Cave
I was living right there at Rājagaha on the side of the Isigili mountain on Black Rock
I was living right there at Rājagaha in the Cool Wood at the Snake Tank Slope
I was living right there at Rājagaha in the River Tapodā Monastery
I was living right there near Rājagaha at the Squirrels Feeding Place in Bamboo Wood
At one time nanda I was living right there near Rājagaha at Jīvakas Mango Wood
I was living right there near Rājagaha in the Deer Park at the place called Crushing Womb
in that place nanda I addressed you saying
Delightful nanda is Rājagaha delightful is the Vultures Peak Mountain
delightful is the Gotama Banyan Tree delightful is the Thieves Precipice
delightful is the side of the Vebhāra mountain in the Seven Leaves Cave delightful is the side of the Isigili mountain on Black Rock
delightful is the Cool Wood at the Snake Tank Slope delightful is the River Tapodā Monastery
delightful is the Squirrels Feeding Place in Bamboo Wood delightful is Jīvakas Mango Wood
delightful is the Deer Park at the place called Crushing Womb
 Whoever has developed nanda
made much of carried on established maintained augmented and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power
could if he wanted remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan
 The Realised One has developed nanda
made much of carried on established maintained augmented and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power
If he wanted nanda the Realised One
could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan
But despite such a gross hint being made by the Realised One
such a gross suggestion being made you were unable to penetrate it
and did not beg the Realised One saying
May the Fortunate One remain reverend Sir for the lifespan may the Happy One remain for the lifespan
for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people out of compassion for the world
for the welfare benefit and happiness of Divinities and men
If you nanda had begged the Realised One twice the Realised One might have rejected your speech
but would have accepted it on the third occasion
So nanda there is this wrongdoing for you there is this fault for you
Come nanda let us approach the Gabled House Hall in Great Wood
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
 Then the Fortunate One with venerable nanda
approached the Gabled House Hall in Great Wood
and after approaching he addressed venerable nanda saying
Go nanda and whatever monks are living in dependance on Vesālī
assemble them in the Attendance Hall
Very well reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate One
 and assembling whatever monks were living in dependance on Vesālī
in the Attendance Hall he approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he stood at one side
While standing on one side venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
The Community of monks has assembled reverend Sir now is the time Fortunate One for whatever you are thinking
Then the Fortunate One approached the Attendance Hall
and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat
While sitting the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
Therefore
after grasping them well you should practise develop and make a lot of them
so that the Spiritual Life may last long and may endure for a long time
and that will be for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people out of compassion for the world
for the welfare benefit and happiness of Divinities and men
And what are those Teachings that have with deep knowledge been taught by me
which after grasping them well you should practise develop and make a lot of them
so that the Spiritual Life may last long and may endure for a long time
that will be for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people out of compassion for the world
for the welfare benefit and happiness of Divinities and men
They are as follows
The Four Ways of Attending to Mindfulness
the Four Right Strivings
the Four Paths to Power
the Five Faculties
the Five Strengths
the Seven Factors of Awakening
the Noble EightFold Path
These monks are those Teachings that have with deep knowledge been taught by me
after grasping them well you should practise develop and make a lot of them
so that the Spiritual Life may last long and may endure for a long time
and that will be for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people out of compassion for the world
for the welfare benefit and happiness of Divinities and men
Then the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
Come now monks for I tell you all conditioned things are subject to decay
strive on with heedfulness
Not long now there will be the Realised Ones Final Emancipation
after the passing of three months the Realised One will attain Final Emancipation
The Fortunate One said this and after saying this the Happy One the Teacher said something more
Youths and also the old fools and also the wise
Rich and also the poor  all end in death
Like an earthen vessel made by a potter
Small and great that which is baked and unbaked
All end in breakage just so life ends in death
Then the Teacher said something more
Wellmatured decayed with little of my life remaining
Having abandoned rebirth I will go having made myself a refuge
Be heedful mindful and virtuous monks
With wellreasoned thoughts protect your minds
Whoever in this Teaching and Discipline will live heedful
Having given up the round of rebirths he will put an end to suffering
Then the Fortunate One attained the first absorption
and after emerging from the first absorption he attained the second absorption
and after emerging from the second absorption he attained the third absorption
and after emerging from the third absorption he attained the fourth absorption
and after emerging from the fourth absorption he attained the sphere of endless space
and after emerging from the sphere of endless space he attained the sphere of endless consciousness
and after emerging from the sphere of endless consciousness he attained the sphere of nothingness
and after emerging from the sphere of nothingness
he attained the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception
and after emerging from the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception
he attained the cessation of perception and feeling
Then venerable nanda said this to venerable Anuruddha
Has the Fortunate One reverend Anuruddha attained Final Emancipation
The Fortunate One reverend nanda has not attained Final Emancipation he has attained the cessation of perception and feeling
Then the Fortunate One after emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling
attained the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception
and after emerging from the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception he attained the sphere of nothingness
and after emerging from the sphere of nothingness he attained the sphere of endless consciousness
and after emerging from the sphere of endless consciousness he attained the sphere of endless space
and after emerging from the sphere of endless space he attained the fourth absorption
and after emerging from the fourth absorption he attained the third absorption
and after emerging from the third absorption he attained the second absorption
and after emerging from the second absorption he attained the first absorption
and after emerging from the first absorption he attained the second absorption
and after emerging from the second absorption he attained the third absorption
and after emerging from the third absorption he attained the fourth absorption
and after emerging from the fourth absorption immediately the Fortunate One attained Final Emancipation
When the Fortunate One attained Final Emancipation along with the Emancipation there was a great earthquake
and an awful horrifying crash of the Divinities thunder drum
When the Fortunate One attained Final Emancipation along with the Emancipation
Brahmā Sahampati spoke this verse
All beings in the world will surely lay aside the body
In the same way the Teacher Suchlike unmatched in the world
the Realised One attained to the ten strengths the Sambuddha has attained Final Emancipation
When the Fortunate One attained Final Emancipation along with the Emancipation
Sakka the Lord of the Divinities spoke this verse
Impermanent indeed are all processes arisen they have the nature to decay
After arising they come to cessation the stilling of them is blissful
When the Fortunate One attained Final Emancipation along with the Emancipation
venerable Anuruddha spoke these verses
There is no more breathing for that Suchlike one of steady mind
Freed from lust the Sage who has died has entered the peace of Nibbāna
With an unshaken heart he endured the painful feelings
Like a flame when it goes out so his mind was liberated in Nibbāna
When the Fortunate One attained Final Emancipation along with the Emancipation
venerable nanda spoke this verse
With that there was fear with that there was horror
When the Sambuddha endowed with all noble qualities attained Emancipation
When the Fortunate One attained Final Emancipation those monks there who were not free from passion
throwing up their arms falling down as though cut down rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off were crying
Too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation
too quickly the Happy One has attained Final Emancipation
too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared
But those monks who were free from passion mindfully with full awareness endured thinking
Impermanent are all processes how can it be otherwise
Then venerable Anuruddha said this to the monks
Enough friends do not grieve do not lament
were you not warned by the Fortunate One when he declared
There is alteration in separation from and changeability in all that is dear and appealing
How can it be otherwise friends for that which is obtained
born become in process subject to dissolution
It is not possible to say this It should not dissolve
The Divinities friends are complaining
But what beings and Divinities is the venerable Anuruddha thinking of
There are friend nanda Divinities in the sky perceiving the Earth who having dishevelled hair are weeping
throwing up their arms falling down as though cut down rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off crying
Too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation
too quickly the Happy One has attained Final Emancipation
too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared
There are friend nanda Divinities on the Earth perceiving the Earth who having dishevelled hair are weeping
throwing up their arms falling down as though cut down rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off crying
Too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation
too quickly the Happy One has attained Final Emancipation
too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared
But those Divinities who have cut off passion they mindfully with full awareness endure thinking
Impermanent are all processes how can it be otherwise 
Then the Fortunate One after living near Ambalaṭṭhikā for as long as he liked
addressed venerable nanda saying
Come nanda let us approach Nāḷandā
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Nāḷandā
There the Fortunate One lived near Nāḷanda in Pāvārikas Mango Wood
Then venerable Sāriputta approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side venerable Sāriputta said this to the Fortunate One
I have confidence reverend Sir in the Fortunate One in this way
that neither in the past the future or at present is there found
another ascetic or brahmin
who has more deep knowledge in regard to Perfect Awakening than the Fortunate One
You have spoken this great and imposing speech Sāriputta
a definite wellgrasped lions roar that was roared saying
I have confidence reverend Sir in the Fortunate One in this way
that neither in the past the future or at present is there found
another ascetic or brahmin
who has more deep knowledge in regard to Perfect Awakening than the Fortunate One
 But have you Sāriputta understood those who in past times were Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas
and known with your mind the minds of those Fortunate Ones
Or that those Fortunate Ones had such and such virtues
those Fortunate Ones had such and such qualities
those Fortunate Ones had such and such wisdom
those Fortunate Ones had such and such lifestyles
those Fortunate Ones had such and such liberations
No reverend Sir
But have you Sāriputta
 understood those who in the future times will be Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas
and known with your mind the minds of those Fortunate Ones
Or that those Fortunate Ones will have such and such virtues
those Fortunate Ones will have such and such qualities
those Fortunate Ones will have such and such wisdom
those Fortunate Ones will have such and such lifestyles
those Fortunate Ones will have such and such liberations
No reverend Sir
 But have you understood I who am at present a Worthy and Perfect Sambuddha
and known with your mind my mind
Or that the Fortunate One has such and such virtues
the Fortunate One has such and such qualities
the Fortunate One has such and such wisdom
the Fortunate One has such and such a lifestyle
the Fortunate One has such and such a liberation
No reverend Sir
Here then Sāriputta
in regard to those past future and present Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas
you have no full and exact knowledge with your own mind
Then how is it Sāriputta at present that you
have spoken such a great and imposing speech a definite wellgrasped lions roar that was roared saying
I have confidence reverend Sir in the Fortunate One in this way
that neither in the past the future or at present is there found
another ascetic or brahmin
who has more deep knowledge in regard to Perfect Awakening than the Fortunate One'
I do not reverend Sir in regard to those past future and present Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas
have full and exact knowledge with my own mind
However I understand what I said is in conformity with the Teaching
It is like a Kings city reverend Sir near the border areas
having strong foundations strong walls and gateways and a single door
and there is a watchman wise accomplished and intelligent
warding off those unknown and letting through those wellknown
While going around the road on inspection through the whole of that city
he may not see such fissures in the wall or openings in the wall
that even a cat could go out through it may be so
but he knows Whatever grosser beings enter or depart from this city
all of them surely enter or depart through this door
Similarly reverend Sir I understand it is in conformity with the Teaching
that whoever reverend Sir in the past times are Worthy Ones Perfect Sambuddhas
all those Fortunate Ones after giving up the five hindrances
have penetrated with wisdom the corruptions of the mind that make one feeble
have established their minds in the four ways of attending to mindfulness
and after developing just as it is the Seven Factors of Awakening
have awakened to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening
That whoever reverend Sir in the future times are Worthy Ones Perfect Sambuddhas
all those Fortunate Ones after giving up the five hindrances
and penetrating with wisdom the corruptions of the mind that make one feeble
and establishing their minds in the four ways of attending to mindfulness
and developing just as it is the Seven Factors of Awakening
will awaken to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening
And the Fortunate One reverend Sir in the present time the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
also after giving up the five hindrances
has penetrated with wisdom the corruptions of the mind that make one feeble
has established his mind in the four ways of attending to mindfulness
and after developing just as it is the Seven Factors of Awakening
has awoken to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening
There also the Fortunate One while living near Nāḷandā in Pāvārikas Mango Wood
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching saying
Such is virtue such is concentration such is wisdom
when virtue is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration
when concentration is welldeveloped it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom
when wisdom is welldeveloped the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants
that is to say the pollutant of sensuality the pollutant of craving for continued existence the pollutant of ignorance
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe entered Vesālī for alms
After walking for alms in Vesālī and returning from the almsround after the meal
he addressed venerable nanda saying
Take up the sitting mat nanda
we will approach the Cāpāla shrine to dwell for the day
Very well reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate One
and taking the sitting mat he followed along close behind the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One approached the Cāpāla shrine
and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat
and also venerable nanda after worshipping the Fortunate One sat down on one side
While sitting on one side the Fortunate One said this to venerable nanda
Delightful nanda is Vesālī delightful is the Udena shrine
delightful is the Gotamaka shrine delightful is the Sattamba shrine
delightful is the Many Sons shrine delightful is the Sārandada shrine
delightful is the Cāpāla shrine
 Whoever has developed nanda
made much of carried on established maintained augmented and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power
could if he wanted nanda remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan
 The Realised One has developed nanda
made much of carried on established maintained augmented and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power
If he wanted nanda the Realised One
could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan
But venerable nanda despite such a gross hint being made by the Fortunate One
such a gross suggestion being made was unable to penetrate it
and did not beg the Fortunate One saying
May the Fortunate One remain reverend Sir for the lifespan may the Happy One remain for the lifespan
for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people out of compassion for the world
for the welfare benefit and happiness of Divinities and men
like one whose mind was possessed by Māra
For a second time the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Delightful nanda is Vesālī delightful is the Udena shrine
delightful is the Gotamaka shrine delightful is the Sattamba shrine
delightful is the Many Sons shrine delightful is the Sārandada shrine
delightful is the Cāpāla shrine
 Whoever has developed nanda
made much of carried on established maintained augmented and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power
could if he wanted remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan
 The Realised One has developed nanda
made much of carried on established maintained augmented and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power
If he wanted nanda the Realised One
could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan
But venerable nanda despite such a gross hint being made by the Fortunate One
such a gross suggestion being made was unable to penetrate it
and did not beg the Fortunate One saying
May the Fortunate One remain reverend Sir for the lifespan may the Happy One remain for the lifespan
for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people out of compassion for the world
for the welfare benefit and happiness of Divinities and men
like one whose mind was possessed by Māra
For a third time the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Delightful nanda is Vesālī delightful is the Udena shrine
delightful is the Gotamaka shrine delightful is the Sattamba shrine
delightful is the Many Sons shrine delightful is the Sārandada shrine
delightful is the Cāpāla shrine
 Whoever has developed nanda
made much of carried on established maintained augmented and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power
could if he wanted remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan
 The Realised One has developed nanda
made much of carried on established maintained augmented and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power
If he wanted nanda the Realised One
could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan
But venerable nanda despite such a gross hint being made by the Fortunate One
such a gross suggestion being made was unable to penetrate it
and did not beg the Fortunate One saying
May the Fortunate One remain reverend Sir for the lifespan may the Happy One remain for the lifespan
for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people out of compassion for the world
for the welfare benefit and happiness of Divinities and men
like one whose mind was possessed by Māra
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable nanda saying
Go nanda now is the time for whatever you are thinking
Very well reverend Sir said venerable nanda and after replying to the Fortunate One
rising from his seat worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One
he sat down not far away at the root of a certain tree
At one time nanda I was living right here near Vesālī in the Udena Shrine
I was living right here near Vesālī in the Gotamaka Shrine
I was living right here near Vesālī in the Seven Mangos Shrine
I was living right here near Vesālī in the Many Sons Shrine
I was living right here near Vesālī in the Sārandada Shrine
and here today nanda at the Cāpāla Shrine I addressed you saying
Delightful nanda is Vesālī delightful is the Udena Shrine
delightful is the Gotamaka Shrine delightful is the Seven Mangos Shrine
delightful is the Many Sons Shrine delightful is the Sārandada Shrine
delightful is the Cāpāla Shrine
 Whoever has developed nanda
made much of carried on established maintained augmented and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power
could if he wanted remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan
 The Realised One has developed nanda
made much of carried on established maintained augmented and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power
If he wanted nanda the Realised One
could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan
But despite such a gross hint nanda being made by the Realised One
such a gross suggestion being made you were unable to penetrate it
and did not beg the Realised One saying
May the Fortunate One remain reverend Sir for the lifespan may the Happy One remain for the lifespan
for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people out of compassion for the world
for the welfare benefit and happiness of Divinities and men
If you nanda had begged the Realised One twice the Realised One might have rejected your speech
but would have accepted it on the third occasion
So nanda there is this wrongdoing for you there is this fault for you
Were you not warned by me when I declared
There is alteration in separation from and changeability in all that is dear and appealing
How can it be otherwise nanda for that which is obtained
born become conditioned subject to dissolution
It is not possible to say this It should not dissolve
But this has been relinquished cast out let loose abandoned by the Realised One
forsaken the lifeprocess that has been given up
For sure this word was spoken by the Realised One
Not long now there will be the Realised Ones Final Emancipation
after the passing of three months the Realised One will attain Final Emancipation
The Realised One cannot for the sake of life go back on that it is not possible
Middle Discourses
Two Kinds of Thought
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants before my awakeningwhen I was still unawakened but intent on awakeningI thought
Why dont I meditate by continually dividing my thoughts into two classes
So I assigned sensual malicious and cruel thoughts
to one class
And I assigned thoughts of renunciation good will and harmlessness
to the second class
Then as I meditateddiligent keen and resolutea sensual thought arose
I understood
This sensual thought has arisen in me
It leads to hurting myself hurting others and hurting both It blocks wisdom its on the side of anguish and it doesnt lead to extinguishment
When I reflected that it leads to hurting myself it went away
When I reflected that it leads to hurting others it went away
When I reflected that it leads to hurting both it went away
When I reflected that it blocks wisdom its on the side of anguish and it doesnt lead to extinguishment it went away
So I gave up got rid of and eliminated any sensual thoughts that arose
Then as I meditateddiligent keen and resolutea malicious thought arose 
a cruel thought arose
I understood
This cruel thought has arisen in me
It leads to hurting myself hurting others and hurting both It blocks wisdom its on the side of anguish and it doesnt lead to extinguishment
When I reflected that it leads to hurting myself 
hurting others 
hurting both it went away
When I reflected that it blocks wisdom its on the side of anguish and it doesnt lead to extinguishment it went away
So I gave up got rid of and eliminated any cruel thoughts that arose
Whatever a mendicant frequently thinks about and considers becomes their hearts inclination
If they often think about and consider sensual thoughts theyve given up the thought of renunciation to cultivate sensual thought Their mind inclines to sensual thoughts
If they often think about and consider malicious thoughts  their mind inclines to malicious thoughts
If they often think about and consider cruel thoughts  their mind inclines to cruel thoughts
Suppose its the last month of the rainy season when the crops grow closely together and a cowherd must take care of the cattle
Hed tap and poke them with his staff on this side and that to keep them in check
Why is that
For he sees that if they wander into the crops he could be executed imprisoned fined or condemned
In the same way I saw that unskillful qualities have the drawbacks of sordidness and corruption and that skillful qualities have the benefit and cleansing power of renunciation
Then as I meditateddiligent keen and resolutea thought of renunciation arose
I understood
This thought of renunciation has arisen in me
It doesnt lead to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both It nourishes wisdom its on the side of freedom from anguish and it leads to extinguishment
If I were to keep on thinking and considering this all night 
all night and day I see no danger that would come from that
Still thinking and considering for too long would tire my body
And when the body is tired the mind is stressed
And when the mind is stressed its far from immersion
So I stilled settled unified and immersed my mind internally
Why is that
So that my mind would not be stressed
Then as I meditateddiligent keen and resolutea thought of good will arose 
a thought of harmlessness arose
I understood
This thought of harmlessness has arisen in me
It doesnt lead to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both It nourishes wisdom its on the side of freedom from anguish and it leads to extinguishment
If I were to keep on thinking and considering this all night 
all night and day I see no danger that would come from that
Still thinking and considering for too long would tire my body
And when the body is tired the mind is stressed
And when the mind is stressed its far from immersion
So I stilled settled unified and immersed my mind internally
Why is that
So that my mind would not be stressed
Whatever a mendicant frequently thinks about and considers becomes their hearts inclination
If they often think about and consider thoughts of renunciation theyve given up sensual thought to cultivate the thought of renunciation Their mind inclines to thoughts of renunciation
If they often think about and consider thoughts of good will  their mind inclines to thoughts of good will
If they often think about and consider thoughts of harmlessness  their mind inclines to thoughts of harmlessness
Suppose its the last month of summer when all the crops have been gathered into the neighborhood of a village and a cowherd must take care of the cattle While at the root of a tree or in the open he need only be mindful that
the cattle are there
In the same way I needed only to be mindful that
those things were there
My energy was roused up and unflagging my mindfulness was established and lucid my body was tranquil and undisturbed and my mind was immersed in samādhi
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled I entered and remained in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
And with the fading away of rapture I entered and remained in the third absorption where I meditated with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
With the giving up of pleasure and pain and the ending of former happiness and sadness I entered and remained in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
When my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward recollection of past lives
I recollected many kinds of past lives with features and details
This was the first knowledge which I achieved in the first watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
This was the second knowledge which I achieved in the middle watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
I truly understood This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering'
I truly understood These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements'
Knowing and seeing like this my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
I understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
This was the third knowledge which I achieved in the last watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
Suppose that in a forested wilderness there was an expanse of lowlying marshes
and a large herd of deer lived nearby
Then along comes a person who wants to harm injure and threaten them
They close off the safe secure path that leads to happiness and open the wrong path There they plant domesticated male and female deer as decoys
so that in due course that herd of deer would fall to ruin and disaster
Then along comes a person who wants to help keep the herd of deer safe
They open up the safe secure path that leads to happiness and close off the wrong path They get rid of the decoys
so that in due course that herd of deer would grow increase and mature
Ive made up this simile to make a point
And this is what it means
An expanse of lowlying marshes is a term for sensual pleasures
A large herd of deer is a term for sentient beings
A person who wants to harm injure and threaten them is a term for Māra the Wicked
The wrong path is a term for the wrong eightfold path that is
wrong view wrong thought wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong immersion
A domesticated male deer is a term for greed and relishing
A domesticated female deer is a term for ignorance
A person who wants to help keep the herd of deer safe is a term for the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
The safe secure path that leads to happiness is a term for the noble eightfold path that is
right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion
So mendicants I have opened up the safe secure path to happiness and closed off the wrong path And I have got rid of the male and female decoys
Out of compassion Ive done what a teacher should do who wants whats best for their disciples
Here are these roots of trees and here are these empty huts
Practice absorption mendicants Dont be negligent Dont regret it later This is my instruction to you
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkya
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then as Venerable Māluṅkya was in private retreat this thought came to his mind
There are several convictions that the Buddha has left undeclared he has set them aside and refused to comment on them
For example the cosmos is eternal or not eternal or finite or infinite the soul and the body are the same thing or they are different things after death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt exist
The Buddha does not give me a straight answer on these points
I dont like that and do not accept it
Ill go to him and ask him about this
If he gives me a straight answer on any of these points
I will lead the spiritual life under him
If he does not give me a straight answer on any of these points
I shall resign the training and return to a lesser life
Then in the late afternoon Māluṅkya came out of retreat and went to the Buddha
He bowed sat down to one side and told the Buddha of his thoughts He then continued
If the Buddha knows
that the cosmos is eternal please tell me
If you know
that the cosmos is not eternal tell me
If you dont know
whether the cosmos is eternal or not then it is straightforward to simply say
I neither know nor see
If you know
that the world is finite or infinite that the soul and the body are the same thing or they are different things that after death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt exist please tell me
If you dont know
any of these things then it is straightforward to simply say
I neither know nor see
What Māluṅkyaputta did I ever say to you
Come Māluṅkyaputta lead the spiritual life under me and I will declare these things to you
No sir
Or did you ever say to me
Sir I will lead the spiritual life under the Buddha and the Buddha will declare these things to me
No sir
So it seems that I did not say to you
Come Māluṅkyaputta lead the spiritual life under me and I will declare these things to you
And you never said to me
Sir I will lead the spiritual life under the Buddha and the Buddha will declare these things to me
In that case you silly man are you really in a position to be abandoning anything
Suppose someone were to say this
I will not lead the spiritual life under the Buddha until the Buddha declares to me
that the cosmos is eternal or that the cosmos is not eternal 
or that after death a Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist
That would still remain undeclared by the Realized One and meanwhile that person would die
Suppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison
His friends and colleagues relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat him
But the man would say
I wont pull out this arrow as long as I dont know whether the man who wounded me was an aristocrat a brahmin a merchant or a worker
I wont pull out this arrow as long as I dont know the following things about the man who wounded me his name and clan
whether hes tall short or medium
whether his skin is black brown or tawny
and what village town or city he comes from
I wont pull out this arrow as long as I dont know whether the bow that wounded me is made of wood or cane
whether the bowstring is made of swallowwort fibre sunn hemp fibre sinew sanseveria fibre or spurge fibre
whether the shaft is made from a bush or a plantation tree
whether the shaft was fitted with feathers from a vulture a heron a hawk a peacock or a stork
whether the shaft was bound with sinews of a cow a buffalo a swamp deer or a gibbon
and whether the arrowhead was spiked razortipped barbed made of iron or a calfs tooth or lancetshaped
That man would still not have learned these things and meanwhile theyd die
In the same way suppose someone was to say
I will not lead the spiritual life under the Buddha until the Buddha declares to me
that the cosmos is eternal or that the cosmos is not eternal 
or that after death a Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist
That would still remain undeclared by the Realized One and meanwhile that person would die
Its not true that if there were the view the cosmos is eternal there would be the living of the spiritual life
Its not true that if there were the view the cosmos is not eternal there would be the living of the spiritual life
When there is the view that the cosmos is eternal or that the cosmos is not eternal there is rebirth there is old age there is death and there is sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
And it is the defeat of these things in this very life that I advocate
Its not true that if there were the view the world is finite 
the world is infinite 
the soul and the body are the same thing 
the soul and the body are different things 
a Realized One exists after death 
a Realized One doesnt exist after death 
a Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after death 
a Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after death there would be the living of the spiritual life
When there are any of these views there is rebirth there is old age there is death and there is sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
And it is the defeat of these things in this very life that I advocate
So Māluṅkyaputta you should remember what I have not declared as undeclared
and what I have declared as declared
And what have I not declared
I have not declared the following the cosmos is eternal
the cosmos is not eternal
the world is finite
the world is infinite
the soul and the body are the same thing
the soul and the body are different things
a Realized One exists after death
a Realized One doesnt exist after death
a Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after death
a Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after death
And why havent I declared these things
Because they arent beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life They dont lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment
Thats why I havent declared them
And what have I declared
I have declared the following this is suffering
this is the origin of suffering
this is the cessation of suffering
this is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
And why have I declared these things
Because they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life They lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment
Thats why I have declared them
So Māluṅkyaputta you should remember what I have not declared as undeclared
and what I have declared as declared
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable Māluṅkyaputta was happy with what the Buddha said

The Analysis of Religious Donations
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery
Then Mahāpajāpati Gotamī approached the Buddha bringing a new pair of garments
She bowed sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Sir I have spun and woven this new pair of garments specially for the Buddha
May the Buddha please accept this from me out of compassion
When she said this the Buddha said to her
Give it to the Saṅgha Gotamī
When you give to the Saṅgha both the Saṅgha and I will be honored
For a second time 
For a third time Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Buddha
Sir I have spun and woven this new pair of garments specially for the Buddha
May the Buddha please accept this from me out of compassion
And for a third time the Buddha said to her
Give it to the Saṅgha Gotamī
When you give to the Saṅgha both the Saṅgha and I will be honored
When he said this Venerable nanda said to the Buddha
Sir please accept the new pair of garments from Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī
Sir Mahāpajāpatī was very helpful to the Buddha As his aunt she raised him nurtured him and gave him her milk
When the Buddhas birth mother passed away she nurtured him at her own breast
And the Buddha has been very helpful to Mahāpajāpatī
It is owing to the Buddha that Mahāpajāpatī has gone for refuge to the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha
Its owing to the Buddha that she refrains from killing living creatures stealing committing sexual misconduct lying and taking alcoholic drinks that cause negligence
Its owing to the Buddha that she has experiential confidence in the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha and has the ethics loved by the noble ones
Its owing to the Buddha that she is free of doubt regarding suffering its origin its cessation and the practice that leads to its cessation
The Buddha has been very helpful to Mahāpajāpatī
Thats so true nanda
When someone has enabled you to go for refuge its not easy to repay them
by bowing down to them rising up for them greeting them with joined palms and observing proper etiquette for them or by providing them with robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick
When someone has enabled you to refrain from killing stealing sexual misconduct lying and alcoholic drinks that cause negligence its not easy to repay them

nanda there are these fourteen religious donations to individuals
What fourteen
One gives a gift to the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
This is the first religious donation to an individual
One gives a gift to a Buddha awakened for themselves
This is the second religious donation to an individual
One gives a gift to a perfected one
This is the third religious donation to an individual
One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of perfection
This is the fourth religious donation to an individual
One gives a gift to a nonreturner
This is the fifth religious donation to an individual
One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of nonreturn
This is the sixth religious donation to an individual
One gives a gift to a oncereturner
This is the seventh religious donation to an individual
One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of oncereturn
This is the eighth religious donation to an individual
One gives a gift to a streamenterer
This is the ninth religious donation to an individual
One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of streamentry
This is the tenth religious donation to an individual
One gives a gift to an outsider who is free of sensual desire
This is the eleventh religious donation to an individual
One gives a gift to an ordinary person who has good ethical conduct
This is the twelfth religious donation to an individual
One gives a gift to an ordinary person who has bad ethical conduct
This is the thirteenth religious donation to an individual
One gives a gift to an animal
This is the fourteenth religious donation to an individual
Now nanda gifts to the following persons may be expected to yield the following returns To an animal a hundred times To an unethical ordinary person a thousand To an ethical ordinary person a hundred thousand To an outsider free of sensual desire  But a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of streamentry may be expected to yield incalculable immeasurable returns How much more so a gift to a streamenterer someone practicing to realize the fruit of oncereturn a oncereturner someone practicing to realize the fruit of nonreturn a nonreturner someone practicing to realize the fruit of perfection a perfected one or a Buddha awakened for themselves How much more so a Realized One a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha
But there are nanda seven religious donations bestowed on a Saṅgha
What seven
One gives a gift to the communities of both monks and nuns headed by the Buddha
This is the first religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha
One gives a gift to the communities of both monks and nuns after the Buddha has finally become extinguished
This is the second religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha
One gives a gift to the Saṅgha of monks
This is the third religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha
One gives a gift to the Saṅgha of nuns
This is the fourth religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha
One gives a gift thinking Appoint this many monks and nuns for me from the Saṅgha
This is the fifth religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha
One gives a gift thinking Appoint this many monks for me from the Saṅgha
This is the sixth religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha
One gives a gift thinking Appoint this many nuns for me from the Saṅgha
This is the seventh religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha
In times to come there will be members of the spiritual family merely by virtue of wearing ocher cloth around their necks but they are unethical and of bad character
People will give gifts to those unethical people in the name of the Saṅgha
Even then I say a religious donation bestowed on the Saṅgha is incalculable and immeasurable
But I say that there is no way a personal offering can be more fruitful than one bestowed on a Saṅgha
nanda there are these four ways of purifying a religious donation
What four
Theres a religious donation thats purified by the giver not the recipient
Theres a religious donation thats purified by the recipient not the giver
Theres a religious donation thats purified by neither the giver nor the recipient
Theres a religious donation thats purified by both the giver and the recipient
And how is a religious donation purified by the giver not the recipient
Its when the giver is ethical of good character but the recipient is unethical of bad character
And how is a religious donation purified by the recipient not the giver
Its when the giver is unethical of bad character but the recipient is ethical of good character
And how is a religious donation purified by neither the giver nor the recipient
Its when both the giver and the recipient are unethical of bad character
And how is a religious donation purified by both the giver and the recipient
Its when both the giver and the recipient are ethical of good character
These are the four ways of purifying a religious donation
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
When an ethical person with trusting heart
gives a proper gift to unethical persons
trusting in the ample fruit of deeds
that offering is purified by the giver
When an unethical and untrusting person
gives an improper gift to ethical persons
not trusting in the ample fruit of deeds
that offering is purified by the receivers
When an unethical and untrusting person
gives an improper gift to unethical persons
not trusting in the ample fruit of deeds
I declare that gift is not very fruitful
When an ethical person with trusting heart
gives a proper gift to ethical persons
trusting in the ample fruit of deeds
I declare that gift is abundantly fruitful
But when a passionless one gives to the passionless
a proper gift with trusting heart
trusting in the ample fruit of deeds
thats truly the best of material gifts
Middle Discourses
The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
For a long time I have had discussions with Master Gotama
Please teach me in brief what is skillful and what is unskillful
Vaccha I can teach you what is skillful and what is unskillful in brief or in detail
Still let me do so in brief
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir Vaccha replied
The Buddha said this
Greed is unskillful contentment is skillful
Hate is unskillful love is skillful
Delusion is unskillful understanding is skillful
So there are these three unskillful things and three that are skillful
Killing living creatures stealing and sexual misconduct speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical covetousness ill will and wrong view these things are unskillful
Refraining from killing living creatures stealing and sexual misconduct refraining from speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical contentment kindheartedness and right view these things are skillful
So there are these ten unskillful things and ten that are skillful
When a mendicant has given up craving so it is cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated and unable to arise in the future that mendicant is perfected Theyve ended the defilements completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and are rightly freed through enlightenment
Leaving aside Master Gotama
is there even a single monk disciple of Master Gotama who has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
There are not just one hundred such monks who are my disciples Vaccha or two or three or four or five hundred but many more than that
Leaving aside Master Gotama and the monks
is there even a single nun disciple of Master Gotama who has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
There are not just one hundred such nuns who are my disciples Vaccha or two or three or four or five hundred but many more than that
Leaving aside Master Gotama the monks and the nuns

There are not just one hundred such celibate laymen who are my disciples Vaccha or two or three or four or five hundred but many more than that
Leaving aside Master Gotama the monks the nuns and the celibate laymen

There are not just one hundred such laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures who are my disciples Vaccha or two or three or four or five hundred but many more than that
If Master Gotama was the only one to succeed in this teaching not any monks
then this spiritual path would be incomplete in that respect
But because both Master Gotama and monks have succeeded in this teaching
this spiritual path is complete in that respect
If Master Gotama and the monks were the only ones to succeed in this teaching not any nuns 
celibate laymen 
laymen enjoying sensual pleasures 
celibate laywomen 
laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures
then this spiritual path would be incomplete in that respect
But because Master Gotama monks nuns celibate laymen laymen enjoying sensual pleasures celibate laywomen and laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures have all succeeded in this teaching
this spiritual path is complete in that respect
Just as the Ganges river slants slopes and inclines towards the ocean and keeps pushing into the ocean in the same way Master Gotamas assemblywith both laypeople and renunciatesslants slopes and inclines towards extinguishment and keeps pushing into extinguishment
Excellent Master Gotama 
I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
Sir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Vaccha if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth the ordination in this teaching and training they must spend four months on probation
When four months have passed if the mendicants are satisfied theyll give the going forth the ordination into monkhood
However I have recognized individual differences in this matter
Sir if four months probation are required in such a case Ill spend four years on probation
When four years have passed if the mendicants are satisfied let them give me the going forth the ordination into monkhood
And the wanderer Vaccha received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Not long after his ordination a fortnight later Venerable Vacchagotta went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir Ive reached as far as possible with the knowledge and understanding of a trainee
Please teach me further
Well then Vaccha further develop two things serenity and discernment
When you have further developed these two things theyll lead to the penetration of many elements
Whenever you want youll be capable of realizing the following in each and every case
May I wield the many kinds of psychic power multiplying myself and becoming one again appearing and disappearing going unimpeded through a wall a rampart or a mountain as if through space diving in and out of the earth as if it were water walking on water as if it were earth flying crosslegged through the sky like a bird touching and stroking with my hand the sun and moon so mighty and powerful controlling my body as far as the Brahmā realm
Whenever you want youll be capable of realizing the following in each and every case
With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman may I hear both kinds of sounds human and divine whether near or far
Whenever you want youll be capable of realizing the following in each and every case
May I understand the minds of other beings and individuals having comprehended them with my mind
May I understand mind with greed as mind with greed
and mind without greed as mind without greed
mind with hate as mind with hate
and mind without hate as mind without hate
mind with delusion as mind with delusion
and mind without delusion as mind without delusion
constricted mind as constricted mind
and scattered mind as scattered mind
expansive mind as expansive mind
and unexpansive mind as unexpansive mind
mind that is not supreme as mind that is not supreme
and mind that is supreme as mind that is supreme
mind immersed in samādhi as mind immersed in samādhi
and mind not immersed in samādhi as mind not immersed in samādhi
freed mind as freed mind
and unfreed mind as unfreed mind
Whenever you want youll be capable of realizing the following in each and every case
May I recollect many kinds of past lives That is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding May I remember There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here May I recollect my many past lives with features and details
Whenever you want youll be capable of realizing the following in each and every case
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad placeand understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds These dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mind They spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they chose to act out of that wrong view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place And may I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
Whenever you want youll be capable of realizing the following in each and every case
May I realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements
And then Venerable Vacchagotta approved and agreed with what the Buddha said He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leaving
Then Vacchagotta living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
He understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
And Venerable Vacchagotta became one of the perfected
Now at that time several mendicants were going to see the Buddha
Vacchagotta saw them coming off in the distance
went up to them and said
Hello venerables where are you going
Reverend we are going to see the Buddha
Well then reverends in my name please bow with your head to the Buddhas feet and say
Sir the mendicant Vacchagotta bows with his head to your feet and says
I have served the Blessed One I have served the Holy One
Yes reverend they replied
Then those mendicants went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir the mendicant Vacchagotta bows with his head to your feet and says
I have served the Blessed One I have served the Holy One
Ive already comprehended Vacchagottas mind and understood that
he has the three knowledges and is very mighty and powerful
And deities also told me about this
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said

The Many Kinds of Feeling
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then the master builder Pañcakaṅga went up to Venerable Udāyī bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir how many feelings has the Buddha spoken of
Master builder the Buddha has spoken of three feelings
pleasant painful and neutral
The Buddha has spoken of these three feelings
When he said this Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī
Sir Udāyī the Buddha hasnt spoken of three feelings
Hes spoken of two feelings
pleasant and painful
The Buddha said that neutral feeling is included as a peaceful and subtle kind of pleasure
For a second time Udāyī said to Pañcakaṅga
The Buddha hasnt spoken of two feelings
hes spoken of three
For a second time Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī
The Buddha hasnt spoken of three feelings
hes spoken of two
And for a third time Udāyī said to Pañcakaṅga
The Buddha hasnt spoken of two feelings
hes spoken of three
And for a third time Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī
The Buddha hasnt spoken of three feelings
hes spoken of two
But neither was able to persuade the other
Venerable nanda heard this discussion between Udāyī and Pañcakaṅga
Then he went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side
and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed
When he had spoken the Buddha said to him
nanda the explanation by the mendicant Udāyī which the master builder Pañcakaṅga didnt agree with was quite correct But the explanation by Pañcakaṅga which Udāyī didnt agree with was also quite correct
In one explanation Ive spoken of two feelings In another explanation Ive spoken of three feelings or five six eighteen thirtysix or a hundred and eight feelings
Ive explained the teaching in all these different ways
This being so you can expect that those who dont concede approve or agree with what has been well spoken will argue quarrel and fight continually wounding each other with barbed words
Ive explained the teaching in all these different ways
This being so you can expect that those who do concede approve or agree with what has been well spoken will live in harmony appreciating each other without quarreling blending like milk and water and regarding each other with kindly eyes
There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation
What five
Sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
Sounds known by the ear 
Smells known by the nose 
Tastes known by the tongue 
Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation
The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure
There are those who would say that this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience But I dont grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure that is finer than that
And what is that pleasure
Its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
This is a pleasure that is finer than that
There are those who would say that this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience But I dont grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure that is finer than that
And what is that pleasure
Its when as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected 
And what is that pleasure
Its when with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss 
And what is that pleasure
Its when giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness 
And what is that pleasure
Its when a mendicant going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space 
And what is that pleasure
Its when a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness 
And what is that pleasure
Its when a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness 
And what is that pleasure
Its when a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
This is a pleasure that is finer than that
There are those who would say that this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience But I dont grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure that is finer than that
And what is that pleasure
Its when a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling
This is a pleasure that is finer than that
Its possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say
The ascetic Gotama spoke of the cessation of perception and feeling and he includes it in happiness
Whats up with that
When wanderers who follow other paths say this you should say to them
Reverends when the Buddha describes whats included in happiness hes not just referring to pleasant feeling
The Realized One describes pleasure as included in happiness wherever its found and in whatever context
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha said

The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans where they have a town named Haliddavasana
Then Puṇṇa Koliyaputta who had taken a vow to behave like a cow and Seniya a naked ascetic who had taken a vow to behave like a dog went to see the Buddha
Puṇṇa bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side while Seniya exchanged greetings and polite conversation with him before sitting down to one side curled up like a dog
Puṇṇa said to the Buddha
Sir this naked dog ascetic Seniya does a hard thing he eats food placed on the ground
For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a dog
Where will he be reborn in his next life
Enough Puṇṇa let it be Dont ask me that
For a second time 
and a third time Puṇṇa said to the Buddha
Sir this naked dog ascetic Seniya does a hard thing he eats food placed on the ground
For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a dog
Where will he be reborn in his next life
Clearly Puṇṇa Im not getting through to you when I say
Enough Puṇṇa let it be Dont ask me that
Nevertheless I will answer you
Take someone who develops the dog observance fully and uninterruptedly They develop a dogs ethics a dogs mentality and a dogs behavior fully and uninterruptedly
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of dogs
But if they have such a view
By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life may I become one of the gods This is their wrong view
An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places I say hell or the animal realm
So if the dog observance succeeds it leads to rebirth in the company of dogs but if it fails it leads to hell
When he said this Seniya cried and burst out in tears
The Buddha said to Puṇṇa
This is what I didnt get through to you when I said
Enough Puṇṇa let it be Dont ask me that
Sir Im not crying because of what the Buddha said
But sir for a long time I have undertaken this observance to behave like a dog
Sir this Puṇṇa has taken a vow to behave like a cow
For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a cow
Where will he be reborn in his next life
Enough Seniya let it be Dont ask me that
For a second time 
and a third time Seniya said to the Buddha
Sir this Puṇṇa has taken a vow to behave like a cow
For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a cow
Where will he be reborn in his next life
Clearly Seniya Im not getting through to you when I say
Enough Seniya let it be Dont ask me that
Nevertheless I will answer you
Take someone who develops the cow observance fully and uninterruptedly They develop a cows ethics a cows mentality and a cows behavior fully and uninterruptedly
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of cows
But if they have such a view
By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life may I become one of the gods This is their wrong view
An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places I say hell or the animal realm
So if the cow observance succeeds it leads to rebirth in the company of cows but if it fails it leads to hell
When he said this Puṇṇa cried and burst out in tears
The Buddha said to Seniya
This is what I didnt get through to you when I said
Enough Seniya let it be Dont ask me that
Sir Im not crying because of what the Buddha said
But sir for a long time I have undertaken this observance to behave like a cow
I am quite confident that the Buddha
is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this cow observance and the naked ascetic Seniya can give up that dog observance
Well then Puṇṇa listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir he replied
The Buddha said this
Puṇṇa I declare these four kinds of deeds having realized them with my own insight
What four
There are dark deeds with dark results
bright deeds with bright results
dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results and
neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results which lead to the ending of deeds
And what are dark deeds with dark results
Its when someone makes hurtful choices by way of body speech and mind
Having made these choices theyre reborn in a hurtful world
where hurtful contacts touch them
Touched by hurtful contacts they experience hurtful feelings that are exclusively painfullike the beings in hell
This is how a being is born from a being
For your deeds determine your rebirth
and when youre reborn contacts affect you
This is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deeds
These are called dark deeds with dark results
And what are bright deeds with bright results
Its when someone makes pleasing choices by way of body speech and mind
Having made these choices they are reborn in a pleasing world
where pleasing contacts touch them
Touched by pleasing contacts they experience pleasing feelings that are exclusively happylike the gods replete with glory
This is how a being is born from a being
For your deeds determine your rebirth
and when youre reborn contacts affect you
This is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deeds
These are called bright deeds with bright results
And what are dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results
Its when someone makes both hurtful and pleasing choices by way of body speech and mind
Having made these choices they are reborn in a world that is both hurtful and pleasing
where hurtful and pleasing contacts touch them
Touched by both hurtful and pleasing contacts they experience both hurtful and pleasing feelings that are a mixture of pleasure and painlike humans some gods and some beings in the underworld
This is how a being is born from a being
For what you do brings about your rebirth
and when youre reborn contacts affect you
This is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deeds
These are called dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results
And what are neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results which lead to the ending of deeds
Its the intention to give up dark deeds with dark results bright deeds with bright results and both dark and bright deeds with both dark and bright results
These are called neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results which lead to the ending of deeds
These are the four kinds of deeds that I declare having realized them with my own insight
When he had spoken Puṇṇa Koliyaputta the observer of cow behavior said to the Buddha
Excellent sir Excellent 
From this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
And Seniya the naked dog ascetic said to the Buddha
Excellent sir Excellent 
I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
Sir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Seniya if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth the ordination in this teaching and training they must spend four months on probation
When four months have passed if the mendicants are satisfied theyll give the going forth the ordination into monkhood
However I have recognized individual differences in this matter
Sir if four months probation are required in such a case Ill spend four years on probation When four years have passed if the mendicants are satisfied let them give me the going forth the ordination into monkhood
And the naked dog ascetic Seniya received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Not long after his ordination Venerable Seniya living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
He understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
And Venerable Seniya became one of the perfected
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
Now at that time Saccaka the son of Jain parents was staying in Vesālī He was a debater and clever speaker regarded as holy by many people
He was telling a crowd in Vesālī
If I was to take them on in debate I dont see any ascetic or brahminleader of an order or a community or the teacher of a community even one who claims to be a perfected one a fully awakened Buddhawho would not shake and rock and tremble sweating from the armpits
Even if I took on an insentient post in debate it would shake and rock and tremble
How much more then a human being
Then Venerable Assaji robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Vesālī for alms
As Saccaka was going for a walk he saw Assaji coming off in the distance
He approached him and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over Saccaka stood to one side and said to Assaji
Master Assaji how does the ascetic Gotama guide his disciples And how does instruction to his disciples generally proceed
Aggivessana this is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples and how instruction to his disciples generally proceeds
Form feeling perception choices and consciousness are impermanent
Form feeling perception choices and consciousness are notself
All conditions are impermanent All things are notself
This is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples and how instruction to his disciples generally proceeds
Its sad to hear Master Assaji that the ascetic Gotama has such a doctrine
Hopefully some time or other Ill get to meet Master Gotama and we can have a discussion And hopefully I can dissuade him from this harmful misconception
Now at that time around five hundred Licchavis were sitting together at the meeting hall on some business
Then Saccaka went up to them and said
Come forth good Licchavīs come forth Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic Gotama
If he stands by the position stated to me by one of his wellknown disciplesa mendicant named AssajiIll take him on in debate and drag him to and fro and round about like a strong man would drag a fleecy sheep to and fro and round about
Taking him on in debate Ill drag him to and fro and round about like a strong brewers worker would toss a large brewers sieve into a deep lake grab it by the corners and drag it to and fro and round about
Taking him on in debate Ill shake him down and about and give him a beating like a strong brewers mixer would grab a strainer by the corners and shake it down and about and give it a beating
Ill play a game of earwashing with the ascetic Gotama like a sixtyyearold elephant would plunge into a deep lotus pond and play a game of earwashing
Come forth good Licchavīs come forth Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic Gotama
At that some of the Licchavis said
How can the ascetic Gotama refute Saccakas doctrine when it is Saccaka who will refute Gotamas doctrine
But some of the Licchavis said
Who is Saccaka to refute the Buddhas doctrine when it is the Buddha who will refute Saccakas doctrine
Then Saccaka escorted by the five hundred Licchavis went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood
At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air
Then Saccaka went up to them and said
Gentlemen where is Master Gotama at present
For we want to see him
Aggivessana the Buddha has plunged deep into the Great Wood and is sitting at the root of a tree for the days meditation
Then Saccaka together with a large group of Licchavis went to see the Buddha in the Great Wood and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
Before sitting down to one side some of the Licchavīs bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silent
Then Saccaka said to the Buddha
Id like to ask Master Gotama about a certain point if youd take the time to answer
Ask what you wish Aggivessana
How does the ascetic Gotama guide his disciples And how does instruction to his disciples generally proceed
This is how I guide my disciples and how instruction to my disciples generally proceeds
Form feeling perception choices and consciousness are impermanent
Form feeling perception choices and consciousness are notself
All conditions are impermanent All things are notself
This is how I guide my disciples and how instruction to my disciples generally proceeds
A simile strikes me Master Gotama
Then speak as you feel inspired said the Buddha
All the plants and seeds that achieve growth increase and maturity do so depending on the earth and grounded on the earth
All the hard work that gets done depends on the earth and is grounded on the earth
In the same way an individuals self is form Grounded on form they make good and bad choices An individuals self is feeling  perception  choices  consciousness Grounded on consciousness they make good and bad choices
Aggivessana are you not saying this
Form is my self feeling is my self perception is my self choices are my self consciousness is my self
Indeed Master Gotama that is what I am saying
And this big crowd agrees with me
What has this big crowd to do with you
Please just explain your own statement
Then Master Gotama what I am saying is this
Form is my self feeling is my self perception is my self choices are my self consciousness is my self
Well then Aggivessana Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think Aggivessana
Consider an anointed aristocratic king such as Pasenadi of Kosala or Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha
Would they have the power in their own realm to execute fine or banish those who are guilty
An anointed king would have such power Master Gotama
Even federations such as the
Vajjis and Mallas
have such power in their own realm
So of course an anointed king such as Pasenadi or Ajātasattu
would wield such power as is their right
What do you think Aggivessana
When you say
Form is my self do you have power over that form to say
May my form be like this May it not be like that
When he said this Saccaka kept silent
The Buddha asked the question a second time
but Saccaka still kept silent
So the Buddha said to Saccaka
Answer now Aggivessana Now is not the time for silence
If someone fails to answer a legitimate question when asked three times by the Buddha their head explodes into seven pieces there and then
Now at that time the spirit Vajirapāṇi taking up a burning iron thunderbolt blazing and glowing stood in the sky above Saccaka thinking
If this Saccaka doesnt answer when asked a third time Ill blow his head into seven pieces there and then
And both the Buddha and Saccaka could see Vajirapāṇi
Saccaka was terrified shocked and awestruck Looking to the Buddha for shelter protection and refuge he said
Ask me Master Gotama I will answer
What do you think Aggivessana
When you say
Form is my self do you have power over that form to say
May my form be like this May it not be like that
No Master Gotama
Think about it Aggivessana
You should think before answering
What you said before and what you said after dont match up
What do you think Aggivessana
When you say
Feeling is my self do you have power over that feeling to say
May my feeling be like this May it not be like that
No Master Gotama
Think about it Aggivessana
You should think before answering
What you said before and what you said after dont match up
What do you think Aggivessana
When you say
Perception is my self do you have power over that perception to say
May my perception be like this May it not be like that
No Master Gotama
Think about it Aggivessana
You should think before answering
What you said before and what you said after dont match up
What do you think Aggivessana
When you say
Choices are my self do you have power over those choices to say
May my choices be like this May they not be like that
No Master Gotama
Think about it Aggivessana
You should think before answering
What you said before and what you said after dont match up
What do you think Aggivessana
When you say
Consciousness is my self do you have power over that consciousness to say
May my consciousness be like this May it not be like that
No Master Gotama
Think about it Aggivessana
You should think before answering
What you said before and what you said after dont match up
What do you think Aggivessana
Is form permanent or impermanent
Impermanent
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering
But if its impermanent suffering and liable to fall apart is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No Master Gotama
What do you think Aggivessana
Is feeling 
perception 
consciousness permanent or impermanent
Impermanent
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering
But if its impermanent suffering and liable to fall apart is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No Master Gotama
What do you think Aggivessana
Consider someone who clings holds and attaches to suffering regarding it thus This is mine I am this this is my self Would such a person be able to completely understand suffering themselves or live having wiped out suffering
How could they
No Master Gotama
What do you think Aggivessana
This being so arent you someone who clings holds and attaches to suffering regarding it thus This is mine I am this this is my self
How could I not
Yes Master Gotama
Suppose Aggivessana there was a person in need of heartwood Wandering in search of heartwood theyd take a sharp axe and enter a forest
There theyd see a big banana tree straight and young and grown free of defects
Theyd cut it down at the base cut off the top and unroll the coiled sheaths
But they wouldnt even find sapwood much less heartwood
In the same way when pursued pressed and grilled by me on your own doctrine you turn out to be void hollow and mistaken
But it was you who stated before the assembly of Vesālī
If I was to take them on in debate I dont see any ascetic or brahminleader of an order or a community or the teacher of a community even one who claims to be a perfected one a fully awakened Buddhawho would not shake and rock and tremble sweating from the armpits
Even if I took on an insentient post in debate it would shake and rock and tremble
How much more then a human being
But sweat is pouring from your forehead its soaked through your robe and drips on the ground
While I now have no sweat on my body
So the Buddha revealed his golden body to the assembly
When this was said Saccaka sat silent embarrassed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to say
Knowing this the Licchavi Dummukha said to the Buddha
A simile strikes me Blessed One
Then speak as you feel inspired said the Buddha
Sir suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village
and a crab lived there
Then several boys or girls would leave the town or village and go to the pond where theyd pull out the crab and put it on dry land
Whenever that crab extended a claw those boys or girls would snap crack and break it off with a stick or a stone
And when that crabs claws had all been snapped cracked and broken off it wouldnt be able to return down into that lotus pond
In the same way sir the Buddha has snapped cracked and broken off all Saccakas tricks dodges and evasions
Now he cant get near the Buddha again looking for a debate
But Saccaka said to him
Hold on Dummukha hold on I wasnt talking with you I was talking with Master Gotama
Master Gotama leave aside that statement I madeas did various other ascetics and brahmins
it was like just a bit of nonsense
How do you define a disciple of Master Gotama who follows instructions and responds to advice who has gone beyond doubt got rid of indecision gained assurance and is independent of others in the Teachers instructions
Its when one of my disciples truly sees any kind of form at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all formwith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
They truly see any kind of feeling 
perception 
consciousness at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all consciousnesswith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
Thats how to define one of my disciples who follows instructions and responds to advice who has gone beyond doubt got rid of indecision gained assurance and is independent of others in the Teachers instructions
But how do you define a mendicant who is a perfected one with defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenment
Its when one of my disciples truly sees any kind of form at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all formwith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my self And having seen this with right understanding theyre freed by not grasping
They truly see any kind of feeling 
perception 
consciousness at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all consciousnesswith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my self And having seen this with right understanding theyre freed by not grasping
Thats how to define a mendicant who is a perfected one with defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenment
A mendicant whose mind is freed like this has three unsurpassable qualities
unsurpassable vision practice and freedom
They honor respect esteem and venerate only the Realized One
The Blessed One is awakened tamed serene crossed over and extinguished And he teaches Dhamma for awakening selfcontrol serenity crossing over and extinguishment
When he had spoken Saccaka said to him
Master Gotama it was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debate
For a person might find safety after attacking a rutting elephant but not after attacking Master Gotama
A person might find safety after attacking a blazing mass of fire but not after attacking Master Gotama
They might find safety after attacking a poisonous viper but not after attacking Master Gotama
It was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debate
Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrows meal from me
The Buddha consented in silence
Then knowing that the Buddha had consented Saccaka addressed those Licchavis
Listen gentlemen I have invited the ascetic Gotama together with the Saṅgha of mendicants for tomorrows meal
You may all bring me what you think is suitable
Then when the night had passed those Licchavis presented Saccaka with an offering of five hundred servings of food
And Saccaka had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home Then he had the Buddha informed of the time saying
Its time Master Gotama the meal is ready
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to Saccakas park where he sat on the seat spread out together with the Saṅgha of mendicants
Then Saccaka served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods
When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Saccaka took a low seat and sat to one side
Then Saccaka said to the Buddha
Master Gotama may the merit and the growth of merit in this gift be for the happiness of the donors
Aggivessana whatever comes from giving to a recipient of a religious donation such as yourselfwho is not free of greed hate and delusionwill accrue to the donors
Whatever comes from giving to a recipient of a religious donation such as myselfwho is free of greed hate and delusionwill accrue to you

The Longer Advice to Rāhula

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for alms
And Venerable Rāhula also robed up and followed behind the Buddha
Then the Buddha looked back at Rāhula and said

Middle Discourses
At Kīṭāgiri
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kāsīs together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants I abstain from eating at night
Doing so I find that Im healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
You too should abstain from eating at night
Doing so youll find that youre healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
Yes sir they replied
Then the Buddha traveling stage by stage in the land of the Kāsīs arrived at a town of the Kāsīs named Kīṭāgiri
and stayed there
Now at that time the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka were residing at Kīṭāgiri
Then several mendicants went up to them and said
Reverends the Buddha abstains from eating at night and so does the mendicant Saṅgha
Doing so they find that theyre healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
You too should abstain from eating at night
Doing so youll find that youre healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
When they said this the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka said to them
Reverends we eat in the evening the morning and at the wrong time of day
Doing so we find that were healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
Why should we give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time
We shall eat in the evening the morning and at the wrong time of day
Since those mendicants were unable to persuade the mendicants who were followers of Assaji and Punabbasuka they approached the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
So the Buddha addressed a certain monk
Please monk in my name tell the mendicants who follow Assaji and Punabbasuka that
the teacher summons them
Yes sir that monk replied He went to those mendicants and said
Venerables the teacher summons you
Yes reverend those mendicants replied
They went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to them Is it really true mendicants that several mendicants went to you and said
Reverends the Buddha abstains from eating at night and so does the mendicant Saṅgha
Doing so they find that theyre healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
You too should abstain from eating at night
Doing so youll find that youre healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
When they said this did you really say to them
Reverends we eat in the evening the morning and at the wrong time of day
Doing so we find that were healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
Why should we give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time
We shall eat in the evening the morning and at the wrong time of day

Mendicants I dont say that all these mendicants still have work to do with diligence
Nor do I say that all these mendicants have no work to do with diligence
I say that mendicants dont have work to do with diligence if they are perfected with defilements ended having completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and become rightly freed through enlightenment
Why is that
Theyve done their work with diligence
Theyre incapable of being negligent
I say that mendicants still have work to do with diligence if they are trainees who havent achieved their hearts desire but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary
Why is that Thinking
Hopefully this venerable will frequent appropriate lodgings associate with good friends and control their faculties
Then they might realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life and live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Seeing this fruit of diligence for those mendicants I say that they still have work to do with diligence
Mendicants these seven people are found in the world
What seven
One freed both ways one freed by wisdom a personal witness one attained to view one freed by faith a follower of the teachings and a follower by faith
And what person is freed both ways
Its a person who has direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless transcending form And having seen with wisdom their defilements have come to an end
This person is called freed both ways
And I say that this mendicant has no work to do with diligence
Why is that
Theyve done their work with diligence
Theyre incapable of being negligent
And what person is freed by wisdom
Its a person who does not have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless transcending form Nevertheless having seen with wisdom their defilements have come to an end
This person is called freed by wisdom
I say that this mendicant has no work to do with diligence
Why is that

And what person is a personal witness
Its a person who has direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless transcending form And having seen with wisdom some of their defilements have come to an end
This person is called a personal witness
I say that this mendicant still has work to do with diligence
Why is that Thinking
Hopefully this venerable will frequent appropriate lodgings associate with good friends and control their faculties
Then they might realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life and live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Seeing this fruit of diligence for this mendicant I say that they still have work to do with diligence
And what person is attained to view
Its a person who doesnt have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless transcending form Nevertheless having seen with wisdom some of their defilements have come to an end And they have clearly seen and clearly contemplated with wisdom the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One
This person is called attained to view
I say that this mendicant also still has work to do with diligence
Why is that Thinking
Hopefully this venerable will frequent appropriate lodgings associate with good friends and control their faculties
Then they might realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life and live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Seeing this fruit of diligence for this mendicant I say that they still have work to do with diligence
And what person is freed by faith
Its a person who doesnt have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless transcending form Nevertheless having seen with wisdom some of their defilements have come to an end And their faith is settled rooted and planted in the Realized One
This person is called freed by faith

Its a person who doesnt have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless transcending form Nevertheless having seen with wisdom some of their defilements have come to an end And they accept the teachings proclaimed by the Realized One after considering them with a degree of wisdom And they have the following qualities
the faculties of faith energy mindfulness immersion and wisdom

Mendicants I dont say that enlightenment is achieved right away
Rather enlightenment is achieved by gradual training progress and practice
And how is enlightenment achieved by gradual training progress and practice
Its when someone in whom faith has arisen approaches a teacher They pay homage lend an ear hear the teachings remember the teachings reflect on their meaning and accept them after consideration Then enthusiasm springs up they make an effort weigh up and persevere Persevering they directly realize the ultimate truth and see it with penetrating wisdom
Mendicants there has not been that faith
that approaching
that paying homage
that listening
that hearing the teachings
that remembering the teachings
that reflecting on their meaning
that acceptance after consideration
that enthusiasm
that making an effort
that weighing up
or that striving
Youve lost the way mendicants Youre practicing the wrong way
Just how far have these foolish people strayed from this teaching and training
There is an exposition in four parts which a sensible person would quickly understand when it is recited
I shall recite it for you mendicants Try to understand it
Sir who are we to be counted alongside those who understand the teaching
Even with a teacher who values material things is an heir in material things who lives caught up in material things you wouldnt get into such haggling
If we get this well do that If we dont get this we wont do it What then of the Realized One who lives utterly detached from material things
For a faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teachers instructions this is in line with the teaching
The Buddha is my Teacher I am his disciple
The Buddha knows I do not know
For a faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teachers instructions the Teachers instructions are nourishing and nutritious
For a faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teachers instructions this is in line with the teaching
Gladly let only skin sinews and bones remain Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body I will not relax my energy until I have achieved what is possible by human strength energy and vigor
A faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teachers instructions can expect one of two results
enlightenment in the present life or if theres something left over nonreturn
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
Many Elements
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Whatever dangers there are all come from the foolish not from the astute
Whatever perils there are all come from the foolish not from the astute
Whatever hazards there are all come from the foolish not from the astute
Its like a fire that spreads from a hut made of reeds or grass and burns down even a bungalow plastered inside and out draftfree with latches fastened and windows shuttered
In the same way whatever dangers there are all come from the foolish not from the astute
Whatever perils there are all come from the foolish not from the astute
Whatever hazards there are all come from the foolish not from the astute
So the fool is dangerous but the astute person is safe
The fool is perilous but the astute person is not
The fool is hazardous but the astute person is not
Theres no danger peril or hazard that comes from the astute
So you should train like this We shall be astute we shall be inquirers
When he said this Venerable nanda said to the Buddha
Sir how is a mendicant qualified to be called astute an inquirer
nanda its when a mendicant is skilled in the elements in the sense fields in dependent origination and in the possible and the impossible
Thats how a mendicant is qualified to be called astute an inquirer
But sir how is a mendicant qualified to be called skilled in the elements
There are nanda these eighteen elements
the elements of the eye sights and eye consciousness
the ear sounds and ear consciousness
the nose smells and nose consciousness
the tongue tastes and tongue consciousness
the body touches and body consciousness
the mind thoughts and mind consciousness
When a mendicant knows and sees these eighteen elements
theyre qualified to be called skilled in the elements
But sir could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called skilled in the elements
There could nanda
There are these six elements
the elements of earth water fire air space and consciousness
When a mendicant knows and sees these six elements
theyre qualified to be called skilled in the elements
But sir could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called skilled in the elements
There could nanda
There are these six elements
the elements of pleasure pain happiness sadness equanimity and ignorance
When a mendicant knows and sees these six elements
theyre qualified to be called skilled in the elements
But sir could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called skilled in the elements
There could nanda
There are these six elements
the elements of sensuality and renunciation malice and good will and cruelty and harmlessness
When a mendicant knows and sees these six elements
theyre qualified to be called skilled in the elements
But sir could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called skilled in the elements
There could nanda
There are these three elements
the elements of the sensual realm the realm of luminous form and the formless realm
When a mendicant knows and sees these three elements
theyre qualified to be called skilled in the elements
But sir could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called skilled in the elements
There could nanda
There are these two elements
the conditioned element and the unconditioned element
When a mendicant knows and sees these two elements
theyre qualified to be called skilled in the elements
But sir how is a mendicant qualified to be called skilled in the sense fields
There are these six interior and exterior sense fields
the eye and sights the ear and sounds the nose and smells the tongue and tastes the body and touches and the mind and thoughts
When a mendicant knows and sees these six interior and exterior sense fields
theyre qualified to be called skilled in the sense fields
But sir how is a mendicant qualified to be called skilled in dependent origination
Its when a mendicant understands
When this exists that is due to the arising of this that arises
When this doesnt exist that is not due to the cessation of this that ceases That is
ignorance is a condition for choices
Choices are conditions for consciousness
Consciousness is a condition for name and form
Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields
The six sense fields are conditions for contact
Contact is a condition for feeling
Feeling is a condition for craving
Craving is a condition for grasping
Grasping is a condition for continued existence
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress to come to be
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over choices cease
When choices cease consciousness ceases
When consciousness ceases name and form cease
When name and form cease the six sense fields cease
When the six sense fields cease contact ceases
When contact ceases feeling ceases
When feeling ceases craving ceases
When craving ceases grasping ceases
When grasping ceases continued existence ceases
When continued existence ceases rebirth ceases
When rebirth ceases old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress cease
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases
Thats how a mendicant is qualified to be called skilled in dependent origination
But sir how is a mendicant qualified to be called skilled in the possible and impossible
Its when a mendicant understands Its impossible for a person accomplished in view to take any condition as permanent That is not possible
But its possible for an ordinary person to take some condition as permanent That is possible
They understand Its impossible for a person accomplished in view to take any condition as pleasant
But its possible for an ordinary person to take some condition as pleasant
They understand Its impossible for a person accomplished in view to take anything as self
But its possible for an ordinary person to take something as self
They understand Its impossible for a person accomplished in view to murder their mother
But its possible for an ordinary person to murder their mother
They understand Its impossible for a person accomplished in view to murder their father  or murder a perfected one
But its possible for an ordinary person to murder their father  or a perfected one
They understand Its impossible for a person accomplished in view to injure a Realized One with malicious intent
But its possible for an ordinary person to injure a Realized One with malicious intent
They understand Its impossible for a person accomplished in view to cause a schism in the Saṅgha
But its possible for an ordinary person to cause a schism in the Saṅgha
They understand Its impossible for a person accomplished in view to acknowledge another teacher
But its possible for an ordinary person to acknowledge another teacher
They understand Its impossible for two perfected ones fully awakened Buddhas to arise in the same solar system at the same time
But it is possible for just one perfected one a fully awakened Buddha to arise in one solar system
They understand Its impossible for two wheelturning monarchs to arise in the same solar system at the same time
But it is possible for just one wheelturning monarch to arise in one solar system
They understand Its impossible for a woman to be a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha
But it is possible for a man to be a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha
They understand Its impossible for a woman to be a wheelturning monarch
But it is possible for a man to be a wheelturning monarch
They understand Its impossible for a woman to perform the role of Sakka Māra or Brahmā
But it is possible for a man to perform the role of Sakka Māra or Brahmā
They understand Its impossible for a likable desirable agreeable result to come from bad conduct of body speech and mind
But it is possible for an unlikable undesirable disagreeable result to come from bad conduct of body speech and mind
They understand Its impossible for an unlikable undesirable disagreeable result to come from good conduct of body speech and mind
But it is possible for a likable desirable agreeable result to come from good conduct of body speech and mind
They understand Its impossible that someone who has engaged in bad conduct of body speech and mind could for that reason alone when their body breaks up after death be reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
But it is possible that someone who has engaged in bad conduct of body speech and mind could for that reason alone when their body breaks up after death be reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
They understand Its impossible that someone who has engaged in good conduct of body speech and mind could for that reason alone when their body breaks up after death be reborn in a place of loss the underworld a lower realm hell
But it is possible that someone who has engaged in good conduct of body speech and mind could for that reason alone when their body breaks up after death be reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
Thats how a mendicant is qualified to be called skilled in the possible and impossible
When he said this Venerable nanda said to the Buddha
Its incredible sir its amazing
What is the name of this exposition of the teaching
In that case nanda you may remember this exposition of the teaching as The Many Elements or else The Four Cycles or else The Mirror of the Teaching or else The Drum of the Deathless or else The Supreme Victory in Battle
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
With the People of Nagaravinda
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Nagaravinda
The brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda heard
It seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familywhile wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Nagaravinda together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Its good to see such perfected ones
Then the brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda went up to the Buddha
Before sitting down to one side some bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silent
The Buddha said to them
Householders if wanderers who follow another path were to ask you
What kind of ascetic or brahmin doesnt deserve honor respect reverence and veneration
You should answer them
There are ascetics and brahmins who are not free of greed hate and delusion for sights known by the eye who are not peaceful inside and who conduct themselves badly among the good by way of body speech and mind They dont deserve honor respect reverence and veneration
Why is that
Because we ourselves are not free of these things so we do not see that they have any higher good conduct than us
Thats why they dont deserve honor respect reverence and veneration
There are ascetics and brahmins who are not free of greed hate and delusion for sounds known by the ear 
smells known by the nose 
tastes known by the tongue
touches known by the body 
thoughts known by the mind who are not peaceful inside and who conduct themselves badly among the good by way of body speech and mind They dont deserve honor respect reverence and veneration
Why is that
Because we ourselves are not free of these things so we do not see that they have any higher good conduct than us
Thats why they dont deserve honor respect reverence and veneration
When questioned by wanderers who follow other paths thats how you should answer them
If wanderers who follow other paths were to ask you
What kind of ascetic or brahmin deserves honor respect reverence and veneration
You should answer them
There are ascetics and brahmins who are free of greed hate and delusion for sights known by the eye who are peaceful inside and who conduct themselves well by way of body speech and mind They deserve honor respect reverence and veneration
Why is that
Because we ourselves are not free of these things but we see that they have a higher good conduct than us
Thats why they deserve honor respect reverence and veneration
There are ascetics and brahmins who are free of greed hate and delusion for sounds known by the ear 
smells known by the nose 
tastes known by the tongue 
touches known by the body

Why is that
Because we ourselves are not free of these things but we see that they have a higher good conduct than us
Thats why they deserve honor respect reverence and veneration
When questioned by wanderers who follow other paths thats how you should answer them
If wanderers who follow other paths were to ask you
But what reasons and evidence do you have regarding those venerables that justifies saying
Clearly those venerables are free of greed hate and delusion or practicing to be free of them
You should answer them
Its because those venerables frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest
In such places there are no sights known by the eye to see and enjoy there are no sounds known by the ear to hear and enjoy no odors known by the nose to smell and enjoy no flavors known by the tongue to taste and enjoy and no touches known by the body to feel and enjoy
These are the reasons and evidence that you have regarding those venerables that justifies saying
Clearly those venerables are free of greed hate and delusion or practicing to be free of them
When questioned by wanderers who follow other paths thats how you should answer them
When he had spoken the brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways
We go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life
Middle Discourses
With Bhūmija
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Then Venerable Bhūmija robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of Prince Jayasena where he sat on the seat spread out
Then Jayasena approached and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to Bhūmija
Master Bhūmija there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view
If you make a wish and lead the spiritual life you cant win the fruit
If you dont make a wish and lead the spiritual life you cant win the fruit
If you both make a wish and dont make a wish and lead the spiritual life you cant win the fruit
If you neither make a wish nor dont make a wish and lead the spiritual life you cant win the fruit
What does Master Bhūmijas Teacher say about this How does he explain it
Prince I havent heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha
But its possible that he might explain it like this
If you lead the spiritual life irrationally you cant win the fruit regardless of whether you make a wish
you dont make a wish
you both do and do not make a wish
or you neither do nor dont make a wish
But if you lead the spiritual life rationally you can win the fruit regardless of whether you make a wish
you dont make a wish
you both do and do not make a wish
or you neither do nor dont make a wish
I havent heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha
But its possible that he might explain it like that
If thats what your teacher says Master Bhūmija he clearly stands head and shoulders above all the various other ascetics and brahmins
Then Prince Jayasena served Venerable Bhūmija from his own dish
Then after the meal on his return from almsround Bhūmija went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him all that had happened adding
Answering this way I trust that I repeated what the Buddha has said and didnt misrepresent him with an untruth I trust my explanation was in line with the teaching and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism
Indeed Bhūmija in answering this way you repeated what Ive said and didnt misrepresent me with an untruth Your explanation was in line with the teaching and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view wrong thought wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong immersion If they lead the spiritual life they cant win the fruit regardless of whether they make a wish
they dont make a wish
they both do and do not make a wish
or they neither do nor dont make a wish
Why is that
Because thats an irrational way to win the fruit
Suppose there was a person in need of oil While wandering in search of oil they tried heaping sand in a bucket sprinkling it thoroughly with water and pressing it out
But by doing this they couldnt extract any oil regardless of whether they made a wish
didnt make a wish
both did and did not make a wish
or neither did nor did not make a wish
Why is that
Because thats an irrational way to extract oil
And so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view wrong thought wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong immersion If they lead the spiritual life they cant win the fruit regardless of whether or not they make a wish
Why is that
Because thats an irrational way to win the fruit
Suppose there was a person in need of milk While wandering in search of milk they tried pulling the horn of a newlycalved cow
But by doing this they couldnt get any milk regardless of whether they made a wish

Why is that
Because thats an irrational way to get milk
And so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view 
Because thats an irrational way to win the fruit
Suppose there was a person in need of butter While wandering in search of butter they tried pouring water into a pot and churning it with a stick
But by doing this they couldnt produce any butter regardless of whether they made a wish
didnt make a wish

or neither did nor did not make a wish
Why is that
Because thats an irrational way to produce butter
And so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view 
Because thats an irrational way to win the fruit
Suppose there was a person in need of fire While wandering in search of fire they tried drilling a green sappy log with a drillstick
But by doing this they couldnt start a fire regardless of whether they made a wish
didnt make a wish
both did and did not make a wish
or neither did nor did not make a wish
Why is that
Because thats an irrational way to start a fire
And so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view 
Because thats an irrational way to win the fruit
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion If they lead the spiritual life they can win the fruit regardless of whether they make a wish
they dont make a wish
they both do and do not make a wish

Suppose there was a person in need of oil While wandering in search of oil they tried heaping sesame flour in a bucket sprinkling it thoroughly with water and pressing it out
By doing this they could extract oil regardless of whether they made a wish

Because thats a rational way to win the fruit

Bhūmija it wouldnt be surprising if had these four similes occurred to you Prince Jayasena would have gained confidence in you and shown his confidence
But sir how could these four similes have occurred to me as they did to the Buddha since they were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable Bhūmija was happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
With Sandaka
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi in Ghositas Monastery
Now at that time the wanderer Sandaka was residing at the cave of the wavy leaf fig tree together with a large assembly of around five hundred wanderers
Then in the late afternoon Venerable nanda came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants
Come reverends lets go to the Devakata Pool to see the cave
Yes reverend they replied
Then nanda together with several mendicants went to the Devakata Pool
Now at that time Sandaka and the large assembly of wanderers were sitting together making an uproar a dreadful racket They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk such as
talk about kings bandits and ministers talk about armies threats and wars talk about food drink clothes and beds talk about garlands and fragrances talk about family vehicles villages towns cities and countries talk about women and heroes street talk and well talk talk about the departed motley talk tales of land and sea and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence
Sandaka saw nanda coming off in the distance
and hushed his own assembly
Be quiet good sirs dont make a sound
The ascetic nanda a disciple of the ascetic Gotama is coming
He is included among the disciples of the ascetic Gotama who is residing near Kosambī
Such venerables like the quiet are educated to be quiet and praise the quiet
Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet hell see fit to approach
Then those wanderers fell silent
Then Venerable nanda went up to the wanderer Sandaka
who said to him
Come Master nanda Welcome Master nanda
Its been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here
Please sir sit down this seat is ready
nanda sat down on the seat spread out
while Sandaka took a low seat and sat to one side
nanda said to Sandaka
Sandaka what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was unfinished
Master nanda leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now
It wont be hard for you to hear about that later
Itd be great if Master nanda himself would give a Dhamma talk explaining his own tradition
Well then Sandaka listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir replied Sandaka
Venerable nanda said this
Sandaka these things have been explained by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha four ways that negate the spiritual life and four kinds of unreliable spiritual life A sensible person would to the best of their ability not practice such spiritual paths and if they did practice them they wouldnt succeed in the procedure of the skillful teaching
But Master nanda what are the four ways that negate the spiritual life and the four kinds of unreliable spiritual life
Sandaka take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view
Theres no meaning in giving sacrifice or offerings Theres no fruit or result of good and bad deeds Theres no afterlife Theres no obligation to mother and father No beings are reborn spontaneously And theres no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight
This person is made up of the four primary elements When they die the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of earth The water in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of water The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of fire The air in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of air The faculties are transferred to space
Four men with a bier carry away the corpse
Their footprints show the way to the cemetery
The bones become bleached
Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashes
Giving is a doctrine for morons
When anyone affirms a positive teaching its just hollow false nonsense
Both the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up and they dont exist after death
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way
This teacher has such a doctrine and view
If what that teacher says is true both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished it
have attained exactly the same level Yet Im not one who says that both of us are annihilated and destroyed when our body breaks up and we dont exist after death
But its superfluous for this teacher to go naked shaven persisting in squatting tearing out their hair and beard For Im living at home with my children using sandalwood imported from Kāsi wearing garlands perfumes and makeup and accepting gold and money Yet Ill have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacher
What do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacher
This negates the spiritual life
Realizing this they leave disappointed
This is the first way that negates the spiritual life
Furthermore take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view
Nothing bad is done by the doer when they punish mutilate torture aggrieve oppress intimidate or when they encourage others to do the same Nothing bad is done when they kill steal break into houses plunder wealth steal from isolated buildings commit highway robbery commit adultery and lie
If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razoredged chakram no evil comes of that and no outcome of evil
If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing mutilating and torturing and encouraging others to do the same no evil comes of that and no outcome of evil
If you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same no merit comes of that and no outcome of merit
In giving selfcontrol restraint and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of merit
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way
This teacher has such a doctrine and view
If what that teacher says is true both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished it
have attained exactly the same level Yet Im not one who says that when both of us act nothing wrong is done
But its superfluous for this teacher to go naked shaven persisting in squatting tearing out their hair and beard For Im living at home with my children using sandalwood imported from Kāsi wearing garlands perfumes and makeup and accepting gold and money Yet Ill have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacher
What do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacher
This negates the spiritual life
Realizing this they leave disappointed
This is the second way that negates the spiritual life
Furthermore take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view
There is no cause or condition for the corruption of sentient beings
Sentient beings are corrupted without cause or reason
Theres no cause or condition for the purification of sentient beings
Sentient beings are purified without cause or reason
There is no power no energy no human strength or vigor
All sentient beings all living creatures all beings all souls lack control power and energy Molded by destiny circumstance and nature they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way
This teacher has such a doctrine and view
If what that teacher says is true both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished it
have attained exactly the same level Yet Im not one who says that both of us are purified without cause or reason

What do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacher
This negates the spiritual life
Realizing this they leave disappointed
This is the third way that negates the spiritual life
Furthermore take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view
There are these seven substances that are not made not derived not created without a creator barren steady as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar
They dont move or deteriorate or obstruct each other Theyre unable to cause pleasure pain or neutral feeling to each other
What seven
The substances of earth water fire air pleasure pain and the soul is the seventh
These seven substances are not made not derived not created without a creator barren steady as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillar
They dont move or deteriorate or obstruct each other
Theyre unable to cause pleasure pain or neutral feeling to each other
And here there is noone who kills or who makes others kill noone who learns or who educates others noone who understands or who helps others understand
If you chop off someones head with a sharp sword you dont take anyones life
The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substances
There are  million main wombs and  and  There are  deeds and five and three There are deeds and halfdeeds There are  paths  subeons six classes of rebirth and eight stages in a persons life There are  jīvaka ascetics  wanderers and  naked ascetics There are  faculties  hells and  realms of dust There are seven percipient embryos seven nonpercipient embryos and seven embryos without attachments There are seven gods seven humans and seven goblins There are seven lakes seven winds seven cliffs and  cliffs There are seven dreams and  dreams There are  million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering
And here there is no such thing as this By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by littlefor that cannot be
Pleasure and pain are allotted Transmigration lasts only for a limited period so theres no increase or decrease no getting better or worse
Its like how when you toss a ball of string it rolls away unraveling
In the same way after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way
This teacher has such a doctrine and view
If what that teacher says is true both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished it
have attained exactly the same level Yet Im not one who says that after transmigrating both of us will make an end of suffering
But its superfluous for this teacher to go naked shaven persisting in squatting tearing out their hair and beard For Im living at home with my children using sandalwood imported from Kāsi wearing garlands perfumes and makeup and accepting gold and money Yet Ill have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacher
What do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacher
This negates the spiritual life
Realizing this they leave disappointed
This is the fourth way that negates the spiritual life
These are the four ways that negate the spiritual life that have been explained by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha A sensible person would to the best of their ability not practice such spiritual paths and if they did practice them they wouldnt succeed in the procedure of the skillful teaching
Its incredible Master nanda its amazing
how these four ways that negate the spiritual life have been explained by the Buddha
But Master nanda what are the four kinds of unreliable spiritual life
Sandaka take a certain teacher who claims to be allknowing and allseeing to know and see everything without exception thus
Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me while walking standing sleeping and waking
He enters an empty house he gets no almsfood a dog bites him he encounters a wild elephant a wild horse and a wild cow he asks the name and clan of a woman or man he asks the name and path to a village or town
When asked Why is this he answers I had to enter an empty house thats why I entered it I had to get no almsfood thats why I got none I had to get bitten by a dog thats why I was bitten I had to encounter a wild elephant a wild horse and a wild cow thats why I encountered them I had to ask the name and clan of a woman or man thats why I asked I had to ask the name and path to a village or town thats why I asked
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way
This teacher makes such a claim but he answers in such a way
This spiritual life is unreliable
Realizing this they leave disappointed
This is the first kind of unreliable spiritual life
Furthermore take another teacher who is an oral transmitter who takes oral transmission to be the truth
He teaches by oral transmission by the lineage of testament by canonical authority
But when a teacher takes oral transmission to be the truth some of that is well learned some poorly learned some true and some otherwise
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way
This teacher takes oral transmission to be the truth He teaches by oral transmission by the lineage of testament by canonical authority
But when a teacher takes oral transmission to be the truth some of that is well learned some poorly learned some true and some otherwise
This spiritual life is unreliable
Realizing this they leave disappointed
This is the second kind of unreliable spiritual life
Furthermore take another teacher who relies on logic and inquiry
He teaches what he has worked out by logic following a line of inquiry expressing his own perspective
But when a teacher relies on logic and inquiry some of that is well reasoned some poorly reasoned some true and some otherwise
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way

But when a teacher relies on logic and inquiry some of that is well reasoned some poorly reasoned some true and some otherwise
This spiritual life is unreliable
Realizing this they leave disappointed
This is the third kind of unreliable spiritual life
Furthermore take another teacher who is dull and stupid
Because of that whenever hes asked a question he resorts to evasiveness and equivocation
I dont say its like this I dont say its like that I dont say its otherwise I dont say its not so And I dont deny its not so
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way
This teacher is dull and stupid

Realizing this they leave disappointed
This is the fourth kind of unreliable spiritual life
These are the four kinds of unreliable spiritual life that have been explained by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha A sensible person would to the best of their ability not practice such spiritual paths and if they did practice them they wouldnt complete the procedure of the skillful teaching
Its incredible Master nanda its amazing
how these four kinds of unreliable spiritual life have been explained by the Buddha
But Master nanda what would a teacher say and explain so that a sensible person would to the best of their ability practice such a spiritual path and once practicing it they would complete the procedure of the skillful teaching
Sandaka its when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed 
He gives up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom
Then quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities he enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
A sensible person would to the best of their ability lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction and once practicing it they would complete the procedure of the skillful teaching
Furthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant  enters and remains in the second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption
A sensible person would to the best of their ability lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction and once practicing it they would complete the procedure of the skillful teaching
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past lives
They recollect many kinds of past lives That is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding  They recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and details
A sensible person would to the best of their ability lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction and once practicing it they would complete the procedure of the skillful teaching
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place  They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
A sensible person would to the best of their ability lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction and once practicing it they would complete the procedure of the skillful teaching
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
They truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
They truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements
Knowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
A sensible person would to the best of their ability lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction and once practicing it they would complete the procedure of the skillful teaching
But Master nanda when a mendicant is perfectedwith defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenmentcould they still enjoy sensual pleasures
Sandaka a mendicant who is perfectedwith defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenmentcant transgress in five respects
A mendicant with defilements ended cant deliberately take the life of a living creature take something with the intention to steal have sex tell a deliberate lie or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they did as a lay person
A mendicant who is perfected cant transgress in these five respects
But Master nanda when a mendicant is perfected would the knowledge and vision that their defilements are ended be constantly and continually present to them while walking standing sleeping and waking
Well then Sandaka I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Suppose there was a person whose hands and feet had been amputated
Would they be aware that their hands and feet had been amputated constantly and continually while walking standing sleeping and waking
Or would they be aware of it only when they checked it
They wouldnt be aware of it constantly
only when they checked it
In the same way when a mendicant is perfected the knowledge and vision that their defilements are ended is not constantly and continually present to them while walking standing sleeping and waking
Rather they are aware of it only when they checked it
But Reverend nanda how many emancipators are there in this teaching and training
There are not just one hundred emancipators Sandaka or two or three or four or five hundred but many more than that in this teaching and training
Its incredible Master nanda its amazing
Namely that theres no glorifying ones own teaching and putting down the teaching of others The Dhamma is taught in its own field and so many emancipators are recognized
But these jīvaka ascetics those sons of dead sons glorify themselves and put others down And they only recognize three emancipators
Nanda Vaccha Kisa Saṅkicca and Makkhali Gosāla
Then the wanderer Sandaka addressed his own assembly
Go good sirs The spiritual life is lived under the ascetic Gotama
Its not easy for me to give up possessions honor or popularity now
And thats how the wanderer Sandaka sent his own assembly to lead the spiritual life under the Buddha
Middle Discourses
The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants do you remember the five lower fetters that I taught
When he said this Venerable Māluṅkyaputta said to him
Sir I remember them
But how do you remember them
I remember the lower fetters taught by the Buddha as follows identity view
misapprehension of precepts and observances
sensual desire
and ill will
Thats how I remember the five lower fetters taught by the Buddha
Who on earth do you remember being taught the five lower fetters in that way
Wouldnt the wanderers who follow other paths fault you using the simile of the infant
For a little baby doesnt even have a concept of identity so how could identity view possibly arise in them
Yet the underlying tendency to identity view still lies within them
A little baby doesnt even have a concept of teachings so how could doubt about the teachings possibly arise in them
Yet the underlying tendency to doubt still lies within them
A little baby doesnt even have a concept of precepts so how could misapprehension of precepts and observances possibly arise in them
Yet the underlying tendency to misapprehension of precepts and observances still lies within them
A little baby doesnt even have a concept of sensual pleasures so how could desire for sensual pleasures possibly arise in them
Yet the underlying tendency to sensual desire still lies within them
A little baby doesnt even have a concept of sentient beings so how could ill will for sentient beings possibly arise in them
Yet the underlying tendency to ill will still lies within them
Wouldnt the wanderers who follow other paths fault you using the simile of the infant
When he said this Venerable nanda said to the Buddha
Now is the time Blessed One Now is the time Holy One
May the Buddha teach the five lower fetters
The mendicants will listen and remember it
Well then nanda listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir nanda replied
The Buddha said this
nanda take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve not seen good persons and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons
Their heart is overcome and mired in identity view
and they dont truly understand the escape from identity view that has arisen
That identity view is reinforced in them not eliminated it is a lower fetter
Their heart is overcome and mired in doubt
and they dont truly understand the escape from doubt that has arisen
That doubt is reinforced in them not eliminated it is a lower fetter
Their heart is overcome and mired in misapprehension of precepts and observances
and they dont truly understand the escape from misapprehension of precepts and observances that has arisen
That misapprehension of precepts and observances is reinforced in them not eliminated it is a lower fetter
Their heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire
and they dont truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen
That sensual desire is reinforced in them not eliminated it is a lower fetter
Their heart is overcome and mired in ill will
and they dont truly understand the escape from ill will that has arisen
That ill will is reinforced in them not eliminated it is a lower fetter
But an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve seen good persons and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons Their heart is not overcome and mired in identity view
and they truly understand the escape from identity view that has arisen
That identity view along with any underlying tendency to it is given up in them
Their heart is not overcome and mired in doubt
and they truly understand the escape from doubt that has arisen
That doubt along with any underlying tendency to it is given up in them
Their heart is not overcome and mired in misapprehension of precepts and observances
and they truly understand the escape from misapprehension of precepts and observances that has arisen
That misapprehension of precepts and observances along with any underlying tendency to it is given up in them
Their heart is not overcome and mired in sensual desire
and they truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen
That sensual desire along with any underlying tendency to it is given up in them
Their heart is not overcome and mired in ill will
and they truly understand the escape from ill will that has arisen
That ill will along with any underlying tendency to it is given up in them
There is a path and a practice for giving up the five lower fetters Its not possible to know or see or give up the five lower fetters without relying on that path and that practice
Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood Its not possible to cut out the heartwood without having cut through the bark and the softwood
In the same way there is a path and a practice for giving up the five lower fetters Its not possible to know or see or give up the five lower fetters without relying on that path and that practice
There is a path and a practice for giving up the five lower fetters It is possible to know and see and give up the five lower fetters by relying on that path and that practice
Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood It is possible to cut out the heartwood after having cut through the bark and the softwood
In the same way there is a path and a practice for giving up the five lower fetters It is possible to know and see and give up the five lower fetters by relying on that path and that practice
Suppose the river Ganges was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it
Then along comes a feeble person who thinks
By swimming with my arms Ill safely cross over to the far shore of the Ganges
But theyre not able to do so
In the same way when the Dhamma is being taught for the cessation of identity view someone whose mind isnt eager confident settled and decided
should be regarded as being like that feeble person
Suppose the river Ganges was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it
Then along comes a strong person who thinks
By swimming with my arms Ill safely cross over to the far shore of the Ganges
And they are able to do so
In the same way when the Dhamma is being taught for the cessation of identity view someone whose mind is eager confident settled and decided
should be regarded as being like that strong person
And what nanda is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters
Its when a mendicantdue to the seclusion from attachments the giving up of unskillful qualities and the complete settling of physical discomfortquite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
They contemplate the phenomena thereincluded in form feeling perception choices and consciousnessas impermanent as suffering as diseased as an abscess as a dart as misery as an affliction as alien as falling apart as empty as notself
They turn their mind away from those things
and apply it to the deathless element
This is peaceful this is sublimethat is the stilling of all activities the letting go of all attachments the ending of craving cessation extinguishment
Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements
If they dont attain the ending of defilements with the ending of the five lower fetters theyre reborn spontaneously because of their passion and love for that meditation They are extinguished there and are not liable to return from that world
This is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters
Furthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption
They contemplate the phenomena there as impermanent 
If they dont attain the ending of defilements theyre reborn spontaneously  and are not liable to return from that world
This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters
Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space
They contemplate the phenomena there as impermanent 
If they dont attain the ending of defilements theyre reborn spontaneously  and are not liable to return from that world
This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters
Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness
They contemplate the phenomena there as impermanent 
If they dont attain the ending of defilements theyre reborn spontaneously  and are not liable to return from that world
This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters
Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness
They contemplate the phenomena there as impermanent 
If they dont attain the ending of defilements theyre reborn spontaneously  and are not liable to return from that world
This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters
Sir if this is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters how come some mendicants here are released in heart while others are released by wisdom
In that case I say it is the diversity of their faculties
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
With Jīvaka
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Mango Grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca
Then Jīvaka went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Sir I have heard this
They slaughter living creatures specially for the ascetic Gotama The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared on purpose for him this is a deed he caused
I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said and do not misrepresent him with an untruth Is their explanation in line with the teaching Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
Jīvaka those who say this do not repeat what I have said They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue
In three cases I say that meat may not be eaten
its seen heard or suspected
These are three cases in which meat may not be eaten
In three cases I say that meat may be eaten
its not seen heard or suspected
These are three cases in which meat may be eaten
Take the case of a mendicant living supported by a town or village
They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
A householder or their child approaches and invites them for the next days meal
The mendicant accepts if they want
When the night has passed they robe up in the morning take their bowl and robe and approach that householders home where they sit on the seat spread out
That householder or their child serves them with delicious almsfood
It never occurs to them
Its so good that this householder serves me with delicious almsfood
I hope they serve me with such delicious almsfood in the future
They dont think that
They eat that almsfood untied uninfatuated unattached seeing the drawback and understanding the escape
What do you think Jīvaka
At that time is that mendicant intending to hurt themselves hurt others or hurt both
No sir
Arent they eating blameless food at that time
Yes sir
Sir I have heard that
Brahmā abides in love
Now Ive seen the Buddha with my own eyes
and it is the Buddha who truly abides in love
Any greed hate or delusion that might give rise to ill will has been given up by the Realized One cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated and is unable to arise in the future
If thats what you were referring to I acknowledge it
Thats exactly what I was referring to
Take the case Jīvaka of a mendicant living supported by a town or village
They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion 
They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing 
They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will

Any greed hate or delusion that might give rise to cruelty negativity or repulsion has been given up by the Realized One cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated and is unable to arise in the future
If thats what you were referring to I acknowledge it
Thats exactly what I was referring to
Jīvaka anyone who slaughters a living creature specially for the Realized One or the Realized Ones disciple makes much bad karma for five reasons
When they say
Go fetch that living creature this is the first reason
When that living creature experiences pain and sadness as its led along by a collar this is the second reason
When they say
Go slaughter that living creature this is the third reason
When that living creature experiences pain and sadness as its being slaughtered this is the fourth reason
When they provide the Realized One or the Realized Ones disciple with unallowable food this is the fifth reason
Anyone who slaughters a living creature specially for the Realized One or the Realized Ones disciple makes much bad karma for five reasons
When he had spoken Jīvaka said to the Buddha
Its incredible sir its amazing
The mendicants indeed eat allowable food
The mendicants indeed eat blameless food
Excellent sir Excellent 
From this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Middle Discourses
With Raṭṭhapāla
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kurus together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kurus named Thullakoṭṭhita
The brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita heard
It seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Thullakoṭṭhita together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Its good to see such perfected ones
Then the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita went up to the Buddha Before sitting down to one side some bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silent
When they were seated the Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired them with a Dhamma talk
Now at that time a gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhita was sitting in the assembly
He thought
As I understand the Buddhas teachings its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shell
Why dont I cut off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from lay life to homelessness
Then having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right before leaving
Soon after they left Raṭṭhapāla went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir as I understand the Buddhas teachings its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shell
I wish to cut off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Sir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
May the Buddha please give me the going forth
But Raṭṭhapāla do you have your parents permission
No sir
Raṭṭhapāla Buddhas dont give the going forth to the child of parents who havent given their permission
Ill make sure sir to get my parents permission
Then Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha Then he went to his parents and said
Mum and dad as I understand the Buddhas teachings its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shell
I wish to cut off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Please give me permission to go forth
When he said this Raṭṭhapālas parents said to him
But dear Raṭṭhapāla youre our only child Youre dear to us and we love you Youre dainty and raised in comfort
You know nothing of suffering
When you die we will lose you against our wishes
So how can we allow you to go forth while youre still alive
For a second time
and a third time Raṭṭhapāla asked his parents for permission but got the same reply
Then Raṭṭhapāla thought
My parents dont allow me to go forth He laid down there on the bare ground saying
Ill either die right here or go forth
And he refused to eat up to the seventh meal
Then Raṭṭhapālas parents said to him
Dear Raṭṭhapāla youre our only child Youre dear to us and we love you Youre dainty and raised in comfort
You know nothing of suffering
When you die we will lose you against our wishes
So how can we allow you to go forth from lay life to homelessness while youre still living
Get up Raṭṭhapāla Eat drink and amuse yourself
While enjoying sensual pleasures delight in making merit
We dont allow you to go forth
When you die we will lose you against our wishes
So how can we allow you to go forth while youre still alive
When they said this Raṭṭhapāla kept silent
For a second time
and a third time Raṭṭhapālas parents made the same request
And for a third time Raṭṭhapāla kept silent Raṭṭhapālas parents then went to see his friends They told them of the situation and asked for their help
Then Raṭṭhapālas friends went to him and said
Our friend Raṭṭhapāla you are your parents only child Youre dear to them and they love you Youre dainty and raised in comfort
You know nothing of suffering
When you die your parents will lose you against their wishes
So how can they allow you to go forth while youre still alive
Get up Raṭṭhapāla Eat drink and amuse yourself
While enjoying sensual pleasures delight in making merit
Your parents will not allow you to go forth
When you die your parents will lose you against their wishes
So how can they allow you to go forth while youre still alive
When they said this Raṭṭhapāla kept silent
For a second time
and a third time Raṭṭhapālas friends made the same request
And for a third time Raṭṭhapāla kept silent
Then Raṭṭhapālas friends went to his parents and said
Mum and dad Raṭṭhapāla is lying there on the bare ground saying
Ill either die right here or go forth
If you dont allow him to go forth hell die there
But if you do allow him to go forth youll see him again afterwards
And if he doesnt enjoy the renunciate life where else will he have to go
Hell come right back here
Please give Raṭṭhapāla permission to go forth
Then dears we give Raṭṭhapāla permission to go forth
But once gone forth he must visit his parents
Then Raṭṭhapālas friends went to him and said
Get up Raṭṭhapāla Your parents have given you permission to go forth from lay life to homelessness
But once gone forth you must visit your parents
Raṭṭhapāla got up and regained his strength
He went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir I have my parents permission to go forth from the lay life to homelessness
May the Buddha please give me the going forth
And Raṭṭhapāla received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Not long after Venerable Raṭṭhapālas ordination a fortnight later the Buddhahaving stayed in Thullakoṭṭhita as long as he wishedset out for Sāvatthī
Traveling stage by stage he arrived at Sāvatthī
where he stayed in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then Venerable Raṭṭhapāla living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
He understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
And Venerable Raṭṭhapāla became one of the perfected
Then he went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir Id like to visit my parents if the Buddha allows it
Then the Buddha focused on comprehending Raṭṭhapālas mind
When he knew that
it was impossible for Raṭṭhapāla to resign the training and return to a lesser life he said
Please Raṭṭhapāla go at your convenience
And then Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right Then he set his lodgings in order and taking his bowl and robe set out for Thullakoṭṭhita
Traveling stage by stage he arrived at Thullakoṭṭhika
where he stayed in King Koravyas deer range
Then Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Thullakoṭṭhita for alms
Wandering indiscriminately for almsfood he approached his own fathers house
Now at that time Raṭṭhapālas father was having his hair dressed in the hall of the middle gate
He saw Raṭṭhapāla coming off in the distance
Our dear and beloved only son was made to go forth by these shavelings these fake ascetics
And at his own fathers home Raṭṭhapāla received neither alms nor a polite refusal
but only abuse
Now at that time a family bondservant wanted to throw away the previous nights porridge
So Raṭṭhapāla said to her
If thats to be thrown away sister pour it here in my bowl
As she was pouring the porridge into his bowl she recognized the features of his hands feet and voice
She then went to his mother and said
Please madam you should know this
Master Raṭṭhapāla has arrived
Wow If you speak the truth Ill make you a free woman
Then Raṭṭhapālas mother went to his father and said
Please householder you should know this
It seems our son Raṭṭhapāla has arrived
Now at that time Raṭṭhapāla was eating last nights porridge by a wall
Then Raṭṭhapālas father went up to him and said
Dear Raṭṭhapāla Theres  and youll be eating last nights porridge
Why not go to your own home
Householder how could those of us who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness have a house
Were homeless householder
I came to your house but there I received neither alms nor a polite refusal
but only abuse
Come dear Raṭṭhapāla lets go to the house
Enough householder My meal is finished for today
Well then dear Raṭṭhapāla please accept tomorrows meal from me
Raṭṭhapāla consented in silence
Then knowing that Raṭṭhapāla had consented his father went back to his own house He made a heap of gold coins and bullion and hid it under mats Then he addressed Raṭṭhapālas former wives
Please daughtersinlaw adorn yourselves in the way that our son Raṭṭhapāla found you most adorable
And when the night had passed Raṭṭhapālas father had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home and announced the time to the Venerable Raṭṭhapāla saying
Sir its time The meal is ready
Then Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to his fathers home and sat down on the seat spread out
Raṭṭhapālas father revealing the heap of gold coins and bullion said to him
Dear Raṭṭhapāla this is your maternal fortune Theres another paternal fortune and an ancestral one
You can both enjoy your wealth and make merit
Come return to a lesser life enjoy wealth and make merit
If youd follow my advice householder youd have this heap of gold loaded on a cart and carried away to be dumped in the middle of the Ganges river
Why is that
Because this will bring you nothing but sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Then Raṭṭhapālas former wives each clasped his feet and said
What are they like master the nymphs for whom you lead the spiritual life
Sisters I dont lead the spiritual life for the sake of nymphs
Saying Our master Raṭṭhapāla addresses us as sisters they fainted right away
Then Raṭṭhapāla said to his father
If there is food to be given householder please give it
But dont harass me
Eat dear Raṭṭhapāla The meal is ready
Then Raṭṭhapālas father served and satisfied Venerable Raṭṭhapāla with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods
When he had eaten and washed his hand and bowl he recited this verse while standing right there
See this fancy puppet
a body built of sores
diseased obsessed over
in which nothing lasts at all
See this fancy figure
with its gems and earrings
it is bones wrapped in skin
made pretty by its clothes
Rouged feet
and powdered face
may be enough to beguile a fool
but not a seeker of the far shore
Hair in eight braids
and eyeliner
may be enough to beguile a fool
but not a seeker of the far shore
A rotting body all adorned
like a freshly painted makeup box
may be enough to beguile a fool
but not a seeker of the far shore
The hunter laid his snare
but the deer didnt spring the trap
Ive eaten the bait and now I go
leaving the trapper to lament
Then Raṭṭhapāla having recited this verse while standing went to King Koravyas deer range and sat at the root of a tree for the days meditation
Then King Koravya addressed his gamekeeper
My good gamekeeper tidy up the park of the deer range
We will go to see the scenery
Yes Your Majesty replied the gamekeeper While tidying the deer range he saw Raṭṭhapāla sitting in meditation
Seeing this he went to the king and said
The deer range is tidy sire
And the gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhita of whom you have often spoken highly is meditating there at the root of a tree
Well then my good gamekeeper thats enough of the park for today
Now I shall pay homage to the Master Raṭṭhapāla
And then King Koravya said Give away all the different foods that have been prepared there He had the finest carriages harnessed Then he mounted a fine carriage and along with other fine carriages set out in full royal pomp from Thullakoṭṭhita to see Raṭṭhapāla
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached Raṭṭhapāla on foot together with a group of eminent officials
They exchanged greetings and when the greetings and polite conversation were over he stood to one side and said to Raṭṭhapāla
Here Master Raṭṭhapāla sit on this elephant rug
Enough great king you sit on it
Im sitting on my own seat
So the king sat down on the seat spread out and said
Master Raṭṭhapāla there are these four kinds of decay Because of these some people shave off their hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
What four
Decay due to old age decay due to sickness decay of wealth and decay of relatives
And what is decay due to old age
Its when someone is old elderly and senior advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life
They reflect
Im now old elderly and senior Im advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life
Its not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth Ive already acquired
Why dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
So because of that decay due to old age they go forth
This is called decay due to old age
But Master Raṭṭhapāla is now a youth young blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of life
You have no decay due to old age
So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth
And what is decay due to sickness
Its when someone is sick suffering gravely ill
They reflect
Im now sick suffering gravely ill
Its not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth Ive already acquired
Why dont I go forth from the lay life to homelessness
So because of that decay due to sickness they go forth
This is called decay due to sickness
But Master Raṭṭhapāla is now rarely ill or unwell Your stomach digests well being neither too hot nor too cold
You have no decay due to sickness
So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth
And what is decay of wealth
Its when someone is rich affluent and wealthy
But gradually their wealth dwindles away
They reflect
I used to be rich affluent and wealthy
But gradually my wealth has dwindled away
Its not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth Ive already acquired
Why dont I go forth from the lay life to homelessness
So because of that decay of wealth they go forth
This is called decay of wealth
But Master Raṭṭhapāla is the son of the leading clan here in Thullakoṭṭhita
You have no decay of wealth
So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth
And what is decay of relatives
Its when someone has many friends and colleagues relatives and kin
But gradually their relatives dwindle away
They reflect
I used to have many friends and colleagues relatives and kin
But gradually theyve dwindled away
Its not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth Ive already acquired
Why dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
So because of that decay of relatives they go forth
This is called decay of relatives
But Master Raṭṭhapāla has many friends and colleagues relatives and kin right here in Thullakoṭṭhita
You have no decay of relatives
So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth
There are these four kinds of decay Because of these some people shave off their hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Master Raṭṭhapāla has none of these
So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth
Great king the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha has taught these four summaries of the teaching for recitation It was after knowing and seeing and hearing these that I went forth from the lay life to homelessness
What four
The world is unstable and swept away
This is the first summary
The world has no shelter and no savior
This is the second summary
The world has no owneryou must leave it all behind and pass on
This is the third summary
The world is wanting insatiable the slave of craving
This is the fourth summary
The Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha taught these four summaries of the teaching It was after knowing and seeing and hearing these that I went forth from the lay life to homelessness
The world is unstable and swept away
So Master Raṭṭhapāla said
How should I see the meaning of this statement
What do you think great king
When you were twenty or twentyfive years of age were you proficient at riding elephants horses and chariots and at archery and swordsmanship Were you strong in thigh and arm capable and battlehardened
I was Master Raṭṭhapāla
Sometimes it seems as if I had superpowers then I dont see anyone who could have equalled me in strength
What do you think great king
These days are you just as strong in thigh and arm capable and battlehardened
No Master Raṭṭhapāla
For now I am old elderly and senior Im advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life I am eighty years old
Sometimes I intend to step in one place but my foot goes somewhere else
This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said
The world is unstable and swept away
Its incredible Master Raṭṭhapāla its amazing
how well said this was by the Buddha
For the world is indeed unstable and swept away
In this royal court you can find divisions of elephants cavalry chariots and infantry They will serve to defend us from any threats Yet you said
The world has no shelter and no savior
How should I see the meaning of this statement
What do you think great king
Do you have any chronic ailments
Yes I do
Sometimes my friends and colleagues relatives and family members surround me thinking
Now the king will die Now the king will die
What do you think great king
Can you get your friends and colleagues relatives and family members to help
Please my dear friends and colleagues relatives and family members all of you here share my pain so that I may feel less pain
Or must you alone feel that pain
I cant get my friends to share my pain
Rather I alone must feel it
This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said
The world has no shelter and no savior
Its incredible Master Raṭṭhapāla its amazing
how well said this was by the Buddha
For the world indeed has no shelter and no savior
In this royal court you can find abundant gold coin and bullion stored in dungeons and towers Yet you said
The world has no owneryou must leave it all behind and pass on
How should I see the meaning of this statement
What do you think great king
These days you amuse yourself supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation But is there any way to ensure that in the next life
you will continue to amuse yourself in the same way supplied and provided with the same five kinds of sensual stimulation Or will others make use of this property while you pass on according to your deeds
Theres no way to ensure that I will continue to amuse myself in the same way
Rather others will take over this property while I pass on according to my deeds
This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said
The world has no owneryou must leave it all behind and pass on
Its incredible Master Raṭṭhapāla its amazing
how well said this was by the Buddha
For the world indeed has no owneryou must leave it all behind and pass on
You also said this The world is wanting insatiable the slave of craving
How should I see the meaning of this statement
What do you think great king
Do you dwell in the prosperous land of Kuru
Indeed I do
What do you think great king
Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man were to come from the east
Hed approach you and say
Please sir you should know this I come from the east
There I saw a large country that is successful and prosperous and full of people
They have many divisions of elephants cavalry chariots and infantry
And theres plenty of money and grain
plenty of gold coins and bullion both worked and unworked
and plenty of women for the taking
With your current forces you can conquer it
Conquer it great king What would you do
I would conquer it and dwell there
What do you think great king
Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man were to come from the west
or from over the ocean
Hed approach you and say the same thing
What would you do
I would conquer it and dwell there
This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said
The world is wanting insatiable the slave of craving
And it was after knowing and seeing and hearing this that I went forth from the lay life to homelessness
Its incredible Master Raṭṭhapāla its amazing
how well said this was by the Buddha
For the world is indeed wanting insatiable the slave of craving
This is what Venerable Raṭṭhapāla said
Then he went on to say
I see rich people in the world who
because of delusion give not the wealth theyve earned
Greedily they hoard their riches
yearning for ever more sensual pleasures
A king who conquered the earth by force
ruling the land from sea to sea
unsatisfied with the near shore of the ocean
would still yearn for the further shore
Not just the king but others too
reach death not rid of craving
They leave the body still wanting
for in this world sensual pleasures never satisfy
Relatives lament their hair disheveled
saying Ah Alas Theyre not immortal
They take out the body wrapped in a shroud
heap up a pyre and burn it there
Its poked with stakes while being burnt
in just a single cloth all wealth gone
Relatives friends and companions
cant help you when youre dying
Heirs take your riches
while beings fare on according to their deeds
Riches dont follow you when you die
nor do children wife wealth nor kingdom
Longevity isnt gained by riches
nor does wealth banish old age
for the wise say this life is short
its perishable and not eternal
The rich and the poor feel its touch
the fool and the wise feel it too
But the fool lies stricken by their own folly
while the wise dont tremble at the touch
Therefore wisdoms much better than wealth
since by wisdom you reach consummation in this life
But if because of delusion you dont reach consummation
youll do evil deeds in life after life
One who enters a womb and the world beyond
will transmigrate from one life to the next
While someone of little wisdom placing faith in them
also enters a womb and the world beyond
As a bandit caught in the door
is punished for his own bad deeds
so after departing in the world beyond
people are punished for their own bad deeds
Sensual pleasures are diverse sweet delightful
appearing in disguise they disturb the mind
Seeing danger in the many kinds of sensual stimulation
I went forth O King
As fruit falls from a tree so people fall
young and old when the body breaks up
Seeing this too I went forth O King
the ascetic life is guaranteed to be better
Middle Discourses
With Moggallāna the Guardian
So I have heard
At one time Venerable nanda was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground It was not long after the Buddha had become fully extinguished
Now at that time King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha being suspicious of King Pajjota was having Rājagaha fortified
Then Venerable nanda robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for alms
Then it occurred to him
Its too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha
Why dont I go to see the brahmin Moggallāna the Guardian at his place of work
So thats what he did
Moggallāna the Guardian saw nanda coming off in the distance
and said to him
Come Master nanda
Welcome Master nanda
Its been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here
Please sir sit down this seat is ready
nanda sat down on the seat spread out
while Moggallāna took a low seat and sat to one side
Then he said to nanda
Master nanda is there even a single mendicant who has all the same qualities in each and every way as possessed by Master Gotama the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
No brahmin there is not
For the Blessed One gave rise to the unarisen path gave birth to the unborn path explained the unexplained path He was the knower of the path the discoverer of the path the expert on the path
And now the disciples live following the path they acquire it later
But this conversation between nanda and Moggallāna the Guardian was left unfinished
For just then the brahmin Vassakāra a chief minister of Magadha while supervising the work at Rājagaha approached nanda at Moggallānas place of work and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to nanda
Master nanda what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was unfinished
So nanda told him of the conversation that they were having when Vassakāra arrived Vassakāra said
Master nanda is there even a single mendicant who was appointed by Master Gotama saying
This one will be your refuge when I have passed away to whom you now turn
No there is not
But is there even a single mendicant who has been elected to such a position by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicants
No there is not
But since you lack a refuge Master nanda whats the reason for your harmony
We dont lack a refuge brahmin
we have a refuge
The teaching is our refuge
But Master nanda when asked whether there was even a single mendicanteither appointed by the Buddha
or elected by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicants
who serves as your refuge after the Buddha passed away to whom you now turn
you replied No there is not
But you say that the reason for your harmony is that you have
the teaching as a refuge
How should I see the meaning of this statement
The Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha laid down training rules and recited the monastic code for the mendicants
On the day of the sabbath all of us who live in dependence on one village district gather together as one
We invite one who has freshly rehearsed the code to recite it
If anyone remembers an offense or transgression while theyre reciting we make them act in line with the teachings and in line with the instructions
Its not the venerables that make us act
its the teaching that makes us act
Master nanda is there even a single mendicant who you honor respect revere venerate and rely on
There is brahmin
But Master nanda when asked whether there was even a single mendicanteither appointed by the Buddha
or elected by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicants
who serves as your refuge after the Buddha passed away to whom you now turn
you replied No there is not
But when asked whether there is even a single mendicant who you honor respect revere venerate and rely on
you replied There is
How should I see the meaning of this statement
There are ten inspiring things explained by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
We honor anyone in whom these things are found
Its when a mendicant is ethical restrained in the monastic code conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault they keep the rules theyve undertaken
Theyre very learned remembering and keeping what theyve learned
These teachings are good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased describing a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure They are very learned in such teachings remembering them reinforcing them by recitation mentally scrutinizing them and comprehending them theoretically
Theyre content with robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick
They get the four absorptionsblissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mindwhen they want without trouble or difficulty
They wield the many kinds of psychic power multiplying themselves and becoming one again appearing and disappearing going unimpeded through a wall a rampart or a mountain as if through space diving in and out of the earth as if it were water walking on water as if it were earth flying crosslegged through the sky like a bird touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon so mighty and powerful They control the body as far as the Brahmā realm
With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman they hear both kinds of sounds human and divine whether near or far
They understand the minds of other beings and individuals having comprehended them with their own mind
They understand mind with greed as mind with greed
and mind without greed as mind without greed
They understand mind with hate 
mind without hate 
mind with delusion 
mind without delusion 
constricted mind 
scattered mind 
expansive mind 
unexpansive mind 
mind that is not supreme 
mind that is supreme 
mind immersed in samādhi 
mind not immersed in samādhi 
freed mind 
They understand unfreed mind as unfreed mind
They recollect many kinds of past lives That is
one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding
They remember There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and details
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
These are the ten inspiring things explained by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
We honor anyone in whom these things are found and rely on them
When he had spoken Vassakāra addressed General Upananda
What do you think general
Do these venerables honor respect revere and venerate those who are worthy
Indeed they do
For if these venerables were not to honor respect revere and venerate such a person
then who exactly would they honor
Then Vassakāra said to nanda
Where are you staying at present
In the Bamboo Grove brahmin
I hope the Bamboo Grove is delightful quiet and still far from the madding crowd remote from human settlements and fit for retreat
Indeed it is brahmin And it is like that owing to such protectors and guardians as yourself
Surely Master nanda it is owing to the venerables who meditate making a habit of meditating
For the venerables do in fact meditate and make a habit of meditating
This one time Master nanda Master Gotama was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
So I went there to see him
And there he spoke about meditation in many ways
He meditated and made a habit of meditating
And he praised all kinds of meditation
No brahmin the Buddha did not praise all kinds of meditation nor did he dispraise all kinds of meditation
And what kind of meditation did he not praise
Its when someones heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire and they dont truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen
Harboring sensual desire within they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate
Their heart is overcome and mired in ill will 
dullness and drowsiness 
restlessness and remorse 
doubt and they dont truly know and see the escape from doubt that has arisen
Harboring doubt within they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate
The Buddha didnt praise this kind of meditation
And what kind of meditation did he praise
Its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
And with the fading away of rapture they enter and remain in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
Giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
The Buddha praised this kind of meditation
Well Master nanda it seems that Master Gotama criticized the kind of meditation that deserves criticism and praised that deserving of praise
Well now Master nanda I must go
I have many duties and much to do
Please brahmin go at your convenience
Then Vassakāra the brahmin having approved and agreed with what Venerable nanda said got up from his seat and left
Soon after he had left Moggallāna the Guardian said to nanda
Master nanda you still havent answered my question
But brahmin didnt I say
There is no single mendicant who has all the same qualities in each and every way as possessed by Master Gotama the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
For the Blessed One gave rise to the unarisen path gave birth to the unborn path explained the unexplained path He was the knower of the path the discoverer of the path the expert on the path
And now the disciples live following the path they acquire it later
Middle Discourses
With Dhanañjāni
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
Then a certain mendicant who had completed the rainy season residence in Rājagaha went to the Southern Hills where he approached Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
Sāriputta said to him
Reverend I hope the Buddha is healthy and well
He is reverend
And I hope that the mendicant Saṅgha is healthy and well
Reverend at the rice checkpoint there is a brahmin named Dhanañjāni
I hope that he is healthy and well
He too is well
But is he diligent
How could he possibly be diligent
Dhanañjāni robs the brahmins and householders in the name of the king and he robs the king in the name of the brahmins and householders
His wife a lady of faith who he married from a family of faith has passed away
And he has taken a new wife who has no faith
Oh its bad news
to hear that Dhanañjāni is negligent
Hopefully some time or other Ill get to meet him and we can have a discussion
When Sāriputta had stayed in the Southern Hills as long as he wished he set out for Rājagaha
Traveling stage by stage he arrived at Rājagaha
where he stayed in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Then he robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for alms
Now at that time Dhanañjāni was having his cows milked in a cowshed outside the city
Then Sāriputta wandered for alms in Rājagaha After the meal on his return from almsround he approached Dhanañjāni
Seeing Sāriputta coming off in the distance
Dhanañjāni went to him and said
Here Master Sāriputta drink some fresh milk before the meal time
Enough brahmin
Ive finished eating for today
I shall be at the root of that tree for the days meditation
Come see me there
Yes sir replied Dhanañjāni
When Dhanañjāni had finished breakfast he went to Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
Sāriputta said to him
I hope youre diligent Dhanañjāni
How can I possibly be diligent Master Sāriputta I have to provide for my mother and father my wives and children and my bondservants and workers And I have to make the proper offerings to friends and colleagues relatives and kin guests ancestors deities and king And then this body must also be fattened and built up
What do you think Dhanañjāni
Suppose someone was to behave in an unprincipled and unjust way for the sake of their parents Because of this the wardens of hell would drag them to hell
Could they get out of being dragged to hell by pleading that they had acted for the sake of their parents Or could their parents save them by pleading that the acts had been done for their sake
No Master Sāriputta
Rather even as they were wailing the wardens of hell would cast them down into hell
What do you think Dhanañjāni
Suppose someone was to behave in an unprincipled and unjust way for the sake of their wives and children 
bondservants and workers 
friends and colleagues 
relatives and kin 
ancestors 
fattening and building up their body Because of this the wardens of hell would drag them to hell
Could they get out of being dragged to hell by pleading that they had acted for the sake of fattening and building up their body Or could anyone else save them by pleading that the acts had been done for that reason
No Master Sāriputta
Rather even as they were wailing the wardens of hell would cast them down into hell
Who do you think is better Dhanañjāni Someone who for the sake of their parents behaves in an unprincipled and unjust manner or someone who behaves in a principled and just manner
Someone who behaves in a principled and just manner for the sake of their parents
For principled and moral conduct is better than unprincipled and immoral conduct
Dhanañjāni there are other livelihoods that are both profitable and legitimate By means of these its possible to provide for your parents avoid bad deeds and practice the path of goodness
Who do you think is better Dhanañjāni Someone who for the sake of their wives and children 
bondservants and workers 
friends and colleagues 
relatives and kin 
ancestors 
fattening and building up their body behaves in an unprincipled and unjust manner or someone who behaves in a principled and just manner
Someone who behaves in a principled and just manner
For principled and moral conduct is better than unprincipled and immoral conduct
Dhanañjāni there are other livelihoods that are both profitable and legitimate By means of these its possible to fatten and build up your body avoid bad deeds and practice the path of goodness
Then Dhanañjāni the brahmin having approved and agreed with what Venerable Sāriputta said got up from his seat and left
Some time later Dhanañjāni became sick suffering gravely ill
Then he addressed a man
Please mister go to the Buddha and in my name bow with your head to his feet Say to him
Sir the brahmin Dhanañjāni is sick suffering gravely ill
He bows with his head to your feet
Then go to Venerable Sāriputta and in my name bow with your head to his feet Say to him
Sir the brahmin Dhanañjāni is sick suffering gravely ill
He bows with his head to your feet
And then say
Sir please visit Dhanañjāni at his home out of compassion
Yes sir that man replied
He did as Dhanañjāni asked
Sāriputta consented in silence
He robed up and taking his bowl and robe went to Dhanañjānis home where he sat on the seat spread out and said to Dhanañjāni
Dhanañjāni I hope youre keeping well I hope youre alright And I hope the pain is fading not growing that its fading is evident not its growing
Im not keeping well Master Sāriputta Im not alright
The pain is terrible and growing not fading its growing is evident not its fading
The winds piercing my head are so severe it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point
Im not keeping well
The pain in my head is so severe it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head
Im not keeping well
The winds piercing my belly are so severe it feels like a deft butcher or their apprentice is slicing my belly open with a meat cleaver
Im not keeping well
The burning in my body is so severe it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals
Im not keeping well Master Sāriputta Im not alright
The pain is terrible and growing not fading its growing is evident not its fading

Master Sāriputta speaks of the Brahmā realm
Master Sāriputta speaks of the Brahmā realm
Then Sāriputta thought
These brahmins are devoted to the Brahmā realm
Why dont I teach him a path to the company of Brahmā
Dhanañjāni I shall teach you a path to the company of Brahmā
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir replied Dhanañjāni
Venerable Sāriputta said this
And what is a path to companionship with Brahmā
Firstly a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
This is a path to companionship with Brahmā
Furthermore a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion 
They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing 
They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
This is a path to companionship with Brahmā
Well then Master Sāriputta in my name bow with your head to the Buddhas feet Say to him
Sir the brahmin Dhanañjāni is sick suffering gravely ill
He bows with his head to your feet
Then Sāriputta after establishing Dhanañjāni in the inferior Brahmā realm got up from his seat and left while there was still more left to do
Not long after Sāriputta had departed Dhanañjāni passed away and was reborn in the Brahmā realm
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants
Mendicants Sāriputta after establishing Dhanañjāni in the inferior Brahmā realm got up from his seat and left while there was still more left to do
Then Sāriputta went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said
Sir the brahmin Dhanañjāni is sick suffering gravely ill
He bows with his head to your feet
But Sāriputta after establishing Dhanañjāni in the inferior Brahmā realm why did you get up from your seat and leave while there was still more left to do
Sir I thought
These brahmins are devoted to the Brahmā realm Why dont I teach him a path to the company of Brahmā
And Sāriputta the brahmin Dhanañjāni has passed away and been reborn in the Brahmā realm

Advice to Rāhula at Ambalaṭṭhika
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Now at that time Venerable Rāhula was staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā
Then in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Ambalaṭṭhika to see Venerable Rāhula
Rāhula saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
He spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet
The Buddha sat on the seat spread out
and washed his feet
Rāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side
Then the Buddha leaving a little water in the pot addressed Rāhula
Rāhula do you see this little bit of water left in the pot
Yes sir
Thats how little of the ascetics nature is left in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie
Then the Buddha tossing away what little water was left in the pot said to Rāhula
Do you see this little bit of water that was tossed away
Yes sir
Thats how the ascetics nature is tossed away in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie
Then the Buddha turning the pot upside down said to Rāhula
Do you see how this pot is turned upside down
Yes sir
Thats how the ascetics nature is turned upside down in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie
Then the Buddha turning the pot right side up said to Rāhula
Do you see how this pot is vacant and hollow
Yes sir
Thats how vacant and hollow the ascetics nature is in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie
Suppose there was a royal bull elephant with tusks like chariotpoles able to draw a heavy load pedigree and battlehardened In battle it uses its forefeet and hindfeet its forequarters and hindquarters its head ears tusks and tail but it still protects its trunk
So its rider thinks
This royal bull elephant still protects its trunk
It has not yet given its life
But when that royal bull elephant  in battle uses its forefeet and hindfeet its forequarters and hindquarters its head ears tusks and tail and its trunk its rider thinks
This royal bull elephant  in battle uses its forefeet and hindfeet its forequarters and hindquarters its head ears tusks and tail and its trunk
It has given its life
Now there is nothing that royal bull elephant would not do
In the same way when someone is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie there is no bad deed they would not do I say
So you should train like this I will not tell a lie even for a joke
What do you think Rāhula
What is the purpose of a mirror
Its for checking your reflection sir
In the same way deeds of body speech and mind should be done only after repeated checking
When you want to act with the body you should check on that same deed
Does this act with the body that I want to do lead to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both
Is it unskillful with suffering as its outcome and result
If while checking in this way you know
This act with the body that I want to do leads to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both
Its unskillful with suffering as its outcome and result To the best of your ability Rāhula you should not do such a deed
But if while checking in this way you know
This act with the body that I want to do doesnt lead to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both
Its skillful with happiness as its outcome and result Then Rāhula you should do such a deed
While you are acting with the body you should check on that same act
Does this act with the body that I am doing lead to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both
Is it unskillful with suffering as its outcome and result
If while checking in this way you know
This act with the body that I am doing leads to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both
Its unskillful with suffering as its outcome and result Then Rāhula you should desist from such a deed
But if while checking in this way you know
This act with the body that I am doing doesnt lead to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both
Its skillful with happiness as its outcome and result Then Rāhula you should continue doing such a deed
After you have acted with the body you should check on that same act
Does this act with the body that I have done lead to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both
Is it unskillful with suffering as its outcome and result
If while checking in this way you know
This act with the body that I have done leads to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both
Its unskillful with suffering as its outcome and result Then Rāhula you should confess reveal and clarify such a deed to the Teacher or a sensible spiritual companion
And having revealed it you should restrain yourself in future
But if while checking in this way you know
This act with the body that I have done doesnt lead to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both
Its skillful with happiness as its outcome and result Then Rāhula you should live in rapture and joy because of this training day and night in skillful qualities
When you want to act with speech you should check on that same deed
Does this act of speech that I want to do lead to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both  
If while checking in this way you know
This act of speech that I have done leads to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both
Its unskillful with suffering as its outcome and result Then Rāhula you should confess reveal and clarify such a deed to the Teacher or a sensible spiritual companion
And having revealed it you should restrain yourself in future
But if while checking in this way you know
This act of speech that I have done doesnt lead to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both
Its skillful with happiness as its outcome and result Then Rāhula you should live in rapture and joy because of this training day and night in skillful qualities
When you want to act with the mind you should check on that same deed
Does this act of mind that I want to do lead to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both  
If while checking in this way you know
This act of mind that I have done leads to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both
Its unskillful with suffering as its outcome and result Then Rāhula you should be horrified repelled and disgusted by that deed
And being repelled you should restrain yourself in future
But if while checking in this way you know
This act with the mind that I have done doesnt lead to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both
Its skillful with happiness as its outcome and result Then Rāhula you should live in rapture and joy because of this training day and night in skillful qualities
All the ascetics and brahmins of the past future and present who purify their physical verbal and mental actions do so after repeatedly checking
So Rāhula you should train yourself like this I will purify my physical verbal and mental actions after repeatedly checking
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable Rāhula was happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
The AntHill
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time Venerable Kassapa the Prince was staying in the Dark Forest
Then late at night a glorious deity lighting up the entire Dark Forest went up to Kassapa the Prince stood to one side and said
Monk monk This anthill fumes by night and flames by day
The brahmin said
Take up the sword and dig O sage
Taking up the sword and digging the sage saw a bar
A bar sir
The brahmin said
Throw out the bar
Take up the sword and dig O sage
Taking up the sword and digging the sage saw a bullfrog

The brahmin said

Mendicant go to the Buddha and ask him about this riddle You should remember it in line with his answer
I dont see anyone in this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humanswho could provide a satisfying answer to this riddle except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them
That is what that deity said
before vanishing right there
Then when the night had passed Kassapa the Prince went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
Then he asked
Sir what is the anthill What is the fuming by night and flaming by day Who is the brahmin and who the sage What are the sword the digging the bar the bullfrog the forked path the box the tortoise the axe and block and the lump of meat And what is the dragon
Mendicant anthill is a term for this body made up of the four primary elements produced by mother and father built up from rice and porridge liable to impermanence to wearing away and erosion to breaking up and destruction
Thinking and considering all night about what you did during the day

this is the flaming by day
Brahmin is a term for the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Sage is a term for the trainee mendicant

Middle Discourses
At Kaṇṇakatthala
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Ujuñña in the deer park at Kaṇṇakatthala
Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Ujuñña on some business
Then he addressed a man
Please mister go to the Buddha and in my name bow with your head to his feet Ask him if he is healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
And then say
Sir King Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see you today when he has finished breakfast
Yes Your Majesty that man replied
He did as the king asked
The sisters Somā and Sakulā heard this
While the meal was being served they approached the king and said
Great king since you are going to the Buddha please bow in our name with your head to his feet Ask him if he is healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
When he had finished breakfast King Pasenadi went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir the sisters Somā and Sakulā bow with their heads to your feet They ask if you are healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
But great king couldnt they get any other messenger
So Pasenadi explained the circumstances of the message
The Buddha said May the sisters Somā and Sakulā be happy great king
Then the king said to the Buddha
I have heard sir that the ascetic Gotama says this
There is no ascetic or brahmin who will claim to be allknowing and allseeing to know and see everything without exception that is not possible
Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth Is their explanation in line with the teaching Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
Great king those who say this do not repeat what I have said They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue
Then King Pasenadi addressed General Viḍūḍabha
General who introduced this topic of discussion to the royal compound
It was Sañjaya great king the brahmin of the kāsa clan
Then the king addressed a man
Please mister in my name tell Sañjaya that
King Pasenadi summons him
Yes Your Majesty that man replied He did as the king asked
Then the king said to the Buddha
Sir might the Buddha have spoken in reference to one thing but that person believed it was something else
How then do you recall making this statement
Great king I recall making this statement
There is no ascetic or brahmin who knows all and sees all simultaneously that is not possible
What the Buddha says appears reasonable
Sir there are these four classes
aristocrats brahmins merchants and workers
Is there any difference between them
Of the four classes two are said to be preeminent
the aristocrats and the brahmins
That is when it comes to bowing down rising up greeting with joined palms and observing proper etiquette
Sir I am not asking you about the present life
but about the life to come
Great king there are these five factors that support meditation
What five
Its when a mendicant has faith in the Realized Ones awakening
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
They are rarely ill or unwell Their stomach digests well being neither too hot nor too cold but just right and fit for meditation
Theyre not devious or deceitful They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companions
They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities Theyre strong staunchly vigorous not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities
Theyre wise They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble penetrative and leads to the complete ending of suffering
These are the five factors that support meditation
There are these four classes
aristocrats brahmins merchants and workers
If they had these five factors that support meditation
that would be for their lasting welfare and happiness
Sir there are these four classes
aristocrats brahmins merchants and workers
If they had these five factors that support meditation
would there be any difference between them
In that case I say it is the diversity of their efforts in meditation
Suppose there was a pair of elephants or horses or oxen in training who were well tamed and well trained And there was a pair who were not tamed or trained
What do you think great king
Wouldnt the pair that was well tamed and well trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamed
Yes sir
But would the pair that was not tamed and trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamed just like the tamed pair
No sir
In the same way there are things that must be attained by someone with faith health integrity energy and wisdom Its not possible for a faithless unhealthy deceitful lazy witless person to attain them
What the Buddha says appears reasonable
Sir there are these four classes
aristocrats brahmins merchants and workers
If they had these five factors that support meditation and if they practiced rightly
would there be any difference between them
In that case I say that there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other
Suppose a person took dry teak wood and lit a fire and produced heat
Then another person did the same using sāl wood
another used mango wood
while another used wood of the cluster fig
What do you think great king
Would there be any difference between the fires produced by these different kinds of wood that is in the flame color or light
No sir
In the same way when fire has been kindled by energy and produced by effort I say that there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other
What the Buddha says appears reasonable
But sir do gods absolutely exist
But what exactly are you asking
Whether those gods come back to this state of existence or not
Those gods who are subject to affliction come back to this state of existence but those free of affliction do not come back
When he said this General Viḍūḍabha said to the Buddha
Sir will the gods subject to affliction topple or expel from their place the gods who are free of affliction
Then Venerable nanda thought
This General Viḍūḍabha is King Pasenadis son
and I am the Buddhas son
Now is the time for one son to confer with another
So nanda addressed General Viḍūḍabha
Well then general Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think general
As far as the dominion of King Pasenadi of Kosala extends where he rules as sovereign lord can he topple or expel from that place any ascetic or brahmin regardless of whether they are good or bad or whether or not they are genuine spiritual practitioners
He can mister
What do you think general
As far as the dominion of King Pasenadi does not extend where he does not rule as sovereign lord can he topple or expel from that place any ascetic or brahmin regardless of whether they are good or bad or whether or not they are genuine spiritual practitioners
He cannot mister
What do you think general
Have you heard of the gods of the ThirtyThree
Yes mister
Ive heard of them
and so has the good King Pasenadi
What do you think general
Can King Pasenadi topple or expel from their place the gods of the ThirtyThree
King Pasenadi cant even see the gods of the ThirtyThree so how could he possibly topple or expel them from their place
In the same way general the gods subject to affliction cant even see the gods who are free of affliction so how could they possibly topple or expel them from their place
Then the king said to the Buddha
Sir what is this mendicants name
nanda great king
A joy he is and a joy he seems
What Venerable nanda says seems reasonable
But sir does Brahmā absolutely exist
But what exactly are you asking
Whether that Brahmā comes back to this state of existence or not
Any Brahmā who is subject to affliction comes back to this state of existence but those free of affliction do not come back
Then a certain man said to the king
Great king Sañjaya the brahmin of the kāsa clan has come
Then King Pasenadi asked Sañjaya
Brahmin who introduced this topic of discussion to the royal compound
It was General Viḍūḍabha great king
But Viḍūḍabha said
It was Sañjaya great king the brahmin of the kāsa clan
Then a certain man said to the king
Its time to depart great king
So the king said to the Buddha
Sir I asked you about omniscience and you answered
I like and accept this and am satisfied with it
I asked you about the four classes
about the gods
and about Brahmā and you answered in each case
Whatever I asked the Buddha about he answered
I like and accept this and am satisfied with it
Well now sir I must go
I have many duties and much to do
Please great king go at your convenience
Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what the Buddha said Then he got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leaving
Middle Discourses
The Simile of the Quail
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Northern paṇas near the town of theirs named paṇa
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered paṇa for alms
He wandered for alms in paṇa After the meal on his return from almsround he went to a certain forest grove for the days meditation
Having plunged deep into it he sat at the root of a certain tree for the days meditation
Venerable Udāyī also robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered paṇa for alms
He wandered for alms in paṇa After the meal on his return from almsround he went to a certain forest grove for the days meditation
Having plunged deep into it he sat at the root of a certain tree for the days meditation
Then as Venerable Udāyī was in private retreat this thought came to his mind
The Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happiness
He has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful things
Then in the late afternoon Udāyī came out of retreat and went to the Buddha
He bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Just now sir as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind
The Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happiness
He has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful things
For we used to eat in the evening the morning and at the wrong time of day
But then there came a time when the Buddha addressed the mendicants saying
Please mendicants give up that meal at the wrong time of day
At that sir we became sad and upset
But these faithful householders give us a variety of delicious foods at the wrong time of day And the Blessed One tells us to give it up The Holy One tells us to let it go
But when we considered our love and respect for the Buddha and our sense of conscience and prudence we gave up that meal at the wrong time of day
Then we ate in the evening and the morning
But then there came a time when the Buddha addressed the mendicants saying
Please mendicants give up that meal at the wrong time of night
At that sir we became sad and upset
But thats considered the more delicious of the two meals And the Blessed One tells us to give it up The Holy One tells us to let it go
Once it so happened that a certain person got some soup during the day He said
Come lets set this aside well enjoy it together this evening
Nearly all meals are prepared at night only a few in the day
But when we considered our love and respect for the Buddha and our sense of conscience and prudence we gave up that meal at the wrong time of night
In the past mendicants went wandering for alms in the dark of the night They walked into a swamp or fell into a sewer or collided with a thorn bush or collided with a sleeping cow or encountered youths escaping a crime or on their way to commit one or were invited by a female to commit a lewd act
Once it so happened that I wandered for alms in the dark of the night
A woman washing a pot saw me by a flash of lightning
Startled she cried out
Bloody hell A goblins upon me
When she said this I said to her
Sister I am no goblin
Im a mendicant waiting for alms
Then its a mendicant whose ma died and pa died
Youd be better off having your belly sliced open with a meat cleaver than to wander for alms in the dark of night for the sake of your belly
Recollecting that I thought
The Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happiness
He has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful things
This is exactly what happens when some foolish people are told by me to give something up They say
What such a trivial insignificant thing as this This ascetic is much too strict
They dont give it up and they nurse bitterness towards me
and for the mendicants who want to train that becomes a strong firm stout bond a tie that has not rotted and a heavy yoke
Suppose a quail was tied with a vine and was waiting there to be injured caged or killed
Would it be right to say that
for that quail that vine is weak feeble rotten and insubstantial
For that quail that vine is a strong firm stout bond a tie that has not rotted and a heavy yoke
In the same way when some foolish people are told by me to give something up they say
What such a trivial insignificant thing as this This ascetic is much too strict
They dont give it up and they nurse bitterness towards me
and for the mendicants who want to train that becomes a strong firm stout bond a tie that has not rotted and a heavy yoke
But when some gentlemen are told by me to give something up they say
What we just have to give up such a trivial insignificant thing as this when the Blessed One tells us to give it up the Holy One tells us to let it go
They give it up and they dont nurse bitterness towards me
and when the mendicants who want to train have given that up they live relaxed unruffled surviving on charity their hearts free as a wild deer
For them that bond is weak feeble rotten and insubstantial
Suppose there was a royal bull elephant with tusks like chariotpoles able to draw a heavy load pedigree and battlehardened And it was bound with a strong harness But just by twisting its body a little it would break apart its bonds and go wherever it wants
Would it be right to say that
for that bull elephant that strong harness is a strong firm stout bond a tie that has not rotted and a heavy yoke
For that bull elephant that strong harness is weak feeble rotten and insubstantial
In the same way when some gentlemen are told by me to give something up they say
What we just have to give up such a trivial insignificant thing as this when the Blessed One tells us to give it up the Holy One tells us to let it go
They give it up and they dont nurse bitterness towards me
and when the mendicants who want to train have given that up they live relaxed unruffled surviving on charity their hearts free as a wild deer
For them that bond is weak feeble rotten and insubstantial
Suppose there was a poor man with few possessions and little wealth
He had a single brokendown hovel open to the crows not the best sort a single brokendown couch not the best sort a single pot for storing grain not the best sort and a single wifey not the best sort
Hed see a mendicant sitting in meditation in the cool shade their hands and feet well washed after eating a delectable meal
Hed think
The ascetic life is so very pleasant The ascetic life is so very skillful
If only I could shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
But hes not able to give up his brokendown hovel his brokendown couch his pot for storing grain or his wifeynone of which are the best sortin order to go forth
Would it be right to say that
for that man
those bonds are weak feeble rotten and insubstantial
For that man
they are a strong firm stout bond a tie that has not rotted and a heavy yoke

Udāyī these four people are found in the world
What four
Take a certain person practicing to give up and let go of attachments
As they do so memories and thoughts connected with attachments beset them
They tolerate them and dont give them up get rid of them eliminate them and obliterate them
I call this person fettered not detached
Why is that
Because I understand the diversity of faculties as it applies to this person
Take another person practicing to give up and let go of attachments
As they do so memories and thoughts connected with attachments beset them
They dont tolerate them but give them up get rid of them eliminate them and obliterate them
I call this person fettered not detached
Why is that
Because I understand the diversity of faculties as it applies to this person
Take another person practicing to give up and let go of attachments
As they do so every so often they lose mindfulness and memories and thoughts connected with attachments beset them
Their mindfulness is slow to come up
but they quickly give up get rid of eliminate and obliterate those thoughts
Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day and a person let two or three drops of water fall onto it
The drops would be slow to fall but theyd quickly dry up and evaporate
In the same way take a person practicing to give up and let go of attachments
As they do so every so often they lose mindfulness and memories and thoughts connected with attachments beset them
Their mindfulness is slow to come up
but they quickly give them up get rid of eliminate and obliterate those thoughts
I also call this person fettered not detached
Why is that
Because I understand the diversity of faculties as it applies to this person
Take another person who understanding that attachment is the root of suffering
is freed with the ending of attachments
I call this person detached not fettered
Why is that
Because I understand the diversity of faculties as it applies to this person
These are the four people found in the world
Udāyī these are the five kinds of sensual stimulation
What five
Sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
Sounds known by the ear 
Smells known by the nose 
Tastes known by the tongue 
Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation
The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasurea filthy ordinary ignoble pleasure Such pleasure should not be cultivated or developed but should be feared I say
Take a mendicant who quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption 
second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption
This is called the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of awakening Such pleasure should be cultivated and developed and should not be feared I say
Take a mendicant who quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption
This belongs to the perturbable I say
And what there belongs to the perturbable
Whatever placing of the mind and keeping it connected has not ceased there is what belongs to the perturbable
Take a mendicant who as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled enters and remains in the second absorption
This belongs to the perturbable I say
And what there belongs to the perturbable
Whatever rapture and bliss has not ceased there is what belongs to the perturbable
Take a mendicant who with the fading away of rapture enters and remains in the third absorption
This belongs to the perturbable
And what there belongs to the perturbable
Whatever equanimous bliss has not ceased there is what belongs to the perturbable
Take a mendicant who giving up pleasure and pain enters and remains in the fourth absorption
This belongs to the imperturbable
Take a mendicant who quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption
But this is not enough I say give it up go beyond it
And what goes beyond it
Take a mendicant who as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled enters and remains in the second absorption That goes beyond it
But this too is not enough I say give it up go beyond it
And what goes beyond it
Take a mendicant who with the fading away of rapture enters and remains in the third absorption That goes beyond it
But this too is not enough I say give it up go beyond it
And what goes beyond it
Take a mendicant who giving up pleasure and pain enters and remains in the fourth absorption That goes beyond it
But this too is not enough I say give it up go beyond it
And what goes beyond it
Take a mendicant who going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space That goes beyond it
But this too is not enough I say give it up go beyond it
And what goes beyond it
Take a mendicant who going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness That goes beyond it
But this too is not enough I say give it up go beyond it
And what goes beyond it
Take a mendicant who going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness That goes beyond it
But this too is not enough I say give it up go beyond it
And what goes beyond it
Take a mendicant who going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception That goes beyond it
But this too is not enough I say give it up go beyond it
And what goes beyond it
Take a mendicant who going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling That goes beyond it
So Udāyī I even recommend giving up the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Do you see any fetter large or small that I dont recommend giving up
No sir
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable Udāyī was happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
The Analysis of NonConflict
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants I shall teach you the analysis of nonconflict
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Dont indulge in sensual pleasures which are low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless And dont indulge in selfmortification which is painful ignoble and pointless
Avoiding these two extremes the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way of practice which gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishment
Know what it means to flatter and to rebuke
Knowing these avoid them and just teach Dhamma
Know how to assess different kinds of pleasure
Knowing this pursue inner bliss
Dont talk behind peoples backs and dont speak sharply in their presence
Dont speak hurriedly
Dont insist on local terminology and dont override normal usage
This is the recitation passage for the analysis of nonconflict
Dont indulge in sensual pleasures which are low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless And dont indulge in selfmortification which is painful ignoble and pointless
Thats what I said but why did I say it
Pleasure linked to sensuality is low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless Indulging in such happiness is a principle beset by pain harm stress and fever and it is the wrong way
Breaking off such indulgence is a principle free of pain harm stress and fever and it is the right way
Indulging in selfmortification is painful ignoble and pointless It is a principle beset by pain harm stress and fever and it is the wrong way
Breaking off such indulgence is a principle free of pain harm stress and fever and it is the right way
Dont indulge in sensual pleasures which are low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless And dont indulge in selfmortification which is painful ignoble and pointless
Thats what I said and this is why I said it
Avoiding these two extremes the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way of practice which gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishment
Thats what I said but why did I say it
It is simply this noble eightfold path that is
right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion
Avoiding these two extremes the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way of practice which gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishment
Thats what I said and this is why I said it
Know what it means to flatter and to rebuke
Knowing these avoid them and just teach Dhamma
Thats what I said but why did I say it
And how is there flattering and rebuking without teaching Dhamma
In speaking like this some are rebuked Pleasure linked to sensuality is low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless All those who indulge in such happiness are beset by pain harm stress and fever and they are practicing the wrong way
In speaking like this some are flattered Pleasure linked to sensuality is low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless All those who have broken off such indulgence are free of pain harm stress and fever and they are practicing the right way
In speaking like this some are rebuked Indulging in selfmortification is painful ignoble and pointless All those who indulge in it are beset by pain harm stress and fever and they are practicing the wrong way
In speaking like this some are flattered Indulging in selfmortification is painful ignoble and pointless All those who have broken off such indulgence are free of pain harm stress and fever and they are practicing the right way
In speaking like this some are rebuked All those who have not given up the fetters of rebirth are beset by pain harm stress and fever and they are practicing the wrong way
In speaking like this some are flattered All those who have given up the fetters of rebirth are free of pain harm stress and fever and they are practicing the right way
Thats how there is flattering and rebuking without teaching Dhamma
And how is there neither flattering nor rebuking and just teaching Dhamma
You dont say Pleasure linked to sensuality is low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless All those who indulge in such happiness are beset by pain harm stress and fever and they are practicing the wrong way
Rather by saying this you just teach Dhamma
The indulgence is a principle beset by pain harm stress and fever and it is the wrong way
You dont say Pleasure linked to sensuality is low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless All those who have broken off such indulgence are free of pain harm stress and fever and they are practicing the right way
Rather by saying this you just teach Dhamma
Breaking off the indulgence is a principle free of pain harm stress and fever and it is the right way
You dont say Indulging in selfmortification is painful ignoble and pointless All those who indulge in it are beset by pain harm stress and fever and they are practicing the wrong way
Rather by saying this you just teach Dhamma
The indulgence is a principle beset by pain harm stress and fever and it is the wrong way
You dont say Indulging in selfmortification is painful ignoble and pointless All those who have broken off such indulgence are free of pain harm stress and fever and they are practicing the right way
Rather by saying this you just teach Dhamma
Breaking off the indulgence is a principle free of pain harm stress and fever and it is the right way
You dont say All those who have not given up the fetters of rebirth are beset by pain harm stress and fever and they are practicing the wrong way
Rather by saying this you just teach Dhamma
When the fetter of rebirth is not given up rebirth is also not given up
You dont say All those who have given up the fetters of rebirth are free of pain harm stress and fever and they are practicing the right way
Rather by saying this you just teach Dhamma
When the fetter of rebirth is given up rebirth is also given up
Thats how there is neither flattering nor rebuking and just teaching Dhamma
Know what it means to flatter and to rebuke
Knowing these avoid them and just teach Dhamma
Thats what I said and this is why I said it
Know how to assess different kinds of pleasure
Knowing this pursue inner bliss
Thats what I said but why did I say it
There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation
What five
Sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
Sounds known by the ear 
Smells known by the nose 
Tastes known by the tongue 
Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation
The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasurea filthy common ignoble pleasure
Such pleasure should not be cultivated or developed but should be feared I say
Now take a mendicant who quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption
This is called the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of awakening
Such pleasure should be cultivated and developed and should not be feared I say
Know how to assess different kinds of pleasure
Knowing this pursue inner bliss
Thats what I said and this is why I said it
Dont talk behind peoples backs and dont speak sharply in their presence
Thats what I said
but why did I say it
When you know that what you say behind someones back is untrue false and harmful then if at all possible you should not speak
When you know that what you say behind someones back is true and correct but harmful then you should train yourself not to speak
When you know that what you say behind someones back is true correct and beneficial then you should know the right time to speak
When you know that your sharp words in someones presence are untrue false and harmful then if at all possible you should not speak
When you know that your sharp words in someones presence are true and correct but harmful then you should train yourself not to speak
When you know that your sharp words in someones presence are true correct and beneficial then you should know the right time to speak
Dont talk behind peoples backs and dont speak sharply in their presence
Thats what I said and this is why I said it
Dont speak hurriedly
Thats what I said but why did I say it
When speaking hurriedly your body gets tired your mind gets stressed your voice gets stressed your throat gets sore and your words become unclear and hard to understand
When not speaking hurriedly your body doesnt get tired your mind doesnt get stressed your voice doesnt get stressed your throat doesnt get sore and your words are clear and easy to understand
Dont speak hurriedly
Thats what I said and this is why I said it
Dont insist on local terminology and dont override normal usage
Thats what I said but why did I say it
And how do you insist on local terminology and override normal usage
Its when in different localities the same thing is known as a plate a bowl a cup a dish a basin a tureen or a porringer
And however it is known in those various localities you speak accordingly obstinately sticking to that and insisting
This is the only truth other ideas are silly
Thats how you insist on local terminology and override normal usage
And how do you not insist on local terminology and not override normal usage
Its when in different localities the same thing is known as a plate a bowl a cup a dish a basin a tureen or a porringer
And however it is known in those various localities you speak accordingly thinking It seems that the venerables are referring to this
Thats how you dont insist on local terminology and dont override normal usage
Dont insist on local terminology and dont override normal usage
Thats what I said and this is why I said it
Now mendicants pleasure linked to sensuality is low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless Indulging in such happiness is a principle beset by pain harm stress and fever and it is the wrong way
Thats why this is a principle beset by conflict
Breaking off such indulgence is a principle free of pain harm stress and fever and it is the right way
Thats why this is a principle free of conflict
Indulging in selfmortification is painful ignoble and pointless It is a principle beset by pain harm stress and fever and it is the wrong way
Thats why this is a principle beset by conflict
Breaking off such indulgence is a principle free of pain harm stress and fever and it is the right way
Thats why this is a principle free of conflict
The middle way of practice by which the Realized One was awakened gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishment It is a principle free of pain harm stress and fever and it is the right way
Thats why this is a principle free of conflict
Flattering and rebuking without teaching Dhamma is a principle beset by pain harm stress and fever and it is the wrong way
Thats why this is a principle beset by conflict
Neither flattering nor rebuking and just teaching Dhamma is a principle free of pain harm stress and fever and it is the right way
Thats why this is a principle free of conflict
Sensual pleasurea filthy common ignoble pleasureis a principle beset by pain harm stress and fever and it is the wrong way
Thats why this is a principle beset by conflict
The pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of awakening is a principle free of pain harm stress and fever and it is the right way
Thats why this is a principle free of conflict
Saying untrue false and harmful things behind someones back is a principle beset by pain harm stress and fever and it is the wrong way
Thats why this is a principle beset by conflict
Saying true and correct but harmful things behind someones back is a principle beset by pain harm stress and fever and it is the wrong way
Thats why this is a principle beset by conflict
Saying true correct and beneficial things behind someones back is a principle free of pain harm stress and fever and it is the right way
Thats why this is a principle free of conflict
Saying untrue false and harmful things in someones presence is a principle beset by pain harm stress and fever and it is the wrong way
Thats why this is a principle beset by conflict
Saying true and correct but harmful things in someones presence is a principle beset by pain harm stress and fever and it is the wrong way
Thats why this is a principle beset by conflict
Saying true correct and beneficial things in someones presence is a principle free of pain harm stress and fever and it is the right way
Thats why this is a principle free of conflict
Speaking hurriedly is a principle beset by pain harm stress and fever and it is the wrong way
Thats why this is a principle beset by conflict
Speaking unhurriedly is a principle free of pain harm stress and fever and it is the right way
Thats why this is a principle free of conflict
Insisting on local terminology and overriding normal usage is a principle beset by pain harm stress and fever and it is the wrong way
Thats why this is a principle beset by conflict
Not insisting on local terminology and not overriding normal usage is a principle free of pain harm stress and fever and it is the right way
Thats why this is a principle free of conflict
So you should train like this We shall know the principles beset by conflict and the principles free of conflict
Knowing this we will practice the way free of conflict
And mendicants Subhūti the gentleman practices the way of nonconflict
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
With Brahmāyu
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Videhans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants
Now at that time the brahmin Brahmāyu was residing in Mithilā He was old elderly and senior advanced in years having reached the final stage of life he was a hundred and twenty years old He had mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knew philology and grammar and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man
It seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyis wandering in the land of the Videhans together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He explains a teaching thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Its good to see such perfected ones
Now at that time the brahmin Brahmāyu had a student named Uttara He too had mastered the Vedic curriculum
Brahmāyu told Uttara of the Buddhas presence in the land of the Videhans and added
Please dear Uttara go to the ascetic Gotama and find out whether or not he lives up to his reputation
Through you I shall learn about Master Gotama
But sir how shall I find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives up to his reputation
Dear Uttara the thirtytwo marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies no other
If he stays at home he becomes a king a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king His dominion extends to all four sides he achieves stability in the country and he possesses the seven treasures
He has the following seven treasures
the wheel the elephant the horse the jewel the woman the treasurer and the counselor as the seventh treasure
He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic crushing the armies of his enemies
After conquering this land girt by sea he reigns by principle without rod or sword
But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness he becomes a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha who draws back the veil from the world
But dear Uttara I am the one who gives the hymns
and you are the one who receives them
Yes sir replied Uttara He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled Brahmāyu before setting out for the land of the Videhans where the Buddha was wandering
Traveling stage by stage he came to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
and scrutinized his body for the thirtytwo marks of a great man
He saw all of them except for two
which he had doubts about
whether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongue
Then it occurred to the Buddha
This brahmin student Uttara sees all the marks except for two
which he has doubts about
whether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongue
So the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Uttara would see his retracted private parts
And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils and covered his entire forehead with his tongue
Then Uttara thought
The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirtytwo marks
Why dont I follow him and observe his deportment
So Uttara followed the Buddha like a shadow for seven months
When seven months had passed he set out wandering towards Mithilā
There he approached the brahmin Brahmāyu bowed and sat down to one side
Brahmāyu said to him
Well dear Uttara does Master Gotama live up to his reputation or not
He does sir
Master Gotama possesses the thirtytwo marks
He has wellplanted feet
On the soles of his feet there are thousandspoked wheels with rims and hubs complete in every detail
He has projecting heels
He has long fingers
His hands and feet are tender
His hands and feet cling gracefully
His feet are arched
His calves are like those of an antelope
When standing upright and not bending over the palms of both hands touch the knees
His private parts are retracted
He is gold colored his skin has a golden sheen
He has delicate skin so delicate that dust and dirt dont stick to his body
His hairs grow one per pore
His hairs stand up theyre blueblack and curl clockwise
His body is as straight as Brahmās
He has bulging muscles in seven places
His chest is like that of a lion
The gap between the shoulderblades is filled in
He has the proportional circumference of a banyan tree the span of his arms equals the height of his body
His torso is cylindrical
He has an excellent sense of taste
His jaw is like that of a lion
He has forty teeth
His teeth are even
His teeth have no gaps
His teeth are perfectly white
He has a large tongue
He has the voice of Brahmā like a cuckoos call
His eyes are deep blue
He has eyelashes like a cows
Between his eyebrows there grows a tuft soft and white like cottonwool
His head is shaped like a turban
These are the thirtytwo marks of a great man possessed by Master Gotama
When hes walking he takes the first step with the right foot
He doesnt lift his foot too far or place it too near
He doesnt walk too slow or too fast
He walks without knocking his knees or ankles together
When hes walking he keeps his thighs neither too straight nor too bent neither too tight nor too loose
When he walks only the lower half of his body moves and he walks effortlessly
When he turns to look he does so with the whole body
He doesnt look directly up or down
He doesnt look all around while walking but focuses a ploughs length in front Beyond that he has unhindered knowledge and vision
When entering an inhabited area he keeps his body neither too straight nor too bent neither too tight nor too loose
He turns around neither too far nor too close to the seat He doesnt lean on his hand when sitting down And he doesnt just plonk his body down on the seat
When sitting in inhabited areas he doesnt fidget with his hands or feet
He doesnt sit with his knees or ankles crossed
He doesnt sit with his hand holding his chin
When sitting in inhabited areas he doesnt cower or shake or tremble or get anxious and so he is not nervous at all
When sitting in inhabited areas he still practices seclusion
When receiving water for rinsing the bowl he holds the bowl neither too straight nor too bent neither too tight nor too loose
He receives neither too little nor too much water
He rinses the bowl without making a sloshing noise or spinning it around He doesnt put the bowl on the ground to rinse his hands his hands and bowl are rinsed at the same time
He doesnt throw the bowl rinsing water away too far or too near or splash it about
When receiving rice he holds the bowl neither too straight nor too bent neither too close nor too loose
He receives neither too little nor too much rice
He eats sauce in a moderate proportion and doesnt spend too much time saucing his portions
He chews over each portion two or three times before swallowing
But no grain of rice enters his body unchewed and none remain in his mouth
Only then does he raise another portion to his lips
He eats experiencing the taste but without experiencing greed for the taste
He eats food thinking of eight reasons
Not for fun indulgence adornment or decoration but only to sustain this body to avoid harm and to support spiritual practice In this way I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort and I will live blamelessly and at ease
After eating when receiving water for washing the bowl he holds the bowl neither too straight nor too bent neither too tight nor too loose
He receives neither too little nor too much water
He washes the bowl without making a sloshing noise or spinning it around He doesnt put the bowl on the ground to wash his hands his hands and bowl are washed at the same time
He doesnt throw the bowl washing water away too far or too near or splash it about
After eating he doesnt put the bowl on the ground too far away or too close Hes not careless with his bowl nor does he spend too much time on it
After eating he sits for a while in silence but doesnt wait too long to give the verses of appreciation
After eating he expresses appreciation without criticizing the meal or expecting another one
Invariably he educates encourages fires up and inspires that assembly with a Dhamma talk
Then he gets up from his seat and leaves
He walks neither too fast nor too slow without wanting to get out of there
He wears his robe on his body neither too high nor too low neither too tight nor too loose
The wind doesnt blow his robe off his body
And dust and dirt dont stick to his body
When he has gone to the monastery he sits on a seat spread out and washes his feet
But he doesnt waste time with pedicures
When he has washed his feet he sits down crosslegged with his body straight and establishes mindfulness right there
He has no intention to hurt himself hurt others or hurt both
He only wishes for the welfare of himself of others of both and of the whole world
In the monastery when he teaches Dhamma to an assembly he neither flatters them nor rebukes them
Invariably he educates encourages fires up and inspires that assembly with a Dhamma talk
His voice has eight qualities
it is clear comprehensible charming audible rounded undistorted deep and resonant
He makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as the assembly goes but it doesnt extend outside the assembly
And when theyve been inspired with a Dhamma talk by Master Gotama they get up from their seats and leave looking back at him alone and not forgetting their lesson
I have seen Master Gotama walking and standing entering inhabited areas and sitting and eating there sitting silently after eating and expressing appreciation going to the monastery sitting silently there and teaching Dhamma to an assembly there
Such is Master Gotama such he is and more than that
When he had spoken the brahmin Brahmāyu got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and uttered this aphorism three times
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Hopefully some time or other Ill get to meet him and we can have a discussion
And then the Buddha traveling stage by stage in the Videhan lands arrived at Mithilā
where he stayed in the Makhādeva Mango Grove
The brahmins and householders of Mithilā heard
It seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Mithilā where he is staying in the Makhādeva Mango Grove
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Its good to see such perfected ones
Then the brahmins and householders of Mithilā went up to the Buddha Before sitting down to one side some bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silent
The brahmin Brahmāyu also heard that the Buddha had arrived
So he went to the Makhādeva Mango Grove together with several disciples
Not far from the grove he thought
It wouldnt be appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama without first letting him know
So he addressed one of his students
Here student go to the ascetic Gotama and in my name bow with your head to his feet Ask him if he is healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
And then say
Master Gotama the brahmin Brahmāyu is old elderly and senior advanced in years having reached the final stage of life he is a hundred and twenty years old He has mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knows philology and grammar and is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man
Of all the brahmins and householders residing in Mithilā Brahmāyu is said to be the foremost in
lifespan and fame
He wants to see Master Gotama
Yes sir that student replied He did as he was asked and the Buddha said
Please student let Brahmāyu come when hes ready
The student went back to Brahmāyu and said to him
Your request for an audience with the ascetic Gotama has been granted
Please go at your convenience
Then the brahmin Brahmāyu went up to the Buddha
The assembly saw him coming off in the distance
and made way for him as he was wellknown and famous
Brahmāyu said to that retinue
Enough gentlemen
Please sit on your own seats
I shall sit here by the ascetic Gotama
Then the brahmin Brahmāyu went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
and scrutinized the Buddhas body for the thirtytwo marks of a great man
He saw all of them except for two
which he had doubts about
whether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongue
Then Brahmāyu addressed the Buddha in verse
I have learned of the thirtytwo
marks of a great man
There are two that I dont see
on the body of the ascetic Gotama
Are the private parts retracted
O supreme person
Though called by a word of the feminine gender
perhaps your tongue is a manly one
Perhaps your tongue is large
as we have been informed
Please stick it out in its full extent
and so O hermit dispel my doubt
For my welfare and benefit in this life
and happiness in the next
And I ask you to grant the opportunity
to ask whatever I desire
Then the Buddha thought
Brahmāyu sees all the marks except for two
which he has doubts about
whether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongue
So the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Brahmāyu would see his retracted private parts
And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils and covered his entire forehead with his tongue
Then the Buddha replied to Brahmāyu in verse
The thirtytwo marks of a great man
that you have learned
are all found on my body
so do not doubt brahmin
I have known what should be known
and developed what should be developed
and given up what should be given up
and so brahmin I am a Buddha
For your welfare and benefit in this life
and happiness in the next
I grant you the opportunity
to ask whatever you desire
Then Brahmāyu thought
My request has been granted
Should I ask him about
what is beneficial in this life or the next
Then he thought
Im well versed in the benefits that apply to this life
and others ask me about this
Why dont I ask the ascetic Gotama about the benefit that specifically applies to lives to come
So Brahmāyu addressed the Buddha in verse
How do you become a brahmin
And how do you become a knowledge master
How a master of the three knowledges
And how is one called a scholar
How do you become a perfected one
And how a consummate one
How do you become a sage
And how is one declared to be awakened
Then the Buddha replied to Brahmāyu in verse
One who knows their past lives
and sees heaven and places of loss
and has attained the end of rebirth
that sage has perfect insight
They know their mind is pure
completely freed from greed
theyve given up birth and death
and have completed the spiritual journey
Gone beyond all things
such a one is declared to be awakened
When he said this Brahmāyu got up from his seat and arranged his robe on one shoulder He bowed with his head to the Buddhas feet caressing them and covering them with kisses and pronounced his name
I am the brahmin Brahmāyu Master Gotama
I am the brahmin Brahmāyu
Then that assembly their minds full of wonder and amazement thought
Its incredible its amazing
that Brahmāyu who is so wellknown and famous should show the Buddha such utmost devotion
Then the Buddha said to Brahmāyu
Enough brahmin Get up and sit in your own seat since your mind has such confidence in me
So Brahmāyu got up and sat in his own seat
Then the Buddha taught him step by step with
a talk on giving ethical conduct and heaven
He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures so sordid and corrupt and the benefit of renunciation
And when the Buddha knew that Brahmāyus mind was ready pliable rid of hindrances joyful and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas
suffering its origin its cessation and the path
Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye
in that very seat the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin Brahmāyu
Everything that has a beginning has an end
Then Brahmāyu saw attained understood and fathomed the Dhamma He went beyond doubt got rid of indecision and became selfassured and independent of others regarding the Teachers instructions He said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Would you and the mendicant Saṅgha please accept a meal from me tomorrow
The Buddha consented in silence
Then knowing that the Buddha had consented Brahmāyu got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leaving
And when the night had passed Brahmāyu had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home Then he had the Buddha informed of the time saying
Its time Master Gotama the meal is ready
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of the brahmin Brahmāyu where he sat on the seat spread out together with the Saṅgha of mendicants
For seven days Brahmāyu served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods
When the seven days had passed the Buddha departed to wander in the Videhan lands
Not long after the Buddha left Brahmāyu passed away
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir Brahmāyu has passed away
Where has he been reborn in his next life
Mendicants the brahmin Brahmāyu was astute He practiced in line with the teachings and did not trouble me about the teachings
With the ending of the five lower fetters hes been reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there not liable to return from that world
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said

With Prince Abhaya
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Then Prince Abhaya went up to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta bowed and sat down to one side
Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said to him
Come prince refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine
Then you will get a good reputation
Prince Abhaya refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama so mighty and powerful
But sir how am I to do this
Here prince go to the ascetic Gotama and say to him
Sir might the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by others
When hes asked this if he answers
He might prince say this to him
Then sir what exactly is the difference between you and an ordinary person
For even an ordinary person might utter speech that is disliked by others
But if he answers
He would not prince say this to him
Then sir why exactly did you declare of Devadatta
Devadatta is going to a place of loss to hell there to remain for an eon irredeemable
Devadatta was angry and upset with what you said
When you put this dilemma to him the Buddha wont be able to either spit it out or swallow it down
Hell be like a man with an iron cross stuck in his throat unable to either spit it out or swallow it down
Yes sir replied Abhaya He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta keeping him on his right Then he went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
Then he looked up at the sun and thought
Its too late to refute the Buddhas doctrine today
I shall refute his doctrine in my own home tomorrow He said to the Buddha
Sir may the Buddha please accept tomorrows meal from me together with three other monks
The Buddha consented in silence
Then knowing that the Buddha had consented Abhaya got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leaving
Then when the night had passed the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to Abhayas home and sat down on the seat spread out
Then Abhaya served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods
When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Abhaya took a low seat sat to one side
and said to him
Sir might the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by others
This is no simple matter prince
Then the Jains have lost in this sir
But prince why do you say that
the Jains have lost in this
Then Abhaya told the Buddha all that had happened
Now at that time a little baby boy was sitting in Prince Abhayas lap
Then the Buddha said to Abhaya
What do you think prince
Ifbecause of your negligence or his nurses negligenceyour boy was to put a stick or stone in his mouth what would you do to him
Id try to take it out sir
If that didnt work Id hold his head with my left hand and take it out using a hooked finger of my right hand even if it drew blood
Why is that
Because I have compassion for the boy sir
In the same way prince the Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue false and harmful and which is disliked by others
The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be true and substantive but which is harmful and disliked by others
The Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what he knows to be true substantive and beneficial but which is disliked by others
The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue false and harmful but which is liked by others
The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be true and substantive but which is harmful even if it is liked by others
The Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what he knows to be true substantive and beneficial and which is liked by others
Why is that
Because the Realized One has compassion for sentient beings
Sir there are clever aristocrats brahmins householders or ascetics who come to see you with a question already planned
Do you think beforehand that if they ask you like this youll answer like that or does the answer just appear to you on the spot
Well then prince Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think prince
Are you skilled in the various parts of a chariot
I am sir
What do you think prince
When they come to you and ask
Whats the name of this chariot part
Do you think beforehand that if they ask you like this youll answer like that or does the answer appear to you on the spot
Sir Im wellknown as a charioteer skilled in a chariots parts
All the parts are wellknown to me
The answer just appears to me on the spot
In the same way when clever aristocrats brahmins householders or ascetics come to see me with a question already planned the answer just appears to me on the spot
Why is that
Because the Realized One has clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings so that the answer just appears to him on the spot
When he had spoken Prince Abhaya said to the Buddha
Excellent sir Excellent 
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life

Jungle Thickets
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants I will teach you an exposition about jungle thickets
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants take the case of a mendicant who lives close by a jungle thicket
As they do so their mindfulness does not become established their mind does not become immersed in samādhi their defilements do not come to an end and they do not arrive at the supreme sanctuary
And the necessities of life that a renunciate requiresrobes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sickare hard to come by
That mendicant should reflect

At Madhurā
So I have heard
At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying near Madhurā in Gundas Grove
King Avantiputta of Madhurā heard
It seems the ascetic Kaccāna is staying near Madhurā in Gundas Grove
He has this good reputation
He is astute competent clever learned a brilliant speaker eloquent mature a perfected one
Its good to see such perfected ones
And then King Avantiputta had the finest carriages harnessed He mounted a fine carriage and along with other fine carriages set out in full royal pomp from Madhurā to see Mahākaccāna
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached Mahākaccāna on foot
They exchanged greetings and when the greetings and polite conversation were over the king sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna
Master Kaccāna the brahmins say
Only brahmins are the highest caste other castes are inferior
Only brahmins are the light caste other castes are dark
Only brahmins are purified not others
Only brahmins are Brahmās rightful sons born of his mouth born of Brahmā created by Brahmā heirs of Brahmā
What does Master Kaccāna have to say about this
Great king thats just propaganda
And heres a way to understand that its just propaganda
What do you think great king
Suppose an aristocrat prospers in money grain silver or gold Wouldnt there be aristocrats brahmins merchants and workers who would get up before him and go to bed after him and be obliging behaving nicely and speaking politely

Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was sick suffering gravely ill
Then he addressed a man
Please mister go to the Buddha and in my name bow with your head to his feet Say to him
Sir the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is sick suffering gravely ill
He bows with his head to your feet
Then go to Venerable Sāriputta and in my name bow with your head to his feet Say to him

He bows with his head to your feet
And then say
Sir please visit him at his home out of compassion
Yes sir that man replied
He did as Anāthapiṇḍika asked
Sāriputta consented in silence
Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went with Venerable nanda as his second monk to Anāthapiṇḍikas home
He sat down on the seat spread out and said to Anāthapiṇḍika
Householder I hope youre keeping well I hope youre alright And I hope the pain is fading not growing that its fading is evident not its growing
Im not keeping well Master Sāriputta Im not alright
The pain is terrible and growing not fading its growing not its fading is evident
The winds piercing my head are so severe it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point
The pain in my head is so severe it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head
The winds piercing my belly are so severe it feels like a deft butcher or their apprentice is slicing my belly open with a meat cleaver
The burning in my body is so severe it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals Thats how severe the burning is in my body

When he said this Anāthapiṇḍika cried and burst out in tears
Venerable nanda said to him
Are you failing householder Are you fading householder
But for a long time I have paid homage to the Buddha and the esteemed mendicants
Yet I have never before heard such a Dhamma talk
Householder it does not occur to us to teach such a Dhamma talk to whiteclothed laypeople
Rather we teach like this to those gone forth
Well then Master Sāriputta let it occur to you to teach such a Dhamma talk to whiteclothed laypeople as well
There are gentlemen with little dust in their eyes Theyre in decline because they havent heard the teaching
There will be those who understand the teaching
And when the venerables Sāriputta and nanda had given the householder Anāthapiṇḍika this advice they got up from their seat and left
Not long after they had left Anāthapiṇḍika passed away and was reborn in the host of Joyful Gods
Then late at night the glorious god Anāthapiṇḍika lighting up the entire Jetas Grove went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one side
and addressed the Buddha in verse
This is indeed that Jetas Grove
frequented by the Saṅgha of hermits
where the King of Dhamma stayed
it brings me joy
Deeds knowledge and principle
ethical conduct an excellent livelihood
by these are mortals purified
not by clan or wealth
Thats why an astute person
seeing whats good for themselves
would examine the teaching rationally
and thus be purified in it
Sāriputta has true wisdom
ethics and also peace
Any mendicant who has crossed over
can at best equal him
This is what the god Anāthapiṇḍika said
and the teacher approved
Then the god Anāthapiṇḍika
knowing that the teacher approved bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before vanishing right there
Then when the night had passed the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened
When he had spoken Venerable nanda said to the Buddha
Sir that god must surely have been Anāthapiṇḍika
For the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was devoted to Venerable Sāriputta
Good good nanda
Youve reached the logical conclusion as far as logic goes
For that was indeed the god Anāthapiṇḍika
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants a trapper doesnt cast bait for deer thinking
May the deer enjoying this bait be healthy and in good condition May they live long and prosper
A trapper casts bait for deer thinking
When these deer intrude on where I cast the bait theyll recklessly enjoy eating it Theyll become indulgent then theyll become negligent and then theyll be vulnerable on account of this bait
And indeed the first herd of deer intruded on where the trapper cast the bait and recklessly enjoyed eating it They became indulgent then they became negligent and then they were vulnerable to the trapper on account of that bait
And thats how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the trappers power
So then a second herd of deer thought up a plan
The first herd of deer became indulgent 
and failed to get free of the trappers power
Why dont we avoid eating the bait altogether Avoiding dangerous food we can venture deep into a wilderness region and live there
And thats just what they did
But when it came to the last month of summer the grass and water ran out Their bodies became much too thin
and they lost their strength and energy
So they went back to that same place where the trapper had cast bait
Intruding on that place they recklessly enjoyed eating it 
And thats how the second herd failed to get free from the trappers power
So then a third herd of deer thought up a plan
The first 
and second herds of deer 
failed to get free of the trappers power
Why dont we set up our lair close by the place where the trapper has cast the bait
Then we can intrude on it and enjoy eating without being reckless We wont become indulgent then we wont become negligent and then we wont be vulnerable to the trapper on account of that bait
And thats just what they did
So the trapper and his companions thought
Wow this third herd of deer is so sneaky and devious they must be some kind of unnatural spirits with psychic power
For they eat the bait weve cast without us knowing how they come and go
Why dont we surround the bait on all sides by staking out high nets Hopefully we might get to see their lair where they go to hide out
