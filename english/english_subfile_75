Perfect Sambuddha with unsurpassed complete awakeningTo me knowledge and insight aroseSure is my liberation of mindthis is my last birthnow there is no continuation of existenceThe Fortunate One said thisand the groupoffive monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Fortunate OneMoreover as this sermon was being given to the venerable Koṇḍaññathe dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma aroseWhatever has the nature of arisingall that has the nature of ceasingNow when the Dhamma Wheel was set rolling by the Fortunate Onethe Earth godsthe unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate Oneand it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇaor by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the worldHaving heard the cry of the Earth

tenthousand worldelement moved wavered and shookand great and measureless light became manifest in the worldtranscending the godly power of the godsThen the Fortunate One uttered this inspired utteranceKoṇḍañña surely knowsKoṇḍañña surely knowsThus to the venerable Koṇḍaññacame the name Aññā Koṇḍañña Koṇḍañña hewhoknowsThen the young man Yasas mother having ascended the palaceand not findingand after approaching the merchant householder she said thisYour son Yasa householder cannot be foundThen the merchant householder after sending scouts on horses to the four directionshimself approached the Deer Park at IsipatanaThe merchant householder saw the castoff golden sandalsand after seeing them he went after himThe Fortunate One saw the merchant householder coming while still far awayand after seeing him this occurred to the Fortunate OneNow what if I were to so arrange it with my psychic powersthat while the merchant householder is sitting herehe could not see the young man Yasa sitting hereThen the Fortunate One so arranged it with his psychic powersThen the merchant householder approached the Fortunate Oneand after approaching he said this to the Fortunate OneHas the Fortunate One venerable Sir seen the young man YasaSit householder and it may be that while you are sitting hereyou will see the young man Yasa sitting hereThen the merchant householder thought It seems that while sitting hereI will see the young man Yasa sitting hereand joyful uplifted after worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one sideTo the merchant householder sitting at one sidethe Fortunate One spoke about the gradual teachingthat is to say talk about giving talk about virtue talk about heaventhe danger degradation and defilement of sensual desiresand the advantages of

Dhammaunderstood the Dhamma penetrated the Dhamma crossed over uncertainty being without doubtshaving attained full confidence having become independent of others in the Teachers teaching said this to the Fortunate OneExcellent venerable Sir Excellent venerable SirJust as venerable Sir one might set upright what has been overturnedor open up what has been closed or show a path to one who is lostor

refugeand to the Dhamma and to the Community of monksPlease bear it in mind Fortunate One that I am a lay followerwho has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I have the breath of lifeand he became the first lay disciple in the world with the threerefuge formulaThen while Dhamma was being taught to the young man Yasas fatheras Yasa was reflecting on the stage he had reached just as it was seen as it was understoodhis mind was liberated from the pollutants without attachmentThen this occurred to the Fortunate OneWhile Dhamma was being taught to the young man Yasas fatheras Yasa was reflecting on the stage he had reached just as it was seen as it was understoodhis mind was liberated from the pollutants without attachmentIt is impossible that the young man Yasa could go back to enjoying the low life of sensual pleasuresin the way he formerly did when he was at homeNow what if I were to allay my psychic powersThen the Fortunate One allayed his psychic powersThen the merchant householder saw the young man Yasa sitting thereand after seeing him he said this to the young man YasaYour Mother dear Yasa is taken up with lamenting and grieving give life to your MotherThen the young man Yasa looked up at the Fortunate OneThen the Fortunate One said this to the merchant householderWhat do you think of this householderfor the young man Yasa with a trainees knowledge with a trainees insightwho saw the Dhamma just as you havebut as he was reflecting on the stage he had reached just as it was seen as it was understoodhis mind was liberated from the pollutants without

a gain for the young man Yasa venerable Sir it is a great gain venerable Sir for the young man Yasathat the young man Yasas mind is liberated from the pollutants without attachmentMay the Fortunate One venerable Sir consent to me offering him a meal today together withthe young man Yasa as the ascetic who attends on himThe Fortunate One consented by maintaining silenceThen the merchant householder having understood the Fortunate Ones consenthaving worshipped and circumambulated the Fortunate One went awayThen the young man Yasa not long after the merchant householder had gone awaysaid this to the Fortunate OneMay I receive the goingforth venerable Sir in the presence of the Fortunate Onemay I receive the full ordinationCome monk said the Fortunate One the Dhamma has been wellproclaimedlive the spiritual life for the complete ending of sufferingThat was this venerable ones full ordinationand at that time there were seven Worthy Ones in the worldThen the Fortunate One addressed the groupoffive monks sayingBodily form monks is not Selffor if this bodily form monks were Selfthis bodily form would not lead to affliction and regarding bodily form it might be possible to sayLet my bodily form be thus let my bodily form be not thusBut because bodily form monks is not Selftherefore bodily form does lead to affliction and regarding bodily form it is not possible to

such is liberationDestroyed is rebirthaccomplished is the spiritual lifedone is what ought to be donethere is no more of this mundane state  this he knowsMoreover as this sermon was being giventhose one thousand monks minds were liberated from the pollutants without attachmentThen with the passing of seven days the Fortunate Oneafter arising from that concentrationapproached the Royal treeand after approaching the root of the Royal treehe sat in one crosslegged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of liberationThen at that time the merchants Tapussa and Ballikawere in that district travelling along the highway from UkkalāThen a god who had formerly been a blood relativesaid this to the merchants Tapussa and BhallikaThe Fortunate One Sirs is dwelling at the root of the Royal tree in the first period after the complete and perfect AwakeningGo and wait upon the Fortunate One with milkrice and honeyballsand for a long timeThen the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika having taken milkrice and honeyballsapproached the Fortunate Oneand after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One they stood at one sideWhile standing on one side the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika said this to the Fortunate OnePlease accept our milkrice and honeyballs venerable Sir Fortunate Onethat for a long time will be for our benefit and happinessThen it occurred to the Fortunate OneRealised Onesnow how can I accept the milkrice and honeyballsThen the gods called the Four Great Kings knowing with their minds the reflection in the mind of the Fortunate Onebrought from the four directions four bowls made of green stonePlease accept venerable Sir Fortunate One the milkrice and honeyballs here in the bowlsThe Fortunate One accepted in the new bowlthe milkrice and honeyballs

mind that we are lay disciples who have gone for refuge from today forward for as long as we have the breath of lifeand they became the first lay disciples in the world with the tworefuge formulaThen with the passing of seven days the Fortunate Oneafter arising from that concentrationapproached the Goatherds Banyan tree from the root of the Royal treeand there the Fortunate One dwelt at the root of the Goatherds Banyan treeThen when the Fortunate One had gone into solitude into seclusionthis reflection arose in his mindThis Dhamma I have attained is deep hard to see hard to understandpeaceful excellent beyond the sphere of logic profound understandable only to the wiseBut this generation delights in desireand for a generation delighting in desire devoted to desire gladdened by desirethis thing is hard to see that is to say conditionality and conditional originationThis thing also is very hard to see that is to saythe tranquilising of all processes the letting go of all bases for cleavingthe end of craving dispassion cessation EmancipationBut if I were to teach the Dhamma and others did not understand methat would be tiring for me that would be troublesome to meFurther these truly wonderful versesNow is it suitableFor those overcome by passion and hatred this Dhamma is not easily understoodGoing against the streamThose delighting in passionSuch was the Fortunate Ones reflectionand his mind inclined to inactionThen to Brahmā Sahampatiknowing with his mind the reflection in the mind of the Fortunate One this thought occurredThe world is surely going to destruction the world is surely going to complete destructionwherever the Realised One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddhasmind inclines to inaction not to teaching the DhammaThen Brahmā Sahampati just as a strong manmight stretch out a bent arm or bend in an outstretched armso did he vanish from the Brahmā world and appear in front of the Fortunate OneThen Brahmā Sahampati after arranging his upper robe

venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate OneI have seen reverend Sir the Fortunate One comfortableI have seen reverend Sir the Fortunate One bearing up while sickand my body reverend Sir became faint as it wereand although I could not see straight and things were not clearit appeared to me reverend Sir that the Fortunate One was sickbut it was some small comfort that the Fortunate One would not attain Final Emancipationuntil the Fortunate One had spoken regarding the Community of monksBut what nanda does the Community of monks expect of meThe Teaching has been taught by me nanda without having made a distinction between esoteric and exotericfor the Realised One there is nothing nanda of a closed teachers fist in regard to the TeachingTo whoever nanda this thought occurs I will lead the Community of monksor I am the instructer of the Community of monkslet him speak nanda regarding the Community of monksBut to the Realised One nanda this thought does not occurI will lead the Community of monksor I am the instructor of the Community of monksThen why nanda should the Realised One speak regarding the Community of monksI nanda at present am old elderly of great agefar gone advanced in years I am eighty years oldIt is like nanda an old cart which only keeps going when shored up with bamboojust so nanda I think the Realised Ones body only keeps going when shored up with bambooWhen the Realised One doesnt pay attention nanda to any of the signswhen all feelings have ceased he lives having established the signless mindconcentrationand at that time nanda the Realised Ones body is most comfortableTherefore nanda live with yourself as an island yourself as a refuge with no other refugewith the Teaching as an island the Teaching as a refuge with no other refugeAnd how nanda does a monk live with himself as an island himself as a refuge with no other refugewith the Teaching as an island the Teaching as a refuge with no other refugeHere nanda a monk dwells contemplating the nature of the body in the bodyardent fully aware and mindful after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the worldhe dwells contemplating the nature of feelings in feelingsardent fully aware and mindful after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the worldhe dwells contemplating the nature of the mind in the mindardent fully aware and mindful after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the worldhe dwells contemplating the nature of things in various thingsardent fully aware and mindful after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the worldThus nanda a monk lives with himself as an island himself as a refuge with no other refugewith the Teaching as an island the Teaching as a refuge with no other refugeFor whoever nanda whether at present or after my passinglives with himself as an island himself as a refuge with no other refugewith the Teaching as an island the Teaching as a refuge with no other refugethose monks of mine nanda will go from darkness to the

by the Realised OneNot long now there will be the Realised Ones Final Emancipationafter the passing of three months the Realised One will attain Final EmancipationThe Realised One cannot for the sake of life go back on that it is not possibleMiddle DiscoursesTwo Kinds of ThoughtSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants before my awakeningwhen I was still unawakened but intent on awakeningI thoughtWhy dont I meditate by continually dividing my thoughts into two classesSo I assigned sensual malicious and cruel thoughtsto one classAnd I assigned thoughts of renunciation good will and harmlessnessto the second classThen as I meditateddiligent keen and resolutea sensual thought aroseI understoodThis sensual thought has arisen in meIt leads to hurting myself hurting others and hurting both It blocks wisdom its on the side of anguish and it doesnt lead to extinguishmentWhen I reflected that it leads to hurting myself it went awayWhen I reflected that it leads to hurting others it went awayWhen I reflected that it leads to hurting both it went awayWhen I reflected that it blocks wisdom its on the side of anguish and it doesnt lead to extinguishment it went awaySo I gave up got rid of and eliminated any sensual thoughts that aroseThen as I meditateddiligent keen and resolutea malicious thought arose a cruel thought aroseI understoodThis cruel thought has arisen in meIt leads to hurting myself hurting others and hurting both It blocks wisdom its on the side of anguish and it doesnt lead to extinguishmentWhen I reflected that it leads to hurting myself hurting others hurting both it went awayWhen I reflected that it blocks wisdom its on the side of anguish and it doesnt lead to extinguishment it went awaySo I gave up got rid of and eliminated any cruel thoughts that aroseWhatever a mendicant frequently thinks about and considers becomes their hearts inclinationIf they often think about and consider sensual thoughts theyve given up the thought of renunciation to cultivate sensual thought Their mind inclines to sensual thoughtsIf they often think about and consider malicious thoughts  their mind inclines to malicious thoughtsIf they often think about and consider cruel thoughts  their mind inclines to cruel thoughtsSuppose its the last month of the rainy season when the crops grow closely together and a cowherd must take care of the cattleHed tap and poke them with his staff on this side and that to keep them in checkWhy is thatFor he sees that if they wander into the crops he could be executed imprisoned fined or condemnedIn the same way I saw that unskillful qualities have the drawbacks of sordidness and corruption and that skillful qualities have the benefit and cleansing power of renunciationThen as I meditateddiligent keen and resolutea thought of renunciation aroseI understoodThis thought of renunciation has arisen in meIt doesnt lead to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both It nourishes wisdom its on the side of freedom from anguish and it leads to extinguishmentIf I were to keep on thinking and considering this all night all night and day I see no danger that would come from thatStill thinking and considering for too long would tire my bodyAnd when the body is tired the mind is stressedAnd when the mind is stressed its far from immersionSo I stilled settled unified and immersed my mind internallyWhy is thatSo that my mind would not be stressedThen as I meditateddiligent keen and resolutea thought of good will arose a thought of harmlessness aroseI understoodThis thought of harmlessness has arisen in meIt doesnt lead to hurting myself hurting others or hurting both It nourishes wisdom its on the side of freedom from anguish and it leads to extinguishmentIf I were to keep on thinking and considering this all night all night and day I see no danger that would come from thatStill thinking and considering for too long would tire my bodyAnd when the body is tired the mind is stressedAnd when the mind is stressed its far from immersionSo I stilled settled unified and immersed my mind internallyWhy is thatSo that my mind would not be stressedWhatever a mendicant frequently thinks about and considers becomes their hearts inclinationIf they often think about and consider thoughts of renunciation theyve given up sensual thought to cultivate the thought of renunciation Their mind inclines to thoughts of renunciationIf they often think about and consider thoughts of good will  their mind inclines to thoughts of good willIf they often think about and consider thoughts of harmlessness  their mind inclines to thoughts of harmlessnessSuppose its the last month of summer when all the crops have been gathered into the neighborhood of a village and a cowherd must take care of the cattle While at the root of a tree or in the open he need only be mindful thatthe cattle are thereIn the same way I needed only to be mindful thatthose things were thereMy energy was roused up and unflagging my mindfulness was established and lucid my body was tranquil and undisturbed and my mind was immersed in samādhiQuite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedAs the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled I entered and remained in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedAnd with the fading away of rapture I entered and remained in the third absorption where I meditated with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissWith the giving up of pleasure and pain and the ending of former happiness and sadness I entered and remained in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessWhen my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward recollection of past livesI recollected many kinds of past lives with features and detailsThis was the first knowledge which I achieved in the first watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteWhen my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThis was the second knowledge which I achieved in the middle watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteWhen my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsI truly understood This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingI truly understood These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceI understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThis was the third knowledge which I achieved in the last watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteSuppose that in a forested wilderness there was an expanse of lowlying marshesand a large herd of deer lived nearbyThen along comes a person who wants to harm injure and threaten themThey close off the safe secure path that leads to happiness and open the wrong path There they plant domesticated male and female deer as decoysso that in due course that herd of deer would fall to ruin and disasterThen along comes a person who wants to help keep the herd of deer safeThey open up the safe secure path that leads to happiness and close off the wrong path They get rid of the decoysso that in due course that herd of deer would grow increase and matureIve made up this simile to make a pointAnd this is what it meansAn expanse of lowlying marshes is a term for sensual pleasuresA large herd of deer is a term for sentient beingsA person who wants to harm injure and threaten them is a term for Māra the WickedThe wrong path is a term for the wrong eightfold path that iswrong view wrong thought wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong immersionA domesticated male deer is a term for greed and relishingA domesticated female deer is a term for ignoranceA person who wants to help keep the herd of deer safe is a term for the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaThe safe secure path that leads to happiness is a term for the noble eightfold path that isright view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersionSo mendicants I have opened up the safe secure path to happiness and closed off the wrong path And I have got rid of the male and female decoysOut of compassion Ive done what a teacher should do who wants whats best for their disciplesHere are these roots of trees and here are these empty hutsPractice absorption mendicants Dont be negligent Dont regret it later This is my instruction to youThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Shorter Discourse With MāluṅkyaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen as Venerable Māluṅkya was in private retreat this thought came to his mindThere are several convictions that the Buddha has left undeclared he has set them aside and refused to comment on themFor example the cosmos is eternal or not eternal or finite or infinite the soul and the body are the same thing or they are different things after death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt existThe Buddha does not give me a straight answer on these pointsI dont like that and do not accept itIll go to him and ask him about thisIf he gives me a straight answer on any of these pointsI will lead the spiritual life under himIf he does not give me a straight answer on any of these pointsI shall resign the training and return to a lesser lifeThen in the late afternoon Māluṅkya came out of retreat and went to the BuddhaHe bowed sat down to one side and told the Buddha of his thoughts He then continuedIf the Buddha knowsthat the cosmos is eternal please tell meIf you knowthat the cosmos is not eternal tell meIf you dont knowwhether the cosmos is eternal or not then it is straightforward to simply sayI neither know nor seeIf you knowthat the world is finite or infinite that the soul and the body are the same thing or they are different things that after death a Realized One exists or doesnt exist or both exists and doesnt exist or neither exists nor doesnt exist please tell meIf you dont knowany of these things then it is straightforward to simply sayI neither know nor seeWhat Māluṅkyaputta did I ever say to youCome Māluṅkyaputta lead the spiritual life under me and I will declare these things to youNo sirOr did you ever say to meSir I will lead the spiritual life under the Buddha and the Buddha will declare these things to meNo sirSo it seems that I did not say to youCome Māluṅkyaputta lead the spiritual life under me and I will declare these things to youAnd you never said to meSir I will lead the spiritual life under the Buddha and the Buddha will declare these things to meIn that case you silly man are you really in a position to be abandoning anythingSuppose someone were to say thisI will not lead the spiritual life under the Buddha until the Buddha declares to methat the cosmos is eternal or that the cosmos is not eternal or that after death a Realized One neither exists nor doesnt existThat would still remain undeclared by the Realized One and meanwhile that person would dieSuppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poisonHis friends and colleagues relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat himBut the man would sayI wont pull out this arrow as long as I dont know whether the man who wounded me was an aristocrat a brahmin a merchant or a workerI wont pull out this arrow as long as I dont know the following things about the man who wounded me his name and clanwhether hes tall short or mediumwhether his skin is black brown or tawnyand what village town or city he comes fromI wont pull out this arrow as long as I dont know whether the bow that wounded me is made of wood or canewhether the bowstring is made of swallowwort fibre sunn hemp fibre sinew sanseveria fibre or spurge fibrewhether the shaft is made from a bush or a plantation treewhether the shaft was fitted with feathers from a vulture a heron a hawk a peacock or a storkwhether the shaft was bound with sinews of a cow a buffalo a swamp deer or a gibbonand whether the arrowhead was spiked razortipped barbed made of iron or a calfs tooth or lancetshapedThat man would still not have learned these things and meanwhile theyd dieIn the same way suppose someone was to sayI will not lead the spiritual life under the Buddha until the Buddha declares to methat the cosmos is eternal or that the cosmos is not eternal or that after death a Realized One neither exists nor doesnt existThat would still remain undeclared by the Realized One and meanwhile that person would dieIts not true that if there were the view the cosmos is eternal there would be the living of the spiritual lifeIts not true that if there were the view the cosmos is not eternal there would be the living of the spiritual lifeWhen there is the view that the cosmos is eternal or that the cosmos is not eternal there is rebirth there is old age there is death and there is sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressAnd it is the defeat of these things in this very life that I advocateIts not true that if there were the view the world is finite the world is infinite the soul and the body are the same thing the soul and the body are different things a Realized One exists after death a Realized One doesnt exist after death a Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after death a Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after death there would be the living of the spiritual lifeWhen there are any of these views there is rebirth there is old age there is death and there is sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressAnd it is the defeat of these things in this very life that I advocateSo Māluṅkyaputta you should remember what I have not declared as undeclaredand what I have declared as declaredAnd what have I not declaredI have not declared the following the cosmos is eternalthe cosmos is not eternalthe world is finitethe world is infinitethe soul and the body are the same thingthe soul and the body are different thingsa Realized One exists after deatha Realized One doesnt exist after deatha Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after deatha Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after deathAnd why havent I declared these thingsBecause they arent beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life They dont lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentThats why I havent declared themAnd what have I declaredI have declared the following this is sufferingthis is the origin of sufferingthis is the cessation of sufferingthis is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingAnd why have I declared these thingsBecause they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life They lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishmentThats why I have declared themSo Māluṅkyaputta you should remember what I have not declared as undeclaredand what I have declared as declaredThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable Māluṅkyaputta was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Analysis of Religious DonationsSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree MonasteryThen Mahāpajāpati Gotamī approached the Buddha bringing a new pair of garmentsShe bowed sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaSir I have spun and woven this new pair of garments specially for the BuddhaMay the Buddha please accept this from me out of compassionWhen she said this the Buddha said to herGive it to the Saṅgha GotamīWhen you give to the Saṅgha both the Saṅgha and I will be honoredFor a second time For a third time Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the BuddhaSir I have spun and woven this new pair of garments specially for the BuddhaMay the Buddha please accept this from me out of compassionAnd for a third time the Buddha said to herGive it to the Saṅgha GotamīWhen you give to the Saṅgha both the Saṅgha and I will be honoredWhen he said this Venerable nanda said to the BuddhaSir please accept the new pair of garments from Mahāpajāpatī GotamīSir Mahāpajāpatī was very helpful to the Buddha As his aunt she raised him nurtured him and gave him her milkWhen the Buddhas birth mother passed away she nurtured him at her own breastAnd the Buddha has been very helpful to MahāpajāpatīIt is owing to the Buddha that Mahāpajāpatī has gone for refuge to the Buddha the teaching and the SaṅghaIts owing to the Buddha that she refrains from killing living creatures stealing committing sexual misconduct lying and taking alcoholic drinks that cause negligenceIts owing to the Buddha that she has experiential confidence in the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha and has the ethics loved by the noble onesIts owing to the Buddha that she is free of doubt regarding suffering its origin its cessation and the practice that leads to its cessationThe Buddha has been very helpful to MahāpajāpatīThats so true nandaWhen someone has enabled you to go for refuge its not easy to repay themby bowing down to them rising up for them greeting them with joined palms and observing proper etiquette for them or by providing them with robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sickWhen someone has enabled you to refrain from

more fruitful than one bestowed on a Saṅghananda there are these four ways of purifying a religious donationWhat fourTheres a religious donation thats purified by the giver not the recipientTheres a religious donation thats purified by the recipient not the giverTheres a religious donation thats purified by neither the giver nor the recipientTheres a religious donation thats purified by both the

a religious donation purified by the recipient not the giverIts when the giver is unethical of bad character but the recipient is ethical of good characterAnd how is a religious donation purified by neither the giver nor the recipientIts when both the giver and the recipient are unethical of bad characterAnd how is a religious donation purified by both the giver and the recipientIts when both the giver and the recipient are ethical of good characterThese are the four ways of purifying a religious donationThat is what the Buddha saidThen the Holy One the Teacher went on to sayWhen an ethical person with trusting heartgives a proper gift to unethical personstrusting in the ample fruit of deedsthat offering is purified by the giverWhen an unethical and untrusting persongives an improper gift to ethical personsnot trusting in the ample fruit of deedsthat offering is purified by the receiversWhen an unethical and untrusting persongives an improper gift to unethical personsnot trusting in the ample fruit of deedsI declare that gift is not very fruitfulWhen an ethical person with trusting heartgives a proper gift to ethical personstrusting in the ample fruit of deedsI declare that gift is abundantly fruitfulBut when a passionless one gives to the passionlessa proper gift with trusting hearttrusting in the ample fruit of deedsthats truly the best of material giftsMiddle DiscoursesThe Longer Discourse With VacchagottaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding groundThen the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaFor a long time I have had discussions with Master GotamaPlease teach me in brief what is skillful and what is unskillfulVaccha I can teach you what is skillful and what is unskillful in brief or in detailStill let me do so in briefListen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir Vaccha repliedThe Buddha said thisGreed is unskillful contentment is skillfulHate is unskillful love is skillfulDelusion is unskillful understanding is skillfulSo there are these three unskillful things and three that are skillfulKilling living creatures stealing and sexual misconduct speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical covetousness ill will and wrong view these things are unskillfulRefraining from killing living creatures stealing and sexual misconduct refraining from speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical contentment kindheartedness and right view these things are skillfulSo there are these ten unskillful things and ten that are skillfulWhen a mendicant has given up craving so it is cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated and unable to arise in the future that mendicant is perfected Theyve ended the defilements completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and are rightly freed through enlightenmentLeaving aside Master Gotamais there even a single monk disciple of Master Gotama who has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilementsThere are not just one hundred such monks who are my disciples Vaccha or two or three or four or five hundred but many more than thatLeaving aside Master Gotama and the monksis there even a single nun disciple of Master Gotama who has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilementsThere are not just one hundred such nuns who

or three or four or five hundred but many more than thatIf Master Gotama was the only one to succeed in this teaching not any monksthen this spiritual path would be incomplete in that respectBut because both Master Gotama and monks have succeeded in this teachingthis spiritual path is complete in that respectIf Master Gotama and the monks were the only ones to succeed in this teaching not any nuns celibate laymen laymen enjoying sensual pleasures celibate laywomen laywomen enjoying sensual pleasuresthen this spiritual path would be incomplete in that respectBut because Master Gotama monks

as the Ganges river slants slopes and inclines towards the ocean and keeps pushing into the ocean in the same way Master Gotamas assemblywith both laypeople and renunciatesslants slopes and inclines towards extinguishment and keeps pushing into extinguishmentExcellent Master Gotama I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaSir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceVaccha if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth the ordination in this teaching and training they must spend four months on probationWhen four months have passed if the mendicants are satisfied theyll give the going forth the ordination into monkhoodHowever I have recognized individual differences in this matterSir if four months probation are required in such a case Ill spend four years on probationWhen four years have passed if the mendicants are satisfied let them give me the going forth the ordination into monkhoodAnd the wanderer Vaccha received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceNot long after his ordination a fortnight later Venerable Vacchagotta went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir Ive reached as far as possible with the knowledge and understanding of a traineePlease teach me furtherWell then Vaccha further develop two things serenity and discernmentWhen you have further developed these two things theyll lead to the penetration of many elementsWhenever you want youll be capable of realizing the following in each and every caseMay I wield the many kinds of psychic power multiplying myself and becoming one again appearing and disappearing going unimpeded through a wall a rampart or a mountain as if through space diving in and out of the earth as if it were water walking on water as if it were earth flying crosslegged through the sky like a bird touching and stroking with my hand the sun and moon so mighty and powerful controlling my body as far as the Brahmā realmWhenever you want youll be capable of realizing the following in each and every caseWith clairaudience that is purified and superhuman may I hear both kinds of sounds human and divine whether near or farWhenever you want youll be capable of realizing the following in each and every caseMay I understand the minds of other beings and individuals having comprehended them with my mindMay I understand mind with greed as mind with greedand mind without greed as mind without greedmind with hate as mind with hateand mind without hate as mind

every caseMay I recollect many kinds of past lives That is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding May I remember There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here May I recollect my many past lives with features and detailsWhenever you want youll be capable of realizing the following in each and every caseWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad placeand understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds These dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mind They spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they chose to act out of that wrong view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place And may I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsWhenever you want youll be capable of realizing the following in each and every caseMay I realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilementsAnd then Venerable Vacchagotta approved and agreed with what the Buddha said He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leavingThen Vacchagotta living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessHe understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceAnd Venerable Vacchagotta became one of the perfectedNow at that time several mendicants were going to see the BuddhaVacchagotta saw them coming off in the distancewent up to them and saidHello venerables where are you goingReverend we are going to see the BuddhaWell then reverends in my name please bow with your head to the Buddhas feet and saySir the mendicant Vacchagotta bows with his head to your feet and saysI have served the Blessed One I have served the Holy OneYes reverend they repliedThen those mendicants went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir the mendicant Vacchagotta bows with his head to your feet and saysI have served the Blessed One I have served the Holy OneIve already comprehended Vacchagottas mind and understood thathe has the three knowledges and is very mighty and powerfulAnd deities also told me about thisThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Many Kinds of FeelingSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen the master builder Pañcakaṅga went up to Venerable Udāyī bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir how many feelings has the Buddha spoken ofMaster builder the Buddha has spoken of three feelingspleasant painful and neutralThe Buddha has spoken of these three feelingsWhen he said this Pañcakaṅga said to UdāyīSir Udāyī the Buddha hasnt spoken of three feelingsHes spoken of two feelingspleasant and painfulThe Buddha said that neutral feeling is included as a peaceful and subtle kind of pleasureFor a second time Udāyī said to PañcakaṅgaThe Buddha hasnt spoken of two feelingshes spoken of threeFor a second time Pañcakaṅga said to UdāyīThe Buddha hasnt spoken of three feelingshes spoken of twoAnd for a third time Udāyī said to PañcakaṅgaThe Buddha hasnt spoken of two feelingshes spoken of threeAnd for a third time Pañcakaṅga said to UdāyīThe Buddha hasnt spoken of three feelingshes spoken of twoBut neither was able to persuade the otherVenerable nanda heard this discussion between Udāyī and PañcakaṅgaThen he went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one sideand informed the Buddha of all they had discussedWhen he had spoken the Buddha said to himnanda the explanation by the mendicant Udāyī which the master builder Pañcakaṅga didnt agree with was quite correct But the explanation by Pañcakaṅga which Udāyī didnt agree with was also quite correctIn one explanation Ive spoken of two feelings In another explanation Ive spoken of three feelings or five six eighteen thirtysix or a hundred and eight feelingsIve explained the teaching in all these different waysThis being so you can expect that those who dont concede approve or agree with what has been well spoken will argue quarrel and fight continually wounding each other with barbed wordsIve explained the teaching in all these different waysThis being so you can expect that those who do concede approve or agree with what has been well spoken will live in harmony appreciating each other without quarreling blending like milk and water and regarding each other with kindly eyesThere are these five kinds of sensual stimulationWhat fiveSights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingSounds known by the ear Smells known by the nose Tastes known by the tongue Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingThese are the five kinds of sensual stimulationThe pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasureThere are those who would say that this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience But I dont grant them thatWhy is thatBecause there is another pleasure that is finer than thatAnd what is that pleasureIts when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis is a pleasure that is finer than thatThere are those who would say that this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience But I dont grant them thatWhy is thatBecause there is another pleasure that is finer than thatAnd what is that pleasureIts when as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected And what is that pleasureIts when with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss And what is that pleasureIts when giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness And what is that pleasureIts when a mendicant going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space And what is that pleasureIts when a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness And what is that pleasureIts when a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness And what is that pleasureIts when a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThis is a pleasure that is finer than thatThere are those who would say that this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience But I dont grant them thatWhy is thatBecause there is another pleasure that is finer than thatAnd what is that pleasureIts when a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feelingThis is a pleasure that is finer than thatIts possible that wanderers who follow other paths might sayThe ascetic Gotama spoke of the cessation of perception and feeling and he includes it in happinessWhats up with thatWhen wanderers who follow other paths say this you should say to themReverends when the Buddha describes whats included in happiness hes not just referring to pleasant feelingThe Realized One describes pleasure as included in happiness wherever its found and in whatever contextThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Ascetic Who Behaved Like a DogSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans where they have a town named HaliddavasanaThen Puṇṇa Koliyaputta who had taken a vow to behave like a cow and Seniya a naked ascetic who had taken a vow to behave like a dog went to see the BuddhaPuṇṇa bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side while Seniya exchanged greetings and polite conversation with him before sitting down to one side curled up like a dogPuṇṇa said to the BuddhaSir this naked dog ascetic Seniya does a hard thing he eats food placed on the groundFor a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a dogWhere will he be reborn in his next lifeEnough Puṇṇa let it be Dont ask me thatFor a second time and a third time Puṇṇa said to the BuddhaSir this naked dog ascetic Seniya does a hard thing he eats food placed on the groundFor a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a dogWhere will he be reborn in his next lifeClearly Puṇṇa Im not getting through to you when I sayEnough Puṇṇa let it be Dont ask me thatNevertheless I will answer youTake someone who develops the dog observance fully and uninterruptedly They develop a dogs ethics a dogs mentality and a dogs behavior fully and uninterruptedlyWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of dogsBut if they have such a viewBy this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life may I become one of the gods This is their wrong viewAn individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places I say hell or the animal realmSo if the dog observance succeeds it leads to rebirth in the company of dogs but if it fails it leads to hellWhen he said this Seniya cried and burst out in tearsThe Buddha said to PuṇṇaThis is what I didnt get through to you when I saidEnough Puṇṇa let it be Dont ask me thatSir Im not crying because of what the Buddha saidBut sir for a long time I have undertaken this observance to behave like a dogSir this Puṇṇa has taken a vow to behave like a cowFor a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a cowWhere will he be reborn in his next lifeEnough Seniya let it be Dont ask me thatFor a second time and a third time Seniya said to the BuddhaSir this Puṇṇa has taken a vow to behave like a cowFor a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a cowWhere will he be reborn in his next lifeClearly Seniya Im not getting through to you when I sayEnough Seniya let it be Dont ask me thatNevertheless I will answer youTake someone who develops the cow observance fully and uninterruptedly They develop a cows ethics a cows mentality and a cows behavior fully and uninterruptedlyWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of cowsBut if they have such a viewBy this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life may I become one of the gods This is their wrong viewAn individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places I say hell or the animal realmSo if the cow observance succeeds it leads to rebirth in the company of cows but if it fails it leads to hellWhen he said this Puṇṇa cried and burst out in tearsThe Buddha said to SeniyaThis is what I didnt get through to you when I saidEnough Seniya let it be Dont ask me thatSir Im not crying because of what the Buddha saidBut sir for a long time I have undertaken this observance to behave like a cowI am quite confident that the Buddhais capable of teaching me so that I can give up this cow observance and the naked ascetic Seniya can give up that dog observanceWell then Puṇṇa listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir he repliedThe Buddha said thisPuṇṇa I declare these four kinds of deeds having realized them with my own insightWhat fourThere are dark deeds with dark resultsbright deeds with bright resultsdark and bright deeds with dark and bright results andneither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results which lead to the ending of deedsAnd what are dark deeds with dark resultsIts when someone makes hurtful choices by way of body speech and mindHaving made these choices theyre reborn in a hurtful worldwhere hurtful contacts touch themTouched by hurtful contacts they experience hurtful feelings that are exclusively painfullike the beings in hellThis is how a being is born from a beingFor your deeds determine your rebirthand when youre reborn contacts affect youThis is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deedsThese are called dark deeds with dark resultsAnd what are bright deeds with bright resultsIts when someone makes pleasing choices by way of body speech and mindHaving made these choices they are reborn in a pleasing worldwhere pleasing contacts touch themTouched by pleasing contacts they experience pleasing feelings that are exclusively happylike the gods replete with gloryThis is how a being is born from a beingFor your deeds determine your rebirthand when youre reborn contacts affect youThis is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deedsThese are called bright deeds with bright resultsAnd what are dark and bright deeds with dark and bright resultsIts when someone makes both hurtful and pleasing choices by way of body speech and mindHaving made these choices they are reborn in a world that is both hurtful and pleasingwhere hurtful and pleasing contacts touch themTouched by both hurtful and pleasing contacts they experience both hurtful and pleasing feelings that are a mixture of pleasure and painlike humans some gods and some beings in the underworldThis is how a being is born from a beingFor what you do brings about your rebirthand when youre reborn contacts affect youThis is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deedsThese are called dark and bright deeds with dark and bright resultsAnd what are neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results which lead to the ending of deedsIts the intention to give up dark deeds with dark results bright deeds with bright results and both dark and bright deeds with both dark and bright resultsThese are called neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results which lead to the ending of deedsThese are the four kinds of deeds that I declare having realized them with my own insightWhen he had spoken Puṇṇa Koliyaputta the observer of cow behavior said to the BuddhaExcellent sir Excellent From this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeAnd Seniya the naked dog ascetic said to the BuddhaExcellent sir Excellent I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaSir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceSeniya if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth the ordination in this teaching and training they must spend four months on probationWhen four months have passed if the mendicants are satisfied theyll give the going forth the ordination into monkhoodHowever I have recognized individual differences in this matterSir if four months probation are required in such a case Ill spend four years on probation When four years have passed if the mendicants are satisfied let them give me the going forth the ordination into monkhoodAnd the naked dog ascetic Seniya received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceNot long after his ordination Venerable Seniya living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessHe understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceAnd Venerable Seniya became one of the perfectedMiddle DiscoursesThe Shorter Discourse With SaccakaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roofNow at that time Saccaka the son of Jain parents was staying in Vesālī He was a debater and clever speaker regarded as holy by many peopleHe was telling a crowd in VesālīIf I was to take them on in debate I dont see any ascetic or brahminleader of an order or a community or the teacher of a community even one who claims to be a perfected one a fully awakened Buddhawho would not shake and rock and tremble sweating from the armpitsEven if I took on an insentient post in debate it would shake and rock and trembleHow much more then a human beingThen Venerable Assaji robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Vesālī for almsAs Saccaka was going for a walk he saw Assaji coming off in the distanceHe approached him and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over Saccaka stood to one side and said to AssajiMaster Assaji how does the ascetic Gotama guide his disciples And how does instruction to his disciples generally proceedAggivessana this is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples and how instruction to his disciples generally proceedsForm feeling perception choices and consciousness are impermanentForm feeling perception choices and consciousness are notselfAll conditions are impermanent All things are notselfThis is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples and how instruction to his disciples generally proceedsIts sad to hear Master Assaji that the ascetic Gotama has such a doctrineHopefully some time or other Ill get to meet Master Gotama and we can have a discussion And hopefully I can dissuade him from this harmful misconceptionNow at that time around five hundred Licchavis were sitting together at the meeting hall on some businessThen Saccaka went up to them and saidCome forth good Licchavīs come forth Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic GotamaIf he stands by the position stated to me by one of his wellknown disciplesa mendicant named AssajiIll take him on in debate and drag him to and fro and round about like a strong man would drag a fleecy sheep to and fro and round aboutTaking him on in debate Ill drag him to and fro and round about like a strong brewers worker would toss a large brewers sieve into a deep lake grab it by the corners and drag it to and fro and round aboutTaking him on in debate Ill shake him down and about and give him a beating like a strong brewers mixer would grab a strainer by the corners and shake it down and about and give it a beatingIll play a game of earwashing with the ascetic Gotama like a sixtyyearold elephant would plunge into a deep lotus pond and play a game of earwashingCome forth good Licchavīs come forth Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic GotamaAt that some of the Licchavis saidHow can the ascetic Gotama refute Saccakas doctrine when it is Saccaka who will refute Gotamas doctrineBut some of the Licchavis saidWho is Saccaka to refute the Buddhas doctrine when it is the Buddha who will refute Saccakas doctrineThen Saccaka escorted by the five hundred Licchavis went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great WoodAt that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open airThen Saccaka went up to them and saidGentlemen where is Master Gotama at presentFor we want to see himAggivessana the Buddha has plunged deep into the Great Wood and is sitting at the root of a tree for the days meditationThen Saccaka together with a large group of Licchavis went to see the Buddha in the Great Wood and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideBefore sitting down to one side some of the Licchavīs bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silentThen Saccaka said to the BuddhaId like to ask Master Gotama about a certain point if youd take the time to answerAsk what you wish AggivessanaHow does the ascetic Gotama guide his disciples And how does instruction to his disciples generally proceedThis is how I guide my disciples and how instruction to my disciples generally proceedsForm feeling perception choices and consciousness are impermanentForm feeling perception choices and consciousness are notselfAll conditions are impermanent All things are notselfThis is how I guide my disciples and how instruction to my disciples generally proceedsA simile strikes me Master GotamaThen speak as you feel inspired said the BuddhaAll the plants and seeds that achieve growth increase and maturity do so depending on the earth and grounded on the earthAll the hard work that gets done depends on the earth and is grounded on the earthIn the same way an individuals self is form Grounded on form they make good and bad choices An individuals self is feeling  perception  choices  consciousness Grounded on consciousness they make good and bad choicesAggivessana are you not saying thisForm is my self feeling is my self perception is my self choices are my self consciousness is my selfIndeed Master Gotama that is what I am sayingAnd this big crowd agrees with meWhat has this big crowd to do with youPlease just explain your own statementThen Master Gotama what I am saying is thisForm is my self feeling is my self perception is my self choices are my self consciousness is my selfWell then Aggivessana Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you likeWhat do you think AggivessanaConsider an anointed aristocratic king such as Pasenadi of Kosala or Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of MagadhaWould they have the power in their own realm to execute fine or banish those who are guiltyAn anointed king would have such power Master GotamaEven federations such as theVajjis and Mallashave such power in their own realmSo of course an anointed king such as Pasenadi or Ajātasattuwould wield such power as is their rightWhat do you think AggivessanaWhen you sayForm is my self do you have power over that form to sayMay my form be like this May it not be like thatWhen he said this Saccaka kept silentThe Buddha asked the question a second timebut Saccaka still kept silentSo the Buddha said to SaccakaAnswer now Aggivessana Now is not the time for silenceIf someone fails to answer a legitimate question when asked three times by the Buddha their head explodes into seven pieces there and thenNow at that time the spirit Vajirapāṇi taking up a burning iron thunderbolt blazing and glowing stood in the sky above Saccaka thinkingIf this Saccaka doesnt answer when asked a third time Ill blow his head into seven pieces there and thenAnd both the Buddha and Saccaka could see VajirapāṇiSaccaka was terrified shocked and awestruck Looking to the Buddha for shelter protection and refuge he saidAsk me Master Gotama I will answerWhat do you think AggivessanaWhen you sayForm is my self do you have power over that form to sayMay my form be like this May it not be like thatNo Master GotamaThink about it AggivessanaYou should think before answeringWhat you said before and what you said after dont match upWhat do you think AggivessanaWhen you sayFeeling is my self do you have power over that feeling to sayMay my feeling be like this May it not be like thatNo Master GotamaThink about it AggivessanaYou should think before answeringWhat you said before and what you said after dont match upWhat do you think AggivessanaWhen you sayPerception is my self do you have power over that perception to sayMay my perception be like this May it not be like thatNo Master GotamaThink about it AggivessanaYou should think before answeringWhat you said before and what you said after dont match upWhat do you think AggivessanaWhen you sayChoices are my self do you have power over those choices to sayMay my choices be like this May they not be like thatNo Master GotamaThink about it AggivessanaYou should think before answeringWhat you said before and what you said after dont match upWhat do you think AggivessanaWhen you sayConsciousness is my self do you have power over that consciousness to sayMay my consciousness be like this May it not be like thatNo Master GotamaThink about it AggivessanaYou should think before answeringWhat you said before and what you said after dont match upWhat do you think AggivessanaIs form permanent or impermanentImpermanentBut if its impermanent is it suffering or happinessSufferingBut if its impermanent suffering and liable to fall apart is it fit to be regarded thusThis is mine I am this this is my selfNo Master GotamaWhat do you think AggivessanaIs feeling perception consciousness permanent or impermanentImpermanentBut if its impermanent is it suffering or happinessSufferingBut if its impermanent suffering and liable to fall apart is it fit to be regarded thusThis is mine I am this this is my selfNo Master GotamaWhat do you think AggivessanaConsider someone who clings holds and attaches to suffering regarding it thus This is mine I am this this is my self Would such a person be able to completely understand suffering themselves or live having wiped out sufferingHow could theyNo Master GotamaWhat do you think AggivessanaThis being so arent you someone who clings holds and attaches to suffering regarding it thus This is mine I am this this is my selfHow could I notYes Master GotamaSuppose Aggivessana there was a person in need of heartwood Wandering in search of heartwood theyd take a sharp axe and enter a forestThere theyd see a big banana tree straight and young and grown free of defectsTheyd cut it down at the base cut off the top and unroll the coiled sheathsBut they wouldnt even find sapwood much less heartwoodIn the same way when pursued pressed and grilled by me on your own doctrine you turn out to be void hollow and mistakenBut it was you who stated before the assembly of VesālīIf I was to take them on in debate I dont see any ascetic or brahminleader of an order or a community or the teacher of a community even one who claims to be a perfected one a fully awakened Buddhawho would not shake and rock and tremble sweating from the armpitsEven if I took on an insentient post in debate it would shake and rock and trembleHow much more then a human beingBut sweat is pouring from your forehead its soaked through your robe and drips on the groundWhile I now have no sweat on my bodySo the Buddha revealed his golden body to the assemblyWhen this was said Saccaka sat silent embarrassed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to sayKnowing this the Licchavi Dummukha said to the BuddhaA simile strikes me Blessed OneThen speak as you feel inspired said the BuddhaSir suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or villageand a crab lived thereThen several boys or girls would leave the town or village and go to the pond where theyd pull out the crab and put it on dry landWhenever that crab extended a claw those boys or girls would snap crack and break it off with a stick or a stoneAnd when that crabs claws had all been snapped cracked and broken off it wouldnt be able to return down into that lotus pondIn the same way sir the Buddha has snapped cracked and broken off all Saccakas tricks dodges and evasionsNow he cant get near the Buddha again looking for a debateBut Saccaka said to himHold on Dummukha hold on I wasnt talking with you I was talking with Master GotamaMaster Gotama leave aside that statement I madeas did various other ascetics and brahminsit was like just a bit of nonsenseHow do you define a disciple of Master Gotama who follows instructions and responds to advice who has gone beyond doubt got rid of indecision gained assurance and is independent of others in the Teachers instructionsIts when one of my disciples truly sees any kind of form at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all formwith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfThey truly see any kind of feeling perception consciousness at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all consciousnesswith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfThats how to define one of my disciples who follows instructions and responds to advice who has gone beyond doubt got rid of indecision gained assurance and is independent of others in the Teachers instructionsBut how do you define a mendicant who is a perfected one with defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenmentIts when one of my disciples truly sees any kind of form at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all formwith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my self And having seen this with right understanding theyre freed by not graspingThey truly see any kind of feeling perception consciousness at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all consciousnesswith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my self And having seen this with right understanding theyre freed by not graspingThats how to define a mendicant who is a perfected one with defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenmentA mendicant whose mind is freed like this has three unsurpassable qualitiesunsurpassable vision practice and freedomThey honor respect esteem and venerate only the Realized OneThe Blessed One is awakened tamed serene crossed over and extinguished And he teaches Dhamma for awakening selfcontrol serenity crossing over and extinguishmentWhen he had spoken Saccaka said to himMaster Gotama it was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debateFor a person might find safety after attacking a rutting elephant but not after attacking Master GotamaA person might find safety after attacking a blazing mass of fire but not after attacking Master GotamaThey might find safety after attacking a poisonous viper but not after attacking Master GotamaIt was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debateWould Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrows meal from meThe Buddha consented in silenceThen knowing that the Buddha had consented Saccaka addressed those LicchavisListen gentlemen I have invited the ascetic Gotama together with the Saṅgha of mendicants for tomorrows mealYou may all bring me what you think is suitableThen when the night had passed those Licchavis presented Saccaka with an offering of five hundred servings of foodAnd Saccaka had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home Then he had the Buddha informed of the time sayingIts time Master Gotama the meal is readyThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to Saccakas park where he sat on the seat spread out together with the Saṅgha of mendicantsThen Saccaka served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foodsWhen the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Saccaka took a low seat and sat to one sideThen Saccaka said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama may the merit and the growth of merit in this gift be for the happiness of the donorsAggivessana whatever comes from giving to a recipient of a religious donation such as yourselfwho is not free of greed hate and delusionwill accrue to the donorsWhatever comes from giving to a recipient of a religious donation such as myselfwho is free of greed hate and delusionwill accrue to youMiddle DiscoursesThe Longer Advice to RāhulaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for almsAnd Venerable Rāhula also robed up and followed behind the BuddhaThen the Buddha looked back at Rāhula and saidRāhula you should truly see any kind of form at allpast future or present internal or external coarse or fine inferior or superior far or near all formwith right understanding This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfOnly form Blessed One Only form Holy OneForm Rāhula as well as feeling and perception and choices and consciousnessThen Rāhula thought Who would go to the village for alms today after being advised directly by the Buddha Turning back he sat down at the root of a certain tree crosslegged with his body straight and established mindfulness right thereVenerable Sāriputta saw him sitting thereand addressed himRāhula develop mindfulness of breathingWhen mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated its very fruitful and beneficialThen in the late afternoon Rāhula came out of retreat went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side

of the Kāsīs together with a large Saṅgha of mendicantsThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicants I abstain from eating at nightDoing so I find that Im healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyYou too should abstain from eating at nightDoing so youll find that youre healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyYes sir they repliedThen the Buddha traveling stage by stage in the land of the Kāsīs arrived at a town of the Kāsīs named Kīṭāgiriand stayed thereNow at that time the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka were residing at KīṭāgiriThen several mendicants went up to them and saidReverends the Buddha abstains from eating at night and so does the mendicant SaṅghaDoing so they find that theyre healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyYou too should abstain from eating at nightDoing so youll find that youre healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyWhen they said this the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka said to themReverends we eat in the evening the morning and at the wrong time of dayDoing so we find that were healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyWhy should we give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over timeWe shall eat in the evening the morning and at the wrong time of daySince those mendicants were unable to persuade the mendicants who were followers of Assaji and Punabbasuka they approached the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happenedSo the Buddha addressed a certain monkPlease monk in my name tell the mendicants who follow Assaji and Punabbasuka thatthe teacher summons themYes sir that monk replied He went to those mendicants and saidVenerables the teacher summons youYes reverend those mendicants repliedThey went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one sideThe Buddha said to them Is it really true mendicants that several mendicants went to you and saidReverends the Buddha abstains from eating at night and so does the mendicant SaṅghaDoing so they find that theyre healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyYou too should abstain from eating at nightDoing so youll find

say that enlightenment is achieved right awayRather enlightenment is achieved by gradual training progress and practiceAnd how is enlightenment achieved by gradual training progress and practiceIts when someone in whom faith has arisen approaches a teacher They pay homage lend an ear hear the teachings remember the teachings reflect on their meaning and accept them after consideration Then enthusiasm springs up they make an effort weigh up and persevere Persevering they directly realize the ultimate truth and see it with penetrating wisdomMendicants there has not been that faiththat approachingthat paying homagethat listeningthat hearing the teachingsthat remembering the teachingsthat reflecting on their meaningthat acceptance after considerationthat enthusiasmthat making an effortthat weighing upor that strivingYouve lost the way mendicants Youre practicing the wrong wayJust how far have these foolish people strayed from this teaching and trainingThere is an exposition in four parts which a sensible person would quickly understand when it is recitedI shall recite it for you mendicants Try to understand itSir who are we to be counted alongside those who understand the teachingEven with a teacher who values material things is an heir in material things who lives caught up in material things you wouldnt get into such hagglingIf we get this well do that If we dont get this we wont do it What then of the Realized One who lives utterly detached from material thingsFor a faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teachers instructions this is in line with the teachingThe Buddha is my Teacher I am his discipleThe Buddha knows I do not knowFor a faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teachers instructions the Teachers instructions are nourishing and nutritiousFor a faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teachers instructions this is in line with the teachingGladly let only skin sinews and bones remain Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body I will not relax my energy until I have achieved what is possible by human strength energy and vigorA faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teachers instructions can expect one of two resultsenlightenment in the present life or if theres something left over nonreturnThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesMany ElementsSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisWhatever dangers there are all come from the foolish not from the astuteWhatever perils there are all come from the foolish not from the astuteWhatever hazards there are all come from the foolish not from the astuteIts like a fire that spreads from a hut made of reeds or grass and burns down even a bungalow plastered inside and out draftfree with latches fastened and windows shutteredIn the same way whatever dangers there are all come from the foolish not from the astuteWhatever perils there are all come from the foolish not from the astuteWhatever hazards there are all come from the foolish not from the astuteSo the fool is dangerous but the astute person is safeThe fool is perilous but the astute person is notThe fool is hazardous but the astute person is notTheres no danger peril or hazard that comes from the astuteSo you should train like this We shall be astute we shall be inquirersWhen he said this Venerable nanda said to the BuddhaSir how is a mendicant qualified to be called astute an inquirernanda its when a mendicant is skilled in the elements in the sense fields in dependent origination and in the

its amazingWhat is the name of this exposition of the teachingIn that case nanda you may remember this exposition of the teaching as The Many Elements or else The Four Cycles or else The Mirror of the Teaching or else The Drum of the Deathless or else The Supreme Victory in BattleThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith the People of NagaravindaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named NagaravindaThe brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda heardIt seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familywhile wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Nagaravinda together with a large Saṅgha of mendicantsHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureIts good to see such perfected onesThen the brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda went up to the BuddhaBefore sitting down to one side some bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silentThe Buddha said to themHouseholders if wanderers who follow another path were to ask youWhat kind of ascetic or brahmin doesnt deserve honor respect reverence and venerationYou should answer themThere are ascetics and brahmins who are not free of greed hate and delusion for sights known by the eye who are not peaceful inside and who conduct themselves badly among the good by way of body speech and mind They dont deserve honor respect reverence and venerationWhy is thatBecause we ourselves are not free of these things so we do not see that they have any higher good conduct than usThats why they dont deserve honor respect reverence and venerationThere are ascetics and brahmins who are not free of greed hate and delusion for sounds known by the ear smells known by the nose tastes known by the tonguetouches known by the body thoughts known by the mind who are not peaceful inside and who conduct themselves badly among the good by way of body speech and mind They dont deserve honor respect reverence and venerationWhy is thatBecause we ourselves are not free of these things so we do not see that they have any higher good conduct than usThats why they dont deserve honor respect reverence and venerationWhen questioned by wanderers who follow other paths thats how you should answer themIf wanderers who follow other paths were to ask youWhat kind of ascetic or brahmin deserves honor respect reverence and venerationYou should answer themThere are ascetics and brahmins who are free of greed hate and delusion for sights known by the eye who are peaceful inside and who conduct themselves well by way of body speech and mind They deserve honor respect reverence and venerationWhy is thatBecause we ourselves are not free of these things but we see that they have a higher good conduct than usThats why they deserve honor respect reverence and venerationThere are ascetics and brahmins who are free of greed hate and delusion for sounds known by the ear smells known by the nose tastes known by the tongue touches known by the body thoughts known by the mind who are peaceful inside and who conduct themselves well by way of body speech and mind They deserve honor respect reverence and venerationWhy is thatBecause we ourselves are not free of these things but we see that they have a higher good conduct than usThats why they deserve honor respect reverence and venerationWhen questioned by wanderers who follow other paths thats how you should answer themIf wanderers who follow other paths were to ask youBut what reasons and evidence do you have regarding those venerables that justifies sayingClearly those venerables are free of greed hate and delusion or practicing to be free of themYou should answer themIts because those venerables frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forestIn such places there are no sights known by the eye to see and enjoy there are no sounds known by the ear to hear and enjoy no odors known by the nose to smell and enjoy no flavors known by the tongue to taste and enjoy and no touches known by the body to feel and enjoyThese are the reasons and evidence that you have regarding those venerables that justifies sayingClearly those venerables are free of greed hate and delusion or practicing to be free of themWhen questioned by wanderers who follow other paths thats how you should answer themWhen he had spoken the brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda said to the BuddhaExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many waysWe go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesWith BhūmijaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding groundThen Venerable Bhūmija robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of Prince Jayasena where he sat on the seat spread outThen Jayasena approached and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to BhūmijaMaster Bhūmija there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewIf you make a wish and lead the spiritual life you cant win the fruitIf you dont make a wish and lead the spiritual life you cant win the fruitIf you both make a wish and dont make a wish and lead the spiritual life you cant win the fruitIf you neither make a wish nor dont make a wish and lead the spiritual life you cant win the fruitWhat does Master Bhūmijas Teacher say about this How does he explain itPrince I havent heard and learned this in the presence of the BuddhaBut its possible that he might explain it like thisIf you lead the spiritual life irrationally you cant win the fruit regardless of whether you make a wishyou dont make a wishyou both do and do not make a wishor you neither do nor dont make a wishBut if you lead the spiritual life rationally you can win the fruit regardless of whether you make a wishyou dont make a wishyou both do and do not make a wishor you neither do nor dont make a wishI havent heard and learned this in the presence of the BuddhaBut its possible that he might explain it like thatIf thats what your teacher says Master Bhūmija he clearly stands head and shoulders above all the various other ascetics and brahminsThen Prince Jayasena served Venerable Bhūmija from his own dishThen after the meal on his return from almsround Bhūmija went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him all that had happened addingAnswering this way I trust that I repeated what the Buddha has said and didnt misrepresent him with an untruth I trust my explanation was in line with the teaching and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticismIndeed Bhūmija in answering this way you repeated what Ive said and didnt misrepresent me with an untruth Your explanation was in line with the teaching and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticismThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view wrong thought wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong immersion If they lead the spiritual life they cant win the fruit regardless of whether they make a wishthey dont make a wishthey both do and do not make a wishor they neither do nor dont make a wishWhy is thatBecause thats an irrational way to win the fruitSuppose there was a person in need of oil While wandering in search of oil they tried heaping sand in a bucket sprinkling it thoroughly with water and pressing it outBut by doing this they couldnt extract any oil regardless of whether they made a wishdidnt make a wishboth did and did not make a wishor neither did nor did not make a wishWhy is thatBecause thats an irrational way to extract oilAnd so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view wrong thought wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness and wrong immersion If they lead the spiritual life they cant win the fruit regardless of whether or not they make a wishWhy is thatBecause thats an irrational way to win the fruitSuppose there was a person in

couldnt produce any butter regardless of whether they made a wishdidnt make a wishboth did and did not make a wishor neither did nor did not make a wishWhy is thatBecause thats an irrational way to produce butterAnd so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view Because thats an irrational way to win the fruitSuppose there was a person in need of fire While wandering in search of fire they tried drilling a green sappy log with a drillstickBut by doing this they couldnt start a fire regardless of whether they made a wishdidnt make a wishboth did and did not make a wishor

Jayasena would have gained confidence in you and shown his confidenceBut sir how could these four similes have occurred to me as they did to the Buddha since they were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the pastThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable Bhūmija was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith SandakaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi in Ghositas MonasteryNow at that time the wanderer Sandaka was residing at the cave of the wavy leaf fig tree together with a large assembly of around five hundred wanderersThen in the late afternoon Venerable nanda came out of retreat and addressed the mendicantsCome reverends lets go to the Devakata Pool to see the caveYes reverend they repliedThen nanda together with several mendicants went to the Devakata PoolNow at that time Sandaka and the large assembly of wanderers were sitting together making an uproar a dreadful racket They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk such astalk about kings bandits and ministers talk about armies threats and wars talk about food drink clothes and beds talk about garlands and fragrances talk about family vehicles villages towns cities and countries talk about women and heroes street talk and well talk talk about the departed motley talk tales of land and sea and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existenceSandaka saw nanda coming off in the distanceand hushed his own assemblyBe quiet good sirs dont make a soundThe ascetic nanda a disciple of the ascetic Gotama is comingHe is included among the disciples of the ascetic Gotama who is residing near KosambīSuch venerables like the quiet are educated to be quiet and praise the quietHopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet hell see fit to approachThen those wanderers fell silentThen Venerable nanda went up to the wanderer Sandakawho said to himCome Master nanda Welcome Master nandaIts been a long time since you took the opportunity to come herePlease sir sit down this seat is readynanda sat down on the seat spread outwhile Sandaka took a low seat and sat to one sidenanda said to SandakaSandaka what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was unfinishedMaster nanda leave aside what we were sitting talking about just nowIt wont be hard for you to hear about that laterItd be great if Master nanda himself would give a Dhamma talk explaining his own traditionWell then Sandaka listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir replied SandakaVenerable nanda said thisSandaka these things have been explained by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha four ways that negate the spiritual life and four kinds of unreliable spiritual life A sensible person would to the best of their ability not practice such spiritual paths and if they did practice them they wouldnt succeed in the procedure of the skillful teachingBut Master nanda what are the four ways that negate the spiritual life and the four kinds of unreliable spiritual lifeSandaka take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and viewTheres no meaning in giving sacrifice or offerings Theres no fruit or result of good and bad deeds Theres no afterlife Theres no obligation to mother and father No beings are reborn spontaneously And theres no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insightThis person is made up of the four primary elements When they die the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of earth The water in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of water The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of fire The air in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of air The faculties are transferred to spaceFour men with a bier carry away the corpseTheir footprints show the way to the cemeteryThe bones become bleachedOfferings dedicated to the gods end in ashesGiving is a doctrine for moronsWhen anyone affirms a positive teaching its just hollow false nonsenseBoth the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up and they dont exist after deathA sensible person reflects on this matter in this wayThis teacher has such a doctrine and viewIf what that teacher says is true both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished ithave attained exactly the same level Yet Im not one who says that both of us are annihilated and destroyed when our body breaks up and we dont exist after deathBut its superfluous for this teacher to go naked shaven persisting in squatting tearing out their hair and beard For Im living at home with my children using sandalwood imported from Kāsi wearing garlands perfumes and makeup and accepting gold and money Yet Ill have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacherWhat do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacherThis negates the spiritual lifeRealizing this they leave disappointedThis is the first way that negates the spiritual lifeFurthermore take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and viewNothing bad is done by the doer when they punish mutilate torture aggrieve oppress intimidate or when they encourage others to do the same Nothing bad is done when they kill steal break into houses plunder wealth steal from isolated buildings commit highway robbery commit adultery and lieIf you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razoredged chakram no evil comes of that and no outcome of evilIf you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing mutilating and torturing and encouraging others to do the same no evil comes of that and no outcome of evilIf you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same no merit comes of that and no outcome of meritIn giving selfcontrol restraint and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of meritA sensible person reflects on this matter in this wayThis teacher has such a doctrine and viewIf what that teacher says is true both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished ithave attained exactly the same level Yet Im not one who says that when both of us act nothing wrong is doneBut its superfluous for this teacher to go naked shaven persisting in squatting tearing out their hair and beard For Im living at home with my children using sandalwood imported from Kāsi wearing garlands perfumes and makeup and accepting gold and money Yet Ill have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacherWhat do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacherThis negates the spiritual lifeRealizing this they leave disappointedThis is the second way that negates the spiritual lifeFurthermore take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and viewThere is no cause or condition for the corruption of sentient beingsSentient beings are corrupted without cause or reasonTheres no cause or condition for the purification of sentient beingsSentient beings are purified without cause or reasonThere is no power no energy no human strength or vigorAll sentient beings all living creatures all beings all souls lack control power and energy Molded by destiny circumstance and nature they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirthA sensible person reflects on this matter in this wayThis teacher has such a doctrine and viewIf what that teacher says is true both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished ithave attained exactly the same level Yet Im not one who says that both of us are purified without cause or reasonBut its superfluous for this teacher to go naked shaven persisting in squatting tearing out their hair and beard For Im living at home with my children using sandalwood imported from Kāsi wearing garlands perfumes and makeup and accepting gold and money Yet Ill have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacherWhat do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacherThis negates the spiritual lifeRealizing this they leave disappointedThis is the third way that negates the spiritual lifeFurthermore take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and viewThere are these seven substances that are not made not derived not created without a creator barren steady as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillarThey dont move or deteriorate or obstruct each other Theyre unable to cause pleasure pain or neutral feeling to each otherWhat sevenThe substances of earth water fire air pleasure pain and the soul is the seventhThese seven substances are not made not derived not created without a creator barren steady as a mountain peak standing firm like a pillarThey dont move or deteriorate or obstruct each otherTheyre unable to cause pleasure pain or neutral feeling to each otherAnd here there is noone who kills or who makes others kill noone who learns or who educates others noone who understands or who helps others understandIf you chop off someones head with a sharp sword you dont take anyones lifeThe sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substancesThere are  million main wombs and  and  There are  deeds and five and three There are deeds and halfdeeds There are  paths  subeons six classes of rebirth and eight stages in a persons life There are  jīvaka ascetics  wanderers and  naked ascetics There are  faculties  hells and  realms of dust There are seven percipient embryos seven nonpercipient embryos and seven embryos without attachments There are seven gods seven humans and seven goblins There are seven lakes seven winds seven cliffs and  cliffs There are seven dreams and  dreams There are  million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of sufferingAnd here there is no such thing as this By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by littlefor that cannot bePleasure and pain are allotted Transmigration lasts only for a limited period so theres no increase or decrease no getting better or worseIts like how when you toss a ball of string it rolls away unravelingIn the same way after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of sufferingA sensible person reflects on this matter in this wayThis teacher has such a doctrine and viewIf what that teacher says is true both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished ithave attained exactly the same level Yet Im not one who says that after transmigrating both of us will make an end of sufferingBut its superfluous for this teacher to go naked shaven persisting in squatting tearing out their hair and beard For Im living at home with my children using sandalwood imported from Kāsi wearing garlands perfumes and makeup and accepting gold and money Yet Ill have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacherWhat do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacherThis negates the spiritual lifeRealizing this they leave disappointedThis is the fourth way that negates the spiritual lifeThese are the four ways that negate the spiritual life that have been explained by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha A sensible person would to the best of their ability not practice such spiritual paths and if they did practice them they wouldnt succeed in the procedure of the skillful teachingIts incredible Master nanda its amazinghow these four ways that negate the spiritual life have been explained by the BuddhaBut Master nanda what are the four kinds of unreliable spiritual lifeSandaka take a certain teacher who claims to be allknowing and allseeing to know and see everything without exception thusKnowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me while walking standing sleeping and wakingHe enters an empty house he gets no almsfood a dog bites him he encounters a wild elephant a wild horse and a wild cow he asks the name and clan of a woman or man he asks the name and path to a village or townWhen asked Why is this he answers I had to enter an empty house thats why I entered it I had to get no almsfood thats why I got none I had to get bitten by a dog thats why I was bitten I had to encounter a wild elephant a wild horse and a wild cow thats why I encountered them I had to ask the name and clan of a woman or man thats why I asked I had to ask the name and path to a village or town thats why I askedA sensible person reflects on this matter in this wayThis teacher makes such a claim but he answers in such a wayThis spiritual life is unreliableRealizing this they leave disappointedThis is the first kind of unreliable spiritual lifeFurthermore take another teacher who is an oral transmitter who takes oral transmission to be the truthHe teaches by oral transmission by the lineage of testament by canonical authorityBut when a teacher takes oral transmission to be the truth some of that is well learned some poorly learned some true and some otherwiseA sensible person reflects on this matter in this wayThis teacher takes oral transmission to be the truth He teaches by oral transmission by the lineage of testament by canonical authorityBut when a teacher takes oral transmission to be the truth some of that is well learned some poorly learned some true and some otherwiseThis spiritual life is unreliableRealizing this they leave disappointedThis is the second kind of unreliable spiritual lifeFurthermore take another teacher who relies on logic and inquiryHe teaches what he has worked out by logic following a line of inquiry expressing his own perspectiveBut when a teacher relies on logic and inquiry some

by logic following a line of inquiry expressing his own perspectiveBut when a teacher relies on logic and inquiry some of that is well reasoned some poorly reasoned some true and some otherwiseThis spiritual life is unreliableRealizing this they leave disappointedThis is the third kind of unreliable spiritual lifeFurthermore take another teacher who is dull and stupidBecause of that whenever hes asked a question he resorts to evasiveness and equivocationI dont say its like this I dont say its like that I dont say its otherwise I dont say its not so And I dont deny its not soA sensible person reflects on this matter in this wayThis teacher is dull and stupidBecause of that whenever hes asked a question he resorts to evasiveness and equivocationI dont say its like this I dont say its like that I dont say its otherwise I dont say its not so And I dont deny its not soThis spiritual life is unreliableRealizing this they leave disappointedThis is the fourth kind of unreliable spiritual lifeThese are the four kinds of unreliable spiritual life that have been explained by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha A sensible person would to the best of their ability not practice such spiritual paths and if they did practice them they wouldnt complete the procedure of the skillful teachingIts incredible Master nanda its amazinghow these four kinds of unreliable spiritual life have been explained by the BuddhaBut Master nanda what would a teacher say and explain so that a sensible person would to the best of their ability practice such a spiritual path and once practicing it they would complete the procedure of the skillful teachingSandaka its when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed He gives up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdomThen quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities he enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedA sensible person would to the best of their ability lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction and once practicing it they would complete the procedure of the skillful teachingFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant  enters and remains in the second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionA sensible person would to the best of their ability lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction and once practicing it they would complete the procedure of the skillful teachingWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past livesThey recollect many kinds of past lives That is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding  They recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsA sensible person would to the best of their ability lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction and once practicing it they would complete the procedure of the skillful teachingWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place  They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsA sensible person would to the best of their ability lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction and once practicing it they would complete the procedure of the skillful teachingWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsThey truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingThey truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen theyre freed they know theyre freedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceA sensible person would to the best of their ability lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction and once practicing it they would complete the procedure of the skillful teachingBut Master nanda when a mendicant is perfectedwith defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenmentcould they still enjoy sensual pleasuresSandaka a mendicant who is perfectedwith defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenmentcant transgress in five respectsA mendicant with defilements ended cant deliberately take the life of a living creature take something with the intention to steal have sex tell a deliberate lie or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they did as a lay personA mendicant who is perfected cant transgress in these five respectsBut Master nanda when a mendicant is perfected would the knowledge and vision that their defilements are ended be constantly and continually present to them while walking standing sleeping and wakingWell then Sandaka I shall give you a simileFor by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is saidSuppose there was a person whose hands and feet had been amputatedWould they be aware that their hands and feet had been amputated constantly and continually while walking standing sleeping and wakingOr would they be aware of it only when they checked itThey wouldnt be aware of it constantlyonly when they checked itIn the same way when a mendicant is perfected the knowledge and vision that their defilements are ended is not constantly and continually present to them while walking standing sleeping and wakingRather they are aware of it only when they checked itBut Reverend nanda how many emancipators are there in this teaching and trainingThere are not just one hundred emancipators Sandaka or two or three or four or five hundred but many more than that in this teaching and trainingIts incredible Master nanda its amazingNamely that theres no glorifying ones own teaching and putting down the teaching of others The Dhamma is taught in its own field and so many emancipators are recognizedBut these jīvaka ascetics those sons of dead sons glorify themselves and put others down And they only recognize three emancipatorsNanda Vaccha Kisa Saṅkicca and Makkhali GosālaThen the wanderer Sandaka addressed his own assemblyGo good sirs The spiritual life is lived under the ascetic GotamaIts not easy for me to give up possessions honor or popularity nowAnd thats how the wanderer Sandaka sent his own assembly to lead the spiritual life under the BuddhaMiddle DiscoursesThe Longer Discourse With MāluṅkyaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants do you remember the five lower fetters that I taughtWhen he said this Venerable Māluṅkyaputta said to himSir I remember themBut how do you remember themI remember the lower fetters taught by the Buddha as follows identity viewmisapprehension of precepts and observancessensual desireand ill willThats how I remember the five lower fetters taught by the BuddhaWho on earth do you remember being taught the five lower fetters in that wayWouldnt the wanderers who follow other paths fault you using the simile of the infantFor a little baby doesnt even have a concept of identity so how could identity view possibly arise in themYet the underlying tendency to identity view still lies within themA little baby doesnt even have a concept of teachings so how could doubt about the teachings possibly arise in themYet the underlying tendency to doubt still lies within themA little baby doesnt

the wanderers who follow other paths fault you using the simile of the infantWhen he said this Venerable nanda said to the BuddhaNow is the time Blessed One Now is the time Holy OneMay the Buddha teach the five lower fettersThe mendicants will listen and remember itWell then nanda listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir nanda repliedThe Buddha said thisnanda take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve not seen good persons and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good personsTheir heart is overcome and mired in identity viewand they dont truly understand the escape from identity view that has arisenThat identity view is reinforced in them not eliminated it is a lower fetterTheir heart is overcome and mired in doubtand they dont truly understand the escape from doubt that has arisenThat doubt is reinforced in them not eliminated it is a lower fetterTheir heart is overcome and mired in misapprehension of precepts and observancesand they dont truly understand the escape from misapprehension of precepts and observances that has arisenThat misapprehension of precepts and observances is reinforced in them not eliminated it is a lower fetterTheir heart is overcome and mired in sensual desireand they dont truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisenThat sensual desire is reinforced in them not eliminated it is a lower fetterTheir heart is overcome and mired in ill willand they dont truly understand the escape from ill will that has arisenThat ill will is reinforced in them not eliminated it is a lower fetterBut an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones Theyve seen good persons and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons Their heart is not overcome and mired in identity viewand they truly understand the escape from identity view that has arisenThat identity view along with any underlying tendency to it is given up in themTheir heart is not overcome and mired in doubtand they truly understand the escape from doubt that has arisenThat doubt along with any underlying tendency to it is given up in themTheir heart is not overcome and mired in misapprehension of precepts and observancesand they truly understand the escape from misapprehension of precepts and observances that has arisenThat misapprehension of precepts and observances along with any underlying tendency to it is given up in themTheir heart is not overcome

overcome and mired in ill willand they truly understand the escape from ill will that has arisenThat ill will along with any underlying tendency to it is given up in themThere is a path and a practice for giving up the five lower fetters Its not possible to know or see or give up the five lower fetters without relying on that path and that practiceSuppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood Its not possible to cut out the heartwood without having cut through the bark and the softwoodIn the same way there is a path and a practice for giving up the five lower fetters Its not possible to know or see or give up the five lower fetters without relying on that path and that practiceThere is a path and a practice for giving up the five lower fetters It is possible to know and see and give up the five lower fetters by relying on that path and that practiceSuppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood It is possible to cut out the heartwood after having cut through the bark and the softwoodIn the same way there is a path and a practice for giving up the five lower fetters It is possible to know and see and give up the five lower fetters by relying on that path and that practiceSuppose the river Ganges was full to the brim so a crow could drink from itThen along comes a feeble person who thinksBy swimming with my arms Ill safely cross over to the far shore of the GangesBut theyre not able to do soIn the same way when the Dhamma is being taught for the cessation of identity view someone whose mind isnt eager confident settled and decidedshould be regarded as being like that feeble personSuppose the river Ganges was full to the brim so a crow could drink from itThen along comes a strong person who thinksBy swimming with my arms Ill safely cross over to the far shore of the GangesAnd they are able to do soIn the same way when the Dhamma is being taught for the cessation of identity view someone whose mind is eager confident settled and decidedshould be regarded as being like that strong personAnd what nanda is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fettersIts when a mendicantdue to the seclusion from attachments the giving up of unskillful qualities and the complete settling of physical discomfortquite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThey contemplate the phenomena thereincluded in form feeling perception choices and consciousnessas impermanent as suffering as diseased as an abscess as a dart as misery as an affliction as alien as falling apart as empty as notselfThey turn their mind away from those thingsand apply it to the deathless elementThis is peaceful this is sublimethat is the stilling of all activities the letting go of all attachments the ending of craving cessation extinguishmentAbiding in that they attain the ending of defilementsIf they dont attain the ending of defilements with the ending of the five lower fetters theyre reborn spontaneously because of their passion and love for that meditation They are extinguished there and are not liable to return from that worldThis is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fettersFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionThey contemplate the phenomena there as impermanent If they dont attain the ending of defilements theyre reborn spontaneously  and are not liable to return from that worldThis too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fettersFurthermore a mendicant going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite spaceThey contemplate the phenomena there as impermanent If they dont attain the ending of defilements theyre reborn spontaneously  and are not liable to return from that worldThis too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fettersFurthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousnessThey contemplate the phenomena there as impermanent If they dont attain the ending of defilements theyre reborn spontaneously  and are not liable to return from that worldThis too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fettersFurthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all enters and remains in the dimension of nothingnessThey contemplate the phenomena there as impermanent If they dont attain the ending of defilements theyre reborn spontaneously  and are not liable to return from that worldThis too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fettersSir if this is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters how come some mendicants here are released in heart while others are released by wisdomIn that case I say it is the diversity of their facultiesThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith JīvakaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Mango Grove of Jīvaka KomārabhaccaThen Jīvaka went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaSir I have heard thisThey slaughter living creatures specially for the ascetic Gotama The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared on purpose for him this is a deed he causedI trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said and do not misrepresent him with an untruth Is their explanation in line with the teaching Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticismJīvaka those who say this do not repeat what I have said They misrepresent me with what is false and untrueIn three cases I say that meat may not be eatenits seen heard or suspectedThese are three cases in which meat may not be eatenIn three cases I say that meat may be eatenits not seen heard or suspectedThese are three cases in which meat may be eatenTake the case of a mendicant living

slaughters a living creature specially for the Realized One or the Realized Ones disciple makes much bad karma for five reasonsWhen they sayGo fetch that living creature this is the first reasonWhen that living creature experiences pain and sadness as its led along by a collar this is the second reasonWhen they sayGo slaughter that living creature this is the third reasonWhen that living creature experiences pain and sadness as its being slaughtered this is the fourth reasonWhen they provide the Realized One or the Realized Ones disciple with unallowable food this is the fifth reasonAnyone who slaughters a living creature specially for the Realized One or the Realized Ones disciple makes much bad karma for five reasonsWhen he had spoken Jīvaka said to the BuddhaIts incredible sir its amazingThe mendicants indeed eat allowable foodThe mendicants indeed eat blameless foodExcellent sir Excellent From this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesWith RaṭṭhapālaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kurus together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kurus named ThullakoṭṭhitaThe brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita heardIt seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Thullakoṭṭhita together with a large Saṅgha of mendicantsHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureIts good to see such perfected onesThen the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita went up to the Buddha Before sitting down to one side some bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silentWhen they were seated the Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired them with a Dhamma talkNow at that time a gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhita was sitting in the assemblyHe thoughtAs I understand the Buddhas teachings its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shellWhy dont I cut off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from lay life to homelessnessThen having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right before leavingSoon after they left Raṭṭhapāla went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir as I understand the Buddhas teachings its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shellI wish to cut off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessSir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceMay the Buddha please give me the going forthBut Raṭṭhapāla do you have your parents permissionNo sirRaṭṭhapāla Buddhas dont give the going forth to the child of parents who havent given their permissionIll make sure sir to get my parents permissionThen Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha Then he went to his parents and saidMum and dad as I understand the Buddhas teachings its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shellI wish to cut off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessPlease give me permission to go forthWhen he said this Raṭṭhapālas parents said to himBut dear Raṭṭhapāla youre our only child Youre dear to us and we love you Youre dainty and raised in comfortYou know nothing of sufferingWhen you die we will lose you against our wishesSo how can we allow you to go forth while youre still aliveFor a second timeand a third time Raṭṭhapāla asked his parents for permission but got the same replyThen Raṭṭhapāla thoughtMy parents dont allow me to go forth He laid down there on the bare ground sayingIll either die right here or go forthAnd he refused to eat up to the seventh mealThen Raṭṭhapālas parents said to himDear Raṭṭhapāla youre our only child Youre dear to us and we love you Youre dainty and raised in comfortYou know nothing of sufferingWhen you die we will lose you against our wishesSo how can we allow you to go forth from lay life to homelessness while youre still livingGet up Raṭṭhapāla Eat drink and amuse yourselfWhile enjoying sensual pleasures delight in making meritWe dont allow you to go forthWhen you die we will lose you against our wishesSo how can we allow you to go forth while youre still aliveWhen they said this Raṭṭhapāla kept silentFor a second timeand a third time Raṭṭhapālas parents made the same requestAnd for a third time Raṭṭhapāla kept silent Raṭṭhapālas parents then went to see his friends They told them of the situation and asked for their helpThen Raṭṭhapālas friends went to him and saidOur friend Raṭṭhapāla you are your parents only child Youre dear to them and they love you Youre dainty and raised in comfortYou know nothing of sufferingWhen you die your parents will lose you against their wishesSo how can they allow you to go forth while youre still aliveGet up Raṭṭhapāla Eat drink and amuse yourselfWhile enjoying sensual pleasures delight in making meritYour parents will not allow you to go forthWhen you die your parents will lose you against their wishesSo how can they allow you to go forth while youre still aliveWhen they said this Raṭṭhapāla kept silentFor a second timeand a third time Raṭṭhapālas friends made the same requestAnd for a third time Raṭṭhapāla kept silentThen Raṭṭhapālas friends went to his parents and saidMum and dad Raṭṭhapāla is lying there on the bare ground sayingIll either die right here or go forthIf you dont allow him to go forth hell die thereBut if you do allow him to go forth youll see him again afterwardsAnd if he doesnt enjoy the renunciate life where else will he have to goHell come right back herePlease give Raṭṭhapāla permission to go forthThen dears we give Raṭṭhapāla permission to go forthBut once gone forth he must visit his parentsThen Raṭṭhapālas friends went to him and saidGet up Raṭṭhapāla Your parents have given you permission to go forth from lay life to homelessnessBut once gone forth you must visit your parentsRaṭṭhapāla got up and regained his strengthHe went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir I have my parents permission to go forth from the lay life to homelessnessMay the Buddha please give me the going forthAnd Raṭṭhapāla received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceNot long after Venerable Raṭṭhapālas ordination a fortnight later the Buddhahaving stayed in Thullakoṭṭhita as long as he wishedset out for SāvatthīTraveling stage by stage he arrived at Sāvatthīwhere he stayed in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen Venerable Raṭṭhapāla living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessHe understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceAnd Venerable Raṭṭhapāla became one of the perfectedThen he went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir Id like to visit my parents if the Buddha allows itThen the Buddha focused on comprehending Raṭṭhapālas mindWhen he knew thatit was impossible for Raṭṭhapāla to resign the training and return to a lesser life he saidPlease Raṭṭhapāla go at your convenienceAnd then Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right Then he set his lodgings in order and taking his bowl and robe set out for ThullakoṭṭhitaTraveling stage by stage he arrived at Thullakoṭṭhikawhere he stayed in King Koravyas deer rangeThen Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Thullakoṭṭhita for almsWandering indiscriminately for almsfood he approached his own fathers houseNow at that time Raṭṭhapālas father was having his hair dressed in the hall of the middle gateHe saw Raṭṭhapāla coming off in the distanceOur dear and beloved only son was made to go forth by these shavelings these fake asceticsAnd at his own fathers home Raṭṭhapāla received neither alms nor a polite refusalbut only abuseNow at that time a family bondservant wanted to throw away the previous nights porridgeSo Raṭṭhapāla said to herIf thats to be thrown away sister pour it here in my bowlAs she was pouring the porridge into his bowl she recognized the features of his hands feet and voiceShe then went to his mother and saidPlease madam you should know thisMaster Raṭṭhapāla has arrivedWow If you speak the truth Ill make you a free womanThen Raṭṭhapālas mother went to his father and saidPlease householder you should know thisIt seems our son Raṭṭhapāla has arrivedNow at that time Raṭṭhapāla was eating last nights porridge by a wallThen Raṭṭhapālas father went up to him and saidDear Raṭṭhapāla Theres  and youll be eating last nights porridgeWhy not go to your own homeHouseholder how could those of us who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness have a houseWere homeless householderI came to your house but there I received neither alms nor a polite refusalbut only abuseCome dear Raṭṭhapāla lets go to the houseEnough householder My meal is finished for todayWell then dear Raṭṭhapāla please accept tomorrows meal from meRaṭṭhapāla consented in silenceThen knowing that Raṭṭhapāla had consented his father went back to his own house He made a heap of gold coins and bullion and hid it under mats Then he addressed Raṭṭhapālas former wivesPlease daughtersinlaw adorn yourselves in the way that our son Raṭṭhapāla found you most adorableAnd when the night had passed Raṭṭhapālas father had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home and announced the time to the Venerable Raṭṭhapāla sayingSir its time The meal is readyThen Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to his fathers home and sat down on the seat spread outRaṭṭhapālas father revealing the heap of gold coins and bullion said to himDear Raṭṭhapāla this is your maternal fortune Theres another paternal fortune and an ancestral oneYou can both enjoy your wealth and make meritCome return to a lesser life enjoy wealth and make meritIf youd follow my advice householder youd have this heap of gold loaded on a cart and carried away to be dumped in the middle of the Ganges riverWhy is thatBecause this will bring you nothing but sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressThen Raṭṭhapālas former wives each clasped his feet and saidWhat are they like master the nymphs for whom you lead the spiritual lifeSisters I dont lead the spiritual life for the sake of nymphsSaying Our master Raṭṭhapāla addresses us as sisters they fainted right awayThen Raṭṭhapāla said to his fatherIf there is food to be given householder please give itBut dont harass meEat dear Raṭṭhapāla The meal is readyThen Raṭṭhapālas father served and satisfied Venerable Raṭṭhapāla with his own hands with a variety of delicious foodsWhen he had eaten and washed his hand and bowl he recited this verse while standing right thereSee this fancy puppeta body built of soresdiseased obsessed overin which nothing lasts at allSee this fancy figurewith its gems and earringsit is bones wrapped in skinmade pretty by its clothesRouged feetand powdered facemay be enough to beguile a foolbut not a seeker of the far shoreHair in eight braidsand eyelinermay be enough to beguile a foolbut not a seeker of the far shoreA rotting body all adornedlike a freshly painted makeup boxmay be enough to beguile a foolbut not a seeker of the far shoreThe hunter laid his snarebut the deer didnt spring the trapIve eaten the bait and now I goleaving the trapper to lamentThen Raṭṭhapāla having recited this verse while standing went to King Koravyas deer range and sat at the root of a tree for the days meditationThen King Koravya addressed his gamekeeperMy good gamekeeper tidy up the park of the deer rangeWe will go to see the sceneryYes Your Majesty replied the gamekeeper While tidying the deer range he saw Raṭṭhapāla sitting in meditationSeeing this he went to the king and saidThe deer range is tidy sireAnd the gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhita of whom you have often spoken highly is meditating there at the root of a treeWell then my good gamekeeper thats enough of the park for todayNow I shall pay homage to the Master RaṭṭhapālaAnd then King Koravya said Give away all the different foods that have been prepared there He had the finest carriages harnessed Then he mounted a fine carriage and along with other fine carriages set out in full royal pomp from Thullakoṭṭhita to see RaṭṭhapālaHe went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached Raṭṭhapāla on foot together with a group of eminent officialsThey exchanged greetings and when the greetings and polite conversation were over he stood to one side and said to RaṭṭhapālaHere Master Raṭṭhapāla sit on this elephant rugEnough great king you sit on itIm sitting on my own seatSo the king sat down on the seat spread out and saidMaster Raṭṭhapāla there are these four kinds of decay Because of these some people shave off their hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessWhat fourDecay due to old age decay due to sickness decay of wealth and

lay life to homelessnessIts incredible Master Raṭṭhapāla its amazinghow well said this was by the BuddhaFor the world is indeed wanting insatiable the slave of cravingThis is what Venerable Raṭṭhapāla saidThen he went on to sayI see rich people in the world whobecause of delusion give not the wealth theyve earnedGreedily they hoard their richesyearning for ever more sensual pleasuresA king who conquered the earth by forceruling the land from sea to seaunsatisfied with the near shore of the oceanwould still yearn for the further shoreNot just the king but others tooreach death not rid of

mindSeeing danger in the many kinds of sensual stimulationI went forth O KingAs fruit falls from a tree so people fallyoung and old when the body breaks upSeeing this too I went forth O Kingthe ascetic life is guaranteed to be betterMiddle DiscoursesWith Moggallāna the GuardianSo I have heardAt one time Venerable nanda was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground It was not long after the Buddha had become fully extinguishedNow at that time King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha being suspicious of King Pajjota was having Rājagaha fortifiedThen Venerable nanda robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for almsThen it occurred to himIts too early to wander for alms in RājagahaWhy dont I go to see the brahmin Moggallāna the Guardian at his place of workSo thats what he didMoggallāna the Guardian saw nanda coming off in the distanceand said to himCome Master nandaWelcome Master nandaIts been a long time since you took the opportunity to come herePlease sir sit down this seat is readynanda sat down on the seat spread outwhile Moggallāna took a low seat and sat to one sideThen he said to nandaMaster nanda is there even a single mendicant who has all the same qualities in each and every way as possessed by Master Gotama the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaNo brahmin there is notFor the Blessed One gave rise to the unarisen path gave birth to the unborn path explained the unexplained path He was the knower of the path the discoverer of the path the expert on the pathAnd now the disciples live following the path they acquire it laterBut this conversation between nanda and Moggallāna the Guardian was left unfinishedFor just then the brahmin Vassakāra a chief minister of Magadha while supervising the work at Rājagaha approached nanda at Moggallānas place of work and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to nandaMaster nanda what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was unfinishedSo nanda told him of the conversation that they were having when Vassakāra arrived Vassakāra saidMaster nanda is there even a single mendicant who was appointed by Master Gotama sayingThis one will be your refuge when I have passed away to whom you now turnNo there is notBut is there even a single mendicant who has been elected to such a position by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicantsNo there is notBut since you lack a refuge Master nanda whats the reason for your harmonyWe dont lack a refuge brahminwe have a refugeThe teaching is our refugeBut Master nanda when asked whether there was even a single mendicanteither appointed by the Buddhaor elected by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicantswho serves as your refuge after the Buddha passed away to whom you now turnyou replied No there is notBut you say that the reason for your harmony is that you havethe teaching as a refugeHow should I see the meaning of this statementThe Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha laid down training rules and recited the monastic code for the mendicantsOn the day of the sabbath all of us who live in dependence on one village district gather together as oneWe invite one who has freshly rehearsed the code to recite itIf anyone remembers an offense or transgression while theyre reciting we make them act in line with the teachings and in line with the instructionsIts not the venerables that make us actits the teaching that makes us actMaster nanda is there even a single mendicant who you honor respect revere venerate and rely onThere is brahminBut Master nanda when asked whether there was even a single mendicanteither appointed by the Buddhaor elected by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicantswho serves as your refuge after the Buddha passed away to whom you now turnyou replied No there is notBut when asked whether there is even a single mendicant who you honor respect revere venerate and rely onyou replied There isHow should I see the meaning of this statementThere are ten inspiring things explained by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaWe honor anyone in whom these things are foundIts when a mendicant is ethical restrained in the monastic code conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault they keep the rules theyve undertakenTheyre very learned remembering and keeping what theyve learnedThese teachings are good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased describing a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure They are very learned in such teachings remembering them reinforcing them by recitation mentally scrutinizing them and comprehending them theoreticallyTheyre content with robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sickThey get the four absorptionsblissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mindwhen they want without trouble or difficultyThey wield the many kinds of psychic power multiplying themselves and becoming one again appearing and disappearing going unimpeded through a wall a rampart or a mountain as if through space diving in and out of the earth as if it were water walking on water as if it were earth flying crosslegged through the sky like a bird touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon so mighty and powerful They control the body as far as the Brahmā realmWith clairaudience that is purified and superhuman they hear both kinds of sounds human and divine whether near or farThey understand the minds of other beings and individuals having comprehended them with their own mindThey understand mind with greed as mind with greedand mind without greed as mind without greedThey understand mind with hate mind without hate mind with delusion mind without delusion constricted mind scattered mind expansive mind unexpansive mind mind that is not supreme mind that is supreme mind immersed in samādhi mind not immersed in samādhi freed mind They understand unfreed mind as unfreed mindThey recollect many kinds of past lives That isone two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expandingThey remember There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThey realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilementsThese are the ten inspiring things explained by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaWe honor anyone in whom these things are found and rely on themWhen he had spoken Vassakāra addressed General UpanandaWhat do you think generalDo these venerables honor respect revere and venerate those who are worthyIndeed they doFor if these venerables were not to honor respect revere and venerate such a personthen who exactly would they honorThen Vassakāra said to nandaWhere are you staying at presentIn the Bamboo Grove brahminI hope the Bamboo Grove is delightful quiet and still far from the madding crowd remote from human settlements and fit for retreatIndeed it is brahmin And it is like that owing to such protectors and guardians as yourselfSurely Master nanda it is owing to the venerables who meditate making a habit of meditatingFor the venerables do in fact meditate and make a habit of meditatingThis one time Master nanda Master Gotama was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roofSo I went there to see himAnd there he spoke about meditation in many waysHe meditated and made a habit of meditatingAnd he praised all kinds of meditationNo brahmin the Buddha did not praise all kinds of meditation nor did he dispraise all kinds of meditationAnd what kind of meditation did he not praiseIts when someones heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire and they dont truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisenHarboring sensual desire within they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminateTheir heart is overcome and mired in ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and remorse doubt and they dont truly know and see the escape from doubt that has arisenHarboring doubt within they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminateThe Buddha didnt praise this kind of meditationAnd what kind of meditation did he praiseIts when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedAs the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedAnd with the fading away of rapture they enter and remain in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissGiving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessThe Buddha praised this kind of meditationWell Master nanda it seems that Master Gotama criticized the kind of meditation that deserves criticism and praised that deserving of praiseWell now Master nanda I must goI have many duties and much to doPlease brahmin go at your convenienceThen Vassakāra the brahmin having approved and agreed with what Venerable nanda said got up from his seat and leftSoon after he had left Moggallāna the Guardian said to nandaMaster nanda you still havent answered my questionBut brahmin didnt I sayThere is no single mendicant who has all the same qualities in each and every way as possessed by Master Gotama the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaFor the Blessed One gave rise to the unarisen path gave birth to the unborn path explained the unexplained path He was the knower of the path the discoverer of the path the expert on the pathAnd now the disciples live following the path they acquire it laterMiddle DiscoursesWith DhanañjāniSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding groundNow at that time Venerable Sāriputta was wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicantsThen a certain mendicant who had completed the rainy season residence in Rājagaha went to the Southern Hills where he approached Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideSāriputta said to himReverend I hope the Buddha is healthy and wellHe is reverendAnd I hope that the mendicant Saṅgha is healthy and wellReverend at the rice checkpoint there is a brahmin named DhanañjāniI hope that he is healthy and wellHe too is wellBut is he diligentHow could he possibly be diligentDhanañjāni robs the brahmins and householders in the name of the king and he robs the king in the name of the brahmins and householdersHis wife a lady of faith who he married from a family of faith has passed awayAnd he has taken a new wife who has no faithOh its bad newsto hear that Dhanañjāni is negligentHopefully some time or other Ill get to meet him and we can have a discussionWhen Sāriputta had stayed in the Southern Hills as long as he wished he set out for RājagahaTraveling stage by stage he arrived at Rājagahawhere he stayed in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding groundThen he robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for almsNow at that time Dhanañjāni was having his cows milked in a cowshed outside the cityThen Sāriputta wandered for alms in Rājagaha After the meal on his return from almsround he approached DhanañjāniSeeing Sāriputta coming off in the distanceDhanañjāni went to him and saidHere Master Sāriputta drink some fresh milk before the meal timeEnough brahminIve finished eating for todayI shall be at the root of that tree for the days meditationCome see me thereYes sir replied DhanañjāniWhen Dhanañjāni had finished breakfast he went to Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideSāriputta said to himI hope youre diligent DhanañjāniHow can I possibly be diligent Master Sāriputta I have to provide for my mother and father my wives and children and my bondservants and workers And I have to make the proper offerings to friends and colleagues relatives and kin guests ancestors deities and king And then this body must also be fattened and built upWhat do you think DhanañjāniSuppose someone was to behave in an unprincipled and unjust way for the sake of their parents Because of this the wardens of hell would drag them to hellCould they get out of being dragged to hell by pleading that they had acted for the sake of their parents Or could their parents save them by pleading that the acts had been done for their sakeNo Master SāriputtaRather even as they were wailing the wardens of hell would cast them down into hellWhat do you think DhanañjāniSuppose someone was to behave in an unprincipled and unjust way for the sake of their wives and children bondservants and workers friends and colleagues relatives and kin ancestors fattening and building up their body Because of this the wardens of hell would drag them to hellCould they get out of being dragged to hell by pleading that they had acted for the sake of fattening and building up their body Or could anyone else save them by pleading that the acts had been done for that reasonNo Master SāriputtaRather even as they were wailing the wardens of hell would cast them down into hellWho do you think is better Dhanañjāni Someone who for the sake of their parents behaves in an unprincipled and unjust manner or someone who behaves in a principled and just mannerSomeone who behaves in a principled and just manner for the sake of their parentsFor principled and moral conduct is better than unprincipled and immoral conductDhanañjāni there are other livelihoods that are both profitable and legitimate By means of these its possible to

of these its possible to fatten and build up your body avoid bad deeds and practice the path of goodnessThen Dhanañjāni the brahmin having approved and agreed with what Venerable Sāriputta said got up from his seat and leftSome time later Dhanañjāni became sick suffering gravely illThen he addressed a manPlease mister go to the Buddha and in my name bow with your head to his feet Say to himSir the

feeding groundNow at that time Venerable Rāhula was staying at AmbalaṭṭhikāThen in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Ambalaṭṭhika to see Venerable RāhulaRāhula saw the Buddha coming off in the distanceHe spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feetThe Buddha sat on the seat spread outand washed his feetRāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one sideThen the Buddha leaving a little water in the pot addressed RāhulaRāhula do you see this little bit of water left in the potYes sirThats how little of the ascetics nature is left in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lieThen the Buddha tossing away what little water was left in the pot said to RāhulaDo you see this little bit of water that was tossed awayYes sirThats how the ascetics nature is tossed away in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lieThen the Buddha turning the pot upside down said to RāhulaDo you see how this pot is turned upside downYes sirThats how the ascetics nature is turned upside down in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lieThen the Buddha turning the pot right side up said to RāhulaDo you see how this pot is vacant and hollowYes sirThats how vacant and hollow the ascetics nature is in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lieSuppose there was a royal bull elephant with tusks like chariotpoles able to draw a heavy load pedigree and battlehardened In battle it uses its forefeet and hindfeet its forequarters and hindquarters its head ears tusks and tail but it still protects its trunkSo its rider thinksThis royal bull elephant still protects its trunkIt has not yet given its lifeBut when that royal bull elephant  in battle uses its forefeet and hindfeet its forequarters and hindquarters its head ears tusks and tail and its trunk its rider thinksThis royal bull elephant  in battle uses its forefeet and hindfeet its forequarters and hindquarters its head ears tusks and tail and its trunkIt has given its lifeNow there is nothing that royal bull elephant would not doIn the same way when someone is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie there is no bad deed they would not do I saySo you should train like this I will not tell a lie even for a jokeWhat do you think RāhulaWhat is the purpose of a mirrorIts for checking your reflection sirIn the same way deeds of body speech and mind should be done only after repeated checkingWhen you want to act with the body you should check on that same deedDoes this act with the body that I want to do lead to hurting myself hurting others or hurting bothIs it unskillful with suffering as its outcome and resultIf while checking in this way you knowThis act with the body that I want to do leads to hurting myself hurting others or hurting bothIts

future and present who purify their physical verbal and mental actions do so after repeatedly checkingSo Rāhula you should train yourself like this I will purify my physical verbal and mental actions after repeatedly checkingThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable Rāhula was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe AntHillSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near

answerI dont see anyone in this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humanswho could provide a satisfying answer to this riddle except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from themThat is what that deity saidbefore vanishing right thereThen when the night had passed Kassapa the Prince went to the Buddha bowed

defilementsThis is the meaning of Leave the dragon Do not disturb the dragon Worship the dragonThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable Kassapa the Prince was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesAt KaṇṇakatthalaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Ujuñña in the deer park at KaṇṇakatthalaNow at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Ujuñña on some businessThen he addressed a manPlease mister go to the Buddha and in my name bow with your head to his feet Ask him if he is healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyAnd then saySir King Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see you today when he has finished breakfastYes Your Majesty that man repliedHe did as the king askedThe sisters Somā and Sakulā heard thisWhile the meal was being served they approached the king and saidGreat king since you are going to the Buddha please bow in our name with your head to his feet Ask him if he is healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyWhen he had finished breakfast King Pasenadi went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir the sisters Somā and Sakulā bow with their heads to your feet They ask if you are healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyBut great king couldnt they get any other messengerSo Pasenadi explained the circumstances of the messageThe Buddha said May the sisters Somā and Sakulā be happy great kingThen the king said to the BuddhaI have heard sir that the ascetic Gotama says thisThere is no ascetic or brahmin who will claim to be allknowing and allseeing to know and see everything without exception that is not possibleDo those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth Is their explanation in line with the teaching Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticismGreat king those who say this do not repeat what I have said They misrepresent me with what is false and untrueThen King Pasenadi addressed General ViḍūḍabhaGeneral who introduced this topic of discussion to the royal compoundIt was Sañjaya great king the brahmin of the kāsa clanThen the king addressed a manPlease mister in my name tell Sañjaya thatKing Pasenadi summons himYes Your Majesty that man replied He did as the king askedThen the king said to the BuddhaSir might the Buddha have spoken in reference to one thing but that person believed it was something elseHow then do you recall making this statementGreat king I recall making this statementThere is no ascetic or brahmin who knows all and sees all simultaneously that is not possibleWhat the Buddha says appears reasonableSir there are these four classesaristocrats brahmins merchants and workersIs there any difference between themOf the four classes two are said to be preeminentthe aristocrats and the brahminsThat is when it comes to bowing down rising up greeting with joined palms and observing proper etiquetteSir I am not asking you about the present lifebut about the life to comeGreat king there are these five factors that support meditationWhat fiveIts when a mendicant has faith in the Realized Ones awakeningThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedThey are rarely ill or unwell Their stomach digests well being neither too hot nor too cold but just right and fit for meditationTheyre not devious or deceitful They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companionsThey live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities Theyre strong staunchly vigorous not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualitiesTheyre wise They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble penetrative and leads to the complete ending of sufferingThese are the five factors that support meditationThere are these four classesaristocrats brahmins merchants and workersIf they had these five factors that support meditationthat would be for their lasting welfare and happinessSir there are these four classesaristocrats brahmins merchants and workersIf they had these five factors that support meditationwould there be any difference between themIn that case I say it is the diversity of their efforts in meditationSuppose there was a pair of elephants or horses or oxen in training who were well tamed and well trained And there was a pair who were not tamed or trainedWhat do you think great kingWouldnt the pair that was well tamed and well trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamedYes sirBut would the pair that was not tamed and trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamed just like the tamed pairNo sirIn the same way there are things that must be attained by someone with faith health integrity energy and wisdom Its not possible for a faithless unhealthy deceitful lazy witless person to attain themWhat the Buddha says appears reasonableSir there are these four classesaristocrats brahmins merchants and workersIf they had these five factors that support meditation and if they practiced rightlywould there be any difference between themIn that case I say that there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the otherSuppose a person took dry teak wood and lit a fire and produced heatThen another person did the same using sāl woodanother used mango woodwhile another used wood of the cluster figWhat do you think great kingWould there be any difference between the fires produced by these different kinds of wood that is in the flame color or lightNo sirIn the same way when fire has been kindled by energy and produced by effort I say that there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the otherWhat the Buddha says appears reasonableBut sir do gods absolutely existBut what exactly are you askingWhether those gods come back to this state of existence or notThose gods who are subject to affliction come back to this state of existence but those free of affliction do not come backWhen he said this General Viḍūḍabha said to the BuddhaSir will the gods subject to affliction topple or expel from their place the gods who are free of afflictionThen Venerable nanda thoughtThis General Viḍūḍabha is King Pasenadis sonand I am the Buddhas sonNow is the time for one son to confer with anotherSo nanda addressed General ViḍūḍabhaWell then general Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you likeWhat do you think generalAs far as the dominion of King Pasenadi of Kosala extends where he rules as sovereign lord can he topple or expel from that place any ascetic or brahmin regardless of whether they are good or bad or whether or not they are genuine spiritual practitionersHe can misterWhat do you think generalAs far as the dominion of King Pasenadi does not extend where he does not rule as sovereign lord can he topple or expel from that place any ascetic or brahmin regardless of whether they are good or bad or whether or not they are genuine spiritual practitionersHe cannot misterWhat do you think generalHave you heard of the gods of the ThirtyThreeYes misterIve heard of themand so has the good King PasenadiWhat do you think generalCan King Pasenadi topple or expel from their place the gods of the ThirtyThreeKing Pasenadi cant even see the gods of the ThirtyThree so how could he possibly topple or expel them from their placeIn the same way general the gods subject to affliction cant even see the gods who are free of affliction so how could they possibly topple or expel them from their placeThen the king said to the BuddhaSir what is this mendicants namenanda great kingA joy he is and a joy he seemsWhat Venerable nanda says seems reasonableBut sir does Brahmā absolutely existBut what exactly are you askingWhether that Brahmā comes back to this state of existence or notAny Brahmā who is subject to affliction comes back to this state of existence but those free of affliction do not come backThen a certain man said to the kingGreat king Sañjaya the brahmin of the kāsa clan has comeThen King Pasenadi asked SañjayaBrahmin who introduced this topic of discussion to the royal compoundIt was General Viḍūḍabha great kingBut Viḍūḍabha saidIt was Sañjaya great king the brahmin of the kāsa clanThen a certain man said to the kingIts time to depart great kingSo the king said to the BuddhaSir I asked you about omniscience and you answeredI like and accept this and am satisfied with itI asked you about the four classesabout the godsand about Brahmā and you answered in each caseWhatever I asked the Buddha about he answeredI like and accept this and am satisfied with itWell now sir I must goI have many duties and much to doPlease great king go at your convenienceThen King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what the Buddha said Then he got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leavingMiddle DiscoursesThe Simile of the QuailSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Northern paṇas near the town of theirs named paṇaThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered paṇa for almsHe wandered for alms in paṇa After the meal on his return from almsround he went to a certain forest grove for the days meditationHaving plunged deep into it he sat at the root of a certain tree for the days meditationVenerable Udāyī also robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered paṇa for almsHe wandered for alms in paṇa After the meal on his return from almsround he went to a certain forest grove for the days meditationHaving plunged deep into it he sat at the root of a certain tree for the days meditationThen as Venerable Udāyī was in private retreat this thought came to his mindThe Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happinessHe has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful thingsThen in the late afternoon Udāyī came out of retreat and went to the BuddhaHe bowed sat down to one side and said to himJust now sir as I was in private retreat this thought came to mindThe Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happinessHe has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful thingsFor we used to eat in the evening the morning and at the wrong time of dayBut then there came a time when the Buddha addressed the mendicants sayingPlease mendicants give up that meal at the wrong time of dayAt that sir we became sad and upsetBut these faithful householders give us a variety of delicious foods at the wrong time of day And the Blessed One tells us to give it up The Holy One tells us to let it goBut when we considered our love and respect for the Buddha and our sense of conscience and prudence we gave up that meal at the wrong time of dayThen we ate in the evening and the morningBut then there came a time when the Buddha addressed the mendicants sayingPlease mendicants give up that meal at the wrong time of nightAt that sir we became sad and upsetBut thats considered the more delicious of the two meals And the Blessed One tells us to give it up The Holy One tells us to let it goOnce it so happened that a certain person got some soup during the day He saidCome lets set this aside well enjoy it together this eveningNearly all meals are prepared at night only a few in the dayBut when we considered our love and respect for the Buddha and our sense of conscience and prudence we gave up that meal at the wrong time of nightIn the past mendicants went wandering for alms in the dark of the night They walked into a swamp or fell into a sewer or collided with a thorn bush or collided with a sleeping cow or encountered youths escaping a crime or on their way to commit one or were invited by a female to commit a lewd actOnce it so happened that I wandered for alms in the dark of the nightA woman washing a pot saw me by a flash of lightningStartled she cried outBloody hell A goblins upon meWhen she said this I said to herSister I am no goblinIm a mendicant waiting for almsThen its a mendicant whose ma died and pa diedYoud be better off having your belly sliced open with a meat cleaver than to wander for alms in the dark of night for the sake of your bellyRecollecting that I thoughtThe Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happinessHe has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful thingsThis is exactly what happens when some foolish people are told by me to give something up They sayWhat such a trivial insignificant thing as this This ascetic is much too strictThey dont give it up and they nurse bitterness towards meand for the mendicants who want to train that becomes a strong firm stout bond a tie that has not rotted and a heavy yokeSuppose a quail was tied with a vine and was waiting there to be injured caged or killedWould it be right to say thatfor that quail that vine is weak feeble rotten and insubstantialFor that quail that vine is a strong firm stout bond a tie that has not rotted and a heavy yokeIn the same way when some foolish people are told by me to give something up they sayWhat such a trivial insignificant thing as this This ascetic is much too strictThey dont give it up and they nurse bitterness towards meand for the mendicants who want to train that becomes a strong firm stout bond a tie that has not rotted and a

Holy One tells us to let it goThey give it up and they dont nurse bitterness towards meand when the mendicants who want to train have given that up they live relaxed unruffled surviving on charity their hearts free as a wild deerFor them that bond is weak feeble rotten and insubstantialSuppose there was a royal bull elephant with tusks like chariotpoles able to draw a heavy load pedigree and battlehardened And it was bound with a strong harness But just by twisting its body a little it would break apart its bonds and go wherever it wantsWould it be right to say thatfor that bull elephant

beset themThey tolerate them and dont give them up get rid of them eliminate them and obliterate themI call this person fettered not detachedWhy is thatBecause I understand the diversity of faculties as it applies to this personTake another person practicing to give up and let go of attachmentsAs they do so memories and thoughts connected with attachments beset themThey dont tolerate them but give them up get rid of them eliminate them and obliterate themI call this person fettered not detachedWhy is thatBecause I understand the diversity of faculties as it applies to this personTake another person practicing to give up and let go of attachmentsAs they do so every so often they lose mindfulness and memories and thoughts connected with attachments beset themTheir mindfulness is slow to come upbut they quickly give up get rid of eliminate and obliterate those thoughtsSuppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day and a person let two or three drops of water fall onto itThe drops would be slow to fall but theyd quickly dry up and evaporateIn the same way take a person practicing to give up and let go of attachmentsAs they do so every so often they lose mindfulness and memories and thoughts connected with attachments beset themTheir mindfulness is slow to come upbut they quickly give them up get rid of eliminate and obliterate those thoughtsI also call this person fettered not detachedWhy is thatBecause I understand the diversity of faculties as it applies to this personTake another person who understanding that attachment is the root of sufferingis freed with the ending of attachmentsI call this person detached not fetteredWhy is thatBecause I understand the diversity of faculties as it applies to this personThese are the four people found in the worldUdāyī these are the five kinds of sensual stimulationWhat fiveSights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingSounds known by the ear Smells known by the nose Tastes known by the tongue Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingThese are the five kinds of sensual stimulationThe pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasurea filthy ordinary ignoble pleasure Such pleasure should not be cultivated or developed but should be feared I sayTake a mendicant who quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionThis is called the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of awakening Such pleasure should be cultivated and developed and should not be feared I sayTake a mendicant who quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorptionThis belongs to the perturbable I sayAnd what there belongs to the perturbableWhatever placing of the mind and keeping it connected has not ceased there is what belongs to the perturbableTake a mendicant who as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled enters and remains in the second absorptionThis belongs to the perturbable I sayAnd what there belongs to the perturbableWhatever rapture and bliss has not ceased there is what belongs to the perturbableTake a mendicant who with the fading away of rapture enters and remains in the third absorptionThis belongs to the perturbableAnd what there belongs to the perturbableWhatever equanimous bliss has not ceased there is what belongs to the perturbableTake a mendicant who giving up pleasure and pain enters and remains in the fourth absorptionThis belongs to the imperturbableTake a mendicant who quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorptionBut this is not enough I say give it up go beyond itAnd what goes

go beyond itAnd what goes beyond itTake a mendicant who with the fading away of rapture enters and remains in the third absorption That goes beyond itBut this too is not enough I say give it up go beyond itAnd what goes beyond itTake a mendicant who giving up pleasure and pain enters and remains in the fourth absorption That goes beyond itBut this too is not enough I say give it up go beyond itAnd what goes beyond itTake a mendicant who going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space That goes beyond itBut this too is not enough I say give it up go beyond itAnd what goes beyond itTake a mendicant who going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness That goes beyond itBut this too is not enough I say give it up

perception nor nonperceptionDo you see any fetter large or small that I dont recommend giving upNo sirThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable Udāyī was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Analysis of NonConflictSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants I shall teach you the analysis of nonconflictListen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisDont indulge in sensual

understanding the middle way of practice which gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishmentKnow what it means to flatter and to rebukeKnowing these avoid

pleasant sensual and arousingSounds known by the ear Smells known by the nose Tastes known by the tongue Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingThese are the five kinds of sensual stimulationThe pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasurea filthy common ignoble pleasureSuch pleasure should not be cultivated or developed but should be feared I sayNow take a mendicant who quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedAs the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionThis is called the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of awakeningSuch pleasure should be cultivated and developed and should not be feared I sayKnow how to assess different kinds of pleasureKnowing this pursue inner blissThats what I said and this is why I said itDont talk behind peoples

gentleman practices the way of nonconflictThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith BrahmāyuSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Videhans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicantsNow at that time the brahmin Brahmāyu was residing in Mithilā He was old elderly and senior advanced in years having reached the final stage of life he was a hundred and twenty years old He had mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knew philology and grammar and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great manIt seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyis wandering in the land of the Videhans together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicantsHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe explains a teaching thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureIts good to see such perfected onesNow at that time the brahmin Brahmāyu had a student named Uttara He too had mastered the Vedic curriculumBrahmāyu told Uttara of the Buddhas presence in the land of the Videhans and addedPlease dear Uttara go to the ascetic Gotama and find out whether or not he lives up to his reputationThrough you I shall learn about Master GotamaBut sir how shall I find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives up to his reputationDear Uttara the thirtytwo marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies no otherIf he stays at home he becomes a king a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king His dominion extends to all four sides he achieves stability in the country and he possesses the seven treasuresHe has the following seven treasuresthe wheel the elephant the horse the jewel the woman the treasurer and the counselor as the seventh treasureHe has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic crushing the armies of his enemiesAfter conquering this land girt by sea he reigns by principle without rod or swordBut if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness he becomes a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha who draws back the veil from the worldBut dear Uttara I am the one who gives the hymnsand you are the one who receives themYes sir replied Uttara He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled Brahmāyu before setting out for the land of the Videhans where the Buddha was wanderingTraveling stage by stage he came to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideand scrutinized his body for the thirtytwo marks of a great manHe saw all of them except for twowhich he had doubts aboutwhether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongueThen it occurred to the BuddhaThis brahmin student Uttara sees all the marks except for twowhich he has doubts aboutwhether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongueSo the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Uttara would see his retracted private partsAnd he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils and covered his entire forehead with his tongueThen Uttara thoughtThe ascetic Gotama possesses the thirtytwo marksWhy dont I follow him and observe his deportmentSo Uttara followed the Buddha like a shadow for seven monthsWhen seven months had passed he set out wandering towards MithilāThere he approached the brahmin Brahmāyu bowed and sat down to one sideBrahmāyu said to himWell dear Uttara does Master Gotama live up to his reputation or notHe does sirMaster Gotama possesses the thirtytwo marksHe has wellplanted feetOn the soles of his feet there are thousandspoked wheels with rims and hubs complete in every detailHe has projecting heelsHe has long fingersHis hands and feet are tenderHis hands and feet cling gracefullyHis feet are archedHis calves are like those of an antelopeWhen standing upright and not bending over the palms of both hands touch the kneesHis private parts are retractedHe is gold colored his skin has a golden sheenHe has delicate skin so delicate that dust and dirt dont stick to his bodyHis hairs grow one per poreHis hairs stand up theyre blueblack and curl clockwiseHis body is as straight as BrahmāsHe has bulging muscles in seven placesHis chest is like that of a lionThe gap between the shoulderblades is filled inHe has the proportional circumference of a banyan tree the span of his arms equals the height of his bodyHis torso is cylindricalHe has an excellent sense of tasteHis jaw is like that of a lionHe has forty teethHis teeth are evenHis teeth have no gapsHis teeth are perfectly whiteHe has a large tongueHe has the voice of Brahmā like a cuckoos callHis eyes are deep blueHe has eyelashes like a cowsBetween his eyebrows there grows a tuft soft and white like cottonwoolHis head is shaped like a turbanThese are the thirtytwo marks of a great man possessed by Master GotamaWhen hes walking he takes the first step with the right footHe doesnt lift his foot too far or place it too nearHe doesnt walk too slow or too fastHe walks without knocking his knees or ankles togetherWhen hes walking he keeps his thighs neither too straight nor too bent neither too tight nor too looseWhen he walks only the lower half of his body moves and he walks effortlesslyWhen he turns to look he does so with the whole bodyHe doesnt look directly up or downHe doesnt look all around while walking but focuses a ploughs length in front Beyond that he has unhindered knowledge and visionWhen entering an inhabited area he keeps his body neither too straight nor too bent neither too tight nor too looseHe turns around neither too far nor too close to the seat He doesnt lean on his hand when sitting down And he doesnt just plonk his body down on the seatWhen sitting in inhabited areas he doesnt fidget with his hands or feetHe doesnt sit with his knees or ankles crossedHe doesnt sit with his hand holding his chinWhen sitting in inhabited areas he doesnt cower or shake or tremble or get anxious and so he is not nervous at allWhen sitting in inhabited areas he still practices seclusionWhen receiving water for rinsing the bowl he holds the bowl neither too straight nor too bent neither too tight nor too looseHe receives neither too little nor too much waterHe rinses the bowl without making a sloshing noise or spinning it around He doesnt put the bowl on the ground to rinse his hands his hands and bowl are rinsed at the same timeHe doesnt throw the bowl rinsing water away too far or too near or splash it aboutWhen receiving rice he holds the bowl neither too straight nor too bent neither too close nor too looseHe receives neither too little nor too much riceHe eats sauce in a moderate proportion and doesnt spend too much time saucing his portionsHe chews over each portion two or three times before swallowingBut no grain of rice enters his body unchewed and none remain in his mouthOnly then does he raise another portion to his lipsHe eats experiencing the taste but without experiencing greed for the tasteHe eats food thinking of eight reasonsNot for fun indulgence adornment or decoration but only to sustain this body to avoid harm and to support spiritual practice In this way I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort and I will live blamelessly and at easeAfter eating when receiving water for washing the bowl he holds the bowl neither too straight nor too bent neither too tight nor too looseHe receives neither too little nor too much waterHe washes the bowl without making a sloshing noise or spinning it around He doesnt put the bowl on the ground to wash his hands his hands and bowl are washed at the same timeHe doesnt throw the bowl washing water away too far or too near or splash it aboutAfter eating he doesnt put the bowl on the ground too far away or too close Hes not careless with his bowl nor does he spend too much time on itAfter eating he sits for a while in silence but doesnt wait too long to give the verses of appreciationAfter eating he expresses appreciation without criticizing the meal or expecting another oneInvariably he educates encourages fires up and inspires that assembly with a Dhamma talkThen he gets up from his seat and leavesHe walks neither too fast nor too slow without wanting to get out of thereHe wears his robe on his body neither too high nor too low neither too tight nor too looseThe wind doesnt blow his robe off his bodyAnd dust and dirt dont stick to his bodyWhen he has gone to the monastery he sits on a seat spread out and washes his feetBut he doesnt waste time with pedicuresWhen he has washed his feet he sits down crosslegged with his body straight and establishes mindfulness right thereHe has no intention to hurt himself hurt others or hurt bothHe only wishes for the welfare of himself of others of both and of the whole worldIn the monastery when he teaches Dhamma to an assembly he neither flatters them nor rebukes themInvariably he educates encourages fires up and inspires that assembly with a Dhamma talkHis voice has eight qualitiesit is clear comprehensible charming audible rounded undistorted deep and resonantHe makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as the assembly goes but it doesnt extend outside the assemblyAnd when theyve been inspired with a Dhamma talk by Master Gotama they get up from their seats and leave looking back at him alone and not forgetting their lessonI have seen Master Gotama walking and standing entering inhabited areas and sitting and eating there sitting silently after eating and expressing appreciation going to the monastery sitting silently there and teaching Dhamma to an assembly thereSuch is Master Gotama such he is and more than thatWhen he had spoken the brahmin Brahmāyu got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and uttered this aphorism three timesHomage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaHomage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaHomage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaHopefully some time or other Ill get to meet him and we can have a discussionAnd then the Buddha traveling stage by stage in the Videhan lands arrived at Mithilāwhere he stayed in the Makhādeva Mango GroveThe brahmins and householders of Mithilā heardIt seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Mithilā where he is staying in the Makhādeva Mango GroveHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureIts good to see such perfected onesThen the brahmins and householders of Mithilā went up to the Buddha Before sitting down to one side some bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silentThe brahmin Brahmāyu also heard that the Buddha had arrivedSo he went to the Makhādeva Mango Grove together with several disciplesNot far from the grove he thoughtIt wouldnt be appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama without first letting him knowSo he addressed one of his studentsHere student go to the ascetic Gotama and in my name bow with your head to his feet Ask him if he is healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyAnd then sayMaster Gotama the brahmin Brahmāyu is old elderly and senior advanced in years having reached the final stage of life he is a hundred and twenty years old He has mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knows philology and grammar and is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great manOf all the brahmins and householders residing in Mithilā Brahmāyu is said to be the foremost inlifespan and fameHe wants to see Master GotamaYes sir that student replied He did as he was asked and the Buddha saidPlease student let Brahmāyu come when hes readyThe student went back to Brahmāyu and said to himYour request for an audience with the ascetic Gotama has been grantedPlease go at your convenienceThen the brahmin Brahmāyu went up to the BuddhaThe assembly saw him coming off in the distanceand made way for him as he was wellknown and famousBrahmāyu said to that retinueEnough gentlemenPlease sit on your own seatsI shall sit here by the ascetic GotamaThen the brahmin Brahmāyu went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideand scrutinized the Buddhas body for the thirtytwo marks of a great manHe saw all of them except for twowhich he had doubts aboutwhether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongueThen Brahmāyu addressed the Buddha in verseI have learned of the thirtytwomarks of a great manThere are two that I dont seeon the body of the ascetic GotamaAre the private parts retractedO supreme personThough called by a word of the feminine genderperhaps your tongue is a manly onePerhaps your tongue is largeas we have been informedPlease stick it out in its full extentand so O hermit dispel my doubtFor my welfare and benefit in this lifeand happiness in the nextAnd I ask you to grant the opportunityto ask whatever I desireThen the Buddha thoughtBrahmāyu sees all the marks except for twowhich he has doubts aboutwhether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongueSo the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Brahmāyu would see his retracted private partsAnd he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils and covered his entire forehead with his tongueThen the Buddha replied to Brahmāyu in verseThe thirtytwo marks of a great manthat you have learnedare all found on my bodyso do not doubt brahminI have known what should be knownand developed what should be developedand given up what should be given upand so brahmin I am a BuddhaFor your welfare and benefit in this lifeand happiness in the nextI grant you the opportunityto ask whatever you desireThen Brahmāyu thoughtMy request has been grantedShould I ask him aboutwhat is beneficial in this life or the nextThen he thoughtIm well versed in the benefits that apply to this lifeand others ask me about thisWhy dont I ask the ascetic Gotama about the benefit that specifically applies to lives to comeSo Brahmāyu addressed the Buddha in verseHow do you become a brahminAnd how do you become a knowledge masterHow a master of the three knowledgesAnd how is one called a scholarHow do you become a perfected oneAnd how a consummate oneHow do you become a sageAnd how is one declared to be awakenedThen the Buddha replied to Brahmāyu in verseOne who knows their past livesand sees heaven and places of lossand has attained the end of rebirththat sage has perfect insightThey know their mind is purecompletely freed from greedtheyve given up birth and deathand have completed the spiritual journeyGone beyond all thingssuch a one is declared to be awakenedWhen he said this Brahmāyu got up from his seat and arranged his robe on one shoulder He bowed with his head to the Buddhas feet caressing them and covering them with kisses and pronounced his nameI am the brahmin Brahmāyu Master GotamaI am the brahmin BrahmāyuThen that assembly their minds full of wonder and amazement thoughtIts incredible its amazingthat Brahmāyu who is so wellknown and famous should show the Buddha such utmost devotionThen the Buddha said to BrahmāyuEnough brahmin Get up and sit in your own seat since your mind has such confidence in meSo Brahmāyu got up and sat in his own seatThen the Buddha taught him step by step witha talk on giving ethical conduct and heavenHe explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures so sordid and corrupt and the benefit of renunciationAnd when the Buddha knew that Brahmāyus mind was ready pliable rid of hindrances joyful and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhassuffering its origin its cessation and the pathJust as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dyein that very seat the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin BrahmāyuEverything that has a beginning has an endThen Brahmāyu saw attained understood and fathomed the Dhamma He went beyond doubt got rid of indecision and became selfassured and independent of others regarding the Teachers instructions He said to the BuddhaExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeWould you and the mendicant Saṅgha please accept a meal from me tomorrowThe Buddha consented in silenceThen knowing that the Buddha had consented Brahmāyu got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leavingAnd when the night had passed Brahmāyu had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home Then he had the Buddha informed of the time sayingIts time Master Gotama the meal is readyThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of the brahmin Brahmāyu where he sat on the seat spread out together with the Saṅgha of mendicantsFor seven days Brahmāyu served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foodsWhen the seven days had passed the Buddha departed to wander in the Videhan landsNot long after the Buddha left Brahmāyu passed awayThen several mendicants went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir Brahmāyu has passed awayWhere has he been reborn in his next lifeMendicants the brahmin Brahmāyu was astute He practiced in line with the teachings and did not trouble me about the teachingsWith the ending of the five lower fetters hes been reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there not liable to return from that worldThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith Prince AbhayaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding groundThen Prince Abhaya went up to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta bowed and sat down to one sideNigaṇṭha Nātaputta said to himCome prince refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrineThen you will get a good reputationPrince Abhaya refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama so mighty and powerfulBut sir how am I to do thisHere prince go to the ascetic Gotama and say to himSir might the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by othersWhen hes asked this if he answersHe might prince say this to himThen sir what exactly is the difference between you and an ordinary personFor even an ordinary person might utter speech that is disliked by othersBut if he answersHe would not prince say this to himThen sir why exactly did you declare of DevadattaDevadatta is going to a place of loss to hell there to remain for an eon irredeemableDevadatta was angry and upset with what you saidWhen you put this dilemma to him the Buddha wont be able to either spit it out or swallow it downHell be like a man with an iron cross stuck in his throat unable to either spit it out or swallow it downYes sir replied Abhaya He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta keeping him on his right Then he went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one sideThen he looked up at the sun and thoughtIts too late to refute the Buddhas doctrine todayI shall refute his doctrine in my own home tomorrow He said to the BuddhaSir may the Buddha please accept tomorrows meal from me together with three other monksThe Buddha consented in silenceThen knowing that the Buddha had consented Abhaya got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leavingThen when the night had passed the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to Abhayas home and sat down on the seat spread outThen Abhaya served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foodsWhen the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Abhaya took a low seat sat to one sideand said to himSir might the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by othersThis is no simple matter princeThen the Jains have lost in this sirBut prince why do you say thatthe Jains have lost in thisThen Abhaya told the Buddha all that had happenedNow at that time a little baby boy was sitting in Prince Abhayas lapThen the Buddha said to AbhayaWhat do you think princeIfbecause of your negligence or his nurses negligenceyour boy was to put a stick or stone in his mouth what would you do to himId try to take it out sirIf that didnt work Id hold his head with my left hand and take it out using a hooked finger of my right hand even if it drew bloodWhy is thatBecause I have compassion for the boy sirIn the same way prince the Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue false and harmful and which is disliked by othersThe Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be true and substantive but which is harmful and disliked by othersThe Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what he knows to be true substantive and beneficial but which is disliked by othersThe Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue false and harmful but which is liked by othersThe Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be true and substantive but which is harmful even if it is liked by othersThe Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what he knows to be true substantive and beneficial and which is liked by othersWhy is thatBecause the Realized One has compassion for sentient beingsSir there are clever aristocrats brahmins householders or ascetics who come to see you with a question already plannedDo you think beforehand that if they ask you like this youll answer like that or does the answer just appear to you on the spotWell then prince Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you likeWhat do you think princeAre you skilled in the various parts of a chariotI am sirWhat do you think princeWhen they come to you and askWhats the name of this chariot partDo you think beforehand that if they ask you like this youll answer like that or does the answer appear to you on the spotSir Im wellknown as a charioteer skilled in a chariots partsAll the parts are wellknown to meThe answer just appears to me on the spotIn the same way when clever aristocrats brahmins householders or ascetics come to see me with a question already planned the answer just appears to me on the spotWhy is thatBecause the Realized One has clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings so that the answer just appears to him on the spotWhen he had spoken Prince Abhaya said to the BuddhaExcellent sir Excellent From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesJungle ThicketsSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the

remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesAdvice to AnāthapiṇḍikaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was sick suffering gravely illThen he addressed a manPlease mister go to the Buddha and in my name bow with your head to his feet Say to himSir the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is sick suffering gravely illHe bows with his head to your feetThen go to Venerable Sāriputta and in my name bow with your head to his feet Say to himSir the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is sick suffering gravely illHe bows with his head to your feetAnd then saySir please visit him at his home out of compassionYes sir that man repliedHe did as Anāthapiṇḍika askedSāriputta consented in silenceThen Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went with Venerable nanda as his second monk to Anāthapiṇḍikas homeHe sat down on the seat spread out and said to AnāthapiṇḍikaHouseholder I hope youre keeping well I hope youre alright And I hope the pain is fading not growing that its fading is evident not its growingIm not keeping well Master Sāriputta Im not alrightThe pain is terrible and growing not fading its growing not its fading is evidentThe winds piercing my head are so severe it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp pointThe pain in my head is so severe it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my headThe winds piercing my belly are so severe it feels like a deft butcher or their apprentice is slicing my belly open with a meat cleaverThe burning in my body is so severe it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals Thats how severe the burning is in my bodyIm not keeping well Master Sāriputta Im not alrightThe pain is terrible and growing not fading its growing not its fading is evidentThats

himAre you failing householder Are you fading householderBut for a long time I have paid homage to the Buddha and the esteemed mendicantsYet I have never before heard such a Dhamma talkHouseholder it does not occur to us to teach such a Dhamma talk to whiteclothed laypeopleRather we teach like this to those gone forthWell then Master Sāriputta let it occur to you to teach such a Dhamma talk to whiteclothed laypeople as wellThere are gentlemen with little dust in their eyes Theyre in decline because they havent heard the teachingThere will be those who understand the teachingAnd when the venerables Sāriputta and nanda had given the householder Anāthapiṇḍika this advice they got up from their seat and leftNot long after they had left Anāthapiṇḍika passed away and was reborn in the host of Joyful GodsThen late at night the glorious god Anāthapiṇḍika lighting up the entire Jetas Grove went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one sideand addressed the Buddha in verseThis is indeed that Jetas Grovefrequented by the Saṅgha of hermitswhere the King of Dhamma stayedit brings me joyDeeds knowledge and principleethical conduct an excellent livelihoodby these are mortals purifiednot by clan or wealthThats why an astute personseeing whats good for themselveswould examine the teaching rationallyand thus be purified in itSāriputta has true wisdomethics and also peaceAny mendicant who has crossed overcan at best equal himThis is what the god Anāthapiṇḍika saidand the teacher approvedThen the god Anāthapiṇḍikaknowing that the teacher approved bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before vanishing right thereThen when the night had passed the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happenedWhen he had spoken Venerable nanda said to the BuddhaSir that god must surely have been AnāthapiṇḍikaFor the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was devoted to Venerable SāriputtaGood good nandaYouve reached the logical conclusion as far as logic goesFor that was indeed the god AnāthapiṇḍikaThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants a trapper doesnt cast bait for deer thinkingMay the deer enjoying this bait be healthy and in good condition May they live long and prosperA trapper casts bait for deer thinkingWhen these deer intrude on where I cast the bait theyll recklessly enjoy eating it Theyll become indulgent then theyll become negligent and then theyll be vulnerable on account of this baitAnd indeed the first herd of deer intruded on where the trapper cast the bait and recklessly enjoyed eating it They became indulgent then they became negligent and then they were vulnerable to the trapper on account of that baitAnd thats how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the trappers powerSo then a second herd of deer thought up a planThe first herd of deer became indulgent and failed to get free of the trappers powerWhy dont we avoid eating the bait altogether Avoiding dangerous food we can venture deep into a wilderness region and live thereAnd thats just what they didBut when it came to the last month of summer the grass and water ran out Their bodies became much too thinand they lost their strength and energySo they went back to that same place where the trapper had cast baitIntruding on that place they recklessly enjoyed eating it And thats how the second herd failed to get free from the trappers powerSo then a third herd of deer thought up a planThe first and second herds of deer failed to get free of the trappers powerWhy dont we set up our lair close by the place where the trapper has cast the baitThen we can intrude on it and enjoy eating without being reckless We wont become indulgent then we wont become negligent and then we wont be vulnerable to the trapper on account of that baitAnd thats just what they didSo the trapper and his companions thoughtWow this third herd of deer is so sneaky and devious they must be some kind of unnatural spirits with psychic powerFor they eat the bait weve cast without us knowing how they come and goWhy dont we surround the bait on all sides by staking out high nets Hopefully we might get to see their lair where they go to hide out
