Herein the nondelusion is the cause and that it establishes two ideas namely the undistorted seeing in right view and the directaddressing  in right mindfulness this is its outcomeThe fruit of this divine life is the two kinds of deliverance namely the heartdeliverance due to fading of lust and the understanding deliverance due to fading of ignorance This is the fruitSo these three roots of the profitable have been demonstrated as to cause as to outcome and as to fruitThis is how the kinds of the profitable can be penetrated as shared in commonNow here is a relevant verse The Stilled One dropped the beingdeterminant That gives existence measured and unmeasuredAs to  That gives existence measured and unmeasured  the measured is the determined and the unmeasured is the undeterminedThe unmeasured cannot be measured for two reasons The rejection  of the being determinants known therein is nongreedThe words happy in himself and concentrated which deny distraction signify nonhateSo these are the three roots of the profitable That gives existence measured and unmeasured   this is nondelusionthe greed for the beingdeterminants meeting together which is the gratification due to right concentration  is the causeThe breaking happy in oneself of the eggshell of ignorance is the outcomeThat is occurrence    These three roots of the profitable have now been demonstrated as to cause as to outcome and as to fruitUp to this point this is both occurrence and stopping It occurs by means of the roots of unprofit and it stops  by means of the roots of profit thus all the unprofitable meets together with these three roots of profitFor any  defilement verbally demonstrated in the True Idea too as say craving or as anger or as  unawareness  or  underlying tendency  as  contempt  or  domineering  as  unmindfulness  as  envy  or  avarice     as  unknowing   can be demonstrated  by those three basic examples too of which defilement in general these twoterm  Traces of the True Idea are demonstrated In fact there is no defilement that comes to be combined and to meet together in these nine terms And the roots of unprofit like the roots of profit can be demonstrated in the opposite senseHerein what is that expressed in terms of bodily action Let him do  profit by the body His body being then restrainedand There are these three kinds of good bodily conductabstention from killing breathing things  from taking what is not given abstention from misconduct in sensual desires    This is expressed in terms of bodily actionHerein what is that expressed in terms of verbal action The just say that what is well spoken is best  And speak what is right and not wrong for the secondand  This is expressed in terms of verbal actionHerein what is that expressed in terms of mental actionLet there be mental acts of profit Let him be well restrained in mindand  This is expressed in terms of mental actionThese are unshared ThreadsHerein what are Shared Threads Who guards his speech is well restrained in mind Does no unprofit through the bodys meansand  Bhikkhus there are these three purities  purity of bodily action purity of verbal action purity of mental actionHerein what is purity of bodily actionIt is abstention from killing breathing things abstention from taking what is not given abstention from misconduct in sensual desiresHerein what is purity of verbal actionIt is abstention from false speech  abstention from gossipHerein what is purity of mental actionIt is noncovetousness nonillwill right view  This is the shared type of ThreadThat is how shared Threads and unshared Threads can be penetratedAfter penetrating them thus the Threads meaning can be demonstrated as to speech and as to bodyHe is not one they call a pauper His life has not been lived in vain and all of and  the Blessed One   This is expressed in terms of the faith facultyHerein what is that expressed in terms of the energy faculty Instigate yourselves launch out devote Yourselves in the Enlightened Ones Dispensation and  This is expressed in terms of the energy facultyHerein what is that expressed in terms of the mindfulness faculty The mindful man has always  luck Let there be luck for the mindful manOne mindful always  comes off better One mindful easily succeeds and  can be quoted in detail This is expressed in terms of the mindfulness facultyHerein what is that expressed in terms of the concentration faculty Leader of men to be tamed When you intend No gods or men or even allThe whole array Of breathing things can know what is Thought in your mind Using the quiet concentration Without conflict and This is expressed in terms of the concentration facultyHerein what is that expressed in terms of the understanding faculty  in detailand  This is the type of Thread expressed in terms of the understanding faculty One not without lust for sense desires And whose five faculties are bluntCopy not such as him o bhikkhu   For he is still attached thereto  and namely the faithfaculty etc see the Indriya Samyutta andThese are Threads expressed in terms of the faculties sharedWhichever the faculty may be  whether its context  is that of profit or unprofit the Thread in question  should be demonstrated by those terms of expression no other idea than that should be demonstratedHerein the shared is only the profitable there is no profitable unprofitable as there are shared profitable roots and shared unprofitable roots  namely  and the right endeavours  are in  profitable and unprofitable contexts Here is a mnemonic verse When a man is engrossed in thoughts Also when giving a man is dearAnd then who always guards his speech   And the three kinds of PurityWho in a Perfect One has faith And what is taught in coarising So in the Elder MahaKaccayanaand likewise in the case of proseexpositions And thatand that he dies without remorse   this is the Outcomewho in the world Takes to himself what is not given Who goes too with anothers wifeWho has the habit to indulge In drinking spirituous liquor  and he who indulges  in drinking spirituous liquor finds like him who goes with anothers wife  that enemies spring upAnd likewise the false speech he speaks as already demonstrated is his state of a speaker of the illspoken This is expressed in terms of hateand that on the dissolution of the body he reappears in hell is the fruit  Were one to go the round of births As much as a hundred thousand aeonsOr even more than that besides Travelling on from womb to wombNever accepting the Buddhas word Accepting determinations as selfThat one shall make an end of pain Is utterly impossible when he does so through hate this is simply hate and when he does so through delusion this is simply delusionWhere one is demonstrable there  he demonstrates one  When a man strays from the True Idea Through will hate fear or else delusionHe finds his good fame wanes away As in its dark half does the moon Knowing the right amount in eating Faithful and energetic tooHim Mara sure no more can shake Than can the wind a rocky peak  Knowing the right amount in eating  is the abandoning of craving for tastesThe basis for nongreed is this namely skilled just as it is owing to understanding that he is so described as having understanding and owing to wisdom that he is so described as wisethat he is skilled is the outcomeis the fruitBest in the world is understanding The kind that deals with penetration The kind that rightly understands  The exhaustion of birth and death  and so it should be quoted for the rest of the four Truthsand that he is taintless and the words there is no more of this beyond  refer to knowledge of nonarising It is nongreed nonhate and nondelusionIt is the eight rightnesses  right view  down to  right concentrationand that nongreed moulds the three kinds of action namely the right intention right effort and right concentration this is the outcome of the nongreedand that it founds right speech right action and right livelihood this is its outcomeboth where there are two so shared and where there are threeAnd happy in himself and concentrated Selfexistence he sundered like a mailcoat Herein there are two ideas which as measured are determined namely gratification and disappointment and they are measured as follows   In the case of sensual desiresthe gratification is this muchthe disappointment is this much  and he understands extinction thus  in the case of this the escape is this it is not measured as follows  This is just so much there is not more of it past this point and then it is not measured in its wonderfulness by making some jewel reach it Herein the actofknowing and actofseeing that give existence to the profitable  are nondelusionwhich defilement is not greed and not hate and not delusionLeaving misconduct by the body Let him pursue good bodily conduct And speak what is kind not unkind for the third And speak what is trite and not false for the fourth Mental misconduct abandoning Pursuing good conduct in the mind  Who purifies this triple course of action Will win the path the Seers have divulged  Who in a Perfect One has faith Immovable and well establishedHerein what is that expressed in terms of the faith facultyWhose own good virtue is the kind Desired and praised by Noble OnesWith confidence in the Community Whose seeing has been straightened tooScatter the armies of Mortality As does an elephant a hut of reeds  If that has been said by the Blessed One sire then it is soso too Mallika no matter what the recluse Gotama says you

Three understandings are displayedNot without lust for sensedesires And so too the five  faculties  THUS have I heardOnce the Lord was staying at Savatthi in Anathapindikas park in the Jeta grove in the Kareri hutmentAnd among a number of monks who had gathered together after their meal after the almsround sitting in the Kareri pavilion there arose a serious discussion on former lives as they said This is how it was in a former life or That was how it was And the Lord with the purified divineear faculty surpassing the powers of humans heard what they were talking aboutGetting up from his seat he went to the Kareri pavilion sat down on the prepared seat and said Monks what was your conversation as you sat together What discussion did I interruptAnd they told him Well monks would you like to hear a proper discourse on past livesLord it is time for that WellFarer it is time for that If the Lord were to give a proper discourse on past lives the monks would listen and remember itWell then monks listen pay close attention and I will speakYes Lord the monks replied Monks ninetyone aeons ago the Lord the Arahant the fullyenlightened Buddha Vipassi arose in the worldThirty one aeons ago the Lord Buddha Sikhi aroseAnd in this present fortunate aeon the Lords Buddhas KakusandhaAnd monks in this present fortunate aeon I too have now arisen in the world as a fullyenlightened BuddhaThe Lord Buddha Vipassi was born of Khattiya race and arose in a Khattiya familyThe Lord Buddha Vipassi was of the Kondanna clanIn the time of the Lord Buddha Vipassi the lifespan was eighty thousand yearsIn my time the lifespan is short limited and quick to pass it is seldom that anybody lives to be a hundredThe Lord Buddha Vipassi gained his full enlightenment at the foot of a trumpetflower treeThe Lord Buddha Vipassi had the pair of noble disciples Khanda and TissaThe Lord Buddha Vipassi had three assemblies of disciplesone of a hundred thousand one of eighty thousand and one of seventy thousand monksall Arahants all ArahantsThe Lord Buddha Vipassis personal attendant was the monk AsokaThe Lord Buddha Vipassis father was King BandhumaThe Lord Buddha Sikhis father was

the Brahmin YannadattaThe king at that time was SobhaThe Lord Buddha Kassapas father was the Brahmin BrahmadattaThe king at that time was KikiAnd now monks my father was King Suddhodana my mother was Queen Maya and the royal capital was KapilavatthuThus the Lord spoke and the WellFarer then rose from his seat and went to his lodgingthe way he recalls past Buddhas who have gained Parinibbana having cut away the hindrances cut off the road of craving put an end to the round of becoming overcome all suffering He recalls their birth their name their clan their lifespan the disciples and assemblies connected with him Being bom thus these Blessed Lords were suchandsuch such were their names their clans their discipline their Dhamma their wisdom their liberationWell now friends how did the Tathagata come by the penetrative knowledge through which he remembers all this  Did some deva reveal this knowledge to himThis was the conversation of those monks which came to be interruptedThen the Lord rising from the seclusion of the restperiod went to the Kareri pavilion and sat down on the prepared seatHe said Monks what was your conversation as you sat together What discussion did I interruptAnd the monks told himThe Tathagata understands these thingsby his own penetration of the principles of Dhamma and devas too have told himWell monks do you wish to hear still more about past lives Lord it is time for that WellFarer it is time for that If the Lord were to give a proper discourse on past lives the monks would listen and remember itWell then monks listen pay close attention

consecutivity thus  How then did he instigate this Thread in its beginning   etc  Is it construable with those Threads that are fully agreed upon  or is it not so construableAccording as the Blessed one teaches defilement there in the beginning it should be scrutinized as follows How then is the abandoning of those defilements taught there too or is it not taught If it is not taught then the profitable ideas which bring about the abandoning of those defilements must be sought in the kind of divine life lived under the Blessed One If in searching one does not find where those unprofitable ideas come to their abandonmentthen those unprofitable ideas must be reserved  and inquired into further taking the type of Thread in this case to be that Dealing with Corruption where no profit is explicitly taughtSo wherever on the level of any one of the four paths any defilements come to their abandonment any defilements so far not construable as opposites of noble ideas there in that particular plane say that of Seeing must be reserved  If when they are thus reserved they give the constructionstill that Thread must be inquired into herein in regard to those defilements as followsOr even if not capable of being demonstrated in thls way still the Thread need not on that account alone be the object of uncertainty Whatever the defilements as to how they are abandonableJust as in the case of the first statement   namely that of defilements coming first now again any noble ideas taught for the abandoning of any defilements must be investigated as to whether they are abandoned by these particular noble ideas or notIf when so scrutinized they are construable then they can be accepted as such For noble ideas do not arrive at the abandonment of defilements that are future  to them Neither does any noble idea alone indiscriminately bring about the abandoning of all defilementsAs for example while loving kindness is profitable and lust unprofitable yet taking loving kindness as profitable does not bring about the abandoning of lust it is in fact ill will not lust that comes to abandonment by means of lovingkindnessSo both sorts of defilement have to be scrutinizedIf these namely ill will and lust in this case  are construed when reserved then there is nothing more to be scrutinizedEither the two defilements may be abandonable by the one noble idea  or else either one of the two defilements may be abandonable by two noble ideas successivelyOr alternatively also when only one on being scrutinized is construed herein it must be inquired into how it is construed namely by which noble idea or it must be inquired into why it is that the Thread cannot  be demonstrated  for no Thread must remain an object of uncertainty Any defilements lapse  when any noble ideas that are taught must be scrutinized in both the ways indicated above for lovingkindness as followsOr conversely do these noble ideas lead to the abandonment of these defilementsstill not all unprofitable ideas come to abandonment indiscriminately by means of any profitable ideas indiscriminatelynor simply by taking a profitable idea in a given Thread  in this case lovingkindness does that lead to the abandonment of all defilements indiscriminatelyIn fact it is only when a noble idea belonging to a particular Thread is a defilements opposite that that defilement comes to be abandoned by means of that noble ideaHerein when the profitable taught in a particular verse or proseexposition in the Thread and the corruptions taught there do not construe or the noble ideas do not construe  these should be reserved in accordance with the parts of the formula for scrutinizing demonstrable in the Principal Appeals to Authority Herein if with the defilements taught and with that noble idea among the noble ideas those defilements do come to abandonmentFor there is one defilement abandonable by only one  noble idea not in any other way while view and lust  are abandonable by Seeing in the first Path not so ignorance which is only abandonable by ArahantshipAnd if ignorance or ideas belonging to the plane of KeepinginBeing ie the last three paths and second and third fruits are abandonable in this way regarded collectively under KeepinginBeingit is precisely that ignorance which belongs to the further side fetters which is abandoned through the kind of nonattention that is due to the deliverances signless heartconcentration for the purpose of seeing the undeterminedThat is how the Thread should be scrutinized in order to verify that it is When defilements are of the kind abandonable by Seeing then the noble idea is taught in the mood of Seeing when they are of the kind abandonable by KeepinginBeing then the noble idea is taught in the mood of KeepinginBeing When of the kind abandonable  by right use of the four requisites of the bhikkhus life then the noble idea is taught in the mood of right use  and so on from those abandonable by removal down to the end of the Thread dealing with the seven kinds of taints  which can be quotedIn so far as this defilement idea is abandonable in the various other stages than that of Seeing the noble idea will be appropriately taught in another mood and so that noble idea must be sought otherwise according to the moodIf this defilementidea gives the construing  for one when one is seeking it thus then in whichever mood that noble idea can be sought out that is the mood in which the particular defilement is abandonedAnd so that noble idea must be scrutinized therein with respect to the seven moods mentioned above and in so far as it is construable it can be acceptedbut in so far as it is not construable it cannot be accepted   which is demonstrable according to the prescribed way of searching in the Principal Appeals to Authority What is taught by the Blessed One is according to how things are  Whatever the idea taught profitable as well as unprofitable that ideas condition must be sought out for no idea arises unconditioned without a conditionHerein what is the mood for the searchHerein this Thread to be sought must be inqired into as to whether this  idea in question has been stated with the cause and with the condition appropriate theretoAnd the condition is of three kinds slight medium and outstandingWhen the condition is slight what is unoutstanding  owing to it must be soughtWhat is the reasonIt may be that a certain condition  comes to occurrence  or fulfilment through other conditionsHerein whatever the idea taught in this Thread that is being scrutinized the cause of that must be sought either through that idea or through a PathfunctionAnd like the condition the outcome of that idea must be sought by cause and by conditionThat condition should be sought in the way that one seeks how the basic state was demonstrated  in the terms of expression of the particular Thread for there is no slight idea that has an outstanding outcome nor  does any outstanding outcome have a slight conditionidea If  the slight is construable of the slight  the medim of the medium and the outstanding of the outstanding that can be accepted But if  it does not so construe it cannot be acceptedAnd whatever idea the Blessed One instigates initially in order to teach a particular teaching that he teaches also in the middle and the end of it  he demonstrates in the beginning the idea  according as it is given in the terms of expression of that particular teaching and only that idea appears much in it and is that Threads endfor it is in virtue of that idea that that Thread comes to be such as it is in type whether verse or proseexposition whether small or large  But as the fixing  is twofold namely fixing that is in conformity as well as fixing the actual teachingAnd just as the restraining of the five faculties of the eye etc taught by the Blessed One in having for its purpose the curbing of cravingteaches that that idea conveys his wish  as  in the simile of the Cattleherd Thread in the Anguttara  when tested also by means of other Threads that the Blessed One has uttered namely the thought  in the Majjhima Nikaya  it conveys his wish This is what is in conformity with the Blessed Ones teaching So this idea has to be sought also in other proseexpositions for it cannot be regarded as sought out in only a single ThreadWhen it construes it can be acceptedHerein what is the agreed When any Thread whatever is not uttered by the Blessed One and that Thread is found among the Threads tooThat Thread must be inquired into as follows   How then does this Thread allow of the Blessed Ones agreement or does it not allow of his agreement And some Threads allow of the Blessed Ones agreement  and some Threads do not allow of his agreementWhen someone teaches what is the Ten Powered Ones  province doing so altogether without giving a way of entry to the main ideas in his teaching  that Thread does not allow of the Blessed Ones agreement But there is also the kind of hearer who knows the Ten Powered Ones province doing so either limitedly or unlimitedly yet he does not know that power itself at all beyond the hearing of it as for instance in the case of the divine exhorted by the venerable Sariputta Now that venerable one had no Knowledge of Variety in Faculties and Powers  hence by his not knowing the Encompassing of Other Persons while the divine had more he could still have done ie by attaining the Noble Path he was made to reappear after death in the world of High Divinity and so the venerable Sariputta was not congratulated by the Blessed One And as for instance in the case of the venerable MahaKassapa  when he advised his nephew  though he the nephew was possessed of unprofitable action ripening straightway upon rebirth  the Elder lighting a finger by a feat of supernormal power   but since no  knowledge of how things are by cause and instance in the case of all Undertaking of Action existed in that venerable one hence the Blessed One  advised him saying Even o Kassapa if thou Wilt carry ten such luminariesAnd again like a messenger who informs a creature of the kings word so the mere emulator  teaches to others speech he does not himself understandA Thread which has the agreed approval can be accepted that which has not the agreed approval cannot be acceptedHerein what is MixingUp of ThreadsIf one type would requite he teaches another and he demonstrates in one type of Thread the meaning of another type of ThreadOr he demonstrates a Threads meaning  in several moods He demonstrates  in those dealing with Seeing the meaning of one dealing with MoralityHe demonstrates in the furtherside fetters the meaning of higherside fettersHe demonstrates in Threads dealing with outstanding faculties  the meaning of those dealing with blunt and medim faculties So this Thread is thus broken up by him The breaking up as to cause outcome and fruit as to the blunt medium and outstanding state  and as to meaning and phrasing is what is called MixingUp of ThreadsThe nonbreakingup is what is called  Investigation of Threads Herein this is a mnemonic verse The Elder MahaKaccayanasIf when the defilements or any one of themare thus reserved they still do not give the construing then the ideas belonging to the noble paths must be scrutinized as follows  Do these particular defilements come to abandonment in these particular planes namely those of Seeing and KeepinginBeing or do they not  Now a certain specific number of defilements may be taught eg the ten fetterswithout any correspondingly equal number of noble ideas being taught eg the four pathsDo two or three or more  defilements come to their abandonment by means of any single PathIf when thus inquired into they give the construction then that Thread must be scrutinized therein in regard to those defilements as followsWhat is the Threads meaning and what is not its meaning according to the traditional interpretation or by what is given in the textsrather it should be further investigated according as to whether the iaeas in the beginning are profitable instead of unprofitable  they must be scrutinizedwhether the profitable comes first or whether it is arrived at through its opposites coming first The teaching must be taken as having nothing lacking or superfluousbut if they are not so construable then any defilements that are not opposites of those particular noble ideas cannot be opposed to themand any idea so disclosed whether profitable or unprofitable must be reservedIt seems that these  particular defilements are taught in this verse or proseexposition How then are these defilements abandoned by these noble ideas or are they notFor although unprofitable ideas do come to abandonment by means of profitable ideasAs for example while lovingkindness is profitable and lust unprofitable yet taking lovingkindness as profitable and lust as unprofitable lust does not come to abandonment by means of lovingkindness  it is in fact ill will not lust that comes  to abandonment by means of loving kindness Consequently defilement does not come  to abandonment in a given Thread simply by taking it as  defilement indiscriminatelythen it should also be scrutinized as follows In which Pathfunction are these defilements abandonable In which Pathfunction  are these noble ideas taughtIn whichever mood that is as Seeing or as one of the stages of KeepinginBeing the noble ideas are taught that is the aspect in which this defilement stands in relation theretoThen if it still does not construe the meaning of the actual Thread itself which is being sought out by means of that already tested other Thread must be inquired intoHerein when the condition is slight the idea conditioned must be taken as slight That being so  this condition is again of two kinds condition in remote relation and condition in immediate proximity the fixing of that idea must also be sought as to whether it is in conformity  with other Threadsthen according as it is uttered by whomsoever it may be so it should be borne in mind Not even then will he see forms  That eye does not exist in him The Thread is fivefold the type of Thread Dealing with Corruption the type of Thread Dealing with Morality the type of Thread Dealing with Seeing the type of Thread Dealing with KeepinginBeing and the type of Thread Dealing with the Adept and in the establishing of the particular noble idea taught there he divulges  a meaning not there fourth chapter called the Investigation of Threads  Untornness

seven  Also a characteristic of suffering is demonstrated in the Book of Demonstrations by eleven kinds of painfulness Also the fifteen terms namely  Birth has the characteristic of causing to be manifest  down to  Deceaseand Reappearance has the characteristic of decease and manifestation can be quoted in detail  So this Truth is taught and is taught how it comes to be thus  shared and unshared Threads in the seven and in the ten  terms  and in the fiftyfold  Pattern of the Dispensation   and in the eighteenfold   Terms of Expression of the Thread   and in the tenfold   Testings of the Thread  and in the sixteenfold Modes of Conveying  and in the twentyonefold Investigation Inquiry This is called the Mode of Conveying a TeachingHerein what is the Mode of Conveying an Investigation Term  questions  asking  what before What after Term  first the termWhen the Blessed One was asked by the venerable Ajita that can be taken thus how many terms  are asked about Like what The verse  How many terms are these Four So much is the asking for an answerThe terms are answered by the Blessed One with the same number of terms as in the asking and these are the explaining of the terms This is what is called  term One or two or more than that  These four terms are one question   for the phrasing is subordinate to the meaning  Although the terms are several the meaning he asks about is only oneThat these four terms are subordinate is due to the phrasing the question being only oneFor with the term  Tell what is the world shut in by   he asks with reference to the world And with the terms And whereby is it not displayed And what is it besmeared with Say he asks about the same world and with the termAnd what will be its greatest fear   he asks about that same worldThat is how the phrasing is subordinate to the meaning and how the question is only one Now question is of four kinds declarable unilaterally declarable after analysis declarable by asking a counterquestion and unacceptable Herein when it is asked Is the eye impermanent  that is declarable unilaterally in the affirmative When it is asked Is what is impermanent painful that is declarable after analysis  for there is what is impermanent and not an eye and also the bases that are not the eyebase are also impermanent not only the eye This is what is declarable after analysis When it is asked  Does the eye guide  the eye faculty   that is declarable by asking a counterquestion When it is asked  Is that eye a Perfect One   that is an unacceptable questionand likewise Is a Perfect One apart from the eyeThis is questions   As to what the Blessed One is asked  he is asked about the worlds corruptionFor what reason Because corruption is of three kinds corruption by craving corruption by view and corruption by misconduct Herein with the reply  he teaches ignorance By  hankering  he teaches craving By  greatest fear  he teaches ripening of unprofitable action What the Blessed One answers is this That such kind of ripening of action as is experienceable as pleasure shall be experienceable as pain no such instance is found  When it was said by the Blessed One with four terms namely  By ignorance is the world shut in  then it was asked further  in which he asks four terms and the Blessed One answers it with two terms as follows  Whatever streams are in the world They are shut off by mindfulnessWhat is this that is asked   What is asked about is the cleansing of that corrupted world  The streams are the  which are demonstrated in the plural in virtue of all the six external basesWith the question  What is it that shuts off the streams he asks about the abandoning of obsession With the question  Whereby is it that streams are sealed  he asks about eradication of underlying tendencies Herein the Blessed One teaches by way of mindfulness in the six doors for when someone abides aware with mindfulness as doorkeeper his faculties beginning with that of the eye are  guardedHerein the faculties being guarded when there is any insight that conduces to the complete abandonment of any streams and of that ignorance  whereby the world is shut inThat is how the streams are sealed off  After that he asked further  having come in order to ask  the Blessed One where nameandform is set at rest The Blessed One answered these four terms with one term  As to the question that you ask Ajim I shall tell you nowWith cessation of consciousness Tis here that this is set at rest  What does he ask with this questionHe asks about  the element of extinction without trace left The Blessed One answered him with the element of extinction without trace leftHerein with the first question he asks about corruptionThere are these Masters of ideas  And several Initiates hereNow how many questions are these They are those about the Arahant Masters of ideas and about the  Initiates   What is before what after  the meaning is this Herein which does he ask about first and which lastHe asks about the Arahant firstand about the ideas of the Initiate with the corresponding term The Arahants are referred to by the phrase Masters of ideas while the Initiates are referred to by the phrase the severalWith the phrase You have skill to tell me their  he asks the Blessed One a term shared in common with bothNow shared and unshared questions can be asked of himThe Blessed One sometimes as in this case answers such questionsnot in the same order as that in which the questions are asked Here he answers afterwards what was asked firstAnd what is this that he asked  He asks this What is the behaviour of those already purified and of those still being purified  That is answerable as follows   Sensual desires he would not wantHe would be undisturbed in mind     Here the Blessed One shuts off the obsessions produced by the thought of sensual desires but  there is also the obsession due to disturbedness by the other two kinds of thoughts namely those of ill will and cruelty as demonstrated among the inshuttings With the phrase Skilled  in all ideas he answers about the Arahant asked about firstNow as to the verse beginning  these are four terms in the whole verseThe questions are four tooWhat is the reason It is because here the phrasing is not subordinate to the meaning  like Ajitas first question  where the answers were not unilaterally plural since the questions there though plural in phrasing were only one in meaning  Also while in the first Ajita question the fourth was answered after he had already asked the other three questions and had been answered it is not so here since here it is a seeking out how things come to be and accordingly one seeks the answers  as to how things come to be doing so by the termconnexionAs to the question  which he asks here again  in this way herein this is simply  a mood of the questioning   Now the verse  beginning  must be traced out by means of the answer to this questionHow is it answered Herein the Blessed One answers with theHerein keeping a pure heart in being is quiet while keeping understanding in being  is insightHerein he infers as follows  The inner tangle and the outer tangle are any ideas abandoned by means of quiet and insightAs to the answer herein lust is abandoned by means of quiet and ignorance is abandoned by means of insightThe lust which has what is in oneself for its ground is the  inner tangle  while the lust which has what is external for its ground is the  outer tangle And the embodimentview with what is in oneself for its ground is the  inner tangle while the sixtyone  types of view with what is external for their ground are the outer tangle In fact whatever due to lust and to viewtype will exist there regarding what is in oneself and what is external this is the tangleSo in brief any craving and view whatever with what is in oneself for their ground are the  inner tangle And according as a deity asked the Blessed One there is the verse Herein the Blessed One answered with the verse    What the Blessed One answers with is the Way Leading to Cessation of SufferingWith this answer the Blessed One infers the defilements here from what is demonstrable by the first verseFor either the  four wheels  are the four hands and feetand the  nine doors  are the nine bodily orificesor else  the  four wheels are the four assumingsand with assuming as condition being  with cessation of assuming cessation of being Full of associated greed is lust for the five strands of sensual desireHerein it is  the tie  that is answered by cravingand the trace by conceit Evil greed for wishes is lust for the five strands of sensual desireHerein it is  he demonstrates as  evil  Craving with its root   is  Expelling  is the abandoning of the craving rooted in unknowing and of viewAnd again any other ideas leading to the roundabout whatever that construe  for that same reason in association with the four wheels  can all be demonstratedSo  this verseanswer agrees with the question Now if there is any recapitulation with a summary then this Investigation becomes an inquiry into a paraphrasingverse together with its proseexposition that it recapitulates and this in order to see whether the Blessed One paraphrases in verse as many terms as he presents in the proseexpositionFor example  Now these eight meaningterms presented here in this proseexpositionthe Blessed One paraphrases in verse by six terms  as follows He is undismayed when come before A parliament assemblyHe does not lose his thread of Speech He does not hide his missions aimHe can expound views not his own When questioned he is undisturbed  and the paraphrasingverse  can be quoted in detail This where seven terms are presented in the prose the Blessed One paraphrases in verse by seven termsSo sometimes the verseparaphrases with more when the presentation in the prose has fewer terms or when the prose presentation has more terms he verseparaphrases with fewerThis is what was called  and a verseparaphrases investigation   This is the Mode of Conveying an InvestigationHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a ConstruingIn the case of the Threads Conveyings Plane resort outcomeSuch inquiry as  Does this question construe or does it not construe in the Threads  is ConstruingNow what  is the cause what is the condition for that path  There are four  causes and four conditions for the Virtue Category of the Path waiting on True Men and living in befitting places are a condition through assumptive conditionality When there is any old appropriate action its ripening is a condition And through that same conditionality  there is right direction in selfguidance which is a cause So the Paths Virtue Category has a cause and has a condition This is virtue belonging to worldsBut as to virtue dissociated from worlds that has three faculties as condition namely the faith faculty the energy faculty and the concentration faculty These are a conditionThe mindfulness faculty and the understanding faculty are a causeand also the virtue of the fruit of StreamEntry Hence these faculties are the cause these are the conditionSince moreover the tranquillity and happiness  and  gladness  are a condition for concentrationand since the  pleasure  is a cause hence the Concentration Category of the Path has a cause and has a conditionAnd since one who is concentrated understands how things are this is understandingFor that anothers utterance and reasoned attention in oneself are the cause and the condition  So these three categories of the Path have a cause and have a conditionInquiry thus Does this construe or does it not construe in regard to Threads concerning what is declarable unilaterally or after analysis or by a counterquestion  is the Mode of Conveying a ConstruingAnd that Mode of Conveying can also be seen in the four Principal Appeals to Authority Herein what is the Mode of Conveying FootingsThe five faculties beginning with the eye are a footing for lust for formThe mind facultyis a footing for lust for beingThe five categories beginning with form are a footing for the embodimentviewThe sixtyone  types of view are a footing for lust for viewsThe sensualdesire element is a footing for lust for sensual desiresThe formless element is a footing for lust for the formlessPerception of pleasure is a footing for lust for sensual desiresPerception of ill will is a footing for ill willUnawareness is a footing for confusionThe nine grounds for annoyance are a footing for ill willThe nine positions of conceit  are a footing for conceitPleasant feeling is a footing for the underlying tendency to lustPainful feeling is a footing for the underlying tendency to resistanceNeitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling is a footing for the underlying tendency to ignorance Selftheory assuming and false speech are a footing for greedKilling breathing things and malicious speech and harsh speech are a footing for ill willWrongness and gossip are a footing for delusionInequality in existence and in property is a footing for ImakingAppropriation of external objects is a footing for mymakingBodily crookedness is a footing for viewBodily fault is a footing for hate Bodily coloration is a footing for greedOr in fact when any  idea arises by means of any object whether the idea is expressed in terms of creatures  or expressed in terms of ideas  its footing is accordingly Just as when a man  finds a  footing for his foremost foot he raises his second foot and brings it forward past that footbut if he  finds no footing for his second foot he does not  raise the other footsince there is no condition for itso too an idea whether profitable or unprofitable or undeclared does not occur when it finds no footingowing to  nonobtainment  of a reason for the idea so  produced This is called the Mode of Conveying FootingsHerein what is the Mode of Conveying CharacteristicsWhen one idea is mentioned all Ideas of like characteristicAre by that mentioned  here abides The Mode Conveying CharacteristicsFor example when in the verse  mindfulness occupied with the body is mentioned then mindfulness occupied with feelings with cognizance and with ideas are also mentioned by the single Fonndation of Mindfulnesss representing all four Foundations of Mindfulness  for cognizance does not occur in only a single Steadyingpoint for consciousness  it occurs in the different ways simultaneously so when mindfulness occupied with the body is mentioned then that occupied with feelings with cognizance and with ideas is mentioned as wellFor it is not that when mindfulness occupied with the body is kept in being then the rest of the four Fonndations of Mindfulness do not  come to fulfilment by keeping in beingSo when any among like ideas  are mentioned then all those ideas with that same general characteristic are mentionedAgain in the verse And purifying ones own heart This is the Buddhas Dispensation ideas concomitant with cognizance are mentioned And when heart  is mentioned form is also mentionedThis is the nameandform that is the Noble Truth of SufferingConsequently in the purifying of ones own heart  what one purifies is Sufferingwhat one purifies by is the Pathwhat one purifies from is origin and  the purifying is CessationAgain  Herein the conascent feeling perception choice contact and attention  are ideas with a single general characteristic in virtue of the characteristic of assumingHe who  finds dispassion in form finds dispassion in feeling and he also finds dispassion in perception determinations and consciousnessSo when any one of those ideas that have a single general characteristic is demonstrated all the rest of those ideas with that same general characteristic are demonstrated too This is called the Mode of Conveying CharacteristicsHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold Array Language by way of phrasing Purport The Teachings Source and Herein what is Language How is that to be seenAccording as it is said by the Blessed One  What is taught past future and presentHe  looks that Thread over as to phrasing and as to languageskill for the correctness or incorrectness of the Threads language thus This should be inflected  thusThis is called Skill in Language Herein what is Skill in PurportIt is skill in knowing how a section of a Thread taught comes to be taught by the Blessed One with this particular intent Like what  As follows What is the Blessed Ones Purport hereIt is that those who wish  for coolness  will abide diligent This is the purport here Again   No one turns back time for devotion and while Feelings there are not yet overwhelming let one keep in beingWhat is the Blessed Ones Purport hereThis is the Blessed Ones purport hereSo the Purport in what is taught by verse or by proseexposition is the establishment  that through such a Thread one practises an idea in accordance with the True Idea This is what is called the Teachings purport Herein what is ConsecutiveSequence Since in a verse or in prose  Threads the terms are multiple  in this way or in that the preceding terms and the subsequent terms belonging to such  verse or prose Threads must be taken togetherThat sequence is known  as to its consecutivity as follows When one verse in two or three  is embarked upon for search the meaning of the verse spoken  as one part thereof is  yet undemonstrated owing to some verses being still not spoken   what is still to be said  must be compared with thatSo while he who is searching has doubts about the search  that person has still  to search further in another of the descriptions still unspoken  This is what is called sequence by consecutivitySkill   Skill in source as circumstance skill in the teachings purportHerein when a verse is searched for that in order to obtain the source etcthe meaning does not have to be demonstrated separately since skill in sources as circumstances is skill in meanings When the meaning  is being sought out by means of these four terms it is sought out according to how it isAnd then all  that is either the source as circumstance or the purport the language as phrasing and the sequence  is in consecutivity when not a conclusion That is how it can be taught as to the Threads meaningThis is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold ArrayHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a ConversionThe Mode that when there is one footing Seeks out the footing that remainsLike what For example the verse  This  negligence what is it the footing forNow the relinquishment of profitable ideas what is that the footing forUsing unprofitable ideas what is that the footing forSo in the case of negligence  while it is view that sides  with delusion it is craving  that sides with will and lustThe craving and the view herein are the four taints  the craving is the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being while the view  is the taint of views and the taint of ignoranceHerein the view that there is self  in cognizance is the taint of views  and that there is permanence in the concomitants of cognizance is the taint of ignorance   the taint of sensual desire is due to bias  towards sensual desires and the taint of being consists in clutching at reappearancewhile the namebody is a footing for the taint of views and the taint of ignoranceHerein the characteristic of the taint of sensual desire is any sticking to and bias  towards the external five bases adhered toThe characteristic of the taint of being is the determining of a physical or mental body by aspiration ties and determinative acts  The characteristic of the taint of views is insistence and misapprehensionThe characteristic of the taint of ignorance is nonpenetration of the four Truths and unawareness of ideasThese four taints are the four assumings the taint of sensual desire is sensualdesireassuming the taint of being is beingassuming the taint of views is viewassuming and the taint of ignorance is selftheoryassuming  With these four assumings there are the five categoriesHerein the taint of views  can be abandoned in cognizance it is abandoned in one contemplating cognizance as cognizanceThe taint of ignorance  can be abandoned in ideas it is abandoned in one contemplating ideas as ideasThe taint of being can be abandoned in clutching at reappearance it is abandoned in one contemplating feelings as feelingsThe taint of sensual desire can be abandoned in the five strands of sensual desire  it is abandoned in one contemplating the body as a bodyHerein contemplation of the body belongs with the Noble Truth of SufferingContemplation of feelings since the condition for the five affective facultiesfor the pleasure faculty pain faculty joy faculty grief faculty and onlookingequanimity facultyis the approach thereto by craving as creatures defilement belongs therefore with the Noble Truth of OriginContemplation of cognizance belongs with CessationContemplation of ideas belongs with the PathAnd by this seeing of his in the four instances all his taints are abandoned which  were earlier demonstrated thus And for the proud the negligent their taints increase  One seeks profitable  ideas in the sense opposite to the unprofitable and to like extent One converts by the abandoning  of these defilementsHerein the plane of the Mode of Conveying a Conversion is this Mindfulness and its four Foundations  and their opposites the four Perversions and the four kinds of knowledge of the four Truths the way leading to arising of embodiment and the way leading to cessation of embodimentHerein what is the Mode of Conveying an AnalysisAnything at all that is  declarable after analysis  is called the Mode of Conveying an AnalysisLike what   this being in no way the kind of question for further questioning This is called the Mode of Conveying an AnalysisHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a ReversalAny demonstration of an opposite is called the Mode of Conveying a Reversalaccording as it is said by the Blessed One  which can be quoted in detail in regard to all the remaining pathfactorsThis is called the Mode of Conveying a ReversalHerein what is the Mode of Conveying SynonymsDisplayed by many synonyms So synonyms this Mode conveysAs for example when the venerable Siriputta was praised in one instance namely that of understanding by the Blessed One with variously stated synonyms thus   These are synonyms for understandingAnd as for example the meaning of outlet in the Magga Vibhanga  where each pathfactor is demonstrated by synonymsSo too the synonyms for ignorancewhich is one of the unprofitable roots and which while it remains that same unprofitable root people understand by means of this or that synonym in such and such countries In the passage  sensual desires are called by that synonym for themIn the passage  he calls  those same sensual desires  mire  In the passage  those same sensual desires he calls   dirt So when any such idea is taught in the Thread  thus the search is as follows  What  idea is this a name for This is the Mode of Conveying SynonymsWhen he demonstrates a Thread thus  that is a description in terms of presentationDescription in terms of origin is as follows If there is will and there is lust  for physical nutriment  down to  a standingpointBy  he describes a description in terms of abandoningNow by the verse  he describes craving by a description in terms of the agreeable but with a description in terms of the agreeable thus it is still the same one idea the Blessed One describes for while taking it that craving is the origin of suffering nevertheless craving is not demonstrable as origin in every instance as for example in the passage  which is a description in terms of rejectionSo for all ideas both profitable and unprofitable  And whatever is a particular ideas own field it is only  that idea that occurs thereFor this description is of two kinds descriptionintermsof dependenceonanother and descriptionintermsofselfdependenceWhat is the description in terms of selfdependence Bkikkhus keep concentration in beingOne who is concentrated  understands how it is  Form is impermanent   that is how he understands how it is   this is a description in terms of selfdependence  when applied to the concentration category And that  description is also a description in terms of dependence onanother when applied to the associated Pathcategories of understanding and virtue As for example in the passage while that statement has the concentration faculty outstanding the other four faculties are blunt and they in fact are dependentonanother with respect to that concentration In the case of the three  kinds of confidence due to undergoing which are faiths field the concentration faculty is dependentonanother namely faith In the case of the four Truths the four faculties of faith energy mindfulness and concentration are dependent onanother  namely understanding and the understanding faculty which has the Truths for its field is then not dependentonanother In the case of the Foundations of Mindfullness the mindfulness faculty  is not dependentonanother and in the case of the Right Endeavours the energy faculty is notSo when any idea has selfdependence in its own footing and its own field  that idea should be described with respect theretoThe counteraction of it can be demonstrated from its oppositeHere in this Mode of Conveying description has many moods which is why this idea is described thusThis is called DescriptionHerein what is the Mode of Conveying Ways of EntryIn what sixThere is no Thread whether verse or proseexpositionthat does not exhibit one or other of these  six ideasFor the whole extent of the Teaching  is about either the Categories or the Bases or the Faculties  or the Truths or Dependent Arising  Herein it is the feeling category that among the five categories is the footing for lust hate and delusionHerein there are three kinds of feeling in that feeling category wherein the pleasant feeling has the approach with joy the painful has the approach with grief and the neitherpainfulnorpleasant has the approach with onlookingequanimityAgain whatever is felt there among these three kinds of feeling is the Truth of Suffering   Now as to the determinations category among the categories herein a body occurs for one  who has acted negligently And that negligent action is included among determinations  and action is a way of entry to the factors of being  in two ways And the three kinds of determinationsdeterminative acts of merit determinative acts of demerit and determinative acts of imperturbability are a rootcause for all kinds of personalities with lust though not for the lustfree  And likewise the determinative acts of hate It is one not without lust who  chooses and determinatively acts   it is one without lust  who cc neither  chooses nor determinatively acts  Just as a hot thunderbolt falling on a log or a tree or elsewhere splits and burns it so does choice with lust choose and determinatively act as a cold  thunderbolt neither splits nor burns it so lustfree choice neither chooses nor determinatively actsHerein there is one among the five categories which belongs to the kind of physical frame without faculties namely the perception categoryHerein when the ten elements having form are being taught the form category can be demonstrated which is the Noble Truth of Suffering Also when the six bodies of consciousness with the mind as seventh are being taught there the consciousness category can be demonstrated which is the Noble Truth of SufferingThe idea element is the meetingplace of the different  ideas and that idea can be demonstrated by cause and outcome and fruit  and by function and word whichever applieswhether that idea element is profitable or unprofitable or undeclared or undetermined Of the twelve Bases ten bases have form namely the first five pairs and these can be demonstrated as the Noble Truth of SufferingThe idea base is the meetingplace of the different ideasHerein ideas belonging to those with faculties can be demonstrated among those with faculties and ideas belonging to those without faculties can be demonstrated among those without facultiesAnd as the idea element so the idea base can be sought out for what the idea element is that the idea base is too neither less nor more Herein there is Dependent Arising in three ways there is that in four ways and there is that in two waysHerein there is Dependent Arising in three ways as cause fruit and outcome Then ignorance determinations craving and assuming are the cause  consciousness nameandform the sixfold base contact and feeling are the fruit   being birth and ageinganddeath are the outcomeHow in four ways As cause condition ripening and outcomeignorance and craving determinations and assuming  these are the causeConsciousness is nameandforms conditionBeing is the ripeningHow is there Dependent Arising in two waysIgnorance determinations cravings and assuming are OriginConsciousness nameandform the sixfold base contact feeling being birth ageingand death are SufferingBut since with cessation of ignorance cessation of determinations etc these as the opposites are the other two TruthsTherefore whatever Dependent Arising can be made a way of entry by that is what it can be demonstrated byHerein the twelve faculties that is the eyefaculty  down to   the grief faculty are Sufferingit then becomes subject to lust in oneself this is Imaking Being thus lustful it seeks an object externally this is mymaking Likewise the female Herein the pleasure faculty and the joy faculty are subordinate  to the masculinity facultyWhen the mans ideas of greed have their purport fulfilled they increase the unprofitable but if his purport fails to be fulfilledBut if he keeps onlookingequanimity  in being the onlookingequanimity faculty has parallel occurrence with the masculinity faculty So there are seven faculties neither more nor less  due to assuming an object for defilement namely feeling of all five kinds and and the femininity faculty and masculinity facultyHerein the eight faculties namely the faith faculty  down to  the finalknower faculty are the way leading to Cessation of SufferingOf the twelve  faculties the five faculties  beginning with that of the eye are a footing for lust for sensual desiresHerein whatever faculty a Thread whether verse  or prose can be made a way of entry by that is what it can be demonstrated byThat is how ways of entry can be found in the cases of the Categories Elements Bases Faculties Truths and moods of Dependent Arising  This is the Mode of Conveying Ways of EntryHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing UpSeveral verses may express a single instigationLike what For example the verse  This single verse has yet to be demonstratedWhat is the reason There is still expectation of more to come owing to the instigations not having yet been stated The wise then recognizing this As diligences rare distinctionIn diligence rejoice delighting In the way of Noble Ones Also this verses meaning has yet to be demonstratedWhat is the reason There is still something remaining unstated there too namely the verse  So when these verses  are collated then the meaning can be demonstratedSo when a single indication is stated in regard to Threads whether verse or proseexpositions not yet heardany inquiry is an examination with the following task  This Thread has been stated  is its synonym  demonstrated yet or notHerein what is the Mode of Conveying Terms of ExpressionIt is unity and diversityHerein the description in terms of operator  and the description in terms of operation  are respectively the unity and the diversityFor example what is a description ie a  making understood   according to the single synonym as a unity is according to diversity expressible as follows It understands  thus it is understanding  and that understanding is in the sense of dominancethe understanding faculty  and in the sense of nonlapse   the understanding powerWhen made to exist accordingly  the mindfulness cultivating a triple province which is recollection of the three Jewels namely Recollection of the Enlightened One Recollection of the True Idea and Recollection of the Community is a diversity but it is a unity as a state of undistorted recollectionBriefly what are the four Paths as unity and diversity It is with nonconfounding of the basic idea namely path that they are a unity just as water when combined with heat is hot water  and when combined with cold it is  cold water   biting water and frozen water  this is the unity and the diversityAgain there is the type of idea that is a bringing together  of different ideas combined together as for instance form  which consists of the four obstructibles is a unity as formThat is how all the four elements are a unity as form  but are a diversity as the element of earth and the elements of wate are a diversity as the element of earth and the elements of water fire and air  Earth element   by its specific characteristic of hardness  is a unity but it is a diversity as the physical basis namely the bodywhere the  parts are mixed up for whatever the specific characteristic that is all a unity as earth elementThat is how all four elements as forms are a unityAgain there is the type of idea that through its diversity gets another nameas for instance Contemplation of the Body as the Nine Perceptions namely perception of a corpse as discoloured perception of it as bloated   this is  perception of ugliness  and so that which by perception of ugliness is a unity is a diversity  in virtue of its object  That same  perception in one contemplating disappointment in feelings is when expressed in such terms the concentration faculty And that same perception as perception of notself  in ideas is as keepinginbeing the energy faculty and it is contemplation of ideas as ideas and in one abandoning perception of self in cognizance it is the understanding faculty and it is contemplation of cognizance as cognizance  So any  access to knowledge whatever is in all cases as understanding understanding of a particular province  this is the diversity Likewise lust for sensual desires lust for being and lust for views are the diversity in the case of craving which as such is a unitySo any knowledge inquiry or examination concerning unity and diversityHerein what is the mode of Conveying RequisitesCleansing and corruption too Are both with cause and with condition  The search for both of these is called The Mode Conveying RequisitesSo the cause for ideaswithacause must be sought out and the condition for those with a condition must be sought outHerein what is the difference between the cause and the condition The sameessence is the cause and the otheressence is the condition The generator is the cause while the receiver is the conditionThe resident is the cause while the visitor is the conditionThe unshared is the cause while the shared is the conditionThe cause is one only while the condition has distant consecutivity Herein the condition is twofold as  conditioninimmediate proximity and conditioninremoterelation The cause is also twofold as causeinimmediateproximity and causeinremote relationHerein what is the conditioninremoterelationif there is cessation of ignorance in the beginning  there is also cessation of nameandformHerein why immediate succession  Because the conditioninremoterelation is procured  through  the conditioninimmediateproximity This is as to conditionHerein what is causeinremoterelationfor when something generates something next to it it is its cause too With cessation of ignorance cessation of determinations   with cessation of determinations cessation of consciousnessAnd  that condition  is dependently arisen As ignorance is a condition what is its condition That is unreasoned attentionAnd ignorance is a condition for what For determinations So it ie ignorance is a condition and is dependently arisen  What is its cause Ignorance itselffor it is in this way that  no past beginning is evident  Herein ignorance as underlyingtendency is the cause of ignorance as manifest obsession the prior is the cause for the subsequent That second kind of ignorance is also a condition for determinations for four reasons namely by conditionalitythroughconascence by conditionalitythroughimmediateproximity by conditionality throughdrenching  and by conditionalitythroughstanding pointHerein as to determinations  they are those which having become established in the triple relationship of condition  and having obtained a plane of existence being mainly  arisen with ignorance proceed to maturity growth and abundance  Understanding is lost through four reasonsWhat four Underlyingtendency manifest obsession fetter and assumingHerein from  the underlyingtendency is born  the manifest obsession When obsessed one is fettered When fettered one assumes With assuming as condition beingSo these determinations being triply arisen and arrived at a plane of being and mainly  not stopped  by the Path it is said that   That is how there is also  a condition  for determinations in the sense of being arisen with a cause  But the condition so far treated disregarding any demonstrated profitable or unprofitable aspect must have the profitable and unprofitable aspects inserted and the ideas ripening from the condition so far treated without any statableunstatable  aspect must have the statable and the unstatable aspects inserted Except for that which exceeds the range of being  the whole Thread can be encompassednot excluding the ten Powers of a Perfect One and the four Intrepidities  which are kinds of merit  Now when ignorance is a condition by immediateproximityconditionality for determinations and when there is the cognizance called arisen immediately proximate to that cognizance wherewith the ignorance was coarisen  then the previous cognizance is a condition by causeconditionality  for the subsequent cognizance Hence ignorance being in virtue of that previous cognizance the cause of arising  of the subsequent no knowledge arises with the latter because it has no opportunity made for itSince its element of diligence is drenched by ignorance  hence the perversions  arise taking it that there is beauty in the ugly that there is pleasure in the painful etc  Herein the determinations that arise are the choice in one affected by lust by hate and by delusion  r respectively through obsession by lust through obsession by hate or through obsession by delusion The Perversion of View is demonstrable in the demonstration of the four grounds for perversion In as much as one with perverted cognizance cognizes this is the Perversion of Cognizance In as much as perverted perception apprehends this is the Perversion of PerceptionAnd in as much as the perverted view insists this is the Perversion of View Then the eight Wrongnesses increase and in the unreasoned attention the three Unprofitable Roots make wrong knowledge and wrong deliverance ariseAnd being mainly  unpenetrated they are determinations that bring renewal of beingSo that is how ignorance is a condition for determinations by conditionalitythroughconascence and by conditionality throughimmediateproximity How is ignorance a condition for determinations in the mood of drenching How is ignorance a condition for determinations in the sense of standingpoint That is how ignorance is a condition for determinations in the sense of standingpointAgain being is generated in relinking  by the ripening of action  that was accompanied by lust It is when that is firmly  insisted upon through lack of knowledge of action  and its ripening that determinations are called  In this way too there are determinations with ignorance as conditionAgain among the five kinds of persons namely those who  are Initiate  persons those who have entered upon the nonpercipient attainment those seeking to be  and inside the egg   those who  are moistureborn or any others  not yet come to be   these   so what do their determinations have for their conditionThey still have previously  made determinations  and assuming  unabolished  in their cognizance  as long as  the unripened ripening is uneradicated  through the condition for its ripening being unsevered they still have a destinationIn this way too there are determinations with ignorance as condition Again those persons  may have neither that assuming nor those determinations yet their seven underlying tendencies are still uneradicated and unsevered and  In this way too there are determinations with ignorance as conditionAgain those persons  whatever kind of action leads to settingup it is all determinatively acted through ignorance and stuck to by craving and also it is owing to lack of knowledge that they do not know the disappointment thereinThat same action is  that same craving is the moisture for the seeds growthand that same ignorance is the standpoint In this way too there can be said to be determinations with ignorance as conditionSo ignorance is a condition for determinations in these moodsHerein ignorances cause is prior ignorance  and unreasoned attention is its conditionWhere  there is noninterruption  this is continuity  there  the fruit is generation Just as when a cloak or a sheet is in the presses  and they are screwed down  by two people or by one strong man it would not however get dry in the pressesFor those  who attain that rely on it are in touch with it and through craving for it they do not come to abandonment of cravingHerein that noneradication That in turn becomes an obsession as the inability of such impeded cognizance to penetrate how things are That is the taint of ignorance which becomes consciousnessasseed What is a seed is a cause if not severed When unsevered it causes relinkingWhen relinking it does not come to eradicationThe noneradication binds cognizance down  One whose cognizance is bound down does not understand how things are  So this consciousness as seed   has the meaning of being affected by taints the meaning of cause the meaning of noninterruption the meaning of nonstopping  the meaning of fruit the meaning of relinking the meaning of renewal of being the meaning of noneradication  the meaning of underlying tendency the meaning of manifest obsession the meaning of nonpenetrationAt this point the field of ignorance has been demonstratedThis is called the Mode of Conveying RequisitesHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a CoordinationRegarding what has been condensed The proper synonym  and manner Of detail should be known as varied  Herein the demonstration of the name condenses the demonstration of the example is the synonym and the actual example is the detailBut the detail has to be stated  Like what  For example in the passage  This is a condensationHerein what is the coordinationAnd what should be  abandoned  Will and lust  for form should be abandoned  down to As to ignorance that can be described by simileAgain for example  And what is the support Craving and viewHerein the view is ignorance and the craving is determinationsHerein to say with view as condition craving is the same as saying with ignorance as condition determinationsHerein what is supported is consciousness and that implies with determinations as condition consciousness  down to  ageingand death  When this  has been briefly stated thus the remainder of the passage follows  namely  which is thus the abandoning of the view and the craving Herein with cessation of ignorance as view consciousness no longer as it did before  lets go  this or that idea provocative of lust  in order to seize  another idea as in the Monkey Simile  but rather since it has no will and lust for even the least ideas provocative of lust  how is there to be any dislodgement  In the outstanding creatures the Arahants cognizance has done with insistence  and consciousness being without a standingpoint ceases for want of nutriment With cessation of consciousness cessation of nameandform  down to  cessation of ageinganddeathThis is a CoordinationHerein consciousnesss dislodgement comes about through lust When there is no dislodgement then the former approach to defilement along with its chattels which was threefold has its fires tranquillizedHence he said Herein the coordination is this   One whose body is tranquil feels pleasure When he is pleased his cognizance is concentrated down to  there is the knowing and seeing  I am liberated   The deliverance being due to the exhaustion of taints he no more  reappearsWith his reappearances having no actual coming or going  there is  no here or beyond or in between This is only what is coordinated in the middle part of this Thread and it is only its construing in Dependent Arising and in Deliverance  but this does not analyse in detail the meaning of what was stated in briefAlso  the ideas in  the type of Thread dealing with Corruption must be coordinated only  with the type dealing with Corruption not with any otherLikewise in the case of that dealing with Morality and that dealing with Penetration  This is the Mode of Conveying a CoordinationThese are the sixteen Modes of Conveyingin the valiant MahaKaccayana the RoseApple Wood dwellers PitakaDisclosure is accomplishedthere in the beginning is the Mode of Conveying a TeachingWhat is taught and a verseparaphrases  Investigation  this demonstrates The Mode Conveying Investigationwhat is the meaning of that Questions  these four terms how many questions are The streams restraint I tell whereby They can be sealed is understanding  He answered those four terms with two terms with the second question he asks about cleansingwith the third question he asks about the extinction element without trace left and with the fourth question he asks further  about the extinction element with trace left  In addition to that third question he asked further Good sir if asked you have the skill To tell me their  behaviour He asks these four termsand answers first what was asked afterwardsverse  while any craving and view whatever with what is external for their ground are the  outer tangle and the  nine doors are the nine positions of conceit  for the suffering born of conceit is the position for conceit  in the three triads that follow in the Vibhanga textHerein the Blessed One does not  paraphrase in the verse with as many terms as he presents in the proseA bhikkhu such as this will be One on a mission fit to go That which is demonstrated of the sixteen Modes of Conveying as Teaching and as Investigation is the demonstrationLooking for right and wrong construing demonstrates The Mode Conveying a ConstruingAs for example  and the path to that purification is this  which proseexposition  can be citedfor understanding generates  the virtue that leads to penetration The victor teaches an idea And also what has that idea As Footing so with all ideas  This is the Mode Conveying FootingsThe five strands of sensual desires are a footing for lust for sensual desiresfor it is said that In whomsoever lust for sensual desires arises has arisen or will arise the footing for that lust for sensual desires is in those five external bases that have form beginning with visible forms and not apart from them That is why the five strands of sensual desire are the footing for lust for sensual desiresthat whereby  that idea arises with an object the ThreadMeaning As a ConsecutiveSequence  This Mode Conveys a Fourfold Arrayby means of the femininegender designation the masculinegender designation and the neutergender designation All according to the Thread demonstrated as this should not be inflected thusThe path proclaimed by the Seer which is the state of safety From suffering that has shaken off dirt and taints It is that those who are afflicted  by pain will instigate energy  for the exhaustion of suffering skill in language as phrasing skill in sequence by consecutivity And converts to the opposites Is that Conveying a ConversionFor the relinquishment of profitable ideasFor using unprofitable ideasFor using objects of defilementHerein the formbody is a footing for the taint of sensual desire and the taint of beingfor he has exhausted taints when he knows and sees in the four instances namely Suffering Origin Cessation and PathThat is how unprofitable ideas should be sought outThat is how white ideas come to be sought out tooby arrival through profitable ideasKnower of Threads is he that knows   A single idea in the Thread for it does not thereby become  another  even when called reliance Because whatever the language of any inhabitants of any country  however it goes it is by means of that that the Omniscient One teaches  and so the synonym for that has to be soughtHerein what is the Mode of Conveying DescriptionsBy  he describes a description in terms of eradicationthere  consciousness finds   whereby he describes a description in terms of giving beingthe remaining ideas being subordinate to itWays of entry can be found in six ideasIn the Categories the Elements the Bases the Faculties the Truths and the two moods of Dependent ArisingHerein as to the Elements  there are the eighteen elementsand as the form category while the mind base can be demonstrated as the consciousness category which is also the Noble Truth of Sufferingand they can be made ways of entry indirectly and nameandform when it arises is a condition for the sixfold base and so contact and feeling these are the conditionBirth and ageinganddeath are the outcomeLikewise the twentytwo facultiesThe masculinity faculty and the femininity faculty  are a footing for cravingFor as soon as the male has to do with women then the pain faculty occurs in him and the grief facultyand also hate as a root of unprofit increasesand nondelusion as a root of profit increasesthe mind faculty is a footing for lust for beingthe five faculties  beginning with forms are a footing for lust for formand the femininity faculty and the masculinity faculty are a footing for the description  in terms of creaturesHerein the meaning of one of such verses so stated cannot be demonstrated so long as the remaining ones are still unstatedWhat is the reasonThat meaning has not yet been stated  it being not yet stated it cannot yet be demonstrated What has not yet been stated is this and such inquiry is called the Mode of Conveying a Clearing UpRight view as such is a unity while it is a diversity as the investigationofideas enlightenment factor both as the investigating of ideas and as acquaintance with supernormal power due to directing cognizance thereto but a diversity as the element of earth and the elements of water fire and airbut as headhairs bodyhair nails teeth cuticlehide  it is a diversitybut as sounds odours flavours and tangibles they are a diversityconstitutes the Mode of Conveying Terms of Expressionbut though it is the sameessences cause that is the otheressences condition nevertheless when the causality  is regarded as a condition for any otheressence at all it is not called  cause  it is called conditionThe inonself is the cause while the external is the conditionfor the condition is the causes aid when the procuringcause  is procurableIgnorance is nameandforms conditioninremoterelation while consciousness is its condition through conditionalityinimmediateproximity Ignorance  is consciousnesss  cause by causalityinremoterelation while determinations  are its cause by causalityinimmediateproximity This is how the cause too is twofoldHow is ignorance a condition by conditionalitythrough conascence for determinationsIt is so for any cognizance obsessed  by lust Herein owing to the obsession by lust it destroys all understandings provinceIn this way and no other do unprofitable determinations come successively to maturity and abundanceThat ignorance drenches extends through those determinations just as when a waterlily or a lotus is growing in water and being drenched and extended through  with cool water it reaches maturity growth and abundanceso too is ignorance a condition for determinations in the sense of drenchingThose determinations reach maturity growth and abundance in dependence on ignorancejust as a waterlily or a lotus reaches maturity growth and abundance in dependence on earth by its having earth for its standingpointso too these determinations reach maturity growth and abundance in dependence on ignorance by their having ignorance for their standingpointwith consciousness as condition nameandform  the relinking is renewal of being  obsession in the sense of noneradication is underlying tendencyso too although attainment by concentration has the Acme of Being  for its ultimate still it does not conduce to the eradication of the formlesssince the moist water element still lurking  there cannot be dried outwithout  the heatelements coming  if it were put again in the open outside the presses it would mostly keep moist with the seeping of the remaining moisture for it cannot come to be completely dried out  without the fireelements coming is the underlying tendency to ignorance and that is an impediment for cognizanceThis Mode Conveys Coordinationfor consciousness   can be given in detail this is the end of suffering  which is the element of extinction without trace leftThis is called the Mode of Conveying a CoordinationThe fifth chapterhow far the Blessed One penetrates with wisdom and sees with wisdomfor Tathagatas do not speak untruthTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Bhagga country at Sumsumaragira in the Bhesakala Grove the Deer ParkNow on that occasion a palace named Kokanada had recently been built for Prince Bodhi and it had not yet been inhabited by any recluse or brahmin or any human being at allThen say this Venerable sir let the Blessed One together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrows meal from Prince BodhiYes sir Sanjikaputta replied and he went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himAnd he says this Let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrows meal from Prince BodhiThe Blessed One consented in silenceThen knowing that the Blessed One had consented Sanjikaputta rose from his seat went to Prince Bodhi and told him what had happened addingThen when the night had ended Prince Bodhi had good food of various kinds prepared in his own residence and he had the Kokanada Palace spread with white cloth down to the last step of the staircase Then he addressed the brahmin student Sanjikaputta thus Come my dear Sanjikaputta go to the Blessed One and announce that it is time thus It is time venerable sir the meal is readyYes sir Sanjikaputta replied and he went to the Blessed One and announced that it was time thus It is time Master Gotama the meal is readyThen it being morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went to Prince Bodhis residenceNow on that occasion Prince Bodhi was standing in the outer porch waiting for the Blessed OneWhen he saw the Blessed One coming in the distanceBut the Blessed One stopped at the lowest step of the staircasePrince Bodhi said to him Venerable sir let the Blessed One step on the cloth let the Sublime One step on the cloth that it may lead to my welfare and happiness for a long timeWhen this was said the Blessed One was silentThe Blessed One looked at the venerable AnandaThe venerable Ananda said to Prince Bodhi Prince let the cloth be removed The Blessed One will not step on a strip of clothSo Prince Bodhi had the cloth removed and he had seats prepared in the upper apartments of the Kokanada PalaceThe Blessed One and the Sangha of bhikkhus ascended the Kokanada Palace and sat down on the seats that had been preparedThen with his own hands Prince Bodhi served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with the various kinds of good foodWhen the Blessed One had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl Prince Bodhi took a low seat sat down at one sidePrince before my enlightenment while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta I too thought thus Pleasure is not to be gained through pleasure pleasure is to be gained through painLater prince while still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of life Now three similes occurred to me spontaneously never heard beforeI considered This Dhamma that I have attained is profoundThen the bhikkhus of the group of five not long after being thus taught and instructed by me by realising for themselves with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessnessWhen this was said Prince Bodhi said to the Blessed One Venerable sir when a bhikkhu finds the Tathagata to discipline him how long is it until by realising for himself with direct knowledge he here and now enters upon and abides in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessnessAs to that prince I shall ask you a question in returnAnswer it as you chooseWhat do you think prince Are you skilled in the art of wielding a goad while riding an elephantYes venerable sir I amWhat do you think prince Suppose a man came here thinking Prince Bodhi knows the art of wielding a goad while riding an elephant I shall train in that art under himIf he had no faith he could not achieve what can be achieved by one who has faithWhat do you think prince Could that man train under you in the art of wielding a goad while riding an elephantVenerable sir even if he had one of those deficiencies he could not train under me so what of the fiveWhat do you think prince Suppose a man came here thinking Prince Bodhi knows the art of wielding a goad while riding an elephant I shall train in that art under himIf he had faith he could achieve what can be achieved by one who has faithWhat do you think prince Could that man train under you in the art of wielding a goad while riding an elephantVenerable sir even if he had one of those qualities he could train under me so what of the fiveSo too prince there are these five factors of strivingWhat fiveHere a bhikkhu has faith he places his faith in the Tathagatas enlightenment thus That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed Then he is free from illness and affliction possessing a good digestion that is neither too cool nor too warm but medium arid able to bear the strain of striving Then he is honest and sincere and shows himself as he actually is to the Teacher and his companions in the holy life Then he is energetic in abandoning unwholesome states and in undertaking wholesome states steadfast launching his effort with firmness and persevering in cultivating wholesome states Then he is wise he possesses wisdom regarding rise and disappearance that is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of sufferingThese are the five factors of strivingPrince when a bhikkhu who possesses these five factors of striving finds a Tathagata to discipline him he might dwell seven years until by realising for himself with direct knowledge he here and now enters upon and abides in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessnessLet alone seven years princeWhen a bhikkhu who possesses these five factors of striving finds a Tathagata to discipline him he might dwell six yearsfive yearsfour yearsthree yearstwo yearsone yearLet alone one day and night princeWhen a bhikkhu who possesses these five factors of striving finds a Tathagata to discipline him then being instructed in the evening he might arrive at distinction in the morning being instructed in the morning he might arrive at distinction in the eveningWhen this was said Prince Bodhi said to the Blessed One Oh the Buddha Oh the Dhamma Oh how well proclaimed is the DhammaFor one instructed in the evening might arrive at distinction in the morning and one instructed in the morning might arrive at distinctibn in the eveningWhen this was said the brahmin student Sanjikaputta said to Prince Bodhi Master Bodhi says Oh the Buddha Oh the Dhamma Oh how well proclaimed is the Dhamma  But he does not say I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusDo not say that my dear Sanjikaputta do not say thatI heard and learned this from my mothers lipsThen my mother who was pregnant went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him she sat down at one sideLet the Blessed One remember the child as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeThere was also an occasion when the Blessed One was living here in the country of the Bhaggas at Sumsumaragira in the Bhesakala Grove the Deer ParkThen my nurse carrying me on her hip went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to himLet the Blessed One remember him as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeNow my dear Sanjikaputta for the third time I go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusLet the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeThen Prince Bodhi addressed the brahmin student Sanjikaputta thus Come my dear Sanjikaputta go to the Blessed One and pay homage in my name with your head at his feet and ask whether he is free from illness and affliction and is healthy strong and abiding in comfort saying Venerable sir Prince Bodhi pays homage with his head at the Blessed Ones feet and he asks whether the Blessed One is free from illnessand abiding in comfortWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideand said Master Gotama Prince Bodhi pays homage with his head at Master Gotamas feet and asks whether he is free from illnessand abiding in comfortThe recluse Gotama has consentedhe went out to meet him and paid homage to him and then allowing the Blessed One to precede him he proceeded to the Kokanada PalaceA second timeA third time Prince Bodhi said to him Venerable sir let the Blessed One step on the clothlet the Sublime One step on the cloth that it may lead to my welfare and happiness for a long timethe Tathagata has regard for future generationsand said to the Blessed One Venerable sir we have thought thus Pleasure is not to be gained through pleasure pleasure is to be gained through painThe Dispensation of the Enlightened Ones the Blessed Ones comes into comprehension under three headings namely Categories Elements and Bases Herein the Categories are five namely the Form Category  down to  the Consciousness Category The ten  Bases having form namely eyecumforms  down to  bodycumtangibles are the form categoryHerein the six bodies of feeling are the feeling category These are eyecontactborn feeling  down to  mindcontactborn feeling This is the feeling categoryPerception of forms  down to  perception of ideas which are the six bodies of perception these are the perception categoryHerein the six bodies of choice are the determinations category Choice of forms  down to  choice of ideas These are the six bodies of choice These are the determinations categoryHerein the six bodies of consciousness are the consciousness category Eye consciousness  down to  mind consciousness These are the consciousness categoryWhat is the diagnosis of themImpermanent void  painful notself This is the diagnosis of themHerein what is the meaning of  category The meaning of mass is the meaning of category the meaning of aggregate is the meaning of category the meaning of class is the meaning of categoryThat also which among categories  is the comprehensive meaning such as material mass  woodland mass  mass of fire    trunk of timber   mass of water  wind mass  is the meaning of categoryHerein the eighteen Elements are  the eye element form element eyeconsciousness element   etc  the mind element idea element mindconsciousness elementThese are the eighteen elementsWhat is the diagnosis of them Impermanent void painful notself This is the diagnosis of themHerein what is the meaning of  element  It may be said that the meaning of component is the meaning of element Component  The eyes clarity  is the eye element and so with the five elements Again the meaning of cutting off lust is the meaning of element so with the five Again as it is said the meaning of simple nature  is the meaning of elementHerein what are the twelve BasesThey are the six in oneself and the six external These are the twelve basesWhat is the diagnosis of themImpermanent void painful notself This is the diagnosis of themFurthermore the diagnosis is twofold namely diagnosis as knowledge and diagnosis as abandoningHerein diagnosis as knowledge is this  Impermanent void painful notself this is diagnosis as knowledgeBut diagnosis as abandoning is the abandoning of will and lust  this is diagnosis as abandoningHerein what is the meaning of base Again it has been said  that the meaning of provisionofawayof access is the meaning of base There are four noble Truths  Suffering Origin Cessation and PathSuffering as a compound is any behaving not  according to the True Idea and like mentality Origin as a compound is ignorance and craving  Cessation as a compound is science and deliverance  the Path as a compound is quiet and insightHerein what are the thirtyseven ideas siding with enlightenmentThey are the four Foundations of Mindfulness  down to  the Noble EightFactored PathThat is how these ideas siding with enlightenment are thirtyseven which ideas being those that conduce to extinction in the case of Fully SelfEnlightened Ones Hermit Enlightened Ones and Enlightened Ones disciples  whether past future or presently arisen constitute the Path  Four Foundations of MindfulnessWhat fourHere a bkikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body    Also the fourfold  the fourfold  the five beginning with faith and the five beginning with faith   Herein what is the meaning of faculty The meaning of ruler is the meaning of faculty the meaning of dominance is the meaning of faculty the meaning of clarity is the meaning of faculty the meaning of function unshared with any other is the meaning of faculty  The meaning of unshakability  is the meaning of power the meaning of firm is the meaning of power the meaning of upholding  is the meaning of power the meaning of stiffening is the meaning of powerHerein what are the seven Enlightenment FactorsThey are the Mindfulness Enlightenment Factor  down to  the OnlookingEquanimity Enlightenment Factor Herein what is the EightFactored PathIt is Right View  Down to  Right Concentration Herein the EightFactored Path has three categories namely the Virtue Category the Concentration Category and the Understanding Category Herein the right speech right action and right livelihood are the Virtue Category Likewise these three categories are the three Trainings So with the three moods there are the ten terms  etc Herein when a devotee is steadied in the Virtue Category he he does not assume unprofitable hate he eradicates the underlying tendency to hate he extracts the barb of hate he diagnoses painful feeling and he surmounts the element of sensual desireWhen he is steadied in the Concentration Category he does not assume unprofitable greed he eradicates the underlying tendency to lust he extracts the barb of greed he diagnoses pleasant feeling and he surmounts the element of formWhen he is steadied in the Understanding Category he does not assume unprofitable delusion he eradicates the underlying tendency to ignorance he extracts the barbs of delusion and view he diagnoses neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling and he surmounts the formless elementSo with these three Categories he does not assume the three unprofitable roots he extracts the four barbs he diagnoses the three kinds of feeling and he surmounts the triple elementHerein what is ignoranceIt is of the four Noble Truths  which can be quoted in detail as  is done in the case of the steps of the staircaseHerein what is consciousnessThe six bodies of consciousness  Feeling perception choice contact and attention are nameHerein what is formThe four great entities and any description of form assuming the four great entitiesSo this name already mentioned and this form are together called nameandform Herein the sixfold base The six bases in oneself namely the eye as a base in oneself  down to  the mind as a base in oneself Contact The six bodies of contact namely eye contact  down to  mind contact The six bodies of feeling are feeling The six bodies of craving are craving Assuming The four kinds of asstiming namely sensualdesire assuming virtueandduty assuming view assuming and selftheory assuming are assuming  Being The three kinds of being namely sensualdesire being being with form formless being Herein what is birthAny first arising of categories first arising of elements first arising of bases any birth coming to birth finding a footing generating manifesting of categories this is birth Herein what is ageingAny brokenness of teeth grey ness of hair wrinkledness of skin  totteringness discolouration of the four great entities doubledupness  ageing waning outwane wane of lifespan waning away dissolving of faculties overripening of essentials of existence   this is ageingHerein what is birthIn the various orders of creatures any creatures decease deceasing death completion of time corpse bloatedness dissolution of body severance of lifefaculty this is death So this ageing already mentioned and this death are together called ageinganddeathHerein ignorance as murk and gloom has the characteristic of not understanding how things are  it is the footing for determinationsDetrminations have the characteristic of determinative acts and their manifestation is implanting amassing and renewal of being Consciousness has the characteristic of causing the physical body to give intimation  it is the footing for nameandformNameandform has the characteristic of plurality of dependence  it is the footing for the sixfold baseThe sixfold base has the characteristic of causing the separate defining  of the faculties beginning with the eye  it is the footing for contactContact has the characteristic of causing occurrence of the three namely pair of bases and appropriate consciousness it is the footing for feelingFeeling has the characteristic of the coexisting of pleasure etc  it is the footing for cravingCraving has the characteristic of

characteristic of overripening of essentials of existence  it is the footing for death Death has the characteristic of exhausting the lifespan and causing lifes surcease  it is the footing for painPain has the characteristic of oppressing the body it is the footing for griefGrief has the characteristic of oppressing cognizance  it is the footing for sorrowSorrow  has the characteristic of sorrowing  it is the footing for lamentationLamentation  has the characteristic of speechutterance  it is the footing for despairDespairs are any kinds of hopelessness There are nine terms wherein all the unprofitable comes to be comprised  and meets togetherWhat nine termsThe two root defilements the three unprofitable roots and the four perversions Herein the two rootdefilements are ignorance and cravingforbeing  The three unprofitable roots are greed hate and delusion the four perversions perversion of perception perversion of cognizance and c perversion of view of the impermanent that it is permanent the perversion of perception perversion of cognizance and perversion of view of the painful that it is pleasant the a perversion of perception perversion of cognizance and perversion of view of the notself that it is self and the perversion of perception perversion of cognizance and perversion of view of the ugly that it is beautifulHerein  what is called ignorance is unknowing of how things are in the four noble Truths  this is ignoranceWhat is called cravingjorbeing is lust lustfulness wish infatuation aspiration relish cleaving not giving up with regard to the types of being this is craving for being Herein what is greed as a root of unprofitWhat is called greed is any greed greediness wish infatuation aspiration relish cleaving not giving up with regard to others lands others materials others places others belongings others chattels  this is greed as a root of unprofitWhat is it the root ofIt is the root of greedborn unprofitable bodily and verbal and mental action and in the same way also for the cognizance and cognizanceconcomitant ideas associated therewithHerein what is hate as a root of unprofitIt is annoyance with creatures impatience irritation ill will hatred desire for harm  resistance of the heart  this is hate as a root of unprofitWhat is it the root ofIt is the root of hateborn unprofitable bodily and verbal and mental action and for the cognizance and cognizanceconcomitant ideas associated therewithHerein what is delusion as a root of unprofitIt is the non actualizing of the four noble Truths nonapprehendingbyenteringupon nonpenetration of them and it is delusion deluding confusion confusing ignorance gloom dark obstruction hindrance covering up concealing nonarrivalatverification   regarding profitable ideas  this is delusion as a root of unprofitWhat is it the root ofIt is the root of delusionborn unprofit able bodily and verbal and mental action and for the cognizance and cognizanceconcomitant ideas associated therewithHerein  the perversion has to be known the object of perversion has to be knownHerein there are one perversion three that are perverted and four objects of perversion permanence in the impermanent pleasure in the painful self in the notself beauty in the ugly What are the four objects of perversionThe body feelings cognizance and ideas  these are the four objects of perversion What are the three perverted Perception cognizance and viewThese three are perverted Herein when an agreeable object has either come within the horizon of the faculties beginning with that of the eye or fails to do so  any seizing of it as a sign  is the perversion of perceptionHerein when one whose cognizance is distorted finds intimation  in an object this is the perversion of cognizanceHerein when one whose cognizance is distorted has in regard to form that is ugly any liking preference way of regarding  formulating pondering of views  adjudgment that it is beautiful etc this is the perversion of view Herein these perversions become twelve as the three  in each of the four objectsnamely three in a body three in a feeling three in a cognizance  and three in an idea  so there are four perversions of perception four perversions of cognizance and four perversions of view And when applied to the six bases  the four perversions become six dodecads as follows  twelve perversions as above with respect to forms in the case of one possessing eye perception   down to  twelve perversions with respect to ideas in the case of one possessing mindperceptionBut as to difference of object  since creatures are ungauged and incalculable the perversions are ungauged and incalculable  by way of the inferior superior and averageHerein the five categories are the four grounds for selfhoodThat is how the five categories are the four grounds for selfhoodHerein it is with respect to the body which is ugly that there is the perversion that it is beautiful Herein ignorance which is murk and gloom has the characteristic of nonpenetration  its  footing is the perversionsCraving has the characteristic of cleaving to its  footing is a dear likeable formGreed has the characteristic of converting  to ones own bias  its footing is takingwhatisnotgivenHate has the characteristic of quarrelling here its footing is killingbreathing thingsDelusion has the characteristic of mistheorizing about an object its footing is wrong theoryPerception of permanence has the characteristic of apprehending nondestruction of determined ideas  its footing is determinationsPerception of pleasure has the characteristic of approaching contact affected by taints  its footing is mymakingPerception of self has the characteristic of approaching wrong theory  about ideas its footing is ImakingPerception of beauty has the characteristic of apprehending colour  its footing is lack of faculty restraintBy these nine terms being indicated all the unprofitable side is demonstrated And that can be known by

since it occurs in the various ways of seeing  impermanence pain and notselfFor this twofold seeing  is called insight into ideas  by its means one sees twofold namely the beautiful and ugly the black

insightOr alternatively in is a prefix sight being the meaning  that is why it is called insight  This is insightHerein creatures have two ailments namely ignorance and cravingforbeing  Two medicines have been stated by the Blessed One for the counteraction  of these two ailments namely quiet and insightThose who make use of these two medicines verify two kinds of nonailment namely the heartdeliverance due to fading of lust and the understandingdeliverance due to fading of ignoranceHerein quiet is the medicine for the ailment of craving whose nonailing is the heartdeliverance due to fading of lustwhile insight is the medicine for the ailment of ignorance whose nonailing is the understandingdeliverance due to fading of ignoranceFor the Blessed One said as follows  Herein one who keeps quiet in being diagnoses form When he diagnoses form he abandons craving When he abandons craving he verifies the heartdeliverance due to fading of lust One who keeps insight in being diagnoses name When he diagnoses name he abandons ignoranceWhen a bhikkhu has diagnosed the two ideas namely name and form then likewise he has abandoned the two ideas namely ignorance and cravingforbeingTwo ideas have been kept in being namely quiet and insight while two ideas have been verified namely science and deliveranceAt this point the bhikkhu is one who has done his taskThis is the extinction element with trace leftWith the termination of his livespan with the surcease of his lifefaculty this suffering ceases and no other suffering arisesHerein the cessation the pacification of these categories elements and bases and the non relinking the nonmanifestation of other categories elements and bases is the extinction element without trace left Herein what is nongreed as a root of

two path factorsOf which twoOf right view and right mindfulness It is the root of these two path factors That is why it is called a root of profitThat is how the eightfactored Path can be construed with the three rootsHerein what is perception of impermanenceAny perception perceiving defining taking it that  this is perception of impermanenceWhat is its outcomeWhen perception of impermanence is kept in being made much of then with respect to the eight Worldly Ideas cognizance does not keep inking up does not Jink does not shape itself thereto but rather onJooking equanimity or else repulsiveness is what it shapes itself to This is the outcomeHerein what is perception of painAny perception perceiving defining apprehending that All determinations are painfitl  this is perception of painWhat is its outcomeWhen perception of pain is kept in being made much of then with respect to sloth negligence and hypocrisy cognizance does not keep linking up does not link does not shape itself thereto but rather onlookingequanimity or else repulsiveness is what it shapes itself to This is the outcomeHerein what is perception of notselfAny perception perceiving defining apprehending that  this is perception of notselfWhat is its outcome When perception of notself is kept in being made much of then with respect to Imaking  cognizance does not keep linking up does not link does not shape itself thereto but rather onJookingequanimity or else repulsiveness is what it shapes itself to This is the outcomeHerein what is perception of uglinessAny perception perceiving defining apprehending that  this is perception of uglinessWhat is its outcomeWhen perception of ugliness is kept in being made much of then with respect to the sign of beauty cognizance does not keep linking up does not link does not shape itself thereto but rather onlookingequanimity or else repulsiveness is what it shapes itself to This is the outcomeHerein the diagnosis of the five categories is taught by the Blessed One and herein any  perception of ugliness is diagnostic of the form category perception of pain is diagnostic of the feeling category perception of notself is diagnostic of the perception category and of the determinations category and perception of impermanence is diagnostic of the consciousness categoryHerein one eradicates craving by quiet one eradicates ignorance by insight One eradicates greed by nongreed  one eradicates hate by nonliate one eradicates delusion by nondelusion One eradicates perception of permanence by perception of impermanence one eradicates perception of pleasure by perception of pain one eradicates perception of self by perception of notself and one eradicates perception of beauty by perception of uglinessQuiet has the characteristic of preventing distraction of cognizance its footing is the MeditationsInsight has the characteristic of penetrating how all ideas come to be   its footing is all the knowableNongreed has the

footing is feelingPerception of notself has the characteristic of not approaching wrong theory about all ideas  its footing is perception of ideasPerception of ugliness has the characteristic of

has learnt much not by one who bas learnt little by one with understanding not by one without understanding by one devoted not by one undevotedHerein perception of impermanence does not become established in one who believing in perception of permanence does not review continuity in the consecutive occurrence of cognizanceI Perception of pain does not become established in one who believing in the gratification offered by pleasure in the five strands of sensual desire does not review the discomfort of the postures Perception of notself does not become established in one who believing in self in the categories or elements or bases does not review the resolution into the different elements and many elements Perception of ugliness does not become established in one for whom delighting in colour and shape and believing in beauty in the body it remains concealedFaith has the characteristic of nonremorse its manifestation is placing faith its footing is the four factors of

of the monks stateHerein when someone  understands how things are  this is the plane of seeingAnd it is the fruit of StreamEntry Having understood how things are he  finds dispassion   this is the footing for attenuation of lust for sensual desire  and of the kinds of ill willand for the fruit of Once Return When his subtle  sensual lust and ill will fade this is the heartdeliverance due to fading of lustand it is the fruit of NonReturn When with the fading of ignorance he is liberated this is g the plane of Him Who has Done and it is Arahantship   Fruits of the monks state  what is the wordmeaning The noble eightfactored path is the monks state These things mentioned above being its fruits are called  fruits of the monks stateWhy are they called fruits of the divine state alsoThe divine state is the noble eightfactored path These being its fruits are called fruits of the divine stateHerein how is he a StreamEntererWith the actualizing of Truth three fetters are abandoned for a noble hearer  namely embodimentview uncertainty and misapprehensionofvirtueandduty  Herein what is the embodimentview   In regard to these five categories either he is a self apprehender or a selfspropertyapprehender thus  in one of them taking it as the power wielder  mover   helper lyeralongsidelimbforlimb  When treating it thus any liking preference way of regarding  way of arguing a case liking for pondering views   or seeing   on his part is called  embodimentview Herein in this embodimentview five of the twenty kinds belong with annihilationismWhich  five down to that is the first of each of the five sets of four positions These five belong with annihilationism The remaining fifteen that is the remaining three in each of the five sets belong with eternalism So with the abandoning of the embodimentview the sixtytwo  types of view are abandoned The abandoning  belongs neither to annihilationism nor to eternalismSo with the abandoning of annihilationism and eternalism the noble hearer has no type of view at all except  right view dissociated from worlds But how does the embodimentview not come to be and the whole white side can be quoted down to etc  When he sees thus he has no embodimentviewHow does uncertainty not come to be Here a noble hearer does not  doubt is not uncertain is confident that the Enlightened One  and all the rest of the passageHe does not  doubt is not uncertain  about the True Idea with all the passage down to  Exhaustion of cramng fading ceasing extinction   he possesses this second undoubtable  ideaHe does not  doubt  about the Community  down to    he possesses this third undoubtable  ideaHe does not doubt is not uncertain believes is confident that  He does not doubt is not uncertain  that craving is the origin of sufferingHe does not doubt is not uncertain  that there is cessation of suffering with cessation of cravingHe does not doubt is not uncertain believes is confident that the noble eightfactored path is the way leading to cessation of sufferingIn so far as concerns the Enlightened One or the True Idea or the Community or Suffering or Origin or Cessation or the Path  any doubting vagueness uncertainty ambivalence   vacillation oscillation  indefiniteness inconclusiveness ununilateralness ununilaterality all that he has Herein Misapprehensionofvirtueandduty is of two kinds  that with regard to virtue and that with regard to one purifiedHerein as to misapprehensionofvirtueandduty with respect to virtue when someone misapprehends thus  and then any  liking preference belief way of regarding way of arguing a case liking for pondering views or seeing on the part of one such as that this is misapprehensionofvirtueanddutyWhen someone has recourse to an uncleansing and unliberating idea as cleansing and liberating thus and so on and  then any liking preference belief  way of regarding way of arguing a case pondering of views or seeing on the part of one such as that is misapprehensionofvirtueandduty with respect to one purifiedNow the noble hearer has abandoned both these kinds of misapprehension  down to   He is virtuous possessing the kinds of virtue desired of noble ones that are untorn  down to conducive to peace With the abandoning of these three fetters a well taught and all the rest With the actualizing of truth   what is the word meaningThere are four kinds of actualizing  actualizing by diagnosing actualizing by abandoning actualizing by verifying and actualizing by keeping in beingHerein a noble hearer actualizes Suffering by means of the actualizing by diagnosing he actualizes Origin by means of the actualizing by abandoning he actualizes Cessation by means of the actualizing by verifying and he actualizes the Path by means of the actualizing by keepingin beingFor what reasonis there the actualizing of Suffering by diagnosis the actualizing of Origin by abandoning the actualizing of Cessation by verification and the actualizing of the Path by keepinginbeing Because of quiet and insight  How does he actualizeHaving anchored cognizance on the object he sees the five categories as sufferingHerein any anchoring  is quietWhen he sees the five categories as suffering then his reliance on the five categories his attachment approaching  cleaving wish infatuation disposition aspiration concerning them are abandonedHerein the five categories are suffering Thus these four Truths have their actualization at one time at one moment in one cognizance neither before nor after That is why the Blessed One said  With the actualizing of Truth three fetters are abandoned for a noble hearer Herein when quiet and insight occur coupled together he performs four functions at one time at one moment in one cognizance  he actualizes suffering by means of the actualizing by diagnosing  down to  he actualizes the Path by means of the actualizing by keepinginbeingWhat is the reasonBecause the actualizing of suffering is done by diagnosis  down to  the actualizing of the Path by keepinginbeingBecause it can be regarded  as follows  Just as a boat going on the water performs four functions it causes one to reach the further shore it leaves the hither shore it carries a cargo and it cleaves the streamso too when quiet and insight occur coupled together he performs four functions at one time at one moment in one cognizance  he actualizes suffering by means of the actualizing by diagnosing  down to  he actualizes the Path by means of the actualizing by keepinginbeingOr just as the sun rising performs four functions at one time neither before nor after  it dispels darkness makes light manifest shows form and terminates coldso too when quiet and insight occur coupled together  etc   Or just as a lamp burning performs four functions at one time neither before nor after  it dispels darkness makes light manifest shows form and uses up fuel so too when quiet and insight occur coupled together  etc  this is the plane of seeing and it is the fruit of StreamEntryBeing steadied in the fruit of StreamEntry when he further keeps quiet and insight in being and when they occur coupled together then with the abandoning of the greater part of lust for sensual desires and of ill will the noble hearer  This is the plane of attenuationand it is the fruit of Once Return  Being steadied in the fruit of OnceReturn when he further keeps quiet and insight in being he abandons without remainder both lust for sensual desires and ill will together with the underlying tendencies to both and when both lust for sensual desires and ill will are abandoned without remainder then the five hitherside fetters are abandoned namely embodimentview misapprehensionof virtueandduty uncertainty willforsensualdesires and illwill  This is the plane of the LustFree and it is the fruit of NonReturnBeing steadied in the fruit of NonReturn when he further keeps quiet and insight in being he abandons the five furtherside fetters namely lustforform lustforbeing conceit agitation and ignoranceWith the abandoning of these five furtherside fetters the noble hearer  This is the plane of Him Who Has Doneand it is Arahantship   This is the element of extinction with trace leftBut with the exhaustion of his lifespan with the surcease of his lifefaculty this suffering too ceases and no other suffering arisesThe cessation pacification of this suffering and the nonmanifestation of any other is the element of extinction without trace left These are the two elements of extinction So the Truths have been stated Actualizing of the Truths has been stated  Definition of Defilement has been stated  Abandoning has been stated  the Planes have been stated  the Fruits have been stated  and the Elements of Extinction have been stated So when these have been stated all the ideas siding with Enlightenment are statedThe task to be done is hereHerein what are the nine successive attainmentsThey are the four Meditations the four Formless Attainments and Cessation Attainment can be quoted in detailHerein what are the four Formless Attainments  down to Cessation Attainment can be quoted in detailThese are the nine successive attainmentsHerein what is the First MeditationIt is that dissociated from five factors and associated with five factors What five factors is it dissociated fromFrom the five HindrancesHerein what are the five HindrancesThey are   which can be given in detail Herein what is will for sensual desiresIt is willandlust love attachment cleaving wish infatuation aspiration non givingup underlyingtendency manifestobsession with regard to the five strands of sensual desire  this is the hindrance of will for sensual desires Herein what is the hindrance of ill willIt is annoyance with creatures and with determinations  etc  as demonstrated  under hate  This is the hindrance of ill will Herein what is drowsinessIt is dulling of cognizance heaviness of cognizance unwieldiness of cognizance shirking of cognizance sleepiness nodding blinking winking this is drowsinessHerein what is lethargy It is any bodily lethargicness dillness heaviness of body untranquillity of bodySo  this lethargy and the drowsiness mentioned before are together called the hindrance of lethargyanddrowsiness  Herein what is agitationAny disquiet of cognizance is agitationHerein what is worryAny mental erasing guilt guiltiness hearterasing remorse this is worryThis worry and the agitation mentioned above are together called the hindrance of agitationandworry  Herein what is the hindrance of uncertainty Any doubt uncertainty about the Enlightened One about the True Idea about the Community  etc  this is uncertaintyFurthermore there are five kinds of uncertainty namely entirely  obstructive partly obstructive obstructive to attainment of quiet obstructive to the Path and obstructive to heaven these are the five  kinds of uncertaintyHere however what is intended  is uncertainty obstructive to attainment of quietHerein as to  hindrances  what is the wordmeaning What do they hinder fromThey hinder from all the profitable sideHow  do they hinderWillforsensualdesires hinders from perception of ugliness ill will hinders from lovingkindness lethargy hinders from tranquillity drowsiness hinders from instigation of energy agitation hinders from quiet worry hinders from non remorse and uncertainty hinders from understanding as that of dependent arisingAnother wayWillforsensualdesires hinders from nongreed as a root of profit ill will hinders from nonhate lethargyand drowsiness hinders from concentration agitationandworry hinders from the foundations of mindfulness and uncertainty hinders from nondelusion as a root of profitAnother way Three abidings namely the heavenly abiding the divine abiding and the noble abiding The heavenly abiding is the four meditations The divine abiding is the four measureless states and the noble abiding is the thirtyseven ideas that side with enlightenment Herein willforsensual desires and agitationandworry hinder from the heavenly abiding ill will hinders from the divine abiding and lethargyanddrowsiness and uncertainty hinder from the noble abidingAnother wayWillforsensualdesires ill will and agitation andworry hinder from quiet and lethargyanddrowsiness and uncertainty hinder from insight That is why these are called hindrancesThe first meditation is dissociated from these five factorsWhat five factors is the first meditation associated withWith thinking and exploring with happiness with pleasure and with unification of cognizance With  the arousing obtaining possessing and verifying of these five factors the first meditation is said to be obtainedhaving aroused perfected these five factors he abides that is why it is said that with the heavenly abidingHerein the second meditation possesses four factors with happiness and pleasure with unification of cognizance  and with confidence in oneself Having aroused perfected these four factors he abides that is why it is said that Herein the third meditation possesses five factors with mindfulness awareness pleasure unification of cognizance  and onlookingequanimity Having aroused perfected these five factors he abides that is why it is said that Herein the fourth meditation possesses four factors with onlookingequanimity purity of mindfulness neither painfulnorpleasant feeling and unification of cognizance  The fourth meditation possesses these four factorsSo with  the arousing obtaining possessing and verifying of these four factors the fourth meditation is said to be obtained Having aroused perfected these four factors he abides that is why it is said that Having aroused perfected these four meditations he abides that is why it is said that The meaning of pressure is the meaning of impermanent the meaning of fleeting the meaning of making reach an end the meaning of seclusion from permanence is the meaning of impermanent This is the meaning of impermanentHerein what is the meaning of painfulThe meaning of repressing is the meaning of painful the meaning of oppressing the meaning of senseofurgency the meaning of sickness This is the meaning of painfulHerein what is the meaning of voidThe meaning of unsullied is the meaning of void the meaning of nonconstraint   the meaning of nontorment the meaning of standstill This is the meaning of voidHerein what is the meaning of notselfThe meaning of unamenability to lordshiprule is the meaning of notself the meaning of unsusceptibility to the wielding of power the meaning of unsusceptibility to be done with as one wants the meaning of being secluded  from identification This is the meaning of notselfThe Pitaka chapter called Compendium of the Threads Meaning in the Actual Presence is completedfor the eye element is cut off for it can be said that just as this man is by nature choleric phlegmatic volatile or of complex nature  so the ten beginning with the eye element and also in all the faculties  etc   the meaning of dissimilar is the meaning of elementthe eye base  down to  the mind base are those in oneself the form base  down to  the idea base are the externalIt may be said that the meaning of aspect  is the meaning of baselike the handsome aspect and ugly aspect  for just as such and such oxen stand out with those two aspectsso with these the oxen of cognizance and cognizanceconcomitants stand out with the defilement of action and inseparably from the idea of sufferingfor just as the wayofaccess to a king is through the provisionsforways ofaccess  so the meaning of provisionofawayofaccess is the meaning of basethe right mindfulness right effort and right concentration are the Concentration Category and the right intention  and right view  are the Understanding Categorythey are the footing for consciousnessand what is pervertable has to be knownWhat is the one perversion It is that distortion into the opposite by which the perverted  perception etc seizesThe form category is the bodyasagroundforselfhoodthe feeling category is feelingasagroundforselfhoodthe perception category and determinations category are ideasasagroundforselfhoodand the consciousness category is cognizanceasagroundfor selfhoodso too with respect to feelings  cognizance  ideas that there comes to be the perversion that they are selfHerein it is for the purpose of the four perversions eradication that the Blessed One teaches and describes the four foundations of mindfulness  when someone abides contemplating the body as a body he eradicates his perversion that there is beauty in the ugly So it can be stated too with respect to feelings cognizance and ideasQuiet and insight  nongreed nonhate and nondelusion  perception of impermanence perception of pain perception of notself and perception of uglinessNonhate has the characteristic of nonillwill  its footing is abstention from killingbreathingthingsUnderstanding has the characteristic of actofunderstanding   its manifestation is judging how a meaning is its footing is the four noble Truthswith respect to one purifiedand any fathoming  is insightany reliance thereon attachment approaching cleaving wish infatuation disposition or aspiration is Origin  the abandoning of that is Cessation  the quiet and insight are the PathHerein what are the four MeditationsHerein what is the meaning of impermanentMeditation  is fading of lustThe four meditations can be cited in detail They are of two kinds dissociated from enlightenment factors and associated with enlightenment factorsHerein those dissociated from enlightenment factors belong to those outside the Enlightened Ones dispensation while those associated with enlightenment factors belong to persons ennobled by obtainment of the Eight Factored PathHerein there are these  six personal roots namely lust and the rest By presenting them as in one of lusting temperament of hating temperament of deluded temperament of lustinghating temperament of lustingdeluded temperament of hatingdeluded temperament and of lusthateand delusiontendingtobequieted temperament there are thus these seven types of persons who have the five hindrances  to their entry upon meditationThe opposite according to capacity to resist them counteracts the three roots of unprofit  as follows by means of the profitable root nongreed it counteracts covetousness and agitation and driftingabout which are due to the unprofitable root greed  worry and uncertainty are on the side of delusion and it counteracts that by means of nondelusion Herein for the fulfilling of nongreed he thinks renunciation thinkingHerein for the fulfilling of nonhate he thinks nonillwill thinkingHerein for the fulfilling of nondelusion he thinks noncrueltythinkingHerein for the fulfilling of nongreed he is Herein for the fulfilling of nonhate and for the fulfilling of nondelusion he is  And so  Thinking   there are three kinds of thinking namely renunciationthinking nonillwillthinking and noncrueltythinking Herein  thinking  is the first instance  while  exploring  is the exploration of what is got thusJust as when a man sees a man coming in the distance he does not yet know whether it is a woman or a man but when he has got the perception that it is a woman or that it is a man or that it is one of such colour  or that it is one of such shape  then when he is thinking this he further scrutinizes as follows How then is he virtuous or unvirtuous rich or poor  such is exploringIn thinking he fixes  in exploring  he wanders about his fixed object and turns it overAnd just as a winged bird  first accumulates speed and afterwards no more accumulates speed when gliding so too thinking is like the accumulation of speed and like the outstretchedness of the gliding birds wings is exploringSuch thinking is the opposite of perception of sensual desires  such exploring is the opposite of perception of ill will and of perception of crueltyThe action  of such kinds of thinking is nonattention to the unprofitable The action of such kinds of exploring is the restraining of the  forerunners Thinking is like a textreciter  who does his recital silently exploring is like his simply contemplating itThinking is like nondiagnosis Thinking is the Discrimination of Language and the Discrimination of Perspicuity  exploring is the Discrimination of Ideas and the Discrimination of Meanings Thinking is cognizances skill in health exploring is cognizances skill in directiveguidanceThinking is about this being profitable this unprofitable about this to be kept in being this to be abandoned this to be verified   exploring is like the abandoning the keeping in being the verifyingThe twofold bodily and mental pain does not arise in one steadied in these types of thinking and explaring and the twofold pleasure bodily and mental does ariseThe mental pleasure thus sprung  from thinking is happiness  while the bodily pkasure is bodily  feeling The unification here is concentration That is how the first meditation has abandoned five factors and possesses five factors With constant cultivation of this same thinking and exploring his mentality becomes inclined theretoThen the thinking and exploring seem  gross to himHis heart which in the first meditation had explorings objectThe two ideas namely thinking and exploring need no longer be recollectedIt is through that singleness that the happiness comes to fulfilmentThe happiness is the mental joy faculty  while the pleasure is the bodily pleasure facultySo that second meditation possesses four factors  has abandoned  what is comprised by wetnessBut joycognizance still arises  there and when he investigates that he attends with only  conascent onlookingequanimity And the unification of cognizance is concentration So that third meditation possesses five  factors hate and lethargy anddrowsiness are on the side of hate and it counteracts that by means of nonhatewhich keeps preserving the thinkings  and keeps preserving the exploringsexploring is like diagnosisand the renunciationborn  pleasure ofhappiness also is grossand so concentrationborn happiness and delight are born insteadbecomes confident in itself with the pacification of these namely thinking and exploringand what now can be served  is the presently arisensingleness due to their quieting which singleness is unificationthe unification of cognizance is concentration and as he still feels with the body the pleasure induced by the happiness he abides awareby means of which mindfulness  and awareness the onlookingequanimity comes to fulfilmentso Herein the onlooking equanimity was as yet unclarified  owing to the presence of the four faculties namely the pain faculty grief faculty pleasure faculty and joy facultyWith the cessation of these there is onlookingequanimity and awareness Herein it was owing to the pleasure faculty and the joy faculty that there was unmindfulness and with their cessation he becomes possessed of mindfulness  and it is owing to the pain faculty and the grief faculty that there was unawareness  and with their cessation he becomes aware So with the clarification  due to onlookingequanimity which is accompanied by neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling he becomes mindful and aware and there is unification of cognizance  This is called the fourth meditationHerein the person of lusting temperament has the pleasure faculty and the joy faculty The person of hating temperament has the pain faculty and the grief faculty The person of deluded temperament has unmindfulness and unawarenessHerein the lustingtemperament persons approval ceases in the third meditation and in the fourth The hatingtemperament persons resistance ceases in the first meditation and in the second The deludedtemperament persons unawareness ceases in the first meditation and in the secondwhile his uninindfulness ceases in the third meditation and in the fourth That is how these three types of persons four meditations arrive at their cleansingHerein the person of lustinghating temperament has unmindfulness and unawareness  and approval and resistance hence his meditation is of the kind dealing with diminution Herein the person of lustingdeluded temperament has the trio with approval   and he is one who sees gratification  hence his meditation is of the kind dealing with diminutionHerein the person of hatingdeluded temperament has the trio with resistance  and he is one who sees disappointment  hence his meditation is of the kind dealing with diminutionHerein It is the person of lustinghateanddelusion tendingtobequieted temperament     who has the kind of meditation that deals with distinction  That is how  these four meditations can be demonstrated among these seven types of persons Also  as regards the four kinds of concentration in the four bases for success the first meditation is through concentration due to will the second meditation is through concentration due to energy the third meditation is through concentration due to cognizance and the fourth meditation is through concentration due to inquiryAgain the first meditation is through the Dispositionless the second meditation is through the Void the third meditation is through the Signless and the fourth meditation is through Mindfulness of BreathingAgain the first meditation is through the pacification of sensualdesire thinking and illwill  the second meditation is through the pacification of thinking and exploring the third meditation is through the pacification of the pleasure faculty and the grief faculty and the fourth meditation is through the pacification of the bodily determinations namely inbreath and outbreath Again the first meditation is through the Expression of Generosity the second meditation is through the Expression of Truth the third meditation is through the Expression of Understanding and the fourth meditation is through the Expression of PeaceThese four meditations are now demonstrated by a brief demonstration  It is here that the concentration faculty comes to fulfilmentthe other four faculties there being subordinate to it Herein he who reaches exhaustion of taints by depending on the first meditation has gone by the painful I Way with sluggish acquaintance with the grief faculty in oppositionHe who reaches exhaustion of taints by depending on the second meditation has gone by the painful  Way with swift acquaintance with the pain faculty in oppositionHe who reaches exhaustion by depending on the third meditation has gone by the pleasant Way with sluggish acquaintance with the joy faculty in oppositionHe who reaches exhaustion of taints by depending on the fourth meditation has gone by the pleasant Vay with swift acquaintance with the pleasure faculty in oppositionMiscellaneous Demonstration The accessories are these  With these accessories the condition for its coming about is this  The stipulate for its coming about is this  The keeping of the stipulate in being is this  With that keeping of it in being the disappointment is this  The falling away through this disappointment is this   Whose falling away Falling away of a meditator who resorts to that meditation through that distinction the gratification is this Whose gratification is it The  thoroughbred meditators   This  thoroughbred  meditator has steadied that meditation in skill in health  When that steadied meditation comes to nonlapse  it is the meditation power  When steadied in the meditation power the perfection  is this  When the meditation has reached perfection its factors are these    Now he who has undisturbed intention  keeps the meditation factors in being in the first meditation and precisely because he is one who recollects that fact  happiness too  is a meditation factor in the first meditation and also because when he possesses the factors his ideas are drenched  by that happiness In the second meditation  too happiness is a meditation factor but rather is it so as the essential idea here owing to the very pleasantness of the meditationfactor ideas that accompany meditation occurring in this second way Confidence in oneself is a meditationfactor in the second meditation owing to clarification of the mind and it is owing to its being drenched  by that clarificationthat the happiness is also a meditationfactor in the second meditation for it is happiness concentrated  by the confidence in oneself that is a meditationfactor in the second meditation Singleness of heart  is also a meditationfactor in the second meditation  The state of contact accompanied by onlookingequanimity is a meditationfactor in the third meditation and pleasure is a factor of it too Singleness of heart  is also a meditation factor in the third  meditation Onlookingequanimity and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling are also  meditationfactors in the fourth meditation but the onlookingequanimity is that belonging to the plane of directivemanagementPurityofmindfulness is a meditation factor in the fourth meditation but purityofmindfulness itself alone is a meditationfactor in more than one plane unassociated with happiness Singleness of heart is also a meditationfactor in the fourth meditation  Herein what is the MeditationPlane In the first meditation with thinking and with exploring the meditationplane is that which goes with seclusionIn the third meditation the meditationplane is that which has no happiness  since it has abandoned  excitement due to pleasureIn the fourth meditation the meditationplane is that unaccompanied  by pleasure or pain and accompanied by directivemanagementIn the second meditation the meditationplane is that accompanied by those Bases for Transcendance  which are found among those percipient of form in themselves namely the first two such BasesIn the third meditation the plane of meditation is that accompanied by the Liberations among those having the eight  LiberationsThe plane of the fourth meditation is rightly that which has bodilydeterminations unaccompanied by inbreath and outbreath   Herein what is the meditationdistinctionIt is that when quite secluded from sensual desires secluded from evil unprofitable ideas there is surmounting of the sensual desire element which surmounting is accompanied by cognizance and cognizanceconcomitants this is a meditationdistinctionThat perception and attention  take place without thinking and without exploring and are accompanied by happiness owing to their being accompanied by mindfulness with happinessThat also in the plane without thinking and without exploring perception and attention  that go with mindfulness accompanied by onlookingequanimity take placeThat perception and attention  accompanied by purity of mindfulness take place and that having entered upon that plane he abides in it this is a meditationdistinctionThat perception and attention  accompanied by the Base ConsistingofNonOwning take place on the plane of that accompanied by the BaseConsistingofInfinitenessofConsciousness and that having entered upon that plane he abides in it this is a meditationdistinction MeditationAccessories The state of purporting removal of sensualdesire thinking is the accessory consisting in renunciation thinkingThe state of purporting removal of illwill thinking is the accessory consisting in nonillwill thinkingThe state of purporting removal of cruelty thinking is the accessory consisting in noncruelty thinkingThe state of abiding without action  as doorguardedness in the five faculties beginning with the eye is the accessory consisting in fewnessofwishes and it is purified livelihood as accessory of the four attainmentsThe state of right practice is the accessory consisting in the pathThe state of meditations having been generated  is the accessory consisting in the fruit The Meditations Coming About  Meditations  that have come to be originated in any instance whatever  with the profitable as cause These come about when they have reached renunciationThey come about when there is the concentration due to cessation of objectivesupport of thinking and exploring They come about with the absence of happinessThey come about with the abandoning of the pleasure faculty and joy faculty and with the absence of affectionthey come about with nonfeverThis is the meditations coming about Herein what is the stipulate Close relationship with the good is a stipulate for meditationDoorguardedness in the faculties beginning with the eye is a stipulate for meditationDiscontent  with mere profitable ideas is a stipulate for meditationHearing the true object of faith is a stipulate for meditationThe measuregauge  of one who has a sense of urgency with regard to an urgent instance Herein what is the keeping in beingCultivation of lovingkindness is the keeping of nonillwill thinking in beingCultivation of compassion  is the keeping of noncruelty thinking in beingKeeping gladness in being is the state of one who acts with happiness pleasure and awarenessThere is keeping onlooking equanimity in being as productivity  and there is keeping onlookingequanimity in being as unproductivity   which are respectively onlookingequanimity and looking on at There is keeping perception of ugliness  in being which is the painful way with sluggish acquaintance such acquaintance being that tied to existence belonging to those tied to existence   That keeping in being in the six ways  is kept in being made much of established made the basis made the vehicle  consolidated  and thoroughly well instigated Likewise    in the first meditation the grief faculty  ceasesand in the second meditation the pain faculty ceases  The Meditations are four and their respective Factors are these The particular mass  of these factors is with any factor of that mass  the Meditation Plane What  is its distinction  It is the distinction of this meditation  When he reviews that meditation as to superiority the distinction being this In the second meditation without thinking and without exploring the meditationplane is that which goes with the happiness born of confidence in oneselfAgain the first meditation the meditationplane is that accompanied by the Measureless States  and has creatures for its objectthis is a meditationdistinctionand that in virtue of the essential idea of this meditation mindfulness is establishedand that having entered upon that plane he abides in it this is a meditationdistinctionThey come about with nonburningHaving a good friend is a stipulate for meditationthis is a stipulate for meditation For one who keeps it in being thus the disappointment is as followsIn the case of the first meditation this idea possesses determinations this idea is still unpurified   and  has taintsthis idea has this habit and has a nearopposite this idea has sensual desire to shadow and haunt it and it is the grossest of all the attainments It has thinking and exploringwhich still disturb cognizance and the body still gets tired there and when the body gets tired cognizance is harrassed and the body is unamenable to directive management for the five worldly kinds of supernormal acquaintance These are the disappointments in the first meditationIn the case of the second meditation the disappointments are these  this idea is accompanied by the extension  of happiness  while cognizance is no longer accessible to disturbance  by thinking and exploring yet this idea still has a danger that has access  to it for this idea has grief for its enemyand this idea is at the mercy  of the happiness belonging to the associated ideas there and accordingly it has difficulty  in avoiding the plane of anxiety about the nonoccurrence of the ceased happiness and this idea in regard to the four kinds of painfulness is interpenetrated by them namely by the painfulness in fear  by the painfulness in impediment  by the painfulness in acquaintance  and by the painfulness in lust These are the disappointments in the second meditationHerein what is the disappointment in the third meditationOwing to its state of being accompanied by pleasuredueto onlookingequanimity  this idea is subordinate  to the onlooking equanimity pleasure belonging to the perceptions  possessing the liking there hence the pleasure there is constantly perceived as accessible to pain and so on account of the disturbance of cognizance it goes with  pleasure and painWhat is the disappointment in the fourth meditationUp to the NonOwning Attainment these ideas have further coattainments and on that plane various types of views arise in foolish ordinary men who like them And the meditations are interpenetrated  by gross and subtle perceptions of form Always a sentimental lovingkindness  etc is shared  with each fraction and subfraction of meditation and all the four accessories are difficult And these meditations come about through something else  each coming about in dependence on another below itand when come about here these ideas are still uncompletedand with the sign not properly taken up  these ideas fall awayAnd since these ideas are cessative   they do not arouse emergent qualities  The meditations belonging to these ideas have factors of successive cessation and the signs  may not be conformable with the meditationsign perceptionand that perception comes about as something not previously obtained and only in virtue of the right type of meditator With these disappointments the falling away from the meditation is thisIn one who has some residual perception while in the fourth Formless State by his not deliberating upon the cessation attainment   perception and attention  accompanying the Base Consisting of Nonowning which is the third Formless State take place in him and so he falls away from the cessationattainment In one who being percipient of imperturbability   has entered upon the Nonpercipient Base  perception and attention  accompanying the BaseConsistingofNonOwning  take place in him and since he does not understand that plane he falls away from itIn one who has entered upon the third Formless State namely the BaseConsistingofNonOwning perception and attention  accompanying the BaseConsistingofInfinitenessofConsciousness take place in him and since he does not understand that plane he falls away from itIn one who has entered upon the second Formless State namely the BaseConsistingofInfinitenessofConsciousness perception and attention accompanied by perception of form   For whom does it fall away In  colt meditation   the meditator meditates as a colt  he meditates misapprehending he meditates interrupting he meditates destroying   he meditates accumulating action  he meditates without consolidating anything  he meditates overrunning he meditates slighting he meditates without tranquillizing  the bodily determination he meditates without knowing the escape from obsession he meditates while still overcome by hindrances  It is when the meditator gives attention to his having attained meditation that there is the gratification of the meditation And the abandoning of the obsession by lust for sensual desires  is the gratification of meditation While they owe their origin  to ideas whose cause is lust for sensual desires the meditations have in the first instance factors cessative  of those ideas and beyond the first of the pleasure by means of which the happiness is abandoned and so it is the abandoning of defilements due to sensual desire and to action  that is the gratification  Again the gratification of meditation is as follows that while still in the lifeinaworld oppressed as it is by the major kinds of habit there may yet come about an opportunity for nonconstraint this is the abandoning offered by meditation nevertheless this benefit of meditation here in the lifeinaworld which consists in obstructing and disobstructing does not have the benefit of abandoning the roundabout of births for creatures who are involved in the roundabout that evolves without ultimate goal  This is the gratification of meditation  Gratification for whom  For the  thoroughbred meditator  for a meditator who has meditated as a  thorough bred  meditates without misapprehending what he has meditated as a thoroughbred and the clauses for the colt meditator   can be set up in parallel fashion in the opposite sense Herein what is skill in meditationNow this also  in one as just described and who does not apprehend  any sign in the object externally  is the DirectiveManagement Power for supernormal acquaintance The signs of unification of cognizance  are well apprehended by the Quiet Power and it is in meditation made to occur by the quiet due to the Path and its Fruit that there is no more foundering  Concentrations purity  that is due to onlookingequanimity which is that in one who apprehends well the consecutivity of the signs  is the Mindfulness Power Insight  with respect to ideas made to occur thereby is the Understanding Power   Herein what is meditationperfectionLovingkindness brought to thorough perfection      Now as to the verse    By the Mode of Conveying a Teaching two truths are demonstrated here in This Thread namely Suffering and Origin   By the Mode of Conveying an investigation that those who see  nothing blameworthy in ideas provocative of fetters will cross the flood no such instance is found and on account of its still going with pleasure and pain cognizance is still unamenable to directive management for the verification of the five worldly supernormal acquaintances and all these ideas in regard to the first three meditationattainments are interpenetrated  by the four painfulnesses namely by the painfulness in fear  by the painfulness in impediment by the painfilness in acquaintance and by the painfulness in lust These are the disappointments in the third meditationin detail down to  in the first meditation perception of sensual desire  can be citedSkill in attaining is skill in meditation skill in distinction of meditations is skill in meditation skill in succession of meditations is skill in meditation skill in emerging from attainment is skill in meditation skill in the meditations individual essences is skill in meditation skill in the meditations disappointments is skill in meditation skill in escape in the case of the meditations is skill in meditation  Through the Meditation Power  skill in means is obtained Through the Meditation Power the nonfallingaway that is the essential idea of a power in the Deliberating Power  is obtained and also the higher meditation dealing with distinction that is due to playing  with the meditation already generated  is obtainedthat they will not cross such an instance is found  There is this Construing and Investigation  What is this the Footing for  Clung to desires is the five strands of sensual desires  that is the footing for craving for sensual desires Seeing nothing blameworthy in fetters is the footing fo ignorance Assuredly those clung with fetterclinging  never cross the vast abounding flood  is the footing for assuming Clung to desires  sensual desires are twofold namely sensual desire as thing and sensual desire as defilement   Herein sensual desire as defilement is craving for sensual desires as things when craving for sensual desires is stated craving for form and craving for being are stated  under the Mode of Conveying Characteristics   Seeing nothing blameworthy in Fetters  Any will and lust herein for the fetter what is the footing for thatNow when pleasant feeling is admitted the three kinds of feeling are admittedWhen the feeling category is admitted all the five categories are admittedWhen sensual desires as things forms sounds odours flavours tangibles are admitted all the six external bases are admittedWhen the inoneself and external bases are admitted all the existent is admitted  This is called the Mode of Conveying Characteristics  Herein he  who becomes free from lust for a gross defilement resided in does not thereby become necessarily free from lust for all the defilements subtler than that Herein the external fetter is  mine  while the fetter in oneself is  I Herein what is the Blessed Ones Purport Clung to desires Those who cling  the things to which they cling those who do not cling and that whereby they do not  cling  this mood is fourfoldHerein what are the three footings for the perversions is met with as the footing for the action of a doer of what is inferior and superiorThen when persevering with the protection guarding and preservation of those important persons even while assuming  ill will towards that other he still sees to the safety of the important personsIn their safety being seen to when he assumes  ill will towards him who might misbehave towards themhe performs action born of hatewhich is a hindrance due to an improper faculty  Then any  perception  herein of their freedom from fear as an offering is action  of a doer of what  is superior but  any  ill will regarding the misbehaviour  towards them is action of a doer of what  is inferior Greed and hate are terms for hindrances These are the four assumings When anyonewhether woman or manhas assuming in virtue of these four assumings their five categories are Suffering while that same assuming is Origin This Suffering and this Origin are also the Mode of Conveying a TeachingHerein those who do not  cling  to sensual desires do not  cling owing to contemplation of disappointmentSo desirousness to renounce with respect to this element of sensual desire  is called will for renunciation any determinative act  that does not upset any  whether frail or firm  is will for nonillwilland which does not  show cruelty is will for non crueltyHerein will for renunciation is nongreed will for non illwill is nonhate and will for noncruelty is nondelusionThese three roots of profit when produced in the eight Rightnesses  conduce to cessation of those same four assumingsOr if one should again do action whether black or white they conduce to the diminution of its ripening this is the neitherblack norwhite kind of action that conduces to exhaustion of action Herein cessation of the three roots of unprofit is Cessation Clung to desires   those who are Initiates cling only in one  moodwhile those who are ordinary men cling in two moods Therefore  this question must be called one declarable after analysis Although the StreamEnterer still clings it is in using not in insisting  for he  exerts himself for dispersal not for amassingThe Initiate still uses sensual desires with defilement but the ordinary man uses sensual desires in order to mould defilementThat is why  the question namely One who clings  to sensual desires will not  cross the fourfold flood  is one that is declarable after analysis This is AnalysisReversal Those who are not  clung to sensual desires and not bound by fetters will cross over the vast abounding floodThis is the opposite of this ThreadSynonyms one who is clinging to sensual desires and the strand of sensual desires there a synonym therefore is this  term  creature who clings Herein synonyms for sensual desires are as follows mire dirt  barb boil calamity  menace  or any other synonymsalso for this  term creature who clings the synonyms arenamely  creature who clings  much abiding in or any other  Ways of Entry  with this verse the way of entry is  dependent arising suffering and originthe defilements the determinations and the fetters  in the case of the Categories the determinations category is the way of entry in the case of the Bases the unprofitable ideas are the idea base in the case of the faculties the pleasure faculty and joy faculty This is the way of entry by facultiesClearing UpTerms of Expression some of these ideas are described by a unity and some by a diversityIn the case of those who cling to the five strands of sensual desires the obsessions and perversions are described in terms of a diversity Cross the vast abounding flood ignorance is described in terms of a unityRequisites what is the cause what the condition for thatThe strands of sensual desire  are  a condition by objectconditionalityThis is the cause this is the conditionCoordnation the opinion  that those who have clung to sensual desires have a good destination are fair of form  this is will and lust for the sensedesire element That is determinations consisting of demeritWhat have they for their conditionThey have ignorance of their conditionWhat are they a condition forSo with ignorance as condition determinations with determinations as condition consciousness  down to  ageing and death  that is how there is an origin to this whole great  category of suffering One Thread is goneThe Thread dealing with the five Hindrances can be quoted Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Teaching Covetousness and ill will and agitation are craving Lethargy and drowsiness and worry and uncertainty are wrong viewBut although unwieldiness of the body is drowsiness yet it is not a defilement by its individual essence Accordingly stickiness of cognizance  and unwieldiness of body  are an imperfection by what they side with not a defilement by their own individual essenceHerein the kind of lethargy belonging to cognizance obeying  perception of self is weariness while worry is stickiness of cognizance  So these are the five hindrances Four hindrances are defilements by their individual essence but lethargyanddrowsiness is an imperfection by its siding with the hindrancesJust as the four taints are taints through their being taints by their own individual essences as such not through cognizances taintednessnevertheless while these are the four taints that are through their own individual essencesas such there are also taints that are taints only through the taintedness of what they side with But then it was said  Whatever any  taints are associated with or dissociated from in the ThreadofArgument concerned it is by that alone that they can be called tainted or untaintedIt is pleasant feeling and the two faculties namely the pleasure faculty and the joy facultyIt is that those who desire to cross the flood will abide contemplating disappointment in ideas provocative of fetters  this is the Blessed Ones purport hereThe three unprofitable roots are the footing for the perversion of cognizance for the perversion of view and for the perversion of perception  The three unprofitable roots are the footing for the action of a doer  of what is inferior and superiorand for the four kinds of assuming For instance the unprofitable root hateas when someone gives freedom from fear to a mother or a father or  some important bhikkhuand someone else might misbehave towards them by body or by speechSo three kinds of will are directed to renunciation will for renunciation will for nonillwill and will for noncrueltyand the way thereto  is the Path so these are two Truths  these are the four Truths  This is the Mode of Conveying a Conversionclung  bound  infatuated seized cleaved to implicated in sensual desire not released  much abiding

synonyms are variedand these sensual desires  described by a description in terms of indulging in sensual desires and by a description in terms of province of defilement are also described by a description in terms of seed  described by a description in terms of the fetter of determinations The assuming is described by a description in terms of cause The person is described by a description

Annoyance can be cited thus namely how tainted lovingkindnesscontemplators of someone coveted think about someone He is workinghas workwill work for his harm  and arouse  ill will therefor Such defilement of this contemplator of ill will in the form of fever  bodily weariness or unwieldiness is drowsiness Disquiet due  thereto is agitation Any judgment  similar to that is uncertaintyHerein

abandoning of hindrances is CessationThese are the four TruthsThis is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold ArrayHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a ConversionThe five Hindrances are tenWhat one lusts for in oneself is a hindrancewhat one lusts for externally is a hindrance   and so down to  uncertainty These are ten hindrancesThere is defilement concerning what is in oneself and what is external  that is two kinds of fetter namely fetter in oneself and fetter externallyHerein  I  is that in oneself while  mine  is the externalThe embodiment view is that in oneself while the sixtyone types of view are the externalAny will and lust  regarding what is in oneself is not without lust not without will for form  Any cleaving to the six external bases and to the kinds of being is craving for the externalThese are two Truths namely the fetters and the ideas provocative of fettersHerein any contemplation of dispassion in regard to ideas provocative of fetters is the PathThis is the Mode of Conveying a ConversionHerein what is the Mode of Coveying an AnalysisThe fetter of conceit  deals with views   this is not unilaterally always so For one does not abandon conceit by depending on abandoning views and although the conceit that belongs to the furtherside fetters may be on the side of viewsnevertheless the abandoning of only the hitherside fetters does not bring about its abandoningsince the Imaking is still left intact Again when it occurs to someone thus  while this is covetousness it is not the first hindranceAgain an Arahant has the drowsiness of bodily defilement that finds a footing in him but that is not the third hindrance so when it is said lethargyanddrowsiness is a hindrance to oneThis is the Mode of Conveying an AnalysisReversal the five hindrances come to abandonment by means of the fivefactored Meditation this is their opposite It cannot be assessed in any other way than this that Soandsos hindrances  are abandoned The ultimate aim is inoneself

way too these five hindrances  in this Thread are described  by a description in terms of presentationHerein what is the Way of EntryThese five hindrances are ignorance and craving Herein hindrances have ignorance for their rootfor any craving is determinations and they have ignorance for therr condition These two ideas are included in the determinations category among the five categories in the idea base among the bases the idea element among the elements while in the case of the faculties the footing for these ideas is that  of the pleasure faculty and the joy faculty and the femininity

also the barbs and also the assumingsMonks when Prince Vipassi was bom they showed him to King Bandhuma and said Your Majesty a son has been bom to you Deign Sire to look at himThe king looked at the prince and then said to the Brahmins skilled in signs You gentlemen are skilled in signs examine the princeThe Brahmins examined the prince and said to King Bandhuma Sire rejoice for a mighty son has

King Bandhuma having clothed those Brahmins in fresh clothes satisfied all their wishesAnd King Bandhuma appointed nurses for Prince VipassiSome suckled him some bathed him some carried him some dandled himA white umbrella was held over him night and day that he might not be harmed by cold or heat or grass or dustAnd Prince Vipassi was much beloved of the peopleJust as everybody loves a blue yellow or white lotus so they all loved Prince VipassiThus he was borne from lap to lapAnd Prince Vipassi had a sweet voice a beautiful voice charming and delightfulJust as in the Himalaya mountains the karavtkabird has a voice sweeter more beautiful charming and delightful than all other birds so too was Prince Vipassls voice the finest of allAnd owing to the results of past kamma the divine eye was present to Prince Vipassi with which he could see for a league day and night alikeAnd Prince Vipassi was unblinkingly watchful like the ThirtyThree GodsAnd because it was said that he was unblinkingly watchful the prince came to be called VipassiWhen King Bandhuma was trying a case he took Prince Vipassi on his knee and instructed him in the caseThen putting him down from his knee his father would carefully explain the issues to himAnd for this reason he was all the more called VipassiThen King Bandhuma caused three palaces to be built for Prince Vipassi one for the rainy season one for the cold season and one for the hot season to cater for all the fivefold sensepleasuresThere Prince Vipassi stayed in the rainyseason palace for the four months of the rainy season with no male attendants surrounded by female musicians and he never left that palaceEnd of first recitationsection  Then monks after many years many hundreds and thousands of years had passed Prince Vipassi said to his charioteer Harness some fine carriages charioteeft We will go to the pleasurepark to inspect itThe charioteer did so then reported to the prince Your Royal Highness the fine carriages are harnessed it is time to do as you wishAnd Prince Vipassi mounted a carriage and drove in procession to the pleasurepark And as he was being driven to the pleasurepark Prince Vipassi saw an aged man bent like a roofbeam broken leaning on a stick tottering sick his youth all vanishedAt the sight he said to the charioteer Charioteer what is the matter with this manHis hair is not like other mens his body is not like other mensPrince that is what is called an old manBut why is he called an old man He is called old PrinceBut am I liable to become old and not exempt from old ageBoth you and I Prince are liable to become old and are not exempt from old ageWell then charioteer that will do for today with the pleasureparkReturn now to the palaceVery good Prince said the charioteer and brought Prince Vipassi back to the palaceArrived there Prince Vipassi was overcome with grief and dejection crying Shame on this thing birth since to him who is bom old age must manifest itself because he has not long to live Then King Bandhuma sent for the charioteer and said Well did not the prince enjoy himself at the pleasureparkWasnt he happy thereYour Majesty the prince did not enjoy himself he was not happy thereWhat did he see on the way thereSo the charioteer told the King all that had happened Then King Bandhuma thought After many hundreds of thousands of years Prince Vipassi ordered his charioteer to drive to the pleasurepark  And as he was being driven to the pleasurepark Prince Vipassi saw a sick man suffering very ill fallen in his own urine and excrement and some people were picking him up and others putting him to bedAt the sight he said to the charioteer What is the matter with this manHis eyes are not like other mens his head is not like other mensPrince that is what is called a sick manBut why is he called a sick man Prince he is so called because he can hardly recover from his illnessBut am I liable to become sick and not exempt from sicknessBoth you and I Prince are liable to become sick and not exempt from sicknessWell then charioteer return now to the palaceArrived there Prince Vipassi was overcome with grief and dejection crying Shame on this thing birth since he who is bom must experience sickness  Then King Bandhuma sent for the charioteer who told him what had happened So the King provided for Prince Vipassi to have even more enjoyment of the fivefold sensepleasures in order that he should rule the kingdom and not go forth from the household life into homelessnessThus the prince continued to live indulging in and addicted to the fivefold sensepleasuresPrince Vipassi must not renounce the throne he must not go forth from the household life into homelessness  the words of the Brahmins learned in signs must not come true The king provided Prince Vipassi with even more sense pleasures in order that he should rule the kingdom and not go forth from the household life into homelessnessAnd as he was being driven to the pleasurepark Prince Vipassi saw a large crowd collecting clad in many colours and carrying a bierAt the sight he said to the charioteer Why are those people doing thatPrince that is what they call a dead manDrive me over to where the dead man isVery good Prince said the charioteer and did soAnd Prince Vipassi gazed at the corpse of the dead man Then he said to the charioteer Why is he called a dead manPrince he is called a dead manBut am I subject to dying not exempt from dyingBoth you and I Prince are subpfet to dying not exempt from itWell then charioteer that will do for today with the pleasureparkReturn now to the palaceThen King Bandhuma sent for the charioteer After many hundreds of thousands of years Prince Vipassi ordered his charioteer to drive to the pleasureparkbecause now his parents and other relatives will not see him again nor he themArrived there Prince Vipassi was overcome with grief and dejection crying Shame on this thing birth since to him who is bom death must manifest itselfwho told him what had happenedThe king provided Prince Vipassi with even more sensepleasuresAfter many hundreds of thousands of years Prince Vipassi ordered his charioteer to drive to the pleasureparkAnd as he was being driven to the pleasurepark Prince Vipassi saw a shavenheaded man one who had gone forth wearing a yellow robeAnd he said to the charioteer What is the matter with that manHis head is not like other mens and his clothes are not like other mensPrince he is called one who has gone forthWhy is he called one who has gone forth Prince by one who has gone forth we mean one who truly follows Dhamma who truly lives in serenity does good actions performs meritorious deeds is harmless and truly has compassion for living beingsCharioteer he is well called one who has gone forthVery good Prince said the charioteer and did soAnd Prince Vipassi questioned the man who had gone forth Prince as one who has gone forth I truly follow DhammaDrive the carriage over to where he isYou are well called one who has gone forthand have compassion for living beingsThen Prince Vipassi said to the charioteer You take the carriage and drive back to the palaceBut I shall stay here and shave off my hair and beard put on yellow robes and go forth from the household life into homelessnessVery good Prince said the charioteer and returned to the palaceAnd Prince Vipassi shaving off his hair and beard and putting on yellow robes went forth from the household life into homelessnessAnd a great crowd from the royal capital city Bandhumati eightyfour thousand peopleheard that Prince Vipassi had gone forth into homelessnessAnd they thought This is certainly no common teaching and discipline no common goingforth for which Prince Vipassi has shaved off hair and beard donned yellow robes and gone forth into homelessnessIf the Prince has done so why should not we And so monks a great crowd of eightyfour thousand having shaved off their hair and beards and donned yellow robes followed the Bodhisatta Vipassi into homelessnessAnd with this following the Bodhisatta went on his rounds through villages towns and royal citiesThen the Bodhisatta Vipassi having retired to a secluded spot had this thought It is not proper for me to live with a crowd like this I must live alone withdrawn from this crowdSo after a while he left the crowd and dwelt alone The eightyfour thousand went one way the Bodhisatta anotherThen when the Bodhisatta had entered his dwelling alone in a secluded spot he thought This world alas is in a sorry state there is birth and decay there is death and falling into other states and being reborn And no one knows any way of escape from this suffering this ageing and death When will deliverance be found from this suffering this ageing and death And then monks the Bodhisatta thought With what being present does ageinganddeath occur What conditions ageinganddeathAnd then monks as a result of the wisdom born of profound consideration the realisation dawned on him Birth being present ageinganddeath occurs birth conditions ageinganddeath Then he thought What conditions birthAnd the realisation dawned on him Becoming conditions birth Clinging conditions becomingAnd then the Bodhisatta Vipassi thought With what being present does consciousness occur What conditions consciousnessAnd then as a result of the wisdom bom of profound consideration the realisation dawned on him Mindand body conditions consciousnessThen monks the Bodhisatta Vipassi thought This consciousness turns back at mindandbody it does not go any furtherTo this extent there is birth and decay there is death and falling into other states and being reborn namely Mindandbody conditions consciousness and consciousness conditions mindandbody mindandbodyconditions thesix sensebases the six sensebasescondition contact contact conditions feeling feeling conditions craving craving conditions clinging clinging conditions becoming becoming conditions birth birth conditions ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and distressAnd thus this wljole mass of suffering takes its originAnd at the thought Origin origin there arose in the Bodhisatta Vipassi with insight into things never realised before knowledge wisdom awareness and lightThen he thought What now being absent does ageinganddeath not occur With the cessation of what comes the cessation of ageinganddeathAnd then as a result of the wisdom born of profound consideration the realisation dawned on him Birth being absent ageinganddeath does not occurWith the cessation of birth comes the cessation of ageinganddeath With the cessation of what comes the cessation of birth With the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birthThen the Bodhisatta Vipassi thought I have found the insight way to enlightenment namely By the cessation of mindandbody consciousness ceases by the cessation of consciousness mindandbody ceases by the cessation of mindandbody the six sensebases cease by the cessation of the six sensebases contact ceases by the cessation of contact feeling ceases by the cessation of feeling craving ceases by the cessation of craving clinging ceases by the cessation of clinging becoming ceases by the cessation of becoming birth ceases by the cessation of birth ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and distress ceaseAnd thus this whole mass of suffering ceasesAnd at the thought Cessation cessation there arose in the Bodhisatta Vipassi with insight into things never realised before knowledge vision awareness and lightThen monks at another time the Bodhisatta Vipassi dwelt contemplating the rise and fall of the five aggregates of clinging Such is the body such its arising such its passing away such is feeling such is perception such are the mental formations such is consciousness such its arising such its passing away And as he remained contemplating the rise and fall of the five aggregates of clinging before long his mind was freed from the corruptions without remainderAnd I sat down there thinking This will serve for strivingas happens in one who abides diligent ardent and resoluteWhat conditions becoming Craving conditions clinging Feeling conditions craving Contact conditions feeling The six sensebases condition contact Mindandbody conditions the six sense bases Consciousness conditions mindandbody With the cessation of mindandbody comes the cessation of consciousnessWith the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of mindandbody With the cessation of clinging comes the cessation of becoming With the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging With the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving With the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling With the cessation of the six sensebases comes the cessation of contact With the cessation of mindandbody comes the cessation of the six sensebases Then monks the Blessed Lord the Arahant the fully enlightened Buddha Vipassi thought Suppose now I were to teach DhammaAnd then he thought I have attained to this Dhamma which is profound hard to see hard to grasp peaceful excellent beyond reasoning subtle to be apprehended by the wiseBut this generation delights in clinging rejoices in it and revels in itBut for those who so delight rejoice and revel in clinging this matter is hard to see namely the conditioned nature of things or dependent originationEqually hard to see would be the calming of all the mental formations the abandonment of all the substrates of rebirththe waning of craving dispassion cessation and NibbanaAnd if I were to teach Dhamma to others and they did not understand me that would be a weariness and a trouble to me And to the Lord Buddha Vipassi there occurred spontaneously this verse never previously heardThis that Ive attained why should I proclaimThose full of lust and hate can never grasp itLeading upstream this Dhamma subtle deepHard to see no passionblinded folk can see itAs the Lord Buddha Vipassi pondered thus his mind was inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the DhammaAnd monks the Lord Buddha Vipassis reasoning became mentally known to a certain Great Brahma And he thought Alas the world is perishing it will be destroyed because the mind of Vipassi the Blessed Lord the Arahant the fully enlightened Buddha is inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the Dhamma  So this Great Brahma as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his flexed arm or flex it again disappeared from the Brahma world and reappeared before the Lord Buddha VipassiArranging his upper robe over one shoulder and kneeling on his right knee he saluted the Lord Buddha Vipassi with joined hands and said Lord may the Blessed Lord teach Dhamma may the WellFarer teach Dhamma There are beings with little dust on their eyes who are perishing through not hearing Dhamma they will become knowers of Dhamma  Then the Lord Buddha Vipassi explained why he inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the DhammaAnd just as in a pool of blue red or white lotuses some are bom in the water grow in the water and not leaving the water thrive in the water Then knowing his thought the Great Brahma addressed the Lord Buddha Vipassi in these versesAs on a mountainpeak a watcher sees the folk belowSo Man of Wisdom seeing all look down from Dhammas heightsFree from woe look on thoseArise hero victor in battle leader of the caravanTeach  Lord the Dhammaand they will understandAnd the Lord Buddha Vipassi replied to the Great Brahma in verseOpen to them are the doors of the DeathlessLet those that hear now put forth faithFor fear of trouble I did not preach at firstThe excellent Dhamma for men Brahma Then that Great Brahma thinking I have been the cause of the Lord Buddha Vipassls preaching Dhamma made obeisance to the Lord Buddha and passing by to his right vanished there and thensome are born in the water and reach the surfacewhile some are born in the water and having reached the surface grow out of the water and are not polluted by itin the same way monks the Lord Buddha Vipassi surveying the world with his Buddhaeye saw some beings with little dust on their eyesAnd the Great Brahma appealed a second and a third time to the Lord Buddha Vipassi to teachThen the Lord Buddha Vipassi recognising Brahmas appeal and moved by compassion for beings surveyed the world with his BuddhaeyeAnd he saw beings with little dust on their eyes and with much dust with faculties sharp and dull of good and bad disposition easy and hard to teach and few of them living in fear of transgression and of the next worldwho are sunk in grief oppressed with birth and agetraverse the world Then the Lord Buddha Vipassi thought To whom should I first teach this Dhamma Who would understand it quicklyThen he thought There are Khanda the Kings son and Tissa the chaplains son living in the capital city of Bandhumati They are wise learned experienced and for a long time have had little dust on their eyesIf now I teach Dhamma first to Khanda and Tissa they will understand it quicklyAnd so the Lord Buddha Vipassi as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again vanished there and then from the root of that tree of enlightenment and reappeared in the royal capital of Bandhumati in the deerpark of Khema And the Lord Buddha Vipassi said to the parkkeeper Keeper go to Bandhumati and say to Prince Khanda and the chaplains son Tissa My lords Vipassi the Blessed Lord the Arahant the fullyenlightened Buddha has come to Bandhumati and is staying in the deerpark of Khema He wishes to see youVery good Lord saidthe parkkeeper and went and delivered the messageThen Khanda and Tissa having harnessed some fine carriages drove out of BandhumatiThey took the carriages as far as they would go then alighted and continued on foot till they came to the Lord Buddha VipassiWhen they reached him they made obeisance to him and sat down to one sideAnd the Lord Buddha Vipassi delivered to them a graduated discourse on generosity on morality and on heaven showing the danger degradation and corruption of sensedesires and the profit of renunciationAnd when the Lord Buddha Vipassi knew that the minds of Khanda and Tissa were ready pliable free from the hindrances joyful and calm then he preached the Buddhas special sermon in brief on suffering its origin its cessation and the pathAnd just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly so in Prince Khanda and Tissa the chaplains son as they sat there there arose the pure and spotless DhammaEye and they knew Whatever things have an origin must come to cessationAnd they having seen attained experienced and penetrated the Dhamma having passed beyond doubt having gained perfect confidence in the Teachers doctrine without relying on others said Excellent Lord excellentIt is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was thereJust so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various waysWe go for refuge to the Lord and to the DhammaMay we receive the goingforth at the Lords hands may we receive ordination And so Prince Khanda and Tissa the chaplains son received the goingforth at the hands of the Lord Buddha Vipassi and they received ordinationThen the Lord Buddha Vipassi instructed them wifh a discourse on Dhamma inspired them fired them and delighted them showing the danger degradation and corruption of conditioned things and the profit of NibbanaAnd through their being inspired fired and delighted with this discourse it was not long before their minds were freed from the corruptions without remaindermaking for the deerpark of KhemaAnd a great crowd of eightyfour thousand people from Bandhumati heard that the Lord Buddha Vipassi was staying in the deerpark of Khema and that Khanda and Tissa had shaved off their hair and beards donned yellow robes and gone forth from the household life into homelessnessAnd they thought This is certainly no common teaching and discipline for which Prince Khanda and Tissa the chaplains son have gone forth into homelessrtessIf they can do this in the presence of the Lord Buddha Vipassi why should not weAnd so this great crowd of eightyfour thousand left Bandhumati for the deerpark of Khema where the Lord Buddha Vipassi was When they came to him they made obeisance to him and sat down to one sideAnd the Lord Buddha Vipassi delivered to them a graduated discourseAnd those eightyfour thousand received the going forth at the hands of the Lord Buddha Vipassi and they received ordinationAnd the Lord Buddha Vipassi instructed them with a discourse on DhammaThe verse  Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a TeachingWhat is the meaning in the case of this Thread It teaches the consciousness category under the definition by categories the mindconsciousness element under the definition by elements the mind base under the definition by bases and the mind faculty under the definition by facultiesWhat  ideas are heraldsBriefly six ideas are heralds  the roots of profit and the roots of unprofit But  here  the unprofitable roots  are not implied  in this Thread only the profitable roots are taughtHerein how  are ideas heralded by mindThe mind is their herald as a king is an armys herald  so too is mind ideas heraldHerein mindheralding occurs in three ways  as will for renunciation as will for nonillwill and as will for noncrueltyAs will for renunciation the mindheralding is that of nongreedHerein mind heralds them  these ideas are made emergent  by mind or they are created by mindAnd mind being the head of these ideas mind alone is the senior head of these ideas mind alone effects the domination of these ideas thus  mind heads them  there ideas go thus they are mindmadeand there is the sevenfold bodily and verbal good conduct These are the ten profitable courses of actionHerein If someone with a placid mind is mental actionis wont to speak is verbal actionWith these in this Thread the ten profitable courses of action being ultimate  are settled   the virtue and duty are creditableThe type of Thread dealing with morality consists in prosperity   not in the outlet from the world provided by the PathThis is the teachingHerein what is the Mode of Conveying an InvestigationIdeas are heralded by mind the profitable roots and the eightfactored RightnessConstruing

placidity of cognizance is the footing for the faith facultyIs wont to speak is the footing for right speechCharacteristics ideas heralded thus by consciousness are also heralded by feeling  and these are also heralded by perception and also heralded by determinationsAnd whatever ideas are conascent with the feeling etc all are heralds for these ideas heralded by consciousness and the restThen bliss sure follows after him  joy follows after him too as a most pleasant shadow so does that bliss follow after himHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a Foufold ArrayHeralded by mind  this is not the singular numberBecause these are all the six bodies of consciousness  What is the Blessed Ones purport in this ThreadThose who seek bliss make the mind placid  This is the Blessed Ones purport in this ThreadThe meaning has already been demonstrated The three  profitable roots are the cause of the eight Rightnesses this is the eightfactored PathThe  ten instances  are the teachings causes  the teachings conditions  and the demonstration Herein mind is Suffering That together with nameandform is conditioned by consciousness so while the unprofitable root is being abandoned factor by factor the plane of the unabandoned is Sufferings OriginThe abandoning of these factors  is CessationThese are the four TruthsThis is the Mode of Conveying a ConversionAnalysisBut that is not unilaterally always so of a monk or of a divinewith wrong view  for when his cognizance is placid in his own aim  and when he is wont to speak or act with that kind of placid cognizance then bliss does not surely follow after him as does His shadow keep him company but only suffering follows after himand that  So this is declarable after analysisthat the bodily action and verbal action if done with a placid mind is to be felt as pleasure on ripening  when rightly done it is to be felt as pleasure but when wrongly done it is to be felt as pain This is the analysisHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a

Conveying a Clearing UpHerein what is the Mode of Conveying Terms of Expressionas placidity due to eradication by the Path and placidity due to suppression by the Meditations As deterrence  of obsession by ill willthe placidity is due to the root namely nonhate  or also the placidity is the root itselfowing to its deterrence of what accompanies ill will Then bliss sure follows after him   bliss is bodily and mental Dissociation from the loathed and association with the loved and pleasure of renunciation and pleasure of ordinary men and the happiness enlightenment factor are mental pleasure and when one whose body is tranquil feels pleasure  that is bodily pleasureAnd that is the footing for the mental  pleasure as stated by the description That pleasure of profitable ideas is not misapprehendedFollows  absorption is shown  and this absorption concentration does not follow one who is given over to ill willThis Thread can be expressed by two moodsRequisite together with five hundred bhikkhus the Blessed One entered the city of RajagahaThere a poor man served the Blessed One Placidity arose in him with a profitable root and connected  with previous devotionTo others he announced  he spoke this pronouncement   It is gain for them whose dwelling the Blessed One enters and if that happens to us we too shall gain placidity in the Blessed OneThen extending his hands palms together towards where the Blessed One was  Honour to the Blessed One Honour to the Blessed One l  he said with no ill will in mind and he stood at one sideThereupon the Blessed One uttered this Thread   Ideas are heralded by mind  namely the whole Thread  That he the poor man spoke to others in this way  is verbal actionHerein in that he displays and speaks praise to othersIn that his heart has lovingkindness towards the Blessed One therein is manifest in him the profitable root nonhateIn that he extends his hands palms together and deters conceit therein is manifest in him the profitable root nondelusionIn that he obtains especial understanding this is his abandoning of the perversion of view There being any suppression owed to  defilements the perversions are then a condition through object conditionality and the profitable roots are a condition through cosupport conditionality  and that reasoned attention is the cause  so with this  cause and this condition this  cognizance is arisenHerein this  cognizance that has occurred with the Teacher  as its object is the Recollection of the Enlightened One Herein mindfulness and awareness are the cause and they are the condition With the bodily determination  the active determining of the action is either the cause and not the condition or  it is both  the cause  as the amassing of the action to be felt as pleasant and the condition for the actionHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a Coordination If someone with a placid mind    here only one who is mindful is placid Furthermore it is with cleansing of cognizance that creatures are liberated hence  herein also the kinds of choice being cognizanceheralded by placid cognizance are liberated  from resistance this is placidity of the kinds of choice The  placidity whereby his  that is the placidity whereby his perception  is  undistorted This placidity which is fivefold  is here placidity as suppression  the placidity as tranquillization of the body too  is dependent on cognizance but the cognizance was placid previously as wellalso placidity of the rest of the fiveFor it is not owing to the existence of a self that the actions ripening followsIt is that the means to that ripening goes along with the action and  when with that action as condition  joy arises that is also the nonremorse  that follows afterThis is the CoordinationThe Thread of Mahanama the Sakyan can be cited in detail namely how he asked For what reasonOthers have said  that faith has the characteristic of making purification of qualities reach the goal  and still others that faith has the characteristic of accepting statementsAnother way If for himself someone trusts thus I know nothing and Herein by agreement I am no knower Another way there is the contemplation of disappointment in the sixtyone types of views as impermanent painful notselfThis is called faithAnother way some ordinary being likes noninsistence  upon the twentybased  embodimentviewthough this noninsistence is not yet the kind of understanding that belongs to finding a footing in rightness   for on the contrary it is only owing to right view of howthings are that by means of all the five faculties even though blunt the defilements coefficient with wrong view  come to be It is on that same plane that the Initiates virtue is called the support of Noble Onesand it is on that same plane that even blunt understanding is called the understanding facultythe more so too since there may be  the faithlessness that belongs to a distorted view and owing to that the essentials of existence are undertaken and completed but herein the Expression of Generosity is not merely relinquishment of such evident evils as the decision I shall indulge in sensual desires the while the faith faculty is still placed there in those essentials of existence The Expression of Understanding is due to the Understanding faculty while the Expression of Peace is due to virtueNow it is when these ideas namely faith virtue generosity and understanding imbue cognizance  thatand then the virtue is diligencethe generosity is action with understandingand the understanding is the understanding faculty And herein the faith facultythe understanding is that of the Truths and any mindfulness there is conducive to all goodThat Initiate has an auspicious destination he has auspicious prospect Even when he dies  with mindfulness forgotten  it is not through that state of forgotten mindfulness  that those faculties or that profitable root have their ripeningTeaching herein there are the four ideas namely faith virtue generosity and understandingThe faith and the understanding are mental good conductSo when cognizance is admitted the five categories are admittedThe good conduct in virtue of these four ideas is the Noble Truth of Suffering and the footing for the PathHerein what is the Mode of Conveying an InvestigationThis faith and this virtue and the restwhy does he do thatIt is through faith that he recollects the Blessed One even were he to meet with a mad elephant saying  Master Hound  and all the rest of the passage  It is through virtue that he does not transgress  any instance either by body or speech and so is one free from remorse It is through generosity  that his understandingness is establishedWhen his virtue is untorn  then even when forgetfulness is arisen  no cognizance that is unprofitable or accompanied by wrong view arises in him This is the Mode of Conveying an InvestigationOne who asserts the True Idea will have an auspicious destination  there is this construingHerein what is the Mode of Conveying FootingsThe faith is his undisturbed intention and that is the footing for the second MeditationThere are the three kinds of confidence due to undergoing

CharacteristicsWhen consciousness is stated as imbued by faith etc all the five categories are statedWhen faith is mentioned all the seven kinds of riches are mentioned namely faith as riches  and so on When the virtue category is stated the concentration category and understanding category are stated tooThat when this cognizance has been long imbued it will not  have parallel occurrence therewith at the last moment  of life no such instance is foundHerein perception too has parallel occurrence therewithnamely perception of forms and choice contact  and attention occupied with forms and likewise in the case of each body of consciousness in regard to the rest of the six bases This is the Mode of Conveying CharacteristicsHerein what is the Fourfold ArrayWhat is the Blessed Ones purport

winggoer so too these ideas being produced by mind where the mind goes  there these ideas go thus they are mindmadeThey are procured by will in three ways the threefold thinking is undisturbedand or act is bodily actionthese are what is statedand  or act for right action and for right effortWhat is the reason Ideas are heralded by mind Mind heads them and they are mindmadeIf someone with a placid mind Is wont to speak or actthen bliss Sure follows after him as does His shadow keep him company in the case of Dependent Arising it is consciousnessin the case of the elements the idea element in the case of the Bases the idea baseand in the case of the faculties the pleasure faculty and joy faculty that are profitable are the ways of entryis the meaning that concludes it  the Thread is instigated by that meaning Ideas are heralded by mind is a description in terms of synonyms not a description in terms of a unity Ideas  is a unity  not a description in terms of synonymsIf someone with a placid mind this unity namely placidity is as a diversity twofold namely nonsuppression  of nonillwill in oneself and as trust externallyThis placidity in oneself is twofoldon generosity on morality and on heaven showing the danger degradation and corruption of sensedesires and the profit of renunciationhe who is placid minded through the cause and he who has what is to be felt as pleasure  through the ripeningAnd just as a clean cloth receives the dye perfectly so in those eightyfour thousand as they sat there there arose the pure and spotless Dhammaeye and they knew Whatever things have an origin must come to cessationThen the first eightyfour thousand who had gone forth heard The Lord Buddha Vipassi has come to Bandhumati and is staying in the Khema deerpark teaching Dhamma And all happened as beforethat he extended his hands palms together is bodily actionthat he was placid in mind is mental actionAnd it was not long before their minds were freed from the corruptions without remainderand with all his utterance namely For them whose dwelling enters the Blessed One therein is manifest in him the profitable root nongreedin that he has suchlike restraint this is his abandoning of the perversion of perception in that he has placidity of mind this is his abandoning of the perversion of cognizance  thus there is the unprofitable perversions abandoning by suppression  The condition for all thisis the three profitable roots The intention in the undisturbed cognizance is what is called his reasoned attentionand in that he gives attention to the Blessed Ones qualities this is the Recollection of the True Idea in himfeeling and perception  are the cause and thinking and exploring are the conditionThis coordination is thusThen bliss sure follows after him what is the Blessed One describingand the Blessed Ones reply undisturbedness of intention is faith Faith is confidence of the heartDemonstration of the Threads Meaning  What does he show by faith virtue generosity and understanding Because of the characteristic of being undisturbed for faith has the characteristic of being undisturbedthis is faithand that belongs to the worldsand thereby it is well seen  just as a man with good eyesight  sees water in a deep well without his being able to reach it with the bodyso too he has a view of the noble ideas  by means of liking for pondering upon them  without his having yet verified them for himselfabandoned by means of the path of seeing which is why this faithis called fulfilled only on the plane of the heading of StreamEntry factors On that same plane the nonseeking  of categories by desiring rebirth is generosityand it is by that nonseeking that faith can be demonstrated through the Expression of Generosityherein one is that in the three kinds of Confidence due to Undergoing the generosity is that in the four MeditationsThis is the demonstration of the Threads Meaningthe virtue is bodily and verbal good conductwhile the generosity is a cognizanceconcomitant namely good conduct as nongreedThat his cognizance has for long been imbued with faith virtue generosity and understanding is through concentration the footing for the first Meditationand also the ideas born therefrom have parallel occurrence therewithIt is that those who want an auspicious destination  and an auspicious prospect will give attention to faith virtue generosity and understanding  this is the purportAnd at that time in the royal capital of Bandhumati there was a vast gathering of six million eight hundred thousand monksAnd when the Lord Buddha Vipassi had withdrawn into seclusion he thought There is now this great gathering of monks here in the capital Suppose I were to give them permission Wander abroad monks for the good of the many for the happiness of the many out of compassion for the world for the welfare and happiness of devas and humans Do not go two together monks but teach the Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending both in the letter and in the spirit and display the holy life fully complete and perfectThere are beings with little dust on their eyes who are perishing through not hearing Dhamma they will become knowers of DhammaBut at the end of six years precisely you are to come together to the royal capital of Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary codeThen a certain Great Brahma having divined the Lord Buddha Vipassis thought as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his flexed arm or flex it againArranging his robe over one shoulder and saluting the Lord with joined palms he said Just so  Lord just so  Well FarerLet the Lord give permission to this great gathering to wander abroad for the good of the many  out of compassion for the worldThere are beings with little dust on their eyes who are perishing through not hearing Dhamma they will become knowers of DhammaAnd we too will do the same as the monks at the end of six years we will come together to the royal capital of Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary codeHaving spoken thus that Brahma made obeisance to the Lord Buddha and passing by to his right vanished there and then So the Lord Buddha Vipassi emerging from the seclusion of his restperiod told the monks what had occurred occurredI allow you monks to wander abroad for the good of the many for the welfare and happiness of devas and humans Do not go two together monks but teach the Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending both in the letter and in the spirit and display the holy life fully complete and perfectThere are beings with little dust on their eyes who are perishing through not hearing Dhamma they will become knowers of DhammaBut at the end of six years precisely you are to come together to the royal capital of Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary codeAnd the majority of those monks left that very day to wander about the countryAnd at that time there were eightyfour thousand religious residences in JambudlpaAnd at the end of one year the devas would proclaim Gentlemen one year has passed five remainAt the end of five years you are to return to Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary code and similarly at the end of two three four five years And those monks some by their own psychic powers and some by that of the devas all in one day came to Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary codeAnd then the Lord Buddha Vipassi gave to the assembled monks the following preceptsPatient forbearance is the highest sacrificeSupreme is Nibbana so say the BuddhasHes not one gone forth who hurts othersNo ascetic he who harms anotherNot to do any evil but cultivate the goodTo purify ones mind this the Buddhas teachNot insulting not harming restraint according to ruleModeration in food seclusion of dwellingDevotion to high thinking this the Buddhas teachvanished from the Brahma world and appeared before the Lord Buddha VipassiAnd when six years had passed the devas announced Gentlemen six years have passed it is now time to go to the royal capital of Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary codeOnce monks I was staying at Ukkattha in the Subhaga grove at the foot of  great saltreeAnd as I dwelt there in seclusion it occurred to me There is no abode of beings easily accessible that has not been visited by me for so long as that of the devas of the Pure AbodesSuppose I were to visit them nowAnd then as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his flexed arm or flex it again I vanished from Ukkattha and appeared among the Aviha devasAnd many thousands of them came to me saluted me and stood to one sideThen they said Sir it is ninetyone aeons since the Lord Buddha Vipassi appeared in the worldThe Lord Buddha Vipassi was bom of Khattiya race and arose in a Khattiya familyThe Lord Buddha Vipassis renunciation was like this his goingforth like this his striving like this his full enlightenment like this his turning of the wheel like thisAnd we sir who lived the holy life under the Lord Buddha Vipassi having freed ourselves from sensedesires have arisen here  In the same way many thousands of devas came They said Sir in this fortunate aeon now the Lord Buddha has arisen in the worldHe was bom of Khattiya raceHe gained his full enlightenment under an assatthatreeSuch was the Lords renunciation such his going forth such his striving such his full enlightenment such his turning of the wheelAnd we sir who have lived the holy life under the Lord having freed ourselves from sensedesires have arisen here Then I went with the Aviha devas to see the Atappa devas and with these to see the Sudassa devas and with these to see the SudassI devas and with all of these to see the Akanittha devashe was of the Kondanna clanin his time the lifespan was eighty thousand yearshe gained his full enlightenment under a trumpetflower treehe had the pair of noble disciples Khanda and Tissahe had three assemblies of disciplesone of six million eight hundred thousandone of a hundred thousandand one of eighty thousand monksall of whom were Arahantshis chief personal attendant was the monk Asokahis father was King Bandhumahis mother was Queen Bandhumatiand his fathers royal capital was Bandhumatihe is of the Gotama clanin his time the lifespan is short limited and quick to pass it is seldom that anybody lives to be a hundredhe has a pair of noble disciples Sariputta and Moggallanahe has one assembly of disciples one thousand two hundred and fifty monkswho are all Arahantshis chief personal attendant is Anandahis father is King Suddhodana his mother was Queen Mayaand his royal capital is KapilavatthuAnd so it is monks that by his penetration of the fundamentals of Dhamma the Tathagata remembers the past Buddhas who have attained final Nibbana cutting through multiplicity blazing a trail have exhausted the round have passed by all suffering he recalls their births their names their dan their lifespan their twindisciples their assemblies of disciples These Blessed Lords were born thusAnd there many thousands of devas came saluted me and stood to one sidesaying Sir it is ninetyone aeons since the Lord Buddha Vipassi appeared in the world as verses were called thus thus was their clan thus was their morality their Dhamma their wisdom their dwelling thus was their liberationThus the Lord spokeand the monks delighted rejoiced at his wordsand the six of us lived on what those two bhikkhus brought back from their almsroundif he had much illness he could not achieve what can be achieved by one who is free from illnessif he was fraudulent and deceitful he could not achieve what can be achieved by one who is honest and sincereif he was lazy he could not achieve what can be achieved by one who is energeticif he was not wise he could not achieve what can be achieved by one who is wiseif he was free from illness he could achieve what can be achieved by one who is free from illnessif he was honest and sincere he could achieve what can be achieved by one who is honest and sincereif he was energetic he could achieve what can be achieved by one who is energeticif he was wise he could achieve what can be achieved by one who is wiseHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a ConversionAmong these four ideas faith and understanding slay faithlessness and ignorancewhile virtue and generosity and craving  slay hateThus two roots are still to be  abandoned in himAnd the suffering on the plane of the unabandoned which he is stopping now is the tworooted fivecategoriesThus two Truths namely Origin and Suffering The quiet and insightThis is the Mode of Conveying a ConversionHerein what is the AnalysisAs to this  cognizance imbued with faith etc if it can not be said unilaterally also of an ordinary man that his destination  on rebirth will be auspicious that is because his action either turns out  to be that with only ripening here and now in this existence or else it is that some past unprofitable action of his was ready manifested for ripening and that these now become the conditions for that ripening like those instances in the Mahakammavibhanga Sutta  Hence this demonstration that one who walks in the True Idea has an auspicious destination  is one to be declared only after analysisHerein what is the ReversalFaithlessness unvirtuousness avarice and stupidity are abandoned by their opposites This is the ReversalHerein what are the SynonymsThe cognizance that has long been so imbued is cognizance mind consciousness  etc The faith is the faith faculty faith power As to virtue good conduct refraining constraint taming untornness are synonyms for itGenerosity is relinquishment nongreed loosinghold Expression of GenerosityUnderstanding is understandingness understandingluminosity understanding faculty understanding powerHerein what are the DescriptionsThe faith is described by a description in terms of confidenceThe virtue is described by a description in terms of good conductThe generosity is described by a description in terms of making meritThe understanding is described by a description in terms of inquiryThese three ideas namely faith virtue and generosity come to purification in one possessed of understandingHerein what are the Ways of EntryThe four ideas are included in the determinations category in the case of the categories  etc in the case of the elements  in the case of the basesHerein what is the Mode of Conveying Terms of ExpressionThis cognizance described by a diversity is not imbued with unprofitable cognizances  Imbued   any cognizances again so imbued and also what is so described by assumption of the others  also all these four ideas are described by a unityHerein what are the RequisitesFor cognizance the faculties of the eye etc are a condition by dominanceconditionality and attentionFor faith worldly understanding is a condition by causeconditionalityFor virtue living in befitting places is a conditionand right disposition in selfguidance is the causeFor generosity nongreed is the causeFor understanding  anothers utterance and reasoned attention in oneself are the cause and the conditionHerein what is the CoordinationThe cognizance has for long been imbued and also the concomitants of cognizanceHere all ideas being thus imbued the destination  will be auspicious and auspicious the reappearance in a future existenceSo those human uses of possessions are all an auspicious destination too This is the CoordinationFor example the verse The Threads Meaning Herein what is  AboveBeyond this is what will be future   this is  above Herein conjecturors about a retrospective finiteness by means of the past have the eternalistview while some conjecturors about prospective finiteness have the annihilationistview These said conjecturors have these two views namely the annihilationistview and the eternalistviewand they favour perception in the way stated  as follows    and likewise three each with feeling perception determinations and consciousnessAs to the annihilationistview the remaining five terms  belong to annihilationismThat is how in the case of the five categories fifteen tenns of the twentybased embodimentview belong to retrospective finitenessHerein one who sees  thus namely  I am this  when he sees form as self he has the annihilationisttheory but when he sees thus namely  he has the eternalisttheory The annihilationistview treats in terms of selfidentification with the particular category and the eternalistview treats in terms of retrospective finitenessWhen he does not see  I am this his taints of wrong view come to abandonment When by this door by this instrumentality by this means namely  Above below in every way without lust And seeing not at all that I am this   it is thus demonstrated in the several instances  in retrospective finiteness and prospective finiteness in the three temporal periods then this is the Plane of Seeing and the Fruit of Stream Entry and so this noble means occurs for nonrenewal of being  through the Roundabouts becoming nonextant thus there being any noble means at all in the guise of one of the four paths for nonrenewal of being  it is the five faculties beginning with faith whether blunt medium or outstanding that occur  for all  nonrenewal of beingI is the flood of views the flood of sensual desire the flood of being the flood of ignorance according to limitationHerein as to the four Truths by the Mode of Conveying a Teaching with the five faculties beginning with faith and with the fruit of Stream Entry there are respectively two Truths namely the Path and CessationAnd with embodiment  and its origin there are two Truths namely Suffering and its Origin This is the Mode of Conveying a TeachingHerein what is the InvestigationWhen he does not see I am this he abandons the three fetters to be abandoned by SeeingPersons are of three types namely one type gains knowledge by a condensed statement one gains knowledge by an expanded statement and one is guidable The type that gains knowledge by a condensed statement has keen faculties the type that gains knowledge by an expanded statement has blunter faculties than that and the guidable type has still blunter faculties  than thatHerein the type that gains knowledge by a condensed statement after his coming to the plane of seeing with keenness in his faculties reaches the fruit of StreamEntry and becomes a SingleSeed The type that gains knowledge by an expanded statement after his coming to the plane of seeing with blunter faculties reaches the fruit of StreamEntry and becomes a ClantoClanHerein the guidable type after his coming to the plane of seeing reaches the fruit of StreamEntry and becomes a Seven timesatMostthis is the third kind of StreamEntererThere is this construing Whether he verifies the blunt or medium or outstanding plane  with blunt or medium or outstanding faculties he abandons all the types of views wth the abandoning of the embodimentviewHerein the embodiment view is the footing for all wrong viewEmbodiment is the footing for nameandformNameandform is the footing for the embodimentviewThe five faculties having form beginning with the eye are the footing for lust for formThe sixfold base is the footing for ImakingHerein what are the CharacteristicsWhen two kinds  of view are abandoned herein the sixtyone  types of view come to abandonmentWhen he sees in the plane born of that view its specific conditionality  by seeing how the view comes to be This is the Mode of Conveying CharacteristicsHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold ArrayIt is that any creatures who will not  delight in lustprovoking things will make efforts  for the abandoning of viewsThis is the Blessed Ones purport hereThis is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold ArrayHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a ConversionThey eradicate covetousness and ill will  altogether with the means of keepinginbeing fby the NonReturn Path faith being a power then in virtue of the Initiates deliverance When they come to belong to the further side faith is then a power in virtue of the Arahants Right View because exerted by the energy faculty  and based on memory by the mindfulness faculty  and it reaches  the goalHerein the faculties are the Path and the abandoning of defilementis Cessation What is no more inseparable from the idea of future arising is SufferingThis is the Mode of Conveying a ConversionHerein what is the Mode of Conveying an AnalysisHerein one acquires outstandingness in the plane born of that embodimentview in five moods by virtue duty much learning concentration and pleasure in renunciationHerein one who perceives something as reached when it is not reached overestimatesAnd it was on account of this very need arisen  that the Blessed One delivered this ThreadHerein when he is one who perceives something as reached when it is not reached his concentration is materialistic it is that cultivated by trivial men and it is ordinary men that are called  trivial menAnd this  materialistic concentration belongs to the worlds  and is ignoble  through its not having come to the Noble Path that is why such concentration is ignoble and of the kind cultivated by trivial menBut he who understands and sees  in the noble mood how this is abandons overestimation  He  is guided  by the noble concentration cultivated by untrivial men and unmaterialistic Herein it is noble persons that are called  untrivial men and the concentration cultivated by them is what is called concentration cultivated by untrivial menTherefore this  is declarable after analysis namely the passage   Seeing not at all  that  I am this  Herein what is the ReversalIt is owing to this plane of seeing that defilements are abandorable  for they  are abandonable here Both any  not demonstrated in this Thread by the Blessed One and any  demonstrated by the Blessed One here can be demonstrated  hereHerein what are the SynonymsAny embodiment view of selfviewDefilements abandonableare abandoned  also when undemonstrated by the Blessed One  They are for instance the eternalistview and the annihilationviewThe annihilationistview is the nonexistenceofgivingetcviewThese are synonymsCraving is described by a description in terms of fettersHerein what are the Ways of EntryEmbodiment is Suffering what is abandonable by seeingHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing UpThe instigation instigated whereby the Blessed One uttered this Thread has been completedNameandform has cause and condition consciousness is the cause as seedWhat has to be stopped is the renewal of being  in a further existence  and the  individualessence as cause  and the otheressence as condition  For any  such right view anothers utterance and reasoned attention are the condition and any understanding that is aroused is the cause since from the right view right intention has its being and so right view is the requisiteHerein what is the CoordinationHe who  sees not at all that I am this sees it as painful as an ailment  etc with the eleven  terms The virtues Blessed One what is their aim what is their reward The virtues Ananda have nonremorse for their aim  down to  deliverance   Herein aim  is twofold mans aim  and words aim Herein what is the mans aim That there is no subsequent regret this is the  nonremorse  this is the mans aim As for instance when someone fosters this aim cultivates it he might say   Whatever it is I am dependent on that is the aim for which I instigate this task Herein what is the words aim  The kinds of virtue whether bodily or verbal good conduct have nonremorse for their aim Herein it is only the radiance of virtue and duty as good conduct due to the state of action well done nothing else that is the nonremorse hereAnd so down to deliverance  there are the two aims  the mans aim and the words aim in the case of each term in the text And as in this Thread so in all Threads there are the two aims And the ultimate aim  the supreme aim is this namely what can be verified for oneself  on ones own depending on what is verifiable  as extinction this is called ones own aim effectedThis again is a synonym That one understands by this synonym the concluded aim referred to  this is the words aim Herein of whatever aim the hearer wantsthe actual obtaining is the mans aim is the words  aim  Herein nonremorse is the aim and the reward of the kinds of virtueAnd the reward is this namely that one does not go to a bad destinationaccording as it is said by the Blessed One   This is the aim that a man associated with power  on the plane of mastery  has been instigated by virtue And so down to deliverance  Likewise the Three Categories  herein both the non remorse demonstrated by means of underlying tendency and that virtue are the Virtue CategoryAnd in virtue of the concentration faculty the gladness happiness and tranquillity are the Concentration CategoryAnd that one concentrated  understands how this is this is the Understanding CategoryThese are the three Categories Virtue Concentration and Understanding  Likewise  in the case of the Faculties when he fulfils virtue the energy faculty is the reason whereby he fulfils virtue and makes efforts for the nonarising of the unarisen unprofitable for the abandoning of the arisen unprofitable for the arising of the unarisen profitable and for the increase of the arisen profitable thus the Energy Faculty is demonstratedAnd herein the concentration category is the Concentration Facultyand the understanding category is the Understanding Faculty That can also be seen in the case of the four Right Endeavourslikewise for when someone makes eftorts for the nonarising of unarisen unprofit this is the first Right EndeavourThese are the four Right Endeavours  Also it can be seen in the case of the four Meditationslikewise  First Meditation With the virtue category there comes the renunciation element as the beginning ie renunciation of sensual desire and the three kinds of thinking namely renunciation thinking nonillwillthinking and noncrueltythinkingand the nondistraction there is concentrationThis is the fivefactored first meditation Second Meditation What is the mental tranquillity Any obstruction  with the thinking and exploring which is defilement and fever has ceased in the first meditationand any such  tranquillization of defilement in the first meditation and any  tranquillization of thinking and exploring in the second meditation this is tranquillization of both these ideasHerein any  pleasure and pleasing of the body and of cognizance this is the tranquillity of one who has happiness and pleasureSo the confidence in oneself and the singleness of cognizance and the happiness and the pleasure are the four factored second meditation Third Meditation  As to  tranquil feels pleasure  after dispensing  with that outstanding bodily pleasure only mental pleasure remains this being fading  of happiness with the fading of happiness he obtains onlookingequanimity and also unification of cognizance This is the fivefactored third meditation Fourth Meditation As to pleased his cognizance is concentrated   this is unification Now  this  unification of the kind dealing with meditation is there also in the first meditation but owing to its being accompanied  there  by pleasant  feeling it does not  come altogether to fulfilmentthere as in the fourth meditation Accordingly onlookingequanimity purified mindfulness neitherpainfulnor pleasant feeling and unification these are the fourth meditation And just as the Concentration Faculty can be shown thus in the four Meditations so too the Understanding Faculty can be shown in the four TruthsFor as to concentrated understands how it is   this act ofunderstanding is fourfold namely understanding as ugly as impermanent as painful and as notself and then its object is the Noble Truth of Suffering Then as to finds dispassion and his lust fades this is the Path When  liberated  the abandoning accordingly of the taint of sensual desire the taint of being the taint of view and the taint of ignorance on reaching Arahantship is the Noble Truth of Cessation The Origin of taints is on the plane of unabandoned defilementThis is how the Understanding Faculty can be seen as the four Noble TruthsLikewise with the  Paths and Fruits  as to He who is concentrated understands how it is  this is the plane of seeingAnd then when he understands how the fruit of StreamEntry is he finds dispassion and this is then the attenuation of lust for sensual desires and of ill will frrnished by the Path of OnceReturn And when he finds dispassion and his lust fades for the Fruit of OnceReturn this is the first plane of keeping meditation in being as the heartdeliverance due to fading of lust and it is the Fruit of NonReturnWhat is called  deliverance  is the understandingdeliverance and it is ArahantshipNow these are the kinds of nonremorse and the Energy Faculty and the four right endeavours are also the kinds of nonremorse  And what follows down to  the concentration which is the four meditations in this way is the Concentration Faculty As to  he who is concentrated understands how it is this is the four foundations of mindfulness  Consequent upon the fulfilment of virtue due to its being connected with generosity they provide an undisturbed state of mind  for signs penetrative of the Truths This is the Mindfulness Faculty namely the four foundations of mindfulnessAgain the faculty that owing to this teaching of the True Idea is in the three instances without inclusion  of wrong views and has the virtue that is only the Initiates owing to the abandonment of only a portion  of what is given up by the Arahant is the Faith FacultyAnd these are the four factors of StreamEntry The fruitsas the concentration faculties  that are accompanied by what is deferred till higher  in the subsequent attainments  can be demonstrated in all Threads  Knowledge in one who remembers that the obtaining of meditation is got only through energy is understanding consisting in what is heard The concentration possessing illumination of the successive signs in their due order  owing to nonlapse in procedure is understanding consisting in cogitation And since one who is thus  concentrated understands how it is this is understanding consisting in keepinginbeingThis is a demonstration of the ThreadThis Thread is one dealing with penetration It requites a discoverer it can be discoveredit is by means of the factors with which it is endowed that it will be discovered  its factors will discover  hence Enlightenment Factors Accordingly in so far as at the beginning of this Thread it is said   how does he fulfil the kinds of virtueEnergy for the nonarising of the unarisen unprofitable for the abandoning of the arisen unprofitable for the arousing of the unarisen profitable and for the increase of the arisen profitable is a factor  for that virtues being brought to enlightenment It is owing to this energy that there are the two ideas stated at the beginning of this Thread namely nonremorse and gladness and again any  happiness with the nonremorse as condition and with the gladness as condition is the Happiness Enlightenment Factorand the abandoning of the roots these are two Truths namely Cessation and the PathThe cognizance is described by a description in terms of seedThe imbuing is described  by a description in terms of moralityThe cognizance is the consciousness category in the case of the categories the mind consciousness element in the case of the elements the mind base in the case of the basesHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing UpThis which was the Blessed Ones utterance when questioned by Mahanama the Sakyan all in the question has been concluded with the answerAuspicious destination   even for an enjoyer of sensual desires the form element the formless element and the human state are all  described by a unity  as  an auspicious destination  This is the Descriptionis a condition by causeconditionalityand reasoned attention is a conditionand nonremorse is the causecondition  Below is what is bygone past The above and the below are called the extent Herein as to this eternalistview the following fifteen of the twenty terms of the embodimentview belong to eternalismand they  see that  taking it that  and

Footingshe grasps all dependent arisingboth above and below  and he is  without lust  that is without lust for all things provocative of lustWhat is the Blessed Ones Purport in this ThreadThe five faculties beginning with faith when blunt are five hitherside  facultiesAnd seeing not at all that  I am this     this is not unilaterally always so for when someone  does this merely by outstanding intellectual effort in the plane of the worlds he certainly has not abandoned the embodimentview by the noble instrumentality his effort being merely that which is called outstandingness  in the plane

conditionThis is the mans aim while the intimation of the aim of whatever idea the Blessed One teachesand that for the abandoning of the arisen is the second and so onaccompanied by exploringThen the happiness  that is born  in one happyminded  through gladness is happiness   and the bodily pleasure induced through the tranquillization of the body  is pleasureand also any singleness  of cognizance

this is the Energy Enlightenment Factorhe might dwell seven monthssix monthsfive monthsfour monthsthree monthstwo monthsone monthhalf a monthLet alone half a month princeAs to happy his body becomes tranquillized this is the Tranquillity Enlightenment FactorThe bodily pleasure induced thereby since pleased his cognizance is concentrated is the Concentration Enlightenment FactorAs to concentrated understands how it is  this is the InvestigationofIdeas Enlightenment FactorThat owing to the virtue the employment of a sign  that is in conformity with the arising  of the five enlightenment factors so far mentioned is accompanied by their nonfloating away when partaking of steadiness  and partaking of distinction and does not come to lapse  this is the Mindfulness Enlightenment FactorAs to the clause he  understands how it is  he works overenergetically this being censured as the plane of idleness he becomes by means of these factors enlightened about how the course of the eye understanding coupled with quiet is onlookingequanimity  This is the ThreadDemonstrationHerein what is the TeachingIn this Thread the four noble Truths are taughtHerein what is the InvestigationIn the case of each clause from No virtuous man has to choose how shall I have no remorse   down to deliverance  he framed  the reply to the question what is the aim of    thus each asking having two terms and each answer two terms the two terms by means of which there are the two instances of getting acquainted  are the very two terms by which the answer is given What is he asking about About a penetrative bodily plane for action  for it is accordingly that the standingpoint arouses the ideas that belong to the AdeptHerein what is the ConstruingOne who is virtuous has no remorse  How He is without wilfulness  and has fading of lust There is this construingHerein what are the FootingsEnergy is the footing for the energy facultyEnergy is the footing for nonhateThe energy faculty is the footing for three pathfactors for right effort right action and right livelihood Herein what are the CharacteristicsWhen the virtue category is stated all the categories are stated  Whose cognizance is kept in being like this How shall suffering come to him     because virtue is itself like a rock  Just as a rock cannot be made to shudder  by any kind of opposition at all so too such cognizance does not shudder with any defilement at all  this is nondelusionWhen one idea siding with enlightenment is stated all the ideas that arrive at enlightenment are statedHerein what is the mode of Conveying a Fourfold ArrayWhat is the Blessed Ones Purport in this ThreadIt is that those with will for nonremorse are fulfillers of virtue those with will for gladness are fulfillers of nonremorse  and so on This is the Blessed Ones purport here This is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold ArrayHerein what is the ConversionThis Thread is one dealing with penetrationPenetration is CessationThis is the Conversion The virtuous man has no remorse  is a statement declarable after analysis For  so although that is so nevertheless even when such good conduct misapprehended is well done still he has no gladness due to nonremorse  down to deliverance So the statement The virtuous man has no remorse is one declarable after analysis This is the Mode of Conveying an AnalysisHerein what is the ReversalBy means of these seven excellences in the stipulate  when abandoning abandon the eleven failures  in the stipulate This is the ReversalHerein what are the SynonymsThese are synonyms for the following noble ideas namely the Powers Enlightenment Factors Liberations Concentrations and ExcellencesHerein what are the DescriptionsThe virtuous man has no remorse  is described under the Virtue Category by a description in terms of renunciation and by a description in terms of relinquishment Thus there are ten factors each described by two factorsHerein what are the Ways of EntryThis as a Thread dealing with penetration provides a way of entry in the five faculties   just as  was demonstrated above   with faculties etc so too they can be demonstrated in categories elements and bases Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing UpWhen  The virtuous man has no remorse  is said the instigation  is not yet cleared up and when he who has no remorse is glad is said the instigation is not yet cleared up but when the eleven terms have been taught then the instigation is cleared up This is the Clearing UpHerein what are the Terms of ExpressionIt is described in terms of diversity of virtue Thus the ten remaining terms  are all the reward of the virtue category  Requisites  And for these   is the condition and the cause For the concentration category the pleasure is the cause and the  tranquillity  the condition on which account there being also conascence with meditation in that jnstance  they are meditation factors  Another way  For concentration contemplation of disappointment in sensual desires is the condition and the state of seeing reward in renunciation is the causeHerein what is the CoordinationThe energy faculty is the virtue categoryThe virtue consists in the four ideas that are basic for the meditations any practice of ideas in accordance with the True Idea being restraint by PatimokkhaRuleThe verse    The Threads Meaning As to the simile  as a rock  just as a rock neither shudders with the wind nor wavers with heat or with coldas do many choiceless inanimate things while they wither with heat shrivel with cold and fltter with the wind not so a rock Is free from lust for lustprovoking things Untroubled too by trouble    cognizance thus free from lust for lust provoking things through fadingoflust  is untroubled by troubleWhat is the reasonReversal as to  How shall suffering come to him   there is no mental pleasure in the case of the extinction element without trace leftbut there is in the case of that with trace leftThe pleasure that one who has entered upon the attainment of cessation of perception and feeling has does not belong to the actual occasion This distinction is the Reversal hereHerein what are the Synonyms Whose cognizance is thus kept in being   kept in being well kept in being established made the basis well instigated  Cognizance   mind consciousness mind faculty mindconsciousness elementHerein what are the DescriptionsSuffering is described by a description in terms of what is annihilatedHerein what are the Ways of EntryWhen cognizance is demonstrated the five categories are demonstrated this is the way of entry in the case of the categories When the mind consciousness element is demonstrated the eighteen elements are demonstrated this is the way of entry in the case of the elementsWhen the mind base is demonstrated all the bases are demonstratedHerein the mind base as consciousness is the footing for name andformHerein what is the Clearing up The instigation is already cleared upHerein what are the Terms of ExpressionThe keeping of the sixth  faculty in being is described  by a unity through being based on the sixth  the body is described by a unityHerein what is the RequisiteThe prior cause for the arising of cognizance is attention and a leaning thereto since it is owing to not keeping ideas partaking of distinction in being that cognizance goes on continuously in the unconcentrated plane The cause of concentration is pleasure and its condition is nonremorse  This  is the RequisiteHerein what is the CoordinationWhose cognizance is thus kept in being  the ideas to be coordinated with that are as follows the body the virtue the understanding and the cognizance kept in being They being each uninflected undefiected unsuperfiuous undeficient their attainability unclungto this is the right concentration that belongs to the Adept Monks State not to that of the Initiate So all the Adepts ten Arahantideas have been demonstratedThe type of Thread dealing with the Adept  In this Thread  there are two terms  this venerable one disclaims and two terms he claims  they are abandonment of craving in keeping cognizance in being and abandonment of views in keeping the body in being The first simile he gives is thus  Earth is neither distressed nor disgusted with the impure and the pure nor does it gain happiness and gladness therefrom  so too I  abide with an abundant  measureless  heart without risk and ill will Demonstration of the Thread What is it that the venerableone claims He claims abandoning of the bodilypleasure faculty through keeping the body in being ie contemplation of the body as a body and he claims abandoning of the mental joy faculty through keeying cognizance in being ie contemplation of cognizance as cognizanceBodily pleasant feeling is underlain  by the underlying tendency to lust and that kind of pleasure faculty he rejectsAnd while the contemplation of the body as a pleasant abiding here and nowwith the body the ground  for defilement and with cognizance cognizances dependence ie the body With cognizance well kept in being he claims to abide in the seven attainmentshe might dwell seven days and nightssix days and nightsfive days and nights four days and nightsthree days and nightstwo days and nightsone day and nightthis being taken as the plane of agitation he drives it overslackly  hence taking it that it is on this account that the onlookingequanimity is a factor of that enlightenment it is called the OnlookingEquanimity Enlightenment FactorThere was an occasion when the Blessed One was living at Kosambi in Ghositas Parkconcentration is the footing tor the concentration facultyunderstanding is the footing for the understanding facultyconcentration is the footing for nongreedand said to him Venerable sir the prince or princess in my womb whichever it may be goes to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusunderstanding is the footing for nondelusionthe concentration faculty is the footing for three pathfactors for right intention right speech and right concentration the understanding faculty is the footing for two pathfactors for right mindfulness and right viewshe stood at one side and said to him Venerable sir this Prince Bodhi goes to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusWhen virtue  is stated since virtue is the cause and condition for all the remaining ten ideas in this Thread all those ideas are stated tooHerein what is the Analysisthat whereby he finds dispassion is the Paththat which ceases is Suffering and that which is abandoned by the path leading to penetration is OriginThat it is  free from lust for lustprovoking things  is nongreed That it is untroubled too by any trouble is nonhateHerein the profitable root nondelusion is understanding the nongreed is simply nongreed and the nonhate is simply nonhateOne steadied in the Initiates plane by these three profitable roots arouses the Adepts pathHe arouses ideas that surmount the Initiates plane and these are the ten ideas belonging to Arahantship namely the Adepts right view  down to  his right concentration right deliverance and knowing and seeing of the taste  of deliverance Herein with the eightfactored path the fourfold keepingin being is also obtainednamely keeping virtue in being keeping the body in being keeping cognizance in being and keeping understanding in being Herein the body is kept in being by right action and right livelihoodvirtue is kept in being by right speech and right effortcognizance is kept in being by right intention and right concentrationand understanding is kept in being by right view and right mindfulnessWith this fourfold keepinginbeing two ideas come to fulfilment through keeping in being namely cognizance  and understandingThrough the keepinginbeing the cognizance becomes Quiet and through the keepinginbeing the understanding becomes InsightHerein cognizance is made unadulterated  by imperfections with the abandoning of ignorance that is owed to understandingThe keeping of cognizance in being is itself brought to complete fulfilment by the keeping of the Arahants understanding in beingWhen his cognizance is well  kept in being like this How shall suffering come to him  Furthermore that venerable one  believed in the element of nonillwill and also he had entered upon a higher attainment when the spirit  gave him the blow so no pain was felt in his physical frame when attacked  by the spirit This is the ThreadmeaningHerein what is the TeachingIn this Thread the ten ideas of Arahantship belonging to the Adept are taught and keeping of measureless  concentration in beingHerein what is the InvestigationThe state of being like a rock  whatever ideas are included in what can be felt as pleasure and pain  have all been left behind for those who contemplate only the unformed The requisite for what is felt as a body not being made to occur he does not feel painHerein what is the Construing  Whose cognizance is thus kept in being How shall suffering come to him There are three kinds of keepinginbeing in which cognizance does not suffer painnamely in keeping cognizance  in being which is the Meditations in keeping Cessation in being which is the Paths and in keeping straightresulting concentration in being which is the Paths FruitsSo Whose cognizance is thus kept in being this is the footing for the fruit of the concentrationHerein what are the Characteristics Whose cognizance is thus kept in being  is the four  kinds of what is kept in being demonstrated above  namely understanding virtue body and cognizance Virtue is well kept in being and because he is bodily and mentally  steady  he does not  shudder   and so also feeling and perception and determinationsHow shall suffering come to him  also no pleasure follows after him and no neitherpainnorpleasure comesHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold ArrayWhat is the Blessed Ones Purport hereIt is that those who are beyond suffering abide in such attainments as theseThis is the Blessed Ones purport hereAnd it is that those with no confidence will become confident and when they are confident  they will have happiness and gladness This is the Blessed Ones purport hereConversion there is no plane of conversion hereAnalysis  As to Whose cognizance is thus kept in being How shall suffering come to him the demonstration is twofold as demonstration of the cause of suffering and as demonstration of the oppositeWhat is the cause of sufferingNo grief  about what is hateprovoking  makes it hate  not hating it will not be troubled  hence it is untroubled by trouble It is that from which suffering comes And as to the demonstration of the opposite it is demonstrated thus   How will suffering come to one such as this Again at the same time however they have said  thus At that moment at that period in both cases it is not felt in that with trace left  nor in that without trace leftCognizance is described by a description in terms of pacification of mind determinationsConcentration is described  by a description in terms of the Adeptwith nameandform as condition the sixfold base so in the case of dependent arisingthis is the way of entrybut not the whole feeling category Any mental pleasant feeling that arises there does so with the obtaining of the concentration attainment as conditionHerein under the four Great Entities  he mentions the abandoning of approval  and resistance in regard to the form category he rejects the joy that is the mental pleasure but not all feeling born of mindcontactand the sensual desires as well as the form and that too in the Adepts planeit is through power and through activity  that there is abandoning of all kinds of attention  With the similes of the GreasePot  and the Man Fond of Ornaments there is shown his reviewing of this body given its being by a mother and a father   With the body and with contemplation of the body and with cognizance and with contemplation of cognizance he remembers two ideasTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the venerable Maha Kaccana was living at Madhura in the Gunda GroveNow a good report of Master Kaccana has been spread to this effect He is wise discerning sagacious learned articulate and perspicacious he is aged and he is an arahantIt is good to see such arahantsThen King Avantiputta of Madhura had a number of state carriages made ready and mounting a state carriage he drove out from Madhura with the full pomp of royalty in order to see the venerable Maha KaccanaHe went thus as far as the road was passable for carriages and then he got down from his carriage and went forward on foot to the venerable Maha KaccanaHe exchanged greetings with him and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideWhat does Master Kaccana say about thatIt is just a saying in the world great king that Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of BrahmaAnd there is a way whereby it can be understood how that statement of the brahmins is just a saying in the worldWhat do you think great king If a noble prospers in wealth grain silver or gold will there be nobles who rise before him and retire after him who are eager to serve him who seek to please him and speak sweetly to him and will there also be brahmins merchants and workers who do likewiseThere will be Master KaccanaWhat do you think great king If a brahmin prospers in wealth grain silver or gold will there be brahmins who rise before him and retire after him who are eager to serve him who seek to please him and speak sweetly to him and will there also be merchants workers and nobles who do likewiseThere will be Master KaccanaWhat do you think great king If a merchant prospers in wealth grain silver or gold will there be merchants who rise before him and retire after him who are eager to serve him who seek to please him and speak sweetly to him and will there also be workers nobles and brahmins who do likewiseThere will be Master KaccanaWhat do you think great king If a worker prospers in wealth grain silver or gold will there be workers who rise before him and retire after him who are eager to serve him who seek to please him and speak sweetly to him and will there also be nobles brahmins and merchants who do likewiseThere will be Master KaccanaWhat do you think great king If that is so then are these four castes all the same or are they notSurely if that is so Master Kaccana then these four castes are all the sameThat is a way great king whereby it can be understood how that statement of the brahmins is just a saying in the worldWhat do you think great king Suppose a noble were to kill living beings take what is not given misconduct himself in sensual pleasures speak falsely speak maliciously speak harshly gossip be covetous have a mind of ill will and hold wrong view On the dissolution of the body after death would he be likely to reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell or notIf a noble were such Master Kaccana he would be likely to reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hellThat is how it appears to me in this case and thus I have heard from the arahantsWhat do you think great king Suppose a brahmina merchant a worker were to kill living beingsand hold wrong view On the dissolution of the body after death would he be likely to reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell or notIf a brahmina merchanta worker were such Master Kaccana he would be likely to reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hellThat is how it appears to me in this case and thus I have heard from the arahantsWhat do you think great king If that is so then are these four castes all the same or are they notSurely if that is so Master Kaccana then these four castes are all the sameThat is also a way great king whereby it can be understood how that statement of the brahmins is just a saying in the worldWhat do you think great king Suppose a noble were to abstain from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech from malicious speech from harsh speech and from gossip and were to be uncovetous to have a mind without ill will and to hold right view On the dissolution of the body after death would he be likely to reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world or notIf a noble were such Master Kaccana he would be likely to reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldThat is how it appears to me in this case and thus I have heard from the arahantsWhat do you think great king Suppose a brahmina merchant a worker were to abstain from killing living beings and to hold right view On the dissolution of the body after death would he be likely to reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world or notIf a brahmina merchanta worker were such Master Kaccana he would be likely to reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly worldThat is how it appears to me in this case and thus I have heard from the arahantsWhat do you think great king If that is so then are these four castes all the same or are they notSurely if that is so Master Kaccana then these four castes are all the sameThat is also a way great king whereby it can be understood how that statement of the brahmins is just a saying in the worldWhat do you think great king Suppose a noble were to break into houses plunder wealth commit burglary ambush highways or seduce anothers wife and if your men arrested him and produced him saying Sire this is the culpritWe would have him executed Master Kaccana or we would have him fined or we would have him exiled or we would do with him as he deservedWhy is thatBecause he has lost his former status of a noble and is simply reckoned as a robberWhat do you think great king Suppose a brahmina merchanta worker were to break into housesor seduce anothers wife and if your men arrested him and produced him saying Sire this is the culpritWe would have him executed Master Kaccana or we would have him fined or we would have him exiled of we would do with him as he deservedWhy is thatBecause he has lost his former status of a brahmina merchanta worker and is simply reckoned as a robberWhat do you think great king If that is so then are these four Castes all the same or are they notSurely if that is so Master Kaccana then these four castes are all the sameThat is also a way great king whereby it can be understood how that statement of the brahmins is just a saying in the worldWhat do you think great king Suppose a noble having shaved off his hair and beard put on the yellow robe and gone forth from the home life into homelessness were to abstain from killing living beings from taking what is not given and from false speech Refraining from eating at night he would eat only in one part of the day and would be celibate virtuous of good characterHow would you treat himWe would pay homage to him Master Kaccana or we would rise up for him or invite him to be seated or we would invite him to accept robes almsfood resting place and medicinal requisites or we would arrange for him lawful guarding defence and protectionWhy is thatBecause he has lost his former status of a noble and is simply reckoned as a recluseWhat do you think great king Suppose a brahmina merchant a worker having shaved off his hair

the sameThat is also a way great king whereby it can be understood how that statement of the brahmins is just a saying in the worldWhen this was said King Avantiputta of Madhura said to the venerable Maha Kaccana Magnificent Master Kaccana Magnificent Master KaccanaMaster Kaccana has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who is lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsFrom today let Master Kaccana remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeDo not go to me for refuge great kingGo for refuge to that same Blessed One to whom I have gone for refugeWhere is he living now that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened Master KaccanaThat Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened has attained to final Nibbana great kingIf we heard that that Blessed One was within ten leagues we would go ten leagues in order to see that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedIf we heard that that Blessed One was within twenty leaguesthirty leaguesforty leaguesfifty leaguesa hundred leagues we would go a hundred leagues in order to see that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedFrom today let Master Kaccana remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeKing Avantiputta of Madhura heard The recluse Kaccana is living at Madhura in the Gunda GroveAnd  in the simile of the Householder  just as were a householders son to have a clotheschest full of variously dyed clothes then whatever pair of clothes he wanted in the morning he would put on  in the morning and similarly at noon and in the evening so too because this venerable ones cognizance is well kept in being whatever kind of abiding he wants to abide in in the morning such he abides in in the morning and similarly at noon and in the eveningWith this  simile there is stated by that same venerable one the following fivefold  unsurpassed Keeping of Faculties in Being     With cognizance kept in being that venerable one claims this eightfold keeping in being namely the keeping of the body in being in the similes of the four Great Entities and the keeping of cognizance in being in the similes of the bull the savage the man and the greasepot  doing so in virtue of these kinds of keeping in being With the former kind of keeping in being he implies fulfilment of quietand with the latter four he implies the fulfilment of understandingThe body is by nature repulsive  Perception of the bloated corpsestage in the body etc in brief the nine corpsestage perceptions  these are repulsive ideas And this venerable one undisgusted with the repulsive abides devoted to the pursuit of keeping in being Mindfulness Occupied with the Body  for his cognizance has no repulsion through his having abandoned disgust How does he abide percipient of the repulsive in unrepulsive ideasTo all the world the body is unrepulsive This venerable one abides with perception of it as uglyThat is how he abides percipient of the repulsive in unrepulsive ideas How does he abide percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive ideas It is repulsive  to all the world  that  shaven and with bowl in hand there wanders for alms among the clans this venerable one with goldencoloured  unrepulsive  body Therein  he is percipient of the unrepulsive with cognizance accompanied by dispassion That is how he abides percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive ideas How does he abide percipient of the repulsive  in unrepulsiveandrepulsive ideasIn the case of ideas such as the female form that are unrepulsive  to one percipient of beauty therein and in the case of ideas such as the discoloured and festering corpsestages that are repulsive to one disgusted by them therein this veneable one abides percipient of the repulsive How does he avoid both the repulsive and unrepulsive and abide in onlookingequarumity mindful and aware   In the case of ideas such as the female form that are unrepulsive to one percipient of beauty thereinThat is how he avoids both and abides in onlooking equanimity mindful and awareAnother way All foolish ordinary men have perception of the unrepulsive in lifeinaworld in the triple element  of existenceHerein the venerable Sariputta abides percipient of the repulsiveThat is how he abides percipient of the repulsive in unrepulsive ideas How does he abide percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsive ideasWith regard to that world one who has reached the plane of Him Who Has Done  and has verified the fruits of concentration abides percipient of the unrepulsiveWhat is the reasonBecause there is no longer any reason why he should arouse perception of the repulsive  for the purpose of abandoning any world since that has been completed by him How does he abide percipient of the repulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive  ideasThat is how he abides percipient of the repulsive in repulsiveand unrepulsive  ideas How does he abide percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive ideasWhatever there is from another of verbal modes  illspoken  and unwelcome  that speech is repulsive  to the ordinary hearer  but as to the speaker with regard to such  speech such a person has perception of the unrepulsiveWith regard to that kind of speech the venerable Sariputta having verified it by direct acquaintanceship abides percipient of the unrepulsive That is how he abides percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive ideas How does he avoid both the repulsive and the unrepulsive  and abide in onlookingequanimity mindful and awareHerein the venerable Sariputta considers thus Ideas consisting in misconduct have unwishedfor ripening Then again  he abides percipient of the repulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive ideasCraving is a repulsive idea What is the reasonIt is because creatures are clung by two ideas  they are clung to physical nutriment by craving for taste and they are clung to contact by perception of pleasureHerein the venerable Sariputta abides percipient of the repulsive in physical nutriment and he abides percipient of pain in contact That is how he abides percipient of the repulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive ideas How does he abide percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsive ideas Herein the venerable Sariputta has perception of unrepulsiveness  and perception of nonillwill having seen for himself  with understanding That is how he abides percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsive ideas How does he abide percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive ideasThere are those who  are percipient of the repulsive in extinction and are percipient of the unrepulsive in fame and renown How does he avoid both the repulsive and the unrepulsive  and abide in onlookingequanimity  This is the fivefold unsurpassed Keeping of the Faculties in Being This is the ThreadDemonstrationHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a teachingHerein what is the InvestigationWhen people abide contemplating the body their cognizance does not abide with approval  and resistance and when someone does not  delight in approval and resistance his cognizance will become even  so this is the power of keeping in being This is the Mode of Conveying an InvestigationHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a ConstruingOwing

purportHerein what is the ConversionThere is no plane of conversionHerein what is the AnalysisWhat is the reasonThose who have their virtue tom etc rent etc do not obtain cognizance as even as earthbut all mindfulness occupied with the body ends in  extinction and the fruit of the Path in the Initiates keepingin being This is the AnalysisHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a ReversalThose who will abide contemplating the body for them too may arise taints and fever of distress with the body as condition  This is the Mode of Conveying a ReversalHerein what are the Ways of EntryIn the case of creatures  the five categories are made ways of entry and the twentytwo  faculties likewiseThe mind faculty is the mind element and mind base  the concentration faculty is the idea element and the idea baseThis is the Mode of Conveying Ways of EntryHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing UpThe four that should be kept in being by the mind have all been kept in being That which can be reached  by the mind in abandoning has all been reached  and since the instigation was for the purpose of that  that purpose has been cleared upThis is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing UpHerein what are the Terms of Expressionfor the five faculties with form beginning with the eye are the formbodyThese are the Terms of ExpressionRequisite skill in attainment and skill in steadiness  are the causePleasure is the cause and nonaffliction the conditionThis is the RequisiteHerein what is the CoordinationAs earth remains indifferent whether what is pure is thrown on it or whether what is impure is thrown on it so the body remains indifferent to both agreeable contacts and disagreeable contacts  and so cognizance remains indifferent to resistancecontact  or to pleasant feelingThis Thread is analysed with its similes  by an analysis for a person who gains knowledge from what is condensedHerein there is no opportunity for a coordinationHerein what is the type of Thread dealing with corruption and dealing with moralityHow one does not grow  does not increase in profitable ideas this disappointment the Blessed One teaches with the words But then What is open it soddens not   so one should open out so as to be safe from that disappointment  It is in virtue of three ideas that there is no rainsoddening   in virtue of perception of ugliness one is not rainsoddened  by lustin virtue of lovingkindness one is not rainsoddened  by hateIn this way whatever idea is the opposite of that unprofit in such ideas one will reach fullfilmentAnother wayIt is the ideas where emergence from transgression is not possible by oneself  that are taught by the phraseRain soddens what is covered up though they have that means  whereby they can be emerged from Again in the second part of the verse it is taught how also to keep in being to purify the cognizance of one who tends leans and inclines to seclusion from defilement so that he enters upon maturity growth and abundance in profitable ideas Like a blue or a white or a red lotus in water when  the moon comes in the bright half then  through the day or through the night only its increase is to be expected not its diminution in suchwise is this kind of cognizance not rainsoddenedAnother here also An uncheating unfraudulent undeceitful straight man reveals himself as he isHerein it is when someone conceals unprofitable ideas that overrun his cognizancethat rain soddens what is covered up  But when one who is an unfraudulent uncheating undeceitful straight man reveals himself as he ishis cognizance is not rainsoddened  by unprofitable ideas This is the Threads meaningHerein what is the Teachingaccording as was said by the Blessed One Herein what is the InvestigationWhose cognizance is thus rainsoddened that would be an ordinary mans   but one who has the straightresulting concentration  would open it up  for the purpose of emergence therefrom again  This is the InvestigationHerein what is the ConstruingCognizance that is not being rainsoddened  thus emerges  from the defilementand being emerged it becomes established in profitable ideas There is this construingFootings Rain soddens what is covered up  the covered up is the footing for the kinds of nonrestraint  But what is open it soddens not  the uncoveredup is the footing for the kinds of restraint So open out what is covered up That rain may never sodden you  is the footing for confessionCharacteristics Rain soddens what is covered up   whatever ideas have a single characteristic with the coveredup cognizance are all rainsoddenedBut what is open it soddens not  whatever ideas have a single characteristic with the uncovered are all not rainsoddened This is the Mode of Conveying CharacteristicsHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold ArrayWhat is the Blessed Ones Purport in this ThreadThose who have confessed  unprofitable ideas in their cognizance will make amends according to the True Idea This is the Blessed Ones purport hereinThis is the Fourfold ArrayConversion What is covered up is of two kinds  it is that in the case of the negligent  ie ordinary men and of those incapable  of concealment  through their havingthe straight resulting concentration  ie Initiates Herein when there is lack of faith  conceit increases taints And through lack of faith one comes to negligence Through negligence one despises and comes to prideAnd this is said by the Blessed One  Now these are the four assumings and the four assumings are the five categories of assuming These are the truths of Suffering and OriginThat is why one should open what is covered up  of the  cause by which the taints increasewith the abandoning the taints are abandonedHerein lack of faith is abandoned through diligence and pride  through the abandoning of agitationand worry In him two ideas namely quiet and insight come  to fulfilment this is the PathThe exhaustion of those taints is CessationThese are the four Truths This is the ConversionHerein what is the Mode of Conveying an Analysis Rain soddens what is covered up is not unilaterally always soWhat is the reasonAlthough his  ie the Initiates cognizance may be affected by hindrances through these evil actsyet that can be demonstrated as not a condition for rainsoddening in his case This is the Mode of Conveying an AnalysisHerein the ReversalThis is the Mode of Conveying a ReversalHerein what are the SynonymsThe  covered up  is the shut in shut off sealed off closed off covered over buried away   But what is open it soddens not   he who has abandoned these ideas has removed them  not endured them made an end of them This is the Mode of Conveying SynonymsHerein what are the DescriptionsRain soddens what is covered up  is described in terms of what deals with corruption  But what is open it soddens not is any function connected with the True Idea described by a description in terns of the way  So open out what is covered up  is described by a description in terms of instruction  That rain may never sodden you   is described by a description in terms of source  This is the Mode of Conveying Descriptions Rain soddens what is covered up   There are three defilements namely lust hate and delusion In the case of the categories these are the deterninations category  etc  these are as demonstrated earlier in the cases of the categories elements and bases This is the Mode of Conveying Ways of EntryHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing UpThe instigation with which this Thread was uttered has been completedTerms of Expression  Rain soddens what is covered up is described by a unityWhat is the reasonHerein what are the RequisitesThese are the two causes  and unreasoned attention and relinquishment  of profitable ideas these are the two conditions How does he  abide percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsive ideasand in the case of ideas such as the discoloured and festering corpsestages that are repulsive to one disgusted by them avoiding both these he abides seeing them thus All Initiates are percipient of herewhere   in the triple element in all the worldIn the case of lifeinaworld in the triple element there is that constancy of repulsion which  NonReturners without lust for the plane of the sensualdesire world  have towards that world and constancy of unrepulsion they have towards the formelement and formless elementand as to that the venerable Sariputta abides percipient of the repulsiveWhen someone does not see ideas consisting in misconduct as such those are unrepulsive  to himideas consisting in good conduct lead to amassingbut after taking good conduct to lead to dispersal  and by taking misconduct to have unwishedfor ripening avoiding both these he abides in onlookingequanimityExhaustion of craving is the unsurpassed extinction therein  foolish ordinary men have perception of repulsiveness and perception of being killedThe venerable Sariputta who understands  with right understanding of how the gratification the disappointment and the escape come to be herein abides   percipient of the unrepulsivemindful and aware According as he sees it approval is an unrepulsive idea   and according as he sees it   resistance is a repulsive idea  herein the venerable Sariputta owing to his abandoning of approval and resistance   avoiding both the repulsive and the unrepulsive   abides in onlookingequanimity mindful and awareWhat is taught  in this ThreadHerein it can be stated that a pleasant abiding here and now is taught likewise liberated cognizance and reviewing and the idea of the higher understanding  is taughtCognizances being as even as earth  is the footing for the contemplation of impermanenceKeeping the body in being  is the footing for the first Foundation of MindfulnessIn that he abides with cognizance as even as earth he abides also  contemplating himself as even as earthLike those unassociated with shuddering  owing to resemblance to a rock so too this venerable one is as even as earth owing to ashamedness of this bodyWhat is the venerable ones Purport in this proseexpositionIt is that all Arahants who wish for the keeping of the Faculties in Being will arouse earth evennessThat he who abides contemplating the body will obtain cognizance as even as earth is unilaterally always soThis concentration is described by a unity The six bodies are described by a unitythe six bodies of feeling are the feelingbodythe six bodies of perception are the perceptionbodythe six bodies of choice are the choicebodyand the six bodies of consciousness are the consciousnessbodyand all these are the ideabody as it is calledand skill in resort and skill in health are the condition skill in emerging  is the cause and the health the conditionin virtue of insight one is not rainsoddened  by delusionand any unprofitable idea which is the opposite of that idea by that one will not be rainsoddenedHere the ten unprofitable courses of action are taught in rainsoddening  and the ten profitable courses of action in nonrainsoddening  For one is not purified by unprofitable ideasSomeone may have stopped as in the Initiates caseaccording as is said by the Blessed One Although the Initiate can still do evil By body or by speech or by the mindYet he can never hide it and this fact Is of one who has seen the State of Peace  Rain soddens what is covered up   when someone has any such  ideas all that are not opened up  are rainsoddened  But what is open it soddens not   rain does not sodden what is uncoveredHerein what is the Mode of Conveying Ways of EntrySince this diversity namely that rain soddens and for him it rainsoddens and thus it rainsoddens is described by characteristics that are qualities  shared in common the description is in terns of a unityThere are two causes and two conditions  for its being rainsoddened  concern with what is unprofitable and delight in having oneself well  spoken ofHerein what is the Coordination Rain soddens what is covered up he sees indecision in whether not to accept that not to confess the coveredup is of no concern Now with the unprofitable root delusion thus unevident owing to wondering  and with craving these defects  increase So interpreting it thus these are determinations consisting in determinativeactsWith determinations as condition consciousness   down to  ageinganddeath This is the coordinationAnd  again while with the teaching thus in the form of Arising his unprofitable ideas attain maturity growth and abundance nevertheless with Cessation of his determinations  This is the Coordination Four types of persons the dark with a dark supreme value     The Threads Meaning Herein what is  dark  Dark  is gloom as stated by the Blessed One  so too as to unknowing there is dark as gloom there one has no faith about evil with its action and its ripening  So it is any thuscharacterized unknowing dark ignorance delusion whereby creatures  do not understand  how it is So it is called darkAnd that is dark for the three eyes namely for the fleshly eye for the heavenly eye and for the eye of understanding for these three eyes Here dark is demonstrated as unknowingHerein what is unknowing It is unseeingin the eight  instances namely unknowing about the four Noble Truths unknowing about past finiteness unknowing about future finiteness unknowing about pastandfuture finiwness unknowing about specific conditionality in the forms of unknowing about cause and unknowing about conditionjust as he is called  deluded  so this   Herein what is the  dark with a bright supreme value   He comports himself in that kind of understanding When he comports himself thus he has that for his supreme valueThis type of person is called  dark with a bright supreme value  Herein how does that type of person have a  bright supreme valueHerein the light of knowledge that is inseparable from the idea of one willing to hear  about an idea that is a guideline of the opposite kind to that same dark  is what is called  bright  This  is the type of person that is  dark with a bright supreme value    Herein it may be stated as follows  This  type of person who is  dark with a bright supreme value  if he obtains a good friend such as will keep him from unprofit and encourage him in only keeping what is profitable in being These ideas are profitable these ideas are unprofitable these ideas should be entered upon and abode in these ideas should not be entered upon and abode in these ideas should be given attention these ideas should not be given attentionHe is willing to hear those ideas he gives ear prepares his cognizance for knowledge and he likes pondering  those ideas Being possessed of understandingconsistinginwhat is heard he  comports himself with that  kind of understanding When he comports himself thus  he comes to have that as the ultimate to have that for supreme value This is called the dark person with a bright supreme value  Herein what is the  bright person with a dark supreme value The light of knowledge that is inseparable from the idea of one willing to hear  about an idea that is a guideline of the opposite kind to that same dark  is what is called  bright In regard to understanding he is called wise  he understands thus  But here he cultivates evil friends obeys the power of evil friends he increases unprofitable ideas and abandons profitable ideasOwing to this negligence giving no attention to perception of conditions he cultivates unmindfulness and unawarenessHe increases the dark which is the opposite of that same lightThis is called the type of person that is bright with a dark supreme value Herein what is the bright person with a bright supreme value Herein it may be stated as follows  This  type of person with a good friend for his support is one who is an able  seeker after what is profitable Approaching good friends he asks he questions  thus  How is there a tether ie bond of responsibility for action How is there liberationHow is there an origin to embodiment How is there a cessation to embodiment and it being taught how it appears established here when he practises rightly accordingly he understands thus These ideas are profitable these ideas are unprofitable  and so on down to  how there is an origin to embodiment  how there is a cessation to embodiment to be given in detailHe rightly practises  those ideas and thus he increases vision   knowledge science lightThat type of person comes to have that as the ultimate that as supreme value This is called the  bright person with a bright supreme value  Herein what is the dark person with a dark supreme value He is one who illustrates the unprofitable ideawho owing to keeping that in being shows reappearance in inferior destinations He comes to have that as the ultimate that as supreme valueThis is called the  dark person with a dark supreme value  Herein the  dark person with a bright supreme value By the dark he shows the ripening of unprofitable actionHerein since he shows reappearance in the superior destinations having that as the ultimate he is therefore said to have a  bright supreme value  Herein the bright person with a dark supreme valueYet  by association with bad friends by waiting on bad friends hy obeying the power of bad friends he increases the unprofitable idea Owing to the keeping of that in being he shows reappearance in inferior destinationshe comes to have that as the ultimate hence he is called bright with a dark supreme value  Herein the  bright person with a bright supreme value  Owing to brightenedness he shows reappearance in superior destinations he comes to have that as the ultimatehence they say that he is  bright with a bright supreme value By the dark he shows the eight wrongnessesBy the  bright with a dark supreme value  he shows the ten unprofitable courses of action This is the ThreadMeaningHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a TeachingHerein it may be stated that in this Thread profitable and unprofitable ideas are taughtThis is the Mode of Conveying a Teaching Herein what is the Mode of Conveying an investigationHerein what is the Mode of Conveying FootingsBy the bright type of person he shows the footing for reviewingBy the dark with a bright supreme value  he shows the footing for diligence By the dark he shows the footing for ignorance and for wrong viewBy the  bright with a dark supreme value  he shows the footing for negligence and wrong viewThese are the FootingsHerein what is the Mode of Conveying CharacteristicsWith the dark with a dark supreme value when cognizance is demonstrated as  dark  all defiling ideas are demonstratedWith the bright  with a bright supreme value when science is demonstrated all ideas siding with enlightenment are demonstratedBy the  bright with a dark supreme value  negligence is demonstratedBy the  dark with a bright supreme value  diligence is demonstratedThis is the Mode of Conveying CharacteristicsWhat is the Blessed Ones Purport in this ThreadIt is this even  those creatures that belong to lowborn clans on hearing this will undertake and carry out profitable ideasThis is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold ArrayHerein what is the Mode of Conveying a ConversionThe craving given existence  by ignorance is the Origin of SufferingThe  dark with a dark supreme value  is SufferingThese are two Truths namely Suffering and Origin Whatever Threadidea the  bright  is described by that idea is the footing for the understanding facultyBy means of such nondelusion the three profitable roots come to fulfilment which is the footing for heaven Dark with a dark supreme value is not unilaterally always soWhat is the reasonThere is the dark kind and yet its existence is in a state with future reappearance  as the bright type of person owing to profitable action to be felt in some future period and there is the bright kind and yet its existence is in a state with future rearising as the dark type of person owing to unprofitable action to be felt in some future period   Reversal In the case of the  dark

this Thread as taughtTerms of Expression When the Blessed One spoke of the dark type for instance he does not teach a single type of personbut rather in so far as creatures have destiriation he demonstrates as  dark  in the plural those who have reappeared there through an action consisting in misconduct Bright  is reappearance due to profitable actions in the case of all creatures and all that is what he refers  to as  bright  With this unity  as condition this is a description in terms of reasoned attention of the four persons as principal entitytypesHerein what are the RequisitesFor unprofit having evil friends is the condition  and unreasoned attention the cause Herein what is the CoordinationHere someone is born again  in a lowborn clan Being born again  in a lowborn clan he has reappeared among inferior unprofitable  forms sounds odours flavours and tangibles and all human use of possessionsThe  bright  type has reappeared among superior profitable kinds and all human use of possessionsHerein what is the type of Thread dealing with corruption and dealing with penetrationAn example is the verse For what reason is that bond not  strongFor four reasons One can get free from it by ones own lordly position or by riches or else through another by petitioning or by legal procedureBut as to the bond consisting in lusting for jewels and gems And concern for a wife and for children as well   they are a mental bond for onefrom which one cannot get free by ones own lordly position or by riches or else through another by petitioning or by legal proceduredivine or human to whom one could say Get me free  from the bond with this   By means of the underlying tendency to lust this bond binds one to the six external bases He who is bound here in the world of this life is guided  to the next world boundHe can never get free except by way of the Noble Path For it is through finding this bond and the state of dying and the state of reappearing to be fearful that he comes to abandon will and lustBy abandoning will and lust he surmountsHerein the abandoning of determinations that are due to bondage is elsewhere stated thus   With chattels a Stilled One remains unbesmirched since in regard to chattels consisting in children and wives he   and one such as this shows the abandoning of that same cravingwith the abandoning of the cravings root  He does so   for it is owing to negligence that sensual desire occurs He who delights in the renunciation due to their abandoning is one who abides diligentAnd it is with his abandoning of hope  from these that he hopes neither for this world nor for a next worldHe does not wish for anything endearing and gratifying that has this world for its supportnor does he wish for anything endearing and gratifying that has another world for its support Hence it is said that His abandoning is the  severance    Now the  Stilled One thus demonstrated in the Chapter of Octets is the  steadfast one here   and the nonhoping  demonstrated in the Chapter of Octets is the unconcern  here So since  all these sensual desires have been taught in the first verse alone with craving for the chattel as an objective sensual desireSo in the case of all verses and prose expositions  The Thread has been demonstratedHerein what is the TeachingWith what purport is this Thread taughtThose creatures that are of lusting

by a unity not by a diversityThere are four kinds of lust namely lust for sensual desires lust for form lust for being and lust for views which are described by a unityHerein what are the RequisitesWhen people have  lust for jewels and gems  the cause of that is perception of beauty and apprehending of the sign of beauty through personal features  is its conditionPerception of ugliness is the cause whereby they are severed and removal of apprehension of signs is the conditionHerein what is the CoordinationThose lusting after jewels and gems  are confused and affected by hate  as well But that too they sever and wander in freedom  that is abandoned  because of its having being diagnosed and because of its having being avoided  This is the CoordinationWhen someone is possessed  of this unknowing the outcome is this  that he does not know  This should be cultivated  for filling out see    this should not be given attention It is by that kind of dark that he is demonstrated as  dark  Now the dark by which that type of person is called dark  is the dark by which when uneradicated when unsevered he comes to have that for the ultimate has that for his supreme value which is why this type of person is called  dark with a dark supreme value    The True Idea is the only supreme value  to be given attention  Hearing it he gives ear prepares his cognizance for knowledgeAnd he likes pondering those ideasHe sees with understandingconsistinginwhatisheardand teach him the true object of faith thus these ideas are blameworthy these ideas are blameless these ideas are to be cultivated these ideas are not to be cultivated these ideas are to be kept in being these ideas are not to be kept in being  these ideas should be entered upon and abode in these ideas should not be entered upon and abode inthese ideas should be given attention these ideas should not be given attentionand when the mindfulness faculty  ripens with perception according as this this is perceived to

doublehence the Blessed One teaches in the verse that follows The demonstration of this  verse has been twofold  as demonstration by collation fwith another verse and demonstration by occasion  Just as this verse as an answer to the question asked in the Sarpyutta is the type of Thread dealing with corruption and dealing with penetration so too the answer to the question asked in that verse in the Chapter of Octets is the type of Thread dealing with corruption and dealing with penetrationHerein what is the Investigationwho lusts after fields and lands These are the four Truths   indetail  in the three paragraphs  As to  what is chosen  this is a condition  for bodily and verbal actionWhat is the reasonIt is because what is chosen is choice and that is called mindaction That choice as action is the mental kind and that and the bodily and verbal kinds are the three kinds of action demonstratedNow though the bodily action and the verbal action that one instigates may in themselves be profitable when one misapprehends them this is what is called  misapprehension of virtue and dutyAsserting  is the threefold determinations namely those consisting in merit those consisting in demerit and those consisting in imperturbability  With those as condition consciousness thus these are an object whereby consciousness has a steadyingpoint  Any perception of beauty perception of permanence perception of pleasure and perception of selfis what is chosenThat consciousness passing on  by means of form is steadied with form as its object with form as its standingpoint  comes to growth increase and abundance through its being infected with relishing  this is  asserting   When thus steadied in the steadyingpoints for consciousness the first generating of consciousness is an assuming by way of an object  that is what is called  chosen Then any attachment cleaving to on the part of the formless steadied thereon is what is called asserted   Concern for agreeable forms that are agreeable and pleasing is what is chosen For  among the wishedfor  and agreeable is the BodyTie of covetousness and among those provocative  of resistance it is the BodyTie of ill will  and so all four BodyTies  This is cognizances first instance in the five strands of sensual desires When someone is a contemplator of gratification therein in those sensual desires then owing to that choice of his  many evil unprofitable ideas have parallel occurrence  with his cognizanceFor when a person is bound by lust through sensual desire as defilement  he can be done with as Mara desires  This is the asserting in the case of the Flood of Sensual Desiresand so with all four FloodsIn so far as he abides associated with these sensual desires with them kept in being  cleaved to them this is choiceIn so far likewise as when someone is not without lust has a propensity for loving when any change and alteration arise for him then with the sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair consequent thereon in him that consciousness of his has parallel occurrence with pain  as the thoughtarising that what is remembered is inseparable from the idea of its subsidence grips his cognizance  this is called  assertingHe  chooses  and  asserts  for each single  steadyingpoint for consciousness and that steadyingpoint is twofold namely steadyingpointasobject and steadyingpointasnutrimentHerein the steadyingpointasobject is a condition for nameandformand for the steadyingpointasnutriment  and for any steadyingpoint for that generated renewal of being and for any steadyingpoint as renewal of being Hence  it is said that in the Thread That becomes the objectwhereby consciousness has a steadyingpoint   With that consciousness as condition nameand form   down to  ageinganddeath  Again he does not  choose and does not assert  in order that that steadyingpoint may not give renewal of being in a future physical basis  this opposite is demonstrated as follows in the Thread   the demonstration here being the secondWhat he had formerly chosen   and had asserted  is still uneradicated and with that as condition there is still this steadyingpoint for consciousnessOr else his underlying tendencies reveal themselves and with that as condition renewal of being is generated for himOr else  he does not bother to assert any preference for houses with a refined livingstandard  Since he does not bother to assert it he is thus reborn in houses of low standard That guides him to assert preference Any such determinations chosen and asserted are objects both the choice and the assertion for the purpose of generating a physical basis being an object for consciousness  As  by choice and by assertion  aspiring creatures  that already are choose  and assertnot so those that yet seek to be   who neither choose nor assertWhat are the creatures that already areThey are those actually born and the eggborn  already broken out of the egg and the moistureborn all so long as they have not yet reached dissolution of the body  it is these that  already are What are those that yet seek to be They are those traversing the roundabout while still in the womb or in the egg  it is these latter that  neither choose nor assert  Those that already are  are  frail  while those  that yet seek to be  are  firm  It is the frail that choose  and assert Another wayAnother waythere are subtle breathing things  in the soil and in water that do not come within the eyes horizon   and they neither choose nor assert yet they pursue the roundabout owing to underlying tendencyAnother wayall outsider mendicants  are over estimators  They neither choose nor assert  and yet they pursue the roundabout owing to underlying tendency  If one no more chooses and no more asserts and no more lets tendencies underliethen there is no  object whereby consciousness might have a steadying point With the words He no more chooses he shows eradication of obsessionWith  he no more chooses  he shows abandoning of gross defilementsWith  he no more chooses he shows the plane of seeing   with he no more asserts  he shows the OnceReturner and the NonReturner and with he no more lets tendencies

the purportConversion The choosing the asserting and the underlying tendency on the one hand and the abandoning of the steadyingpoints for consciousness  on the other are two Truths respectively

With cessation of consciousness cessation of nameandform  down to  cessation of ageinganddeathThe words  deal with corruption The words It is by depending on the essentials of existence that this suffering has actual being  down to   His craving for being comes to be abandoned And he no more expectantly relishes nonbeing  deal with penetration The words That bhikkhu being quenched through not assuming no more his being comes to be reneweddown to  one such as this outstrips all kinds of being deal with the AdeptHerein  born to anguish   the anguish is that it is born to lust born to hate and born to delusionand thus with the words  the world is born to anguish  he shows how these creatures standThe  contact  is threefold namely to be felt as pleasure to be felt as pain and to be felt as neitherpainnor pleasureHerein contact to be felt as pleasure brings the anguish of lust that to be felt as pain brings the anguish of hate and that to be felt as neitherpainnorpleasure brings the anguish of delusionAnd according as the Blessed One said to Hatthaka Alavaka  in the Anguttara  It is sickness that it calls self   he who is anguished by these kinds of anguish obtains the threefold perversion namely perversion of perception perversion of cognizance and perversion of viewHerein perversion of perception is that there is beauty in the uglyperversion of cognizance is that there is pleasure in the painful andSimilarly the perversion of cognizance and those of perception and view these are the threefold logical  thinking thinking based on the affective state of cognizance is a perversion thinking based on perception is a perversion and thinking based on view is a perversion tooHerein the plane for the perversions province of predominance is ignorance  for according as ignorance  perceives it according as it cognizes according as it perceives and cognizesThus the words it is sickness that it calls self are a conversion to the oppositeMaintaining its being otherwise than it conceives  while being it aspires to future being hence it is said here that it  clings to being  Expectantly relishes only being but what it relishes brings fear    by this he demonstrates  the five categories Up to this point corruptionNow this divine life is lived in order to abandon being  while  it is by depending on  the essentials of existence that this suffering has actual being  since that pain will be kept in being for anyone who relishes being he stated the abandoning of that pain thus Of that the first perversion is sensualdesire assumption the second is viewassumption while the third is virtueandduty assumption and selftheory assumption Their exhaustion is pains having no more actual being and with this he states the cessation of pain that has the essentials of existence for its sourceSo when a man thus sees with right understanding how this is his    he has no craving for beingBy  He no more expectantly relishes nonbeing  he alludes to the plane of seeing By  That is the utter exhaustion   extinction  he explains two deliverances  fading of lust and fading of ignoranceBy That bhikkhu  no more his   he alludes to the extinction element without trace

deliverances namely heart deliverance due to fading of lust and understandingdeliverance due to fading of ignoranceThis is the ThreadDemonstrationHerein what is the TeachingWhat is taught in this ThreadTwo good destinations namely gods and human beings and also the five strands of sensual desire in the verse namely Merit will grow for one who gives and No risk is stored for one restrained By  One who is skilled abandons evil the path is statedBy  With exhaustion of lust hate delusion He attains complete extinction the two extinction elements are taught that with trace left and that without trace leftThis is the teachingInvestigation Merit will grow for one who gives  by this first term the ground for making merit consisting in giving is stated hence the ripening  of straightwayresulting profitable ideasBy the second term  line     line  let find thus the Dispensation gives outlet This is the purportHerein what is the Reversaland all the fifty terms can be cited he describes all that by a description in terms of synonyms What it expectantly relishes brings fear    the perversions  are described by a description in terms of presentationHerein what is the Clearing Upwith the abandoning of the embodimentview he sees how there is disappointment in sensual desiresand since with that as condition he stands as one divine as it were  an Arahantand with  one gone to the further shore  it is those hearers  who are Adepts and also Fully Enlightened Ones  that are statedand with one gone to the further shore it is the AdeptArahant ideas that are statedand the surmounting of the worlds of the triple elementHe who makes efforts  against the stream of craving also makes efforts against the stream of defilementsand may do evil actions connected therewith Descriptions  By one going with the stream  All ordinary men are described by a unity NonReturners are described by a description in terms of invincibility  These are the descriptionsand said  Master Kaccana the brahmins say thus Brahmins are the highest caste those of any other caste are inferior brahmins are the fairest caste those of any other caste are dark only brahmins are purified not nonbrahmins brahmins alone are the sons of Brahma the offspring of Brahma born of his mouth born of Brahma created by Brahma heirs of Brahmaor how does it appear to you in this casethere is no difference between them at all that I seeor how does it appear to you in this casethis is the demonstration with two  terms line  Herein what is the type of Thread dealing with morality and dealing with penetration The verse  For one who gives   the ground for making merit consisting in giving is statedNo risk is stored for one restrained  the ground for making merit consisting in virtue is stated One who is skilled abandons evil   he states the abandoning of greed and delusion and ill willWith exhaustion of lust hate delusion He attains complete extinction   he states the outguiding of will and lust for greed for delusion and for ill willThe verse   Merit will grow for one who gives  is the profitable root nongreedNo risk is stored for one restrained is the profitable root nonhate line  namely No risk is stored for one restrained the state  of no risk no foe and no ill will affiiction is statedBy the third term namely One who is skilled abandons evil cessation of unknowing with the arising of knowledge is statedBy the fourth term with the exhaustion o lust and hate  there is the heartdeliverance due to fading of lust and with the exhaustion of delusion there is the understandingdeliverance due to fading of ignorance This is the Investigationhe abandons avariceand merit growsThere is this construingHerein what are the Footings  Merit will grow for one who gives is the footing for the Expression of Generosity No risk is stored for one restrained is the footing for the Expression of Understanding  One who is skilled abandons evil  is the footing for the Expression of TruthThis is the FootingsHerein what are the CharacteristicsMerit will grow for him who gives No risk is stored for one restrainedThe Fourfold ArrayWhat is the Blessed Ones Purport hereIt is that those who aspire to great properties will give gifts for the abandoning of danger that those with the will for nonrisk will abandon the five risks that those who have the will for the profitable keep the eightfactored path in being for the abandoning of the eight wrongnessand that those who desire to attain extinction will abandon lust hate and delusion This is the Blessed Ones purportConversion Avarice in one who does not give and risk for one inrestrained and nonabandoning of evil are Origin through demonstration by oppositesWith nongreed and nonhate and nondelusion as profitable these are the three profitable rootsTheir condition is the eight rightnesses This is the PathTheir exhaustion  of lust hate and delusion is CessationConstruing One who is steadied in giving fulfils in both ways and  With exhaustion of lust hate delusion He attains complete extinction  is the footing for the Expression of Peacealso for one who gives no risk is stored up  One who is skilled abandons evil with exhaustion of lust hate delusion he attains complete extinction  also with the exhaustion of form also with the exhaustion of feeling  With exhaustion fading cessation of form by means of which form someone describing a Perfect One  would describe a wrong view  and so with the rest of the five categoriesAnalysis  Merit will grow for him who gives  is not unilaterally always so For him who gives out of fear of punishment by kings for him who gives to the virtuous using what is not allowable no merit grows and he gives such a gift without profit And with gifts of rods for punishing and gifts of weapons it is demerit not merit that grows No risk is stored for one restrained  is not unilaterally always so What is the reason When someone sees his state here and now thus  etc  he does not by such restraint as that unmake riskOn the contrary it is one who undertakes thus  One who kills breathing things has evil ripening here and now and in some future existence and so with all the ten kinds of unprofitable action that he refrains with that as cause It is by this kind of restraint that nonrisk is stored upReversal  Merit will grow for him who gives   merit will not grow for one who does not givethe kind of merit that is that consists in giving  No risk is stored for one restrained   for one unrestrained risk is madeOne who is skilled abandons evil  one who is unskilled does not abandon it With exhaustion of lust hate delusion he   line No risk is stored for one restrained is described by a description in terms ofdestruction with the support of nonhate  One who is skilled abandons evil  is described by a description in terms of destruction with the support of nondelusionWays of Entry In the case of the five faculties beginning with faith Merit will grow for him who gives No risk is stored for one restrained is the virtue category  by means of restraintmade a way of entry In the case of the six faculties beginning with the eye restraint is the concentration category That One who is skilled abandons evil is the understanding categoryWith exhaustion of lust hate delusion he attains complete extinction  this is the deliverance categoryIn the case of the elements the idea element  in the case of the bases the mind baseClearing Up The instigation with which this Thread is taught is cleared up in the Thread itselfTerms of Expression Giving is described in terms of a unityBut  For him who gives  is not described by a description in terms of a unityit is described by a description in terms of the blamelessness of the liking  With exhaustion of lust hate delusion he attains complete extinction  is described in terms of fighting courageRequisites For giving gladness is the condition and nongreed the causeFor one restrained reasoned attention is the cause and giving up the conditionOne who is skilled abandons evil   seeing how things are is the condition and obtainment of knowledge the causeCoordination The verse Merit will grow for him who gives   for him also virtue growsand also restraint growsNo risk is stored for one restrained also no other defilements are stored up  With exhaustion of lust hate delusion he attains complete extinction  with the exhaustion of lust and hate there is also the exhaustion of the underlying tendency to lust and also of those to hate and to delusion  He attains complete extinction is the extinction element with trace left and the extinction element without trace leftThis is the Coordination With exhaustion of lust hate delusion he attains complete extinction   anothers utterance and reasoned attention in oneself and the path are the cause and the conditionThe eight kinds of giving beginning with generosity giving up giving of the True Idea giving of material things   can be cited in detail  this is a diversityDescriptions Merit grows for him who gives is described by a description in terms of destruction with the support of nongreedand also for him who concentrates his cognizance  also merit grows through performance of servicesSynonyms Merit grows for him who gives  merit also grows for him who shares line  attains complete extinction   without the complete exhaustion he has no extinction line   this Thread can be quoted in detailWhen he devotes himself and  strives and makes efforts  he here and now  when ill the time of death when a god he reaches Hermit Enlightenment   Entered the ear   this is done by hearing the true object of faith and his cognizance is not yet thirsty for the insight into ideas that consists in the higher understanding  or for complete breakingout  And this Thread is taught of the five kinds of persons there are the Followers by Faith with blunt faculties and with keen faculties and the followers by Ideas with blunt faculties and with keen facuities but  since a person of deluded temperament cannot devote himself strive or make efforts the deliverance according as it comes to be  according to the concentration it has  shows its fruit at that moment at that instant in that periodand even if the devotee falls away or another corrupts  him  that deliverance  is still not without its pleasant ripening for himeither here and now or on reappearance or in some future periodHerein if the kind of person who is a Follower by Ideas with keen faculties has such ideas entered by the ear then when he devotes himself he reaches distinction here and nowThe Follower by Faith with keen faculties reaches it on the occasion of the time of deathbut the Follower by Ideas with blunt faculties reaches it when he is illand he with blunt faculties reaches it when he is a god but when he does not reach it as a god then with that same lust for the True Idea with that relish for the True Idea he eventually reaches  Hermit Enlightenment He who devotes himself strives makes efforts in regard to the ideas that have entered the ear perceives successive  distinction and perceiving he reaches it here and now If he gives attention thereto when ill he reaches it when he devotes himself thereto If he has the sense of urgency at the time of his death he reaches it when he devotes himself thereto But if he has no sense of urgency in any of these instances then  he recognizes thus Then as a god he reaches itOr else through abiding in negligence due to cleaving to the five strands of heavenly sensual desires he eventually by means of that profitable root reaches Hermit EnlightenmentWhat owing to anothers utterance is consolidated by word of mouth   is understanding consisting in what is heardThose ideas when looked over by the mind are understanding consisting in cogitationIn that they are  well penetrated by right view  is understanding consisting in keeping in beingWhen ideas that have entered the ear are consolidated by word of mouth then  when someone attains extinction here and now that person is an Arahant  He who reaches Hermit Enlightenment through that profitable root is the type of person whose actual being has for its accessories his previous devotionIdeas that have entered the ear is the first Base for Deliverance   consolidated by word of mouth  is the second and third Base for Deliverance  looked over by the mind  is the fourth Base for Deliverance and  well penetrated by right view is the fifth Base for Deliverance Ideas that have entered the ear consolidated by word of mouth   having heard through his ear successive ideas he fulfils the virtue category  Looked over by the mind   he fulfils the concentration category Well penetrated by right view he fulfils the understanding categorybut he who reaches it on reappearance as a god and attains extinction there is a NonReturnerIdeas that have entered the ear    which can be quoted in detail this is the first

Thread having been analysed  there is no need  to produce another waysince the plane of coordination is there already  line  line  In the Elder MahaKacciiyanas PitakaDisclosurethe chapter on the Modes of Conveying in Combined Treatment is completedor how does it appear to you in this caseor how does it appear to you in this casethere is no difference between them at all that I seeor haw does it appear to you in this caseor how does it appear to you in this caseor how does it appear to you in this casethere is no difference between them at all that I see and herein Herein those creatures who are fettered by craving have much cleaving and weak insightHerein creatures of craving temperament have insisted upon perception of creatures and do not see rise and subsidencethey see self in the five categories Some see self as possessed of form or form in self or self in form that is how they see each of the five categoriesby means of the other categories  But when creatures with pronounced views thereof are exercizing insight they see the categories directly as self they see form as self thusSo the first instances  of each of the five categories  belong with the annihilation view thus and with the three last terms in the case of each  single category the instance belongs to eternalism thus When those of craving temperament go forth into homelessness outside this Dispensation they abide devoted to the pursuit of sensual pleasuresAnd those of view temperament with that outcome ie likewise gone forth abide devoted to the pursuit of selftormentIt is owing to that same pleasure in views that outsiders range is only that muchHerein when creatures of view temperament find a way of entry into the Noble Ones True Idea and Outguiding Discipline they become Followers by Ideas Herein when creatures of view temperament hold the view that there is wrong in sensual desires so long as the underlying tendencies with regard to sensual desires are not eradicated  they abide devoted to pursuit of selftormentThere is no meaning in sensual desires and they who already did not seek sensual desires thus easily relinquish sensual desiresHence pleasant way is saidBut creatures of craving temperament cleave to sensual desires To them the Master teachesor some bhikkhu as follows There is no meaning in sensual desires  and they since those are dear to them relinquish with painHence  painful way  is saidSo all these creatures combine together under the two Ways under the Painful and the PleasantHerein creatures of view temperament are of two kinds  with blunt faculties and with keen facultiesHerein creatures of view temperament with keen faculties renounce with pleasure and actualize swiftly hence pleasant way with swift acquaintanceship  is saidAnd herein since creatures of view temperament with blunt faculties actualize more sluggishly as compared with the firstmentioned kind with keen faculties they renounce with pleasure and actualize sluggishlyHerein creatures of craving temperament are of two kinds  with keen faculties and with blunt facultiesHerein creatures of craving temperament with keen faculties renounce with pain and actualize swiftlyhence painful way with swift acquaintanceship is saidThese are the four Ways  with no fifth and no sixthWhoever they  are that have attained extinction or will attain extinction it is by these four Ways not by any other  This Way having been demonstrated  in defilement by a tetrad thuscan be demonstrated in the Noble Ideas by a tetradpath This is called the PlayofLions GuideLineHerein there are  Four Nutriments Four Perversions   Assumings   Bonds   Ties   Taints   Floods   Barbs   SteadyingPoints for Consciousness   Goings on Bad Ways In this way the collation of the Threadis made under the four NutrimentsHerein  physical nutriment and contact as nutriment are abandonable by one of craving temperament The first nutriment is the first perversion the second nutriment the second perversion the third nutriment the third perversion the fourth nutriment the fourth perversionThese are the four perversions with no fifth and no sixth Herein one steadied in the first perversion assumes sensual desires  this is sensualdesire assumingOne steadied in the second perversion assumes future being  this is virtueandduty assumingOne steadied in the third perversion assumes a view   this is view assumingOne steadied in the fourth perversion assumes the categories as self this is selftheory assuming Herein one steadied in sensualdesire assuming ties with covetousness   this is the bodytie of covetousnessOne steadied in virtueandduty assuming ties ill will this is the bodytie of ill willOne steadied in view assuming ties misapprehension this is the bodytie of misapprehensionOne steadied in selftheory assuming ties when diversifying  this is the bodytie of insistence that this is truth While he is tying  the defilements that assail himHerein the taint of sensual desire is due to the bodytie of covetousness the taint of being is due to the bodytie of ill will the taint of views is due to the bodytie of misapprehension and the taint of ignorance is due to the bodytie of insistence that this is truth These  four taints when they come to abundance are floods that is why they are called floodsHerein the taint of sensual desire is the flood of sensual desire the taint of being is the flood of being the taint of ignorance is the flood of ignorance and the taint of views is the flood of views These four floods when they have entered the inclination  and are accompanied by underlying tendencyHerein the flood of sensual desire is the barb of lust the flood of being is the barb of hate the flood of ignorance is the barb of delusion  and the flood of views is the barb of viewsThese are the four steadyingpoints for consciousnessHerein when infected  by the barb of lust consciousness passing on is steadied on form when infected by the barb of hate passing on  on feeling  when infected by the barb of delusion  passing on  on perception  when infected by the barb of views consciousness passing on is steadied on determinations By means of the four steadyingpoints for consciousness they go the fourfold bad way through will through hate through fear and through delusionIt is owing to lust that one goes the bad way through will owing to hate that one goes the bad way through hate owing to delusion that one goes the bad way through delusion and owing to view that one goes the bad way through fearSo this action and these defilements are the cause of the roundaboutHerein these are the four directions Physical nutriment the perversion that there is beauty in the ugly sensualdesire assuming the bond  of sensual desires the bodytie of covetousness the taint of sensual desires the flood of sensual desires the barb of lust forn as steadyingpoint for consciousness passing on the going a bad way through will  Contact as nutriment the perversion that there is pleasure in the painful virtueandduty assuming the bond of being the bodytie of ill will the taint of being the flood of being the barb of hate feeling as steadyingpoint for consciousness passing on the going a bad way through hate  this is the second Directionthis is the third DirectionSo the plotting of the first Direction by the first term of each of these ten Threadsis called the Plotting of DirectionsSurveying on the unprofitable side by means of the four Perversions after associating the defilement is the plane of the Plotting of Directions on the unprofitable side  As to the first terms of these  ten Threads  what is the meaning of these ideasThe meaning is one only the phrasing is differentThis is the first collationAll defilements in the four teros in each tetrad can be inserted under this  abbreviationNext the profitable side  four Ways   four Meditations   four Foundations of Mindfulness   four Abidingsheavenly divine noble imperturbable   four Right

unprofitable by opposites This is called the PlottingofDirections  GuideLineIts end is the four Fruits of the Monks State  And the idea demonstrated  as the first Direction in the profitable demonstration  has for its end the fruit of StreamEntry the second the fruit of OnceReturn the third  the fruit of NonReturn and the fourth the fruit of ArahantshipHerein what is the Trefoil GuideLineThose who find outlet by the painful way with sluggish acquaintance and with swift acquaintance are two types of persons  and those who find outlet by the pleasant way with sluggish acquaintance and with swift acquaintance are two types of personsOf these four types of persons the type of person who finds outlet  by the pleasant way with sluggish acquaintance and the type of person who finds outlet by the painful way with swift acquaintanceHerein he who finds outlet by the pleasant way with swift acquaintance is one who gains knowledge by what is condensed The next type of person shared in common with the third is one who gains knowledge by what is expandedThe type of person who finds outlet by the painful way with sluggish acquaintance is one who is guidableSo these having been four are three  Herein insight preceded by quiet is for one who gains knowledge by what is condensed Quiet preceded by insight is for one who is guidable Quiet and insight coupled together are for one who gains knowledge by what is expandedThe blunt type of teaching is for one who gains knowledge by what is condensed The keen type of teaching is for one who is guidable The keentoblunt type of teaching is for one who gains knowledge by what is expandedThe training in the higher understanding is for one who gains knowledge by what is condensed The training in the higher cognizance is for one who is guidable The training in the higher virtue is for one who gains knowledge by what is expandedThat is how these types of persons have an outlet by the four waysHerein the corruption is

contact three kinds of feeling  down to  painfulness in determinations  Whatever is on the unprofitable side all combines in the three unprofitable roots Herein what is the profitable sideThree Profitable Roots   three kinds of Understanding understanding consisting in what is heard understanding consisting in cogitation understanding consisting in keeping in being three kinds of

profitable ideas are demonstrated by the three triaddemonstrations Their end is the three Gateways to Liberation Herein with the first the Dispositionless with the second the Void with the third the SignlessThis is called the second  GuideLine the TrefoilHerein there are three types of person one who gains knowledge from what is condensed one who gains knowledge from what is expanded and one who is guidable Of these three types of person those types of person who find outlet  by the pleasant way with swift acquaintance and the pleasant way with sluggish acquaintance are two types of personand there are two types of person who find outlet  by the painful way with swift acquaintance and by the painful way with sluggish acquaintance These who are four in virtue of that distinction according to the four ways are two namely as one of view temperament and one of craving temperament Of these two types of persons this is the corruption  Ignorance and Craving   Consciencelessness and Shamelessness   Unmindfulness and Unawareness   Hindrances and Fetters   Cleaving  and Insistence   Imaking and Mymaking   Faithlessness and Unamenability to Correction    Idleness and Unreasoned Attention   Uncertainty and Covetousness   Not Hearing the True Idea and NonAttainment Herein ignorance and consciencelessness and tnmindfulness and hindrances and cleaving and Imaking and faithlessness and idleness and uncertainty and not hearing the True Idea  this is one DirectionCraving and shamelessness and unawareness and fetters and insistence and mymaking and unamenability to correction and unreasoned attention and covetousness and nonattainment  these are the second DirectionOf the ten dyads the ten first termsSo the unprofitable ideas state of being a source  of suffering is OriginWhatever  idea nameandform resides in is Suffering So this Origin and this Suffering are the two Truths of Suifering and Origin which is the first demonstration of the Conversion of RelishingHerein what is the profitable sideQuiet and Insight   Science and Good Conduct   Mindfulness and Awareness   Conscience and Shame   Abandoning of Imaking and Abandoning of Mymaking   Right Effort and Reasoned Attention   Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration   Understanding and Dispassion   Attainment and Hearing the True Idea   Joy and Practice in accordance with the True Idea Herein quiet and science and mindfulness and conscience and abandoning of Imaking and right effort and right mindfulness and understanding and attainment and joy  these ideas are one DirectionInsight and good conduct and awareness and shame and abandoning of mymaking and reasoned attention and right concentration and dispassion and hearing the True Idea and practice in accordance with the True Idea  these are the second DirectionSo on the profitable side and the unprofitable side the Conversion of Relishing GuideLine has four DirectionsNow of these the ten first unprofitable of the unprofitable side that come to abandonment by means of the profitable come to be abandoned by means of the ten first  terms on the profitable sideWith their abandoning the heartdeliverance due to fading of lust is the end And the ten second unprofitable terms of the unprofitable side that come to abandoning come to be abandoned by means of the ten second  terms on the profitable sideWith their abandoning the understandingdeliverance due to fading of ignorance is the endOf these three GuideLines the first GuideLine is called the Play of LionsIt has eight terms four of which are profitable and four unprofitable these eight terms are eight of the RootTerms The second GuideLine as a meaning GuideLine too is the TrefoilThat guides by means of six ideas since it guides by means of three profitable roots and three unprofitable roots So these six terms and the firstmentioned RootTerms are fourteen of the eighteen RootTerms Herein the last GuideLine is the Conversion of Relishing That guides by means of four ideasby ignorance and craving and by quiet and insight These four ideas complete the eighteen RootTerms demonstrated under the three GuideLinesHerein all the unprofitable  converges under the nine unprofitable  termsAnd of these nine RootTerms four are in the PlayofLions GuideLine three in the Trefoil and two in the Conversion of Relishing That is how they are on the unprofitable  sideHerein as to the nine profitable RootTerms all the profitable is construable thereunderHerein in the PlayofLions GuideLine there are four terns in the Trefoil three and in the Conversion of Relishing two These are the nine profitable RootTermsHerein there are four terms in the ConversionofRelishing GuideLine and the eighteen RootTerms converge thereHow Quiet and NonGreed and NonHate and Perception of Ugliness and Perception of Pain  these five terms on the profitable side belong with QuietAnd Insight and NonDelusion and Perception of Impermanence and Perception of NotSelf these four terms belong with InsightThese are the nine profitable construed under two of the terms Herein of the nine unprofitable RootTerms on the unprofitable side Craving and Greed and Hate and Perception of Beauty and Perception of Pleasure  these five terms belong with CravingAnd Ignorance and Delusion and Perception of Permanence and Perception of Self  these four terms belong with IgnoranceThese are the nine unprofitable terms fully abbreviatedSo these three GuideLines are included in the one GuideLineThat is how the eighteen RootTerms can be demonstrated in the Conversionof Relishing GuideLineHow are the eighteen RootTerms construable under the Trefoil GuideLineOf the nine profitable terms Insight and NonDelusion and Perception of Impermanence and Perception of NotSelf these four terms are NonDelusion and Quiet and NonGreed and Perception of Ugliness and Perception of Pain  these four terms are NonGreed and NonHate That is how these nine terms can be construed under the three profitable rootsHerein of the nine unprofitable terms Craving and Greed and Perception of Beauty and Perception of Pleasure  these four tems are Greed as unprofitable Root  and Ignorance and Delusion and Perception of Permanence and Perception of Self  these are Hate And so these nine terms are construed under the three unprofitable rootsThat is how the eighteen RootTerms can be demonstrated by the Trefoil GuideLine by construing them under the profitable and unprofitable  rootsHow are the eighteen RootTerms construable under the PlayofLions GuideLineCraving and Perception of Beauty these are the first PerversionGreed and Perception of Pleasure  these are the second PerversionIgnorance and Perception of Permanence  these are the third PerversionDelusion and Perception of Self  this is the fourth PerversionSo these nine  unprofitable terms are construed under the four termsNonGreed and Perception of Pain  these are the second Foundation of MindfulnessInsight and Perception of Impermanence  these are the third Foundation of MindfulnessNonDelusion and Perception of NotSelf these are the fourth Foundation of MindfulnessThese eighteen RootTerms have been included under the PlayofLions GuideLineThe plane and the resort  of these three GuideLines is included in each  GuideLineWhen the profitable ideas or unprofitable ideas of one GuideLine are known the opposite  can be sought out accordingly Having sought out the opposites that GuideLine can be demonstrated When that GuideLine is demonstrated then according as one GuideLine is demonstrated so can all the three GuideLines each including the others be demonstratedsince the eighteen RootTerms are all included under each single GuideLine when that idea is cognized all ideas are cognizedOf these three GuideLines the PlayofLions GuideLine has the four Fruits of the Monks State for its end The Trefoil GuideLine has the three Gateways to Liberation for its end The Conversion of Relishing GuideLine has the Heart Deliverance due to Fading of Lust and the UnderstandingDeliverance due to Fading of Ignorance for its endThe first Direction has the HeartDeliverance due to Fading of Lust and the second Direction  has the UnderstandingDeliverance due to Fading of IgnoranceThese are three GuideLines The Plotting of these three GuideLines eighteen RootTerms is called the PlottingofDirections GuideLineBy plotting  one knows that this idea belongs with this idea such right bringing together These are the five GuideLinesHere is a mnemonic verse Mindfulness Foundations And Quiet and Insight and the Roots Of Profit All Profit by nine terms construed And all Unprofit too by nine Guiding the profit by the roots Of profit unprofit by its roots which by the Faculties  guide and also By perversions the DefilementsThe GuideLine that plots out ideas Of profit here unprofit thereAfter thus plotting with the Plotting Of Directions what then selects The Moulding of the GuideLinesthe meaning contained in the two profitable ideas  in the Conversion of Relishing may be taken as analysing the plane of existence that is being analysed  in the triads And then all that meaning is demonstrated by three phrasing terms namely the three profitable rootsof meaning too  is stated by the four terms There is no plane to demonstrate by the twentyeight parts  since it is already demonstrated by the four terms as the four profitable perceptions which cover itSo the measure is the nonconfounding of what is demonstratedJust as all kinds of concentration can be sought and found in the three kinds of concentrationin that with thinking and exploring that without thinking and with only exploring and that without thinking and without exploringsince this is their measure there being no fourth kind of concentrationwhile those creatures with prominent views have much insight and weak cleavingWhat is form is selfwhat I am is form and he who  sees forms destruction  is an annihilationistbut when creatures of craving temperament find a way of entry into the Noble Ones True Idea and Outguiding Discipline they become Followers by FaithTo them the Master or some hearer of his teaches as followswithout cleaving to them through mental painhence pleasant way with sluggish acquaintanceship is saidAnd herein since creatures of craving temperament with blunt faculties actualize more sluggishly compared with the firstmentioned kind with keen faculties they renounce with pain and actualize sluggishlyhence painful way with sluggish acquaintanceship is saidwhile mindchoice as nutriment and consciousness as nutriment are abandonable by one of view temperamentand the measure is the four nutrimentsare called remorseand the remorse is underlying tendenciesare called barbs and they strike the heart and remain there Consciousness gripped by the four barbs is steadied on the four ideas  on form on feeling on perception or on determinationsthis is the first Direction Mindchoice as nutriment the perversion that there is self in the notself view assuming the bond of views the bodytie of misapprehension the taint of views the flood of views the barb of views perception as steadyingpoint for consciousness passing on the going a bad way through fear  Consciousness as nutriment the perversion that there is permanence in the impermanent selftheory assuming the bond of ignorance the bodytie of insistence that this is truth  the taint of ignorance the flood of ignorance the barb of delusion determinations as steadyingpoint for consciousness passing on the going a bad way through delusion this is the fourth DirectionLikewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourththese are the first Directionthese are the third Directionthese

in keeping in beingsince they together are demonstrated  in all kinds of understanding understanding having no fourth kind that does not consist in what is heard or cogitation or keeping in being so too what is called the measure is the nonconfounding of these ideasThe Blessed One said thisYes venerable sir those bhikkhus repliedListen to that and attend closely I will speakcommand what punishment for him you wishhow would you treat himcommand what punishment for him you wishhow would you treat himor how does it appear to you in this casethere is no difference between them at all that I seeor how does it appear to you in this casethere is no difference between them at all that I seeI go to Master Kaccana for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusBut since that Blessed One has attained to final Nibbana we go to that Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusIt seems that large numbers of people in India used to gather together here and there at city gates and in debating halls and pay gold money to have the various outsidesectarians tales such as the Rape of Sita and the rest told each tale to be finished at the end of four monthsIn the course of this a talk about good omens started in this way  What is a good omen Is what is seen a good omen Is what is heard a good omen Is what is sensed a good omen Who is there that knows what a good omen isSo Then a man who held the seen to be the good omen said  I know the good omen The seen is the good omen in the world For the visible form reputed as the best omen is seenFor example here someone having risen early sees a talking bird or a bilva sapling or a pregnant woman or children decked out in finery or full offering dishes or a fresh red mullet or a thoroughbred or a chariot with thoroughbreds or a bull or a cow or a brown ox or else he sees some other such visible form reputed to be the best omen This is what is called the good omen as the seen Some accepted his statementand some did notThose who did not disputed with himThen a man who held the heard to be the good omen said  Sirs the eye sees both what is clean and what is unclean likewise what is fair and what is ugly agreeable and disagreeableIf the seen were the good omen it would all be the good omenhere someone having risen early hears the name Vaddha or  Vaddhamna or Punna or Phussa or Sumana  or  Siri  or  Sirivaddha  pronounced or elsethe words  today is a good star conjunction  or a good period or  a good day  or  a good omen  or else he hears some such sound reputed to be the best omen This is what is called the good omen as the heard Some accepted his statement too and some did notThose who did not disputed with himThen a man who held the sensed to be the good omen said  Sirs the ear hears what is good and what is bad agreeable and disagreeableIf the heard were the good omen it would all be the good omenFor example here someone having risen early smells such a flower scent as lotus scent or chews a fine toothstick or he touches earth or touches green crops or fresh cowdung or a tortoise or a basket of sesamum or a flower or a fruit or does plastering with fine clay or clothes himself in fine cloth or wears a fine turbanSome accepted his statement too and some did notHerein he who held the seen to be the good omen could not get the man who held the heard to be the good omen to perceive as he did  nor could anyone of them get the other two to perceive as he didWith that those who accepted the statement of him who held the seen to be the good omen went away saying  Only the seen is the good omen while those who accepted the statement of him who held the heard to be the good omen and that of him who held the sensed to be the good omen went away saying respectively  Only the heard is the good omen   Only the sensed is the good omen So this talk of good omens became the fashion throughout all IndiaAnd throughout all India men in factions speculated about good omens  What is a good omenGuardian deities of human beings heard the talk and likewise took to speculating about good omensThen there were earth deities who were friends of these When they heard about it from them these earth deities also took to speculating about good omens Then there were space deities who were friends of these    and deities of the Realm of the Four Kings    and so on in this way up as far as    Then there were Akanittha Deities who were friends of the Sudassi Deities in the world of High Divinity When they heard about it from them these Akanittha Deities took to speculating in factions about good omensIn this way speculation about good omens spread throughout ten thousand worldsystemsand after it had spread notwithstanding that it kept on being defined  The good omen is this the good omen is this twelve years went by and still there was no agreed definitionExcept for noble disciples of the Blessed One all men and gods and High Divinities became divided into three factions according to the seen the heard and the sensedno single one of whom had come to a conclusion  Only this is the good omen  that tallied with what actually is the fact and so it was that the  Goodomen Tumult arose in the worldNow there are five kinds of tumult an aeon tumult a Wheelturner tumult an Enlightenedone tumult a goodomen tumult and a stillness tumultHerein sensualsphere deities with their heads bared and theirhair dishevelled with piteous faces mopping their tears with their hands clothed in dyed cloth and wearing their dress in great disorder travel up and down the haunts of men making the announcement At the end of a hundred thousand years there will be the emergence of an aeon This world will be destroyed Even the ocean will dry up This Great Earth and Sineru King of Mountains will be consumed and annihilated The destruction ofthe earth will extend as far as the World of High Divinity Maintain lovingkindness in being good sirs maintain compassion gladness maintain onlookingequanimity in being good sirs care for your mothers care for your fathers honour the elders of your clans be wakeful do not be negligentThis is called an aeon tumultSensualsphere deities too travel up and down the haunts of men making the announcement At the end of a hundred years a Wheelturning King will arise in the worldThis is called a Wheelturner tumultPureabode deities put on divine ornaments make divine turbans on their heads and full of happiness and joy they travel up and down the haunts of men making the announcement  At the end of a thousand years an Enlightened One will arise in the worldThis is called an Enlightenedone tumultPureabode deities too knowing gods and mens minds travel up and down the haunts of men making the announcement At the end of twelve years the Fully Enlightened One will explain the Good OmensThis is called a GoodOmen TumultPureabode deities too travel up and down the haunts of men making the announcement  At the end of seven years a certain bhikkhu will meet with the Blessed One and question him about the practice of StillnessThis is called the stillness tumultAmong these five kinds of tumult it was the goodomen tumult that arose in the world among gods and men who had become divided into three factions over the seen good omen and the restThen after repeated investigation amongst gods and men without finding what the good omen was at last at the end of twelve years the deities belonging to the Body of the Thirtythree met and foregathered and they took counsel together thus  Good sirs just as the owner of a house for the inmates of the house as the owner of a village for the villagers as the king for all men so too this Sakka Ruler of Gods is for us our head and chief that is to say by dint of merit by lordship and understanding he is master ofthe two worlds of gods of the Four Kings and of the Thirtythree So surely we ought to ask Sakka Ruler of Gods about this matterAccordingly they went to Sakkas presence and after paying homage to Sakka Ruler of Gods who with his figure resplendent with raiment and regalia befitting the occasion and surrounded by abevy of two and a half myriads of nymphs was seated on the Red Marble Throne at the root of the Pricchattaka Tree they stood atone side and they told him  Good sir please to know that a question about good omens has now arisen Some say that the seen is the good omen some say that it is the heard and some say that it is the sensed We and others too have come to no conclusion It would be good if you would pronounce a verdictNow though the Gods King has native understanding still he asked  Where did this talk of good omens first originateThey replied  Sire we heard it from the gods of the Four Kings Realm Then those of the Four Kings Realm said From the space deities and the spacedeities said  From the earth deities and the earth deities said From human beings guardian deities and the human beings guardian deities said  It originated in the human worldThen the Ruler of Gods asked Where is the Fully Enlightened One livingThey replied In the human world sire Has anyone asked that Blessed One No one sireHow then good sirs would you forget the fire and kindle a glowworm to light you that you overlook that Blessed One teacher of good omens without remainderand conceive that I should be asked Come good sirs let us ask that Blessed One then we shall surely obtain a splendid answer Then he commanded a gods son  Do you ask that Blessed OneSo that gods son decorated himself with ornaments to suit the occasion and then flaring like a lightning flash and surrounded by a group of gods he went to the great monastery of Jetas Wood and after paying homage to the Blessed One he stood at one side Then putting the question about the good omen he uttered the verse  Gods and men there are full many    Therefore the seen is not the good omen On the contrary the heard is the good omenFor the sound reputed as the best omen is heardFor exampleTherefore the heard is not the good omen On the contrary the sensed is the good omenFor the odour flavour and tangible reputed as the best omen is sensedor else he smells some such odour tastes some such flavour touches some such tangible reputed to be the best omen This is called the good omen as the sensed THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Mithila in the Makhadeva Mango GroveIt occurred to the venerable Ananda What is the reason what is the cause for the Blessed Ones smileTathagatas do not smile for no reasonSo he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder and extending his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One he asked him Venerable sir what is the reason what is the cause for the Blessed Ones smileTathagatas do not smile for no reasonOnce Ananda in this same Mithila there was a king named Makhadeva He was a righteous king who ruled by the Dhamma a great king who was established in the Dhamma He conducted himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders among towndwellers and countryfolk and he observed the Uposatha days on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight Yes sire he repliedAnd after many years many hundred years many thousand years the barber saw grey hairs growing on King Makhadevas head Then good barber pull out those grey hairs carefully with tweezers and put them in my palm Yes sire he replied and he pulled out those grey hairs carefully with tweezers and put them in the kings palmThen King Makhadeva gave the best township to his barber and calling the prince his eldest son he said Dear prince the divine messengers have appeared grey hairs are seen growing on my head I have enjoyed human sensual pleasures now it is time to seek divine sensual pleasuresCome dear prince take over the kingshipI shall shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessnessAnd now dear prince when you too see grey hairs growing on your head then after giving the best township to your barber and after carefully instructing the prince your eldest son in kingship shave off your hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessnessContinue this good practice instituted by me and do not be the last manDear prince when there are two men living he under whom there occurs a breach of this good practice  he is the last man among themTherefore dear prince I say to you Continue this good practice instituted by me and do not be the last manThen after giving the best township to his barber and after carefully instructing the prince his eldest son in kingship in the Makhadeva Mango Grove he shaved off his hair and beard put on the yellow robe and went forth from the home life into homelessnessHe abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abided pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with lovingkindness abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill willHe abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassionwith a mind imbued with appreciative joywith a mind imbued with equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abided pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with equanimity abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill willFor eightyfour thousand years King Makhadeva played childish games for eightyfour thousand years he acted as viceregent for eightyfour thousand years he governed the kingdom for eightyfour thousand years he led the holy life in this Makhadeva Mango Grove after shaving off his hair and beard putting on the yellow robe and going forth from the home life into homelessnessBy developing the four divine abodes on the dissolution of the body after death he passed on to the BrahmaworldNow at the end of many years many hundred years many thousand years King Makhadevas son addressed his barber thusThe descendants of King Makhadevas son to the number of eightyfour thousand kings in succession after shaving off their hair and beard and putting on the yellow robe went forth from the home life into homelessness in this Makhadeva Mango Grovewith compassionwith appreciative joywith equanimitywithout ill willFor eightyfour thousand years they played childish games for eightyfour thousand years they acted as vice regents for eightyfour thousand years they governed the kingdom for eightyfour thousand years they led the holy life in this Makhadeva Mango Grove after shaving off their hair and beard putting on the yellow robe and going forth from the home life into homelessnessBy developing the four divine abodes on the dissolution of the body after death they passed on to the BrahmaworldNimi was the last of those kings He was a righteous king who ruled by the Dhamma a great king who was established in the Dhamma He conducted himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders among towndwellers and country folk and he observed the Uposatha days on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnightOnce Ananda when the gods of the Thirtythree had met together and were seated in the Sudhamma Assembly this discussion arose among them It is a gain sirs for the people of Videha it is a great gain for the people of Videha that their King Nimi is a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma a great king who is established in the Dhamma He conducts himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders among town dwellers and countryfolk and he observes the Uposatha days on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnightThen Sakka ruler of gods addressed the gods of the Thirty three Good sirs do you want to see King Nimi Good sir we want to see King NimiNow on that occasion it being the Uposatha day of the fifteenth King Nimi had washed his head and ascended to the upper palace chamber where he was seated for the Uposatha observanceThen just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm Sakka ruler of gods vanished among the gods of the Thirtythree and appeared in the presence of King NimiHe said It is a gain for you great king it is a great gain for you great kingWhen the gods of the Thirtythree had met together and were seated in the Sudhamma Assembly this discussion arose among them It is a gain sirs for the people of Videhaeighth of the fortnightGreat king the gods want to see youI shall send a chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds for you great king Great king mount the divine chariot without misgivingKing Nimi consented in silenceThen just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm Sakka ruler of gods vanished in the presence of King Nimi and appeared among the gods of the ThirtythreeThen Sakka ruler of gods addressed the charioteer Matali thus Come good Matali prepare a chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds and go to King Nimi and say Great king this chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds has been sent for you by Sakka ruler of gods Great king mount the divine chariot without misgivingMay your words be held sacred the charioteer Matali replied And having prepared a chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds he went to King Nimi and said Great king this chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds has been sent for you by Sakka ruler of gods Great king mount the divine chariot without misgivingBut great king by which route shall I drive you by that on which doers of evil experience the results of evil actions or by that on which doers of good experience the results of good actions Drive me by both routes MataliMatali brought King Nimi to the Sudhamma AssemblySakka ruler of gods saw King Nimi coming in the distanceWelcome great kingThe gods of the Thirtythree great king seated in the Sudhamma Assembly have expressed themselves thus It is a gain sirs for the people of Videhaeighth of the fortnightGreat king the gods of the Thirtythree want to see youGreat king enjoy divine might among the godsEnough good sir Let the charioteer drive me back to MithilaThere I will conduct myself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders among towndwellers and country folk there I will observe the Uposatha days on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnightThen Sakka ruler of gods told the charioteer Matali Come good Matali prepare the chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds and drive King Nimi back to MithilaMay your word be held sacred the charioteer Matali replied And having prepared the chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds he drove King Nimi back to MithilaAnd there indeed King Nimi conducted himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders among towndwellers and countryfolk and there he observed the Uposatha days on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnightThen at the end of many years many hundred years many thousand years King Nimi addressed his barber thus Now King Nimi had a son named KalarajanakaHe did not go forth from the home life into homelessnessHe broke that good practiceHe was the last man among themNow Ananda it may be that you think thus Certainly someone else was King Makhadeva on that occasionBut it should not be regarded thusI was King Makhadeva on that occasion I instituted that good practice and later generations continued that good practice instituted by meBut that kind of good practice does not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana but only to reappearance in the BrahmaworldBut there is this kind of good practice that has been instituted by me now which leads to complete disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to NibbanaAnd what is that good practiceIt is this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationThis is the good practice instituted by me now which leads to complete disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to NibbanaAnanda I say to you continue this good practice instituted by me and do not be the last manAnanda when there are two men living he under whom there occurs a breach of this good practice  he is the last man among themTherefore Ananda I say to you continue this good practice instituted by me and do not be the last manThat is what the Blessed One saidThe venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThen in a certain place the Blessed One smiledThere are full many is a demonstrative of an indefinite number hence what is meant is several hundreds several thousandsThey sport  thus they are gods  the meaning isthey play with the five strands of sensual desires or they glitter with their own splendourMoreover as to the word deva it is threefold as convention rebirth and purificationaccording as it is said God   there are three kinds of gods namely gods by convention gods by rebirth and gods by purificationKings queens and princes are called  gods by convention the gods of the Four Kings Realm or the gods higher than that are called Gods by rebirth and the Arahants are called gods by purification  Among these it is the gods by rebirth that are intended hereMen  they are the offspring of Manu  thus they are men though the Ancients say  They are men because of prominence of mind They are of four kinds as belonging to the four great continents of Jambudipa in the South Aparagoyna in the West Uttarakuru in the North and Pubbavideha in the East Here those of Jambudipa are intendedCreatures fall in with weal by means of these  thus they are good omens  the meaning is that they reach success and incrementSpeculating on acintayumcintesum  Which they hope will bring them  which they want aspire to long forSafety is a safe state  what is meant is  Hoping to assure the existence  here and now and in lives to come of all such ideas as are creditable  admirable and good Tell then  teach clarify announce reveal expound explainThe good omen  the reason for success reason for prosperity reason for all excellenceSupreme distinguished lofty which brings welfare and pleasure to all the worldOut of desire to hear about the Goodomen Question deities belonging to ten thousand worldsystems had met together in this worldsystem and had each created for himself a selfhood so subtle that ten twenty thirty forty fifty sixty seventy even eighty could stand together on an area no bigger than the pointof a single hairs tip and so they stood round the Blessed One who was sitting on the Enlightened Ones throne prepared for him outshining in his splendour and lustre all the gods the Mras and the High Divinities so since this gods son saw this and since he knew with his mind even the thoughts in the minds of all the human beings in the whole of Jambudipas land who had been unable to come on that occasion then in order to draw out from all be it gods or men the dart of uncertainty he uttered these wordsGods and men there are full many Speculating on good omensWhich they hope will bring them safety wanting each his own safety Tell then the supreme good omenbeing questioned by me with the consent of these gods and for the sake of aiding men tell us out of pity Blessed One what omen is supreme for all of us by its bringing pure welfare and pleasureHerein not consorting is not frequenting not reverencingWith the foolish  they are strong they breathe  thus they are fools  the intention is that they live with mere inbreath and outbreath instead of with the life of understanding With that sort of foolish menRather with the wise  they pick their way  thus they are wise  the intention is that they go with the gait of knowledge of benefits here and now and in the life to comeWith that sort of wise menConsorting frequenting reverencing them companionship intimacywith them Honouring  worshipping respecting revering paying homageThe honourable  those worthy of honourThis is a supreme good omen  he said This is a supreme good omen  referring collectively to all that he had just mentioned namely the nonconsorting with fools the consorting with the wise and the honouring of the honourablewhat is meant is  Since you have asked  What is the supreme good omen  take it that in the first place this is a supreme good omenThis is the wordcommentary to this stanzaThe commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows The Blessed One spoke this stanza after hearing these words of the gods sons thusHerein there are four kinds of talk talk asked for talk unasked for talk with sequence of meaning and talk without sequence of meaningHerein in such passages as O Gotama of abundant understanding How act disciples to be good I ask  and such passages as Good sir how did you come to cross the flood  what is spoken by him thus questioned is  talk asked for  In such passages as  That which others count as pleasure Noble Ones will count as pain what is spoken by one without first being questioned and inspired by ones own inclination is  talk unasked for Because of the words Bhikkhus I teach the True Idea with sources  all Enlightened Ones talk is  talk with sequence of meaning In this Dispensation there is no  talk without sequence of meaning So out of these four kinds of talk this is  talk asked for  becauseit was spoken by the Blessed One when asked by this gods sonAnd in the case of talk asked for just as when a clever man who isskilled in what is the path and skilled in what is not the path is asked the path then after first telling what should be avoided heafterwards tells what should be taken saying There is a roadfork in that place there leave the left and take the right  so too with respect to what should and what should not be consortedwith what should be consorted with can be told after telling what should not be consorted withAnd the Blessed One is like the man skilled in the pathaccording as it is said  The man skilledin the path this Tissa is a designation for a Perfect One accomplished and fully enlightened  for he is  Skilled in this world skilled in the other world skilled in what is the sphere of mortality skilled in what is not the sphere of mortality skilled in what is Mras sphere skilled in what is not Mras sphere That is why telling first what should not be consorted with he said Not consorting with the foolish Rather with wise men consorting since to start with fools should not be consorted with should not be reverenced like the path to be abandoned and next the wise should be consorted with should be reverenced like the road to be takenIf it is asked  But why were the nonconsorting with foolsand the consorting with the wise mentioned first by the Blessed One when speaking about the good omenIt may be stated as follows It was through consorting with fools that gods and men took up the view of good omens that assumed the good omen to be the seen etc  and that is no good omen That is why the Blessed One spoke first of nonconsorting with fools and consorting with the wise thus condemning association with those who are not good friends which is injurious to good in both this world and the next and commending association with good friends which ensures good in both worldsHerein the foolish are any creatures who follow out the unprofitable courses of action beginning with killing breathing things and they can be recognized in three aspectsaccording as it is said in the Suttas Bhikkhus there are three characteristics of the fool Furthermore the six dissident teachers beginning with Prana Kassapa  then Devadatta andhis followers namely Koklika KatamorakaTissa Khanddeviyputta and Samuddadatta  and also Cincamnavik  etc and in bygone times Dighavidas brother and other such creatures as these should be understood as foolsThey are like a smouldering ember with their misapprehension they ruin both themselves and those who give effect to their wordsAnd so it is that Dighavidas brother has been lying prone where he fell in the Great Hell ripening out his evil actions for four Buddhaintervals with a selfhood  leagues inextent And so it is that five hundred clans who confessed his view were reborn as his retinue to ripen out their evil actions in the Great HellAnd this is saidBhikkhus just as a fire that starts in a rush shed or a grass shed burns down even an upper chamber plastered within and without closed off secured by bars with windows shuttered so too whatever fears arise all arise owing to fools not owing to wise menWhatever perils arise Whatever calamities arise all arise owing to fools not owing to wise menWhile the fool brings fear the wise man does notWhile the fool brings peril the wise man does not While the fool brings calamitythe wise man does not Moreover a fool resembles stale fish and one who consorts with him resembles a leafbag in which stale fish has been wrapped and so becomes fit only for wise mens rejection and disgustAnd this is said Now when a man ties up with blades Of kusa grass some fetid fishThe blades of grass get fetid too Such is consorting with a fool And when the boon was being granted by Sakka Ruler of Gods Akittipandita saidLet me not see or hear a fool Let me not live where lives a foolLet me not choose to have to do In verbal traffic with a foolWhat has a fool then done by you Kassapa teil what is the causeWhy you have preference so great That never fool may cross your sightHe leads halfwittedly to loss And counsels irresponsiblyPrefers misjudgment and if told What is correct shows restiveness Nothing he knows of discipline Tis good to have no sight of him  When the Blessed One had said that nonconsorting with fools is a good omen thus condemning consorting with fools in every aspect he now said that consorting with the wise is a good omen aswell commending consorting with the wiseHerein the wise are any creatures who follow out the ten profitable courses of action beginning with abstention from killing breathing things and they can be recognized in three aspectsFurthermore the Enlightened Ones and Hermit Enlightened Ones the eighty Great Disciples and the other disciples of Perfect Ones such as SunettaMah Govinda Vidhura Sarabhanga Mahosadha SutasomaKing Nimi Prince Ayoghara and Akittipanclita should be understood as wise menThey are as capable of eliminating all fear risk and calamity for those who give effect to their words as are protection in a rebellion a lamp in darkness food and drink and so on ina state of being overcome by pain of hunger and thirst and so onFor innumerable indeed and not to be measured are the gods and men who after coming to the Perfect One have attained exhaustion of taints or become established in the world of High Divinity  or become established in the world of sensualsphere gods or been reborn in the world of the happy destinations as human beingsEighty thousand clans were reborn in heaven after gaining confidence in the Elder Sariputta and serving him with the four requisiteconditions for the bhikkhus life and likewise all the other great disciples Mah Moggallna Mah Kassapa and so on Some of the teacher Sunettas disciples reappeared in the world of High Divinitysome in the sensualsphere world in the company of the Paranimmitavasavatti Gods  some in the company of the householder clans of the great hallsAnd this is saidBhikkhus it is not owing to a wise man that there is fear it is not owing to a wise man that thereis peril it is not owing to a wise man that there is calamity Moreover a wise man resembles such scented goods as tagara flowers and one who consorts with him resembles a leaf in which tagara flowers have been wrapped and he becomes fitf or wise mens cultivation and approvalAnd this is saidNow when in foliage a man Ties up some tagara incenseThe leaves will of the scent partake Such is consorting with the wise  And when the boon was being granted by Sakka Ruler of Gods Akittipanota saidOh let me see and hear wise men Oh let me live where live wise menOh let me choose to have to do In verbal traffic with the wise What have the wise then done for you Kassapa teil what is the causeWhy you have preference so great That wise men always cross your sight They lead wisewittedly to gain Counsel not irresponsiblyPrefer good judgment and if told What is correct show docileness And discipline they understand Tis good to have to do with them  When the Blessed One had said that consorting with wise men is a good omen thus commending consorting with wise men in every aspect he now said that honouring the honourable is a good omen commending the act of honouring to those who have through nonconsorting with fools and consorting with wise men approachedthe honourableHerein the Enlightened Ones the Blessed Ones are honourable because they are devoid of all vices and possessed of all virtuesNext after them the Hermit Enlightened Ones and the Noble Disciples for the honouring of them even if itis little conduces for long to welfare and pleasureThe examples here are Sumana the garlandmaker Mallik and so onHereinwe shall relate one example One day it seems when it was morning the Blessed One dressedand taking his bowl and outer robe went into Rjagaha for almsSumana the garlandmaker was on his way to the king of Magadha with some flowers He saw the Blessed One who inspired confidence invited confidence as gleaming with a Buddhas splendour he was coming to the city gate When he saw him he thought The king might pay me a hundred or a thousand for these flowers but that would only be pleasure of this world On the other handhonour done to the Blessed One is immeasurable its fruit is incalculable and for long brings welfare and pleasure So I shall honour the Blessed One with these flowers And with confident heart hetook a handful of flowers and threw them in the Blessed Ones direction The flowers travelled through the air and remained suspended over the Blessed One in the form of a flower canopySeeing this mighty wonder he became still more confident in his heart and again he threw a handful They travelled as before and remained suspended in the form of a flower curtainIn that way he threw eight handfuls They travelled as before and remained suspended in the form of a flower palanquinthe Blessed One being inside the palanquin A huge body of people gatheredSeeing the garlandmaker the Blessed One manifested a smileThe Elder nanda thought Buddhas do not manifest a smile without cause or condition and he asked the reasonThe Blessed One said nanda through the might of this honouring this garlandmaker will after traversing the round for a hundred thousand aeons among gods and men at last become a Hermit Enlightened Onecalled Sumanissara and at the end of his utterance he pronounced this stanza for the purpose of inculcating the True IdeaGood is the act that when performed Entails no burning of remorseTo reap whose ripening a man Is overjoyed and glad at heart And at the end of the stanza eightyfour thousand breathing things attained the True IdeaThat is how it should be understood that the honouring of them even if it is little conduces for long to welfare and pleasureAnd that was an honouring with only material things so what need besaid of honouring with practiceConsequently when clansmen do honour to the Blessed One by the Going for Refuge the acceptance of the Training Precepts and the giving effect to the Uposatha Factors and by their own special qualities beginning with the Virtue of the Fourfold Purity who can estimate the fruits of their honouringFor they are said to honour a Perfect One with thehighest honouraccording as it is said nanda the bhikkhu or bhikkhuni or layman follower or laywoman follower who abides inthe way of practice in accordance with the True Idea and has entered upon the proper way behaving in accordance with the True Idea he it is that worships respects and reveres a Perfect One and honours him with the highest honour And the bringing of welfare and pleasure by honouring Hermit Enlightened Ones and Enlightened Ones disciples should be understood in the same wayMoreover in the case of laymen it should be understood that elder brothers and sisters are to be honoured by a junior mother and father by a son and husband motherinlaw and fatherinlaw by the daughtersinlaw of a clanFor in their case the honouring is a good omen too because it is their profitable ideas that are called  honouring and because these are a cause of increase in lifespan and the restfor this is said Those who love mothers love fathers love monks love divines and are deferential to seniors of clans proceed in giving effect to this profitable idea Because of their giving effect to profitable ideas they find increase inlifespan and in good appearance  Defining We show lastly how it is so it was stated in the Schedule  what still needs to be said can be stated as follows There are in fact three good omens mentioned in this stanza namely nonconsorting with fools consorting with the wise and honouring the honourableHerein nonconsorting with fools should be understood as a good omen because it is a cause for welfare in both worlds by its safeguarding people from the fears that have for their condition consorting with fools Then consorting with the wise and honouring the honourable should be understood as good omens because they area cause for extinction and for the happy destinations in the way stated in the explanation of the greatness of their fruitBut in what follows we shall in each instance define the good omen and explain how it isa good omen without referring to the ScheduleThe commentary on the meaning of this stanza Not consorting with the foolish  is endedaccording as it is said in the Suttas  Bhikkhus there are these three characteristics of the wise man Now although the Blessed One had been begged for little with the single request  Tell then the supreme good omen still like the rare man who is a generous giver notwithstanding that he had already stated three good omens in a single stanza he began again to speak of many good omens with the stanzas beginning Living in befitting places doing so owing to deities desire to hear more than that owing to the existence of yet further good omens and owing to his own desire to enjoin upon the various creatures the good omens best suited to them wherever they might beHerein in the third stanza to start with befitting means favourablePlaces  village town city countryand in fact any locality inhabited by creaturesLiving  living thereIn the past  before in previous birthsHaving    made merit  having stored up profitable actionSelf is what cognizance is called or else it is the whole selfhood Right direction in    guidance  right directing of that self prompting placing is what is meantThe rest is as already statedThis is the wordcommentary hereThe commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows What is called living in befitting places is living where the four kinds of assembly are found where the grounds for making merit beginning with giving exist  and where the Masters Dispensation with its nine factors is in evidence Living there is called a good omen because it is a condition for creatures making meritAn example here is the story of the fisherman who entered the Island of Ceylon  and so on Another method the place which is the site of the Blessed Ones enlightenment is called a befitting place and likewise the place where the Wheel of the True Idea was set rolling and the place at the root of the Ganda Mango Tree where the Twin Marvel was shown in the midst of an assembly twelve leagues across disrupting the theories of all outside sectarians the place of the Descent from the Gods or any other place inhabited by the Enlightened One such as Svatthi Rjagaha and so on Living there is called a good omen because it is a condition for creatures obtaining the six Unsurpassables Another method  In the eastern direction the town called Kajangala on the far side of that Mahsl beyond that the outland countries to the near side is in the middleIn the southeastern direction the river called SalalavatI beyond that the outland countries to the near side is in the middleIn the southern direction the town called Setakannika beyond that the outland countries to the near side of that is in the middleIn the western direction a Divinecaste village called Thna beyond that the outland countries to the near side is in the middleIn the northern direction a rock called Usiraddhaja beyond that the outland countries to the near side is in the middle  This Middle Place is three hundred leagues wide and two hundred and fifty broad and nine hundred in circumferenceHere the Wheelturning Monarchs who exercise sovereignty and dominance over the four great continents and the two thousand small islands arise And here after fulfilling the Perfections during one incalculable age and a hundred thousand aeons the Great Disciples Sriputta Moggallna and the others arise And here after fulfilling the Perfections for two incalculable ages and a hundred thousand aeons the Hermit Enlightened Ones arise And here after fulfilling the Perfections for four eight or sixteen incalculable ages and a hundred thousand aeons the Fully Enlightened Ones ariseHerein by following the advice of a Wheelturning Monarch and establishing themselves in the five virtues creatures become destined for heavenLikewise by following the advice of Hermit Enlightened Ones But by following the advice of a Fully Enlightened One or that of his disciple they become destined for heaven and destined for extinction That is why living there is called a good omen since it is a condition for these lands of excellenceThe fact of having in past births stored up profitable action contingent upon honouring Enlightened Ones Hermit Enlightened Ones and those with taints exhausted is called having in the past made merit  That is a good omen tooWhyBecause after seeing an Enlightened One or a Hermit Enlightened One facetoface or after hearing even a fourline stanza in the presence of an Enlightened One or his disciple Arahantship can be reached in the endAnd when a human being has had previous practice so that the root of what is profitable is prominent in him  then by means of that same root of what is profitable he arouses insight and so reaches the exhaustion of taints like King Mah Kappina and his chief queen That is why it is said that having in the past made merit is a good omenRight direction in selfguidance is stated thus  Here someone that was unvirtuous establishes himself in virtue that was faithless establishes himself in the excellence of faith that was avaricious establishes himself in the excellence of generosityThis is called  right direction in selfguidance   That also is a good omenWhyBecause it is a cause for attaining the numerous benefits both here and now and inthe life to come that are due to the abandoning of riskSo in this stanza there are also three good omens stated with living in befitting places having in the past made merit and right direction in selfguidanceThe commentary on the meaning of this stanza namely Living in befitting places  is endedThis is called a befitting placeand how they are good omens has already been made clear in each instanceNow as to Ample learning  here ample learning means the state of having heard much A craft is any handskillA   disciplining  disciplining of body speech and mindWelltrained  properly trainedWell spoken  properly spokenAny  an indefinite demonstrativeSpeech  utterance pronouncementThe rest is as already statedThis is the wordcommentary hereThe commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows The phrase ample learning is commented on as remembering the Masters Dispensation in the way beginning Remembers what he has heard and consolidates what he has heard  and Here someone has heard much  Threads of Argument  Songs  Expositions      That is called a good omen since it is a cause for abandoning what is unprofitable and achieving what is profitable and since it is a cause for gradually realizing the ultimate meaning And this is said by the Blessed One Bhikkhus a welltaught noble disciple abandons what is unprofitable and maintains in being what is profitable he abandons what is blamable and maintains in being what is blameless he keeps himself pure and it is said furtherHe investigates the meaning of ideas remembered When he investigates the meaning of ideas remembered he gets a liking for meditation upon ideas With the liking for meditating upon ideas zeal springs up One in whom zeal has sprung up is actively engaged Through being actively engaged he makes judgments When he has made a judgment he makes an endeavourtocontrol When he makes an endeavourtocontrol he realizes with the body the ultimate truth and he sees it by penetration of it with understanding Furthermore any ample learning concerned with the house life should be understood as a good omen if blameless since that too leads to welfare and pleasure in both worldsAs far as concerns the word craft  there is craft in house life and craft in homelessnessHerein craft in house life consists in such work as that of a jeweller or goldsmith which is far from what is morally unprofitable since it is devoid of injury of other breathing things and it is a good omen since it conduces to wellbeing in this worldCraft in homelessness consists in work on the monks requisites such as the layingout and sewing of robes etc which is given in detail here and there in the way beginning Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu is clever in any great or little task for his companions in the Divine Life  of which it is said  This is a helpful idea   That too should be understood as a good omen since it brings welfare and pleasure in both worlds alike to oneself and to othersAs far as concerns disciplining there is firstly disciplining in the house life which is the abstaining from the ten courses of unprofitable action When that is well trained in by not offending through defilement and by defining the special qualities of virtuous conduct it is a good omen since it brings welfare and pleasure in both worldsThen there is disciplining in the homeless state which is nonoffence under the seven categories of offences it is well trained in in the way already stated Or else disciplining in the homeless state is the Virtue of the Fourfold Purity  When that is well trained in by such a training that one established in it reaches Arahantship it should be understood as a good omen since itis a cause for attaining both mundane and supramundane pleasureAny speech that is well spoken should be understood as speech devoid of the defects of lying harsh speechmalicious speech and gossipaccording as it is said  Bhikkhus when speech possesses four factors it is well spoken  Or else speech simply without gossip is  well spokenaccording as it is saidNow those At Peace say First wellspokennessSecond speak but the True Idea naught elseAnd third speak only kindly not unkindlyAnd fourth speak only truth and nothing false  This should be understood as a good omen since it brings welfare and pleasure in both worldsNow this wellspokenness is normally included in disciplining nevertheless since it isseparately mentioned in this stanza  disciplining  should be taken to exclude it hereHowever why all this trouble What is to be understood here as  wellspokenness is the words used in teaching the True Idea to othersfor that like  living in befitting places is called a good omen since it is a condition for creatures to attain welfare and pleasure in both worlds and also extinction as wellAnd this is said tooThe speech where with a Buddha tells How safely to attain extinctionAnd make an end of suffering Of all kinds this is surely first So in this stanza there are four good omens stated with ample learning a craft welltrained disciplining and wellspoken speechThe commentary on the stanza  Ample learning is endedHow they are good omens has already been made clear in each instanceAid is the act of aiding Spheres of work are simply work The rest is as already stated This is the wordcommentaryThe commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows A mother is a parent and so is a father Aid is the furnishing of assistance by provision of the four requisiteconditions for life together with washing of feet rubbinganointing and bathingHerein the mother and father are very helpful to children desiring their welfare and sympathizing with them so that when they see their little children who have been playing outside come in with their bodies covered with dirt they show their affection by cleaning off the dirt stroking their heads and kissing them all over And children can never repay a mother and father for that even were they to carry them about on their heads for a hundred years And then since they as educators and providers and instructors about this world stand as it were in the place of the High Divinity and are reckoned as equal to the Former Teachers aid provided for them brings commendation here in this life and heavenly pleasure after deathAnd this is said by the Blessed One Parents may indeed be called Divinities and Former TeachersThey merit childrens sacrifice For sympathizing with their offspringFor that a wise man venerates And worships them he makes provisionWith what they need for food and drink With clothing and with bed as wellWith care in bathing and anointing With washing of their feet besides For such behaviour towards His mother and his father thusThe wise commend him here and when He dies he goes to heavenly bliss  Another method aid is of five kinds namely sustenance performance of tasks maintenance of the clans traditions etc and that should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for the five kinds of welfare here and now beginning with protection from evilAnd this is said by the Blessed One Householders son mother and father as the eastern direction can be aided in five instances by a son  I who was given sustenance by them shall sustain them I shall perform their tasks for them I shall maintain the traditions of their clan I shall keep up their inheritance and in addition I shall make continual offerings for them when they have passed on and completed their time When mother and fatheras the eastern direction are aided by a son in these five instances they are sympathetic with their son in five instances they protect him from evil they encourage him to do good they have him trained in a craft they have him joined to a suitable wife and when it is the occasion they hand over their inheritance to him Furthermore he who aids his mother and father by arousing in them confidence in the three Objects of faithin the Enlightened One the True Idea and the Community by getting them to give effect to virtue or by the Going Forth is the foremost of those who aid their parentsFor wife and children  here both sons and daughters born of oneself come to be counted as  children   wife  is any one of the twenty kinds of female spouseSupport is the giving of help by cherishing etcand that should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for the welfare and pleasure here and now consisting in wellordered work and so onAnd this is said by the Blessed One  Wife and children can be understood as the western direction  and the wife and children cited here are included by the words  female spouse  in the following passage  Householders son a female spouse as the western direction can be aided in return by a husband in five instances by cherishing by nondespising by nonbetrayal by relinquishing authority and by giving presents of ornamentsWhen a female spouse as the western direction is aided in return by a husband in these five instances she is sympathetic with her husband in five instances she is wellordered in her work her retainers are properly supported she does not betray her husband she preserves what has been earned and she is clever and industrious in all tasks  Still another method Support is the act of supporting with gifts kind words and helpful behaviour that are lawfulfor example giving pocketmoney on Uposatha days allowing the seeing of festivals on festival days ensuring good omens on omen days and advice and instruction about aims here and now and in life to comeThat should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for welfare here and now in the way already stated since it is a cause for welfare in life to come owing to its being in accordance with the True Idea and since it is a cause for veneration by deitiesaccording as Sakka Ruler of Gods has said The meritmaking householders The virtuous layfollowersWho lawfully support their wives I venerate them Mtali The spheres of work that are said to bring no conflict are such spheres of work as agriculture  cattlekeeping commerce etc which owing to their promoting punctuality seemly action industriousness excellence of energy in rising early and freedom from malpractices are devoid of any such unprofitableness as dilatoriness unseemly action inaction tardy action and the likeThese are called a good omen since when thus exercised either through ones own shrewdness or through that of ones wife and children or ones bonds men and servants they are a cause for the obtaining of increased riches here and nowAnd this is said by the Blessed One One seemly in his acts responsible Who rises early will augment his fortune   and Whose habit is to sleep by day And who is seen to rise by nightAnd constantly gets drunk with wine Is all unfit to keep a house  Too cold Too hot Too late  they sayAnd opportunities pass by The tyros who thus shirk the taskBut he that heeds no more than straws Both cold and heatdoing mens work Need never fail in happiness   and again So when a man saves up his wealth Emulating the honeybeeHis riches will accumulate Just as an anthill is built up   and so onSo in this stanza there are just the four good omens stated with aid for a mother aid for a father support for wife and children and spheres of work that bring no conflict But there are five by taking wife and child separately and there are only three if mother and father are taken togetherHow they are good omens has already been made clear in each instanceThe commentary in the meaning of this stanza  Aid for mother and for father is endedThat is why it is called a good omenNow that aid of his to his mother and father which is aid in return for aid given to him by his mother and father is a good omen since it is the footing for many benefits both here and now and in the life to comeNow as to  Giving by means of this one gives  thus it is a giving  what is meant is that what is with one self is transferred to anotherThe conduct of the True Idea or conduct not deviating from the True Idea is TrueIdea conduct These are known to us  thus they are kin Unexceptionable is that which is not to be taken exception to  unblamed uncensured is what is meantThe rest is as already stated This is the wordcommentaryThe commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows Giving is a term for the choice preceded by contentment consisting in giving up in someone elses favour one or other of the ten objects of giving beginning with food  or else it is the nongreed associated with that choicefor it is through nongreed that this object is transferred to another Hence it was said above By means of this one gives thus it is a givingThat is called a good omen since it is a cause for achieving the special fruits both here and now and in life to come consisting in dearness to many etcand here such Suttas as this can be recalled A giver Siha a master of giving is dear to many beloved of many  Another method Giving is of two kinds namely giving of material things and giving of the True Idea  Herein giving of material things is of the kind already statedbut giving of the True Idea is the teaching out of desire for others welfare of the True Idea proclaimed by the Enlightened One and that brings about the kind of pleasure that is due to the exhaustion of suffering both in this world and the other world Of these two kinds of giving this is the bestaccording as it is saidThe gift of the True Idea conquers all giftsThe taste of the True Idea conquers all tastesThe joy of the True Idea conquers all joysThe termination of craving conquers all pain  Herein it has only been stated how the giving of material things is a good omenBut the giving of the True Idea is called a good omen because it is the footing for such special qualities as the experiencing of the meaning for this is said by the Blessed One Bhikkhus in proportion as a bhikkhu teaches in detail the True Idea to others as he has heard and mastered it he accordingly comes to experience the meanings and experience the ideas in that True Idea   and so onTrueIdea conduct is conduct consisting in the ten profitable courses of actionaccording as it is said  Householders there are three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the True Idea fair conduct  and so onThat TrueIdea conduct should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for rebirth in the heavenly worldfor this is said by the Blessed One  Householders it is by reason of conduct in accordance with the True Idea by reason of fair conduct that creatures here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world  Kin are those who are connected as far as the seventh generation back on the mothers or the fathers sideSupport provided for them according to ones means with sustenance clothing corn etc when they come to one stricken by loss of property or loss through sickness is called a good omen since it is a cause for achieving the distinctions here and now consisting in commendation etc and for those in the life to come consisting in going to heaven and so onUnexceptionable actions are those such as giving effect to the Uposatha factors doing social services planting gardens and groves making bridges etcfor these are called a good omen since they are a cause for achieving many kinds of welfare and pleasureHere such Suttas as that which follows can be recalled It is possible Viskh that here some woman or man after observing the Observance Day with eight factors reappears on the dissolution of the body after death in the company of the gods of the Four Kings  So in this stanza there are four good omens stated with giving TrueIdeal conduct support for kin and unexceptionable actionsThe commentary on the meaning of this stanza  Giving is endedHow they are good omens has already been made clear in each instanceNow as to Shrinking abstinence  shrinking is the act of shrinking  Abstinence is the act of abstaining  or else creatures abstain by means of it thus it is abstinenceFrom evil  from what is unprofitableBesotting is in the sense of causing intoxication  Besotting drink  mayjapnarhmajjassa pnam  from that besotting drinkRefraining  the act of refraining  Diligence  act of being not negligent In True Ideals  in what is profitableThe rest is as already stated This is the word commentaryThe commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows Shrinking is only the mental nondelight in one who sees danger in evilAbstinence is his act of abstaining by body and speech in those two doors of action That abstinence is three fold namely abstinence as custom abstinence as undertaking  and abstinence as severance Herein any clansmans abstinence in virtue of his own birth or clan or race from a thing customarily abstained from thinking  It does not befit me that I should kill a breathing thing take what is not given etc is called  abstinence as customWhen it occurs by undertaking training rules it is abstinence as undertaking subsequent to the occurrence of which a clansman does not indulge in killing breathing things and the restThat associated with the Noble Path is  abstinence as severance  subsequent to the occurrence of which in a Noble Disciple the five fears and risks have been made to subside for himEvil is given in detail thus  Householders son killing breathing things is a defilement in action and so are taking what is not given misconduct in sensual desires and false speech   Killing breathing things and taking What has not been given lyingGoing with anothers wife These no wise man will commend  and is summed up in the following stanza thus  defilement in action called the  fourfold unprofitable From that kind of evilAnd such Suttas should be recalled here as this Householders son when a Noble Disciple abstains from killing breathing things     From besotting drink refraining  this designates abstention from any opportunity for negligence due to wine liquor and besotting drink which has already been described This refraining from besotting drink is called a good omen because one who drinks besotting drinks does not know either a meaning or an idea he illtreats his mother and his father and Enlightened Ones and Hermit Enlightened Ones and Perfect Ones disciples here and now he encounters censure in his next rebirth an unhappy destination and in the life after that madnessbut when a man refrains from besotting drink he achieves both immunity from those defects and excellence in those special qualities that are their oppositesSo that it should be understood is why it is called a good omenDiligence in profitable ideals  There is carelessness inattentiveness heedlessness hanging back unzealousness uninterestedness nonrepetition nonmaintenanceinbeing nondevelopment nonresolution nonapplication negligence concerning the maintenance of profitable ideas in beingThis diligence is called a good omen since it is a cause for achieving the various kinds of what is profitable and since it is a cause for reaching the DeathlessAnd the Masters message to be recalled here is that in such passages as follows  When a bhikkhu abides diligent ardent and selfcontrolled his     and  The way of deathlessness is diligence So in this stanza there are three good omens stated with abstinence from evil refraining from besotting drink and diligence in True IdealsThe commentary on the meaning of the stanza  Shrinkingabstinence  is endedAnd all this shrinking and abstinence is called a good omen since it is a cause for the achievement of various kinds of distinction consisting in abandoning fear and risk here and now and in the life to come and so onany such negligence neglecting neglectedness is called negligence it should be understood as the habit of never being without mindfulness of profitable ideas which as to meaning is the converse of the negligence stated as follows How they are good omens has already been made clear in each instanceNow as to  Then respect respect is respectfulness Humble manner is lowly mien Content is contentment The state of knowing what has been done is grateful bearingWhen it is timely  when it is the moment when it is the occasionHearing truth dhammasavanarhdhammassa savanam The rest is as already stated This is the wordcommentaryThe commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows Respect is the payment of respect  paying respect  respectfulness  accorded to Enlightened Ones Hermit Enlightened Ones Perfect Ones disciples teachers preceptors mothers fathers elder brothers and sisters etc who are the worthy means for the payment of respectAnd that respect is called a good omen since it is a cause for going to a happy destination etcaccording as it is said He pays respect to him to whom respect should be paid he reveres him that should be revered he honours him that should be honouredBy his adopting such actions and putting them into effect he reappears on the dissolution of the body after death in a happy destination in the heavenly worldIf on the dissolution of the body    instead of reappearing   in the heavenly world he comes to the human state then he is of a highborn clan wherever he is born  and according as it is said Bhikkhus there are these seven ideas that prevent declinewhat sevenRespectfulness to the teacher     and so onHumble manner is lowliness of the mind humility in manner The person possessing it has put away conceit put away arrogance and he resembles a footwiping cloth resembles a bull with amputated horns resembles a snake with extracted fangs and is gentle genial and easy to talk with Such is humble mannerThis is called a good omen since it is a cause of obtaining the special qualities of fame and so onAnd it is said that One humble and unobdurate Is such as will acquire good fame Content is contentment with the four requisite conditions whatever they are like  That is of twelve kindsThere are three kinds in the case of the robe namely contentment with what one gets contentment with ones own strength and contentment with what is befittingand similarly in the cases of alms foodrestingplace and medicineHere is a commentary on the divisions of it Here a bhikkhu obtains a robe and whether it is a fine one or nothe makes do with only that wishing for no other and he does not use any other even if he gets one this is his  contentment with what one gets  in the case of the robeOn the other hand he may be so afflicted by sickness that if he wears a heavy robe it weighs him down and tires him and then he is quite content to exchange it for a light one with a bhikkhu who is in communion that is not suspended by an act of the Community and to use that one this is his  contentment with ones own strength  in the case of the robeAnother bhikkhu maybe one who gets superior requisiteconditions and if he gets a very costly robe such as a lawn robe then thinking  This befits elders who have been long gone forth or the very learned he gives it to them and for himself collects rags from the top of a rubbish heap or anywhere else makes a patched cloak of them and wears that quite contentedly this is his contentment with what is befitting  in the case of the robeHere again a bhikkhu obtains alms food and whether it is coarse or superior he uses only that and wishing for no other he does not use any other even if he gets it this is his contentment with what one gets  in the case of the alms foodOn the other hand he may be so afflicted by sickness that if he eats coarse alms food he brings on a serious illness or disability and then he is content to give it to a bhikkhu who is in communion and to accept ghee honey milk etc at his hands and so be able to do his work upon the monks True Ideal This is his contentment with ones own strength in the case of the alms foodAnother bhikkhu may get superior alms food and thinking This almsfood befits elders who have been long gone forth and other companions in the Divine Life who make do without superior alms food and so he gives it to them and after wandering for almsfood for himself he eats mixed alms food quite contentedly this is his contentment with what is befitting in the case of the alms foodHere again a bhikkhu acquires a restingplaceOn the other hand he may be so afflicted by sickness that if he lives in a humble restingplace he is much troubled by biliousness and so onAnother bhikkhu may not accept a fine restingplace even if it is offered to him andthinking A fine restingplace offers grounds for negligence or lethargy and drowsiness descend on anyone who sits there and then thoughts of lust beset a man when he wakes up again after having been overcome by sleepHere again a bhikkhu obtains common gallnuts or yellow gallnuts as medicine and he makes do with thatOn the other hand he may get molasses when he is in need of oil and then he is quite content to give that to a bhikkhu who is in communion and after making up a medicine with the oilreceived at his hands he is then able to do his work upon the monks True Ideal this is his contentment with ones own strength  in the case of the requisite of medicineAnother bhikkhu when cows urine fermented with gallnuts has been put in one vessel and  foursweets  in another may be asked  Venerable sir take which you like  and then if either of the two cures his ailment thinking that urine with gallnuts was commended by Buddhas and so on and that this has been said  The Going Forth into Homelessness is dependent for medicine on fermented urine try and make use of that for the rest of your life  he refuses the medicine consisting of the  foursweets  and makes up a medicine with the urine and gallnuts and with that he is supremely contentNow all this contentment thus divided up is what is called contentIt should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for achieving the abandoning of such evil ideas as excessiveness of wishes greatness of wishes and evilness of wishes  since it is a cause for rebirth in the happy destinations since it is an accessory of the Noble Path and since it is a cause of the fourdirection  stateand this is said With no resistance in the four directionsHe is content with any one at all and so onGrateful bearing is the state of knowing  by recollection again and again about assistance whether little or much and done by whomsoever it may beFurthermore grateful bearing can also be understood as recollection of acts of merit which also greatly assist breathing things since they protect them from hells sufferings and so on Consequently  grateful bearing can be understood as the recollection of their assistanceThat is called a good omen since it is a cause for acquiring the many sorts of distinctions beginning with commendability by True MenAnd it is said  Bhikkhus two kinds of person are hard to find in the worldWhat twoOne who first does a favour and one who is grateful who is recognizant Hearing Truth when it is timely  this is the hearing of the True Idea on an occasion when cognizance is accompanied by agitation or is overcome by thoughts of sensual desire ill will or cruelty doing so on such an occasion in order to remove these thoughtsThen some others have said that Hearing Truth when it is timely  is hearing the True Idea every five daysaccording as it is said But every five days we sit out the whole night together in talk on the True Idea  Furthermore  Hearing Truth when it is timely  can also be understood as hearing the True Idea at a time at which one approaches good friends in order to be able to hear such of the True Idea as will remove ones own doubtsaccording as it is said  From time to time he approaches them and he asks and he questions  and so onThat hearing of Truth when it is timely should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for acquiring the many distinctions beginning with the abandoning of hindrances the four benefits and the exhaustion of taintsthis being said Bhikkhus on an occasion on which a Noble Disciple hears the True Idea giving ear by heeding attending and wholeheartedly reacting then on that occasion there is in him no one of the five hindrances  and this  Bhikkhus when ideas that have come to the ear  are well penetrated four benefits can be expected and this Bhikkhus there are these four ideas which when they are completely maintained in being made to have completely parallel occurrence eventually bring about the exhaustion of taintsWhat fourHearing Truth when it is timely      and so onSo in this stanza there are five good omens with respect humble manner content gratitude and hearing Truth when it is timelyThe commentary on the meaning of this stanza  Then respect is endedand is contented with only that one and if he acquires another better one he does not use it this is his  contentment with what one gets  in the case of the restingplaceand then he is quite content to give it to a bhikkhu who is in communion and to live in an airy cool restingplace that the other has acquired and so be able to do his work upon the monks True Ideal this is his contentment with ones own strength  in the case of the restingplacehe rejects it and lives anywhere such as in the open at a treeroot in a leafhut quite contentedly this is his  contentment with what is befitting  in the case of the restingplacehe makes do with only that without wishing for the ghee honey molasses etc obtained by others and not using it even if he gets it this is his contentment with what one gets  in the case of the requisite of medicinethis is his  contentment with what is befitting in the case of the requisite of medicineHow they are good omens has already been made clear in each instanceNow as to Patience patience is the act of being patient Meekness when corrected  because of his taking correction aright a speakingto is easy in his case thus he is easilyspokento  the action of one who is easilyspokento is easilyspokenabout  the state of what is easilyspokenabout is easilyspeakableaboutness They are monks because of the stilling of defilements Seeing  regardingDiscussion of the Truth dhammaskacchdhammassa skacch The rest is as already statedThis is the wordcommentaryaccording as it is saidIn olden time there was a monk Of patience he was paragon He kept his patience even when The king of Ksi murdered him Or else he gives it attention as admirable that it is no worse affliction like the venerable Punnaaccording as it is said Venerable sir if the people of Sonparanta abuse and threaten me then I shall think  These people of Sonparanta are admirable truly admirable in that they did not give me a blow with a fist    and so onOne who possesses this is commended also by the Seersaccording as Sarabhanga the Seer saidWho has his anger slain he sorrows nevermoreThe Seers do recommend abandoning contemptBe patient with the words of all that harshly speakThe Men at Peace have said Such patience is supreme And he is commended by deities tooaccording as it is saidIt is when one endowed with strength Will show forebearance to the weakThat patience shows supreme they say If weak a man is always patient And he is commended by the Enlightened Ones tooaccording as Sakka Ruler of Gods saidWho free from anger will yet bear  Abuse and even torture tooWith patience in force in strong array Him truly do I call divine Now this patience should be understood as a good omen since itis a cause for acquiring the special qualities mentioned here and others as wellMeekness when corrected is the state that causes the speaking of the word  good  by someone who is being lawfully spoken to for the purpose of his being corrected whereby he does so without indulging in prevarication or silence or thinking up virtues and vices and places foremost the greatest obedience respect and lowliness of mindThat is called a good omen since it is a cause for the obtaining of advice and instruction in the Divine Life and since it is a cause for abandoning vices and acquiring virtuesSeeing monks is the seeing byapproaching aiding recollecting and hearing of those gone forth whose defilements are stilled who have maintained in being body virtue cognizance and understanding and who possess the supreme control and quiet And all that is called  seeing  by the Teaching in the elementary form That should be understood as a good omenWhyBecause of its great helpfulnessAnd this has been said  Bhikkhus seeing of those bhikkhus is very helpful I say  and so onConsequently as soon as a clansman desirous of welfare sees virtuous bhikkhus at his door he should serve them according to his means with what is available for giving if anything is available for givingif there is none he should pay homage with the fivefold prostrationif that is not possible he should venerate them with hands raised palms together if that is not possible he should look on them with confident heart and loving eyesThen owing to such merit rooted in seeing he will for many a thousand births have in his eye no disease illhumour swelling or stye and his eyes will sparkle brightly with the five colours like moving crystal panes in a divine mansion built of jewels and for as much as a hundred thousand aeons he enjoys every sort of excellence among gods and menAnd it is no wonder that a human being born with understanding should find that his acts of merit consisting in the rightly effected seeing of monks ripen so excellently since even in the case of animals born with only bare faith it is told how excellently their acts of merit ripenThe roundeyed owl who long did dwell Here in the vedisaka treehappy owl was he indeed To see a Buddha rare to rise betimesHis heart had confidence in me And the Community elect Now for a hundred thousand aeons No state of deprivation he shall know Him when he falls from heavenly worlds His profitable deeds will guideAnd far and wide he will be called The Joyous One whose knowledge has no bounds And then discussion of the Truth when it is timely  in the dusk or in the early dawn say two bhikkhus Suttaexperts discuss with each other about Suttas or two Vinayaexperts about the Vinaya or two Abhidhammaexperts about the Abhidhamma or two Jtakapreachers about the Jtaka or two Commentaryexpounders about the Commentary or else they converse from time to time for the purpose of dispelling a state of cognizance that is slack or agitated or beset by uncertainty this is discussion of the truth when it is timelyIt is a good omen since it is a cause for such special qualities as particular distinction in the scriptures and so onSo in this stanza there are four good omens stated with patience meekness when corrected seeing monks and discussion of the True Idea when it is timelyThe commentary on the meaning of this stanza  Patience  is endedThe commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows Patience is patience as endurance If a bhikkhu possesses it then when people abuse him with the ten instances of abuse or threaten him with torture etc he is as though he neither heard nor saw them and remains as impassive as did Khantivadi How they are good omens has already been made clear in each instanceNow as to  Ardour  it burns up evil ideas thus it is ardour The Divine Life is either the life that is divine or it is the life of the High Divinities  what is meant is the best life Seeing truths that are called Noble ariyasaccna dassanamariyasaccnam dassanam  some say ariyasaccni dassanam  but that is inelegantIt has left the wood  thus it is extinction  the act of realizing is realization  Realization of extinction nibbdnasacchikiriynibbnassa sacchikiriy The rest is as already stated This is the wordcommentaryThe commentary on the meaning should be understood asf ollows Ardour is either facultyrestraint  since that burns up covetousness and grief etc or else it is energy since that burns up idleness a person possessing it is called ardent It is a good omen since it is a cause for the abandoning of covetousness etc and for the obtaining of jhana and so onThe Divine Life is a designation for abstinence from sexual intercourse for the monks True Ideal  for the Dispensation and for the pathFor in such passages as  Abandoning what is not the Divine Life he becomes one who leads the Divine Life  it is abstinence from sexual intercourse that is called Divine Life In such passages as Friend is a Divine Life lived under the Blessed One In such passages as  Evil One I will not finally attain extinction until this Divine Life of mine shall have become prosperous flourishing and widespread among the many  it is the Dispensation In such passages as  Bhikkhu this Noble Eightfold Path is a Divine Lifethat is to say right view   it is the path All this is appropriate here except for the lastmentioned kind since that is included in seeing truths that are called Noble which follows nextIt should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for reaching the successively higher distinctions obtained by the successive four paths and four fruitions of StreamEntry and the restSeeing truths that are called Noble is the seeing peculiar to the Path in virtue of which they attain to the four Truths mentioned in the Boys Questions  It is a good omen since it is a cause for surmounting the suffering of the round of rebirthsRealization of extinction  here it is the fruition of Arahantship that is intended by extinction for that is called  extinction  because of the surmounting of craving termed fastening as the fastening to the five kinds of destinationSo while either the reaching of that as the path or the reviewing of it as the paths fruition can actually be called  realization nevertheless since the former kind of realizationas the path has already been established by the immediately preceding phrase seeing truths that are called Noble that kind is consequently not intended here in this phraseSo this kind of realization of extinction namely reviewing as the fruition of the path should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for a pleasant abiding here and now and so onSo in this stanza there are four good omens stated with ardour the Divine Life seeing the Noble Truths and realization of extinctionThe commentary on the meaning of this stanza  Ardour is endedit is the monks True Ideal How they are good omens has already been made clear in each instanceNow as to Though by worldly ideas tempted Tempted is contacted stirred reachedWorldly ideas are ideas in the world  such ideas as are never reversed as long as the world continues its occurrence is what is meantCognizance is mind  mentality His  of a new bhikkhu a middle or an elder bhikkhuNeer  shall waver  neither moves nor vacillatesSorrowless  unsorrowing  with the dart of sorrow extractedStainless  with stains gone  with stains erased In safety  fearless unmenacedThe rest is as already stated This is the wordcommentaryThe commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows Though by worldly ideas tempted Neer his cognizance shall waver  when someone is tempted  beset by the eight worldly ideas namely gain and nongain fame and illfame censure and praise pleasure and pain  and his cognizance does not waver is unmoved never vacillates then that cognizance of his should be understood as a good omen since it brings about the nonwavering supramundane stateAnd whose cognizance is it that does not waver when he is tempted by themThe Arahants in whom taints are exhausted no one elses at allAnd this is saidJust as a solid mass of rock Remains unshaken by the windSo too no forms sounds smells or tastes No tangibles of any sortNor yet ideas disliked or liked Avail to move those such as this Such cognizance stands quite aloof In contemplating subsidence  It is only the cognizance in one whose taints are exhausted that is called sorrowless That is sorrowless because of the absence of what is stated in the way beginning Sorrow sorrowing sorrowfulness inner sorrow inner sorriness consuming of the heart Some say that it is extinction  but that has no sequence of meaning with the line that precedes itAnd just as the cognizance of one whose taints are exhausted is sorrowless  so too it is stainless and in safety since it is  stainless  with the absence of any stain of lust hate and delusion and it is  in safety  because it is safe from the four bonds  Consequently it should be understood as a good omen since although threefold as demonstrated by the three words beginning with  sorrowless  when thus taken at the moment of its occurrence in whichever mode it happens to occur it is a cause for bringing about undisconcertability and the highest state in the world etc and is a cause for bringing about fitness for gifts  and so on So in this stanza there are four good omens stated with unwavering cognizance sorrowless cognizance unstained cognizance and secure cognizance with respect to the eight worldly ideasThe commentary on the meaning of this stanza  Though by worldly ideas tempted Neer his cognizance  is endedHow they are good omens has already been made clear in each instanceAfter thus stating thirtyeight good omens with the ten stanzas beginning with  Not consorting with the foolish   he now uttered this final stanza Since by working such like omens extolling the good omens already mentioned by himselfHere is a commentary on its meaning Suchlike  such as these  namely  the nonconsorting with fools etc of the kinds already stated by meSince by working katvna is the same as karitv or katv  and is no different in meaningMen are everywhere unvanquished  what is meant is that not being vanquished by even one among the four enemies classed as the Mras of categories defilements and determinative acts and Mara the gods son and having on the contrary themselves vanquished those four MrasThe letter m here in the compound sabbatthamaparjit should be taken as inserted merely for purposes of liaisonAnd go everywhere in safety  whether in this world or in the other world whether standing walking etc everywhere they go in safety owing to their remaining unvanquished by the four Mras after they have worked suchlike good omens as these what is meant is that they go in safety go unmenaced unharassed secure and fearless because of the absence of those taints vexations and fevers that would have arisen from their consorting with fools and the restAnd the nasal component should be understood as inserted for metrical reasonsThat is their supreme good omen with this line of the stanza the Blessed One concluded his teachingHowGods son take it thus Whoever work suchlike omens  then since they go everywhere in safety it is that namely the thirtyeightfold good omen of nonconsorting with fools etcwhich is therefore their namely of those who have worked suchlike omens supreme  best superlative good omen Now when this teaching was thus concluded by the Blessed One a hundred thousand myriads of deities reached Arahantship and the number of those who reached the fruitions of Streamentry Oncereturn and Nonreturn was incalculableThen on the following day the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda thus  nanda last night a certain deity approached me and asked me a question about good omens I told him thirtyeight good omens Learn this discourse on good omens have the Bhikkhus recite itThe Elder learnt it and had the bhikkhus recite itThat has come down by the succession of teachers being such as we have it today So it can be understood that this was how this Divine Life became prosperous flourishing and widespread among the many disseminated and properly explained by gods and men Now here is how to construe it all from the beginning the purpose of doing which is to gain exercise and facility of knowledge in these same good omens So then these creatures who desire the pleasures of this world and of the other world and supramundane pleasure as wellwhen after abandoning consorting with foolish people and coming to depend on the wise they honour those who should be honouredwhen they are encouraged by living in a befitting place and by merit previously made to perform what is profitablewhen by right direction in selfguidance they each acquire a selfhood adorned with ample learning a craft and disciplinewhen they speak what is well spoken since it befits the disciplinewhen as long as they have not renounced the lay state they liquidate their old indebtedness to other peopleby aid for mother and father contracting new indebtedness to themselves by support for wife and children and they gain success in riches and corn through spheres of work that bring no conflict and then by taking the heartwood of riches through giving and the heart wood of life through TrueIdeal conduct they work the welfare of their own people by support of kin and the welfare of other people by unexceptionable actions till by avoiding through abstinence from evil the hurting of others and by refraining from besotting drink the hurting of themselves they increase the profitable side by diligence in True Idealsand when having abandoned the lay life owing to increase in what is profitable they are gone forth in to homelessness and after cultivating excellence in the Duties by respect and humble manner towards the Enlightened One disciples of the Enlightened One preceptors teachers and so on and contentedly abandoning cupidity for requisites they establish themselves on the plane of True Men by means of gratitude and then after abandoning slackness of cognizance through hearing the True Idea and transcending all anxieties through patience they find helpers for themselves through meekness under correction and so come owing to seeing monks to see how to proceed with the practice till after removing by discussion of the truth doubt about ideas that should be doubted about they eventually achieve Purification of Virtue by means of ardour in facultyrestraint Purification of Cognizance by means of the kind of Divine Life that consists in the Monks True Ideal and the four Purifications that follow upon those then by means of this practice the Purification of Knowledge and Seeing that is referred to by the words  seeing truths that are called Noble they realize at last the fruition of Arahantship called  extinction after which their cognizance no more wavers owing to the eight worldly ideas than does Mount Sineru owing to wind and rain they are sorrowless unstained and secureand those who are secure are everywhere unvanquished and go everywhere in safetyThat is why the Blessed One saidSince by working suchlike omens Men are everywhere unvanquishedAnd go everywhere in safety That is their supreme good omenNow at the end of many years many hundred years many thousand years King Makhadeva addressed his barber thus Good barber when you see any grey hairs growing on my head then tell meWhen he saw them he said to the king The divine messengers have appeared sire grey hairs are to be seen growing on your majestys headAnd there he had expounded meditation subjects suitable for the eightyfour thousand shades of temperament in the following way that is to say for those of lustful temperament he showed Loathesomeness as a meditation subject of the eleven kinds as with consciousness and without consciousness for those of hating temperament the fourfold meditation subject beginning with Lovingkindness for those of deluded temperament the meditation subject consisting in Mindfulness of Death etc for those of speculativethinking temperament Mindfulness of Breathing the Earth Universal etc for those of faithful temperament the meditation subjects consisting of the Recollections of the Enlightened One etc and for those of intelligent temperament the Definition of the Four ElementsSo when a party of five hundred bhikkhus had learnt each a meditation subject in the Blessed Ones presence and were seeking a suitable resting place with a village as alms resort eventually in the outland country they came in sight of a mountain forming part of the Himalaya range While its surface glittered like blue quartz crystal it was embellished with a cool dense shady green forest grove and a stretch of ground strewn with sand resembling a pearlnet or a silver sheet and it was furnished with a clean spring of grateful cool waterNow when the bhikkhus had spent one night there and the dawn was drawing near they attended to the needs of the physical frame and then went for alms into a town not far distantThe town was connected with a thousand clans and constructed as a communityresidence and the people there had faith and confidence Since it is hard in the outlands to get a sight of those gone forth into homelessness they were happy and joyful when they saw the bhikkhus and they fed them and begged them to stay on there for the three months of obligatory residence during the Rains and they had five hundred workrooms built and furnished with all such necessaries as beds chairs pots for drinking and washing water and so onOn the following day the bhikkhus went into another town for almsand there too the people served them in like manner and begged them to stay on for the RainsThe bhikkhus consented subject to there being no obstacle They reentered the wood where they arranged to keep up energy night and day by having a woodblock struck for the watches and abiding much in reasoned attention they went to the roots of trees and sat downThe tree deities were discouraged by the virtuous bhikkhus courage and they came down from their own mansions and wandered back and forth with their childrenJust as when a block of houses is commandeered from villagers by kings or royal ministers and the human inhabitants of the houses who have had to evacuate them and go to live elsewhere watch from a distance wondering  When are they going away  so too the deities came down from their own mansions and wandered back and forth watching from a distance and wondering When are the venerable ones going awayNext they thought thus  Bhikkhus who enter upon the first period of residence for the Rains will certainly stay on for three months but we cannot live with our children away from home for so long Let us show the bhikkhus some object that will scare them awaySo in the night when it was the bhikkhus time to give effect to the monks True Ideal they created terrifying forms of spirits and standing in front of each of them they made a dreadful noiseWhen the bhikkhus saw the forms and heard the noise their hearts quailed they grew pale and jaundicedand they could no longer unify their cognizance When they were harassed again and again by this fear with their cognizance ununified they forgot their mindfulness As soon as they had forgotten their mindfulness the deities harassed them with bad smells as objects Their brains seemed to smother in the stench with feelings of oppression in their heads However they did not mention their hauntings to each otherThen one day when all had assembled at the time for waiting on the Senior Elder of the Community he asked them Friends when you went into this wood the colour of your skin was quite pure and bright for some days and your faculties were clear but now you are lean and pale and jaundiced What does not suit you here Then a bhikkhu said  Venerable sir at night I saw and heard suchandsuch a dreadful object and I smelt suchandsuch a smell and so my mind was not concentrated and all told in the same way what had been happeningThe Senior Elder said Friends two kinds of Entry upon Residence for the Rains have been described by the Blessed One  and this resting place does not suit us So let us go to the Blessed One and ask about another resting place that will suit usThe others agreed and so they all put their resting places in order and then they took their bowls and outer robes and without even telling anyone  for they had no attachments among the clans  they set out to wander by stages to SvatthiThey went to the Blessed OneWhen he saw them he said Bhikkhus a training rule has been made known by me saying that no one is to go wandering during the Rains  Why are you wandering They told the Blessed One all that had happenedThe Blessed One adverted to the whole of Jambudipa but he saw not even so much as a place for a fourlegged chair that might suit them as a resting placeThen he told them Bhikkhus there is no other resting place that will suit you It is only by living there that you might reach the exhaustion of taints So go and occupy that same resting place But if you want to be free from fear of deities then learn this safeguardfor this will be both a safeguard and a meditation subject for you and he uttered this SuttaAccording to some others however he said  So go and occupy that same resting place after saying which the Blessed One added  A forestdwelling bhikkhu should know the protection procedurethat is to say by doing every evening and morning two spells of Lovingkindness two of Safeguards two of Loathesomeness and two of Mindfulness of Death and also by adverting to the Eight Principal Grounds for a Sense of Urgency and the Eight Principal Grounds for a Sense of Urgency are either birth ageing sickness death and the suffering in the four states of deprivation or else they are the four consisting of birth ageing sickness and death and then the suffering in the states of deprivation as the fifth the suffering rooted in the round during the past the suffering rooted in the round during the future and the suffering rooted in the search for nutrimentAnd they say that when the Blessed One had told those bhikkhus the protection procedure he then uttered this Sutta for the sake of Lovingkindness for the sake of a Safeguard and for the sake of the jhana obtainable through lovingkindness that is to be used as the basis for insight into the Three Characteristics of impermanence suffering and notselfAnd now since it was also said And then a comment I shall tell there begins the commentary on the meaning of this discourse whose source has just been clarified in this wayBy one with skill in good atthakusalenaatthe kusalena  by one clever in good is what is meantWhat  either this is a nominative indefinite pronoun agreeing with karaniyamand this is an accusative definite pronoun agreeing with santam padam or else the words yan tarn are both nominative agreeing with karaniyam and only the wordssantam padam are accusative and herein this last is a designation for extinction since that is  peace  by characteristic and it is a  state by its reachability To have attained  having come up to He can  thus he is able  what is meant is that he is capable has powerRight  yoked to rectitude He is thoroughly right thus he is upright Speaking to him is easy in his case thus he is meek He would be assabhaveyya Gentle  yoked to mildness Not proud anatimnlna atimnl Now here is a commentary on the meaning of the two clauses What should be done by one with skill in good The State of Peace to have attained is thisHerein there is what should be done and there is what should not be doneHerein briefly what should be done is the three Trainings and what should not be done comprises failure in virtue failure in views failure in conduct failure in livelihood and so onLikewise there is one with skill in good and there is one without skill in goodHerein one without skill in good is one gone forth in the Dispensation who does not devote himself rightly whose virtue is torn  who makes a living by depending on the twentyone kinds of improper search namely be depending as a bhikkhu on giving bamboos giving leaves giving flowers giving fruits giving toothsticks giving mouthwashing water giving bathing facilities giving bath powder giving clay flattery beansoupery fondling carrying communications on foot practising medicine acting as a messenger going on errands getting almsfood given in exchange for alms food science of lands science of fields science of astrology science of limbs who goes to the sixfold wrong resortnamely  A harlot as resort or a widow oldmaid eunuch bhikkhuni or a tavernwho dwells associated with kings kings ministers other sectarians other sectarians disciples by association not in conformity with the True Idea who cultivates frequents and honours such clans as are faithless without confidence addicted to abuse and calumny and undesirous of good and desirous of harm discomfort and what is not safety from bondage where bhikkhus and bhikkhunis and laymen followers and laywomen followers are concerned  But one gone forth in this Dispensation who devotes himself rightly and abandoning improper search and desiring to establish himself in the Virtue of Fourfold Purity  fulfils the Restraint by Ptimokkha Rule under the heading of faith FacultyRestraint under the heading of mindfulness Purification of Livelihood under the heading of energy and right Use of the RequisiteConditions for the bhikkhus life under the heading of understandingAnd when he purifies Restraint by Ptimokkha Rule by means of purification in the seven categories of offences  purifies FacultyRestraint by means of nonarousing of covetousness and ill will when objects have impinged in the six doors of the five faculties beginning with the eye and that of the mind purifies livelihood by means of avoidance of improper search and by use of what is commended by the wise and praised by the Enlightened Ones and their disciples purifies the use of the four requisiteconditions by means of the reviewing already mentioned and purifies Full Awareness by means of the reviewing in the case of alternation of the postures the purposefulness suitability resort and nondelusion And when he knows that virtue is cleaned with knowledge just as dirty cloth is cleaned with beanwater or a lookingglass with ashes or gold with a furnace and he cleans his virtue by washing it in the water of knowledge and that is when he guards his own Virtue Category most diligentlyjust as ahen bird guards her eggs as a yak guards his tail as a woman with an only child guards her dearly beloved only child or as a oneeyed man guards his only eye  and he reviews it evening and morning till he sees no slightest blame thereAnd when he becomes established in the virtue that provides nonremorse when he exerts himself in the way of suppression of defilement and in the pursuit of that does the preliminary work on a Universal  and when by doing the preliminary work on a Universal he generates the attainment of jhanaBut the acme of skill in good is when having emerged from an attainment he comprehends determinations till he eventually reaches ArahantshipHerein those with skill in good  praised either in so far as they are established in the virtue that provides nonremorse or in so far as they exert themselves in the  way of suppression of defilement or in so far as they attain the paths and fruitions are those with skill in good  in this senseAnd those bhikkhus were of such kindsHence the Blessed One said What should be done by one with skill in good with reference to those bhikkhus but giving the teaching in terms of a single personNext when they were wondering  What should be done   he told them The State of Peace to have attained is this Now the intention can be taken as follows It is what should be done by one who desires after contriving to have attained it by penetration to abide in this extinctionStateofPeace  which is praised by the Enlightened Ones and their likeAnd here  what implies only the practice that at the beginning of this line in the stanza it was said  should be done  but then the clause  to have attained the State of Peace is this must be understood as one whose meaning requires completing which is why  by one who desires    to abide in  was said above Or alternatively the intention can be understood as follows When through hearsay etc to this effect namely  To have attained the State of Peace  he knows with mundane understanding the extinctionState to be one of peace  and when he wants to arrive at it then the what that it is proper as the practice should be done by him is this which should be done by one with skill in good Or alternatively it had been said that there is something that  should be done by one with skill in good  and the bhikkhus were wondering  What  and then the Blessed One told them  The State of Peace to have attained is this  the intention of which can be understood also as follows After contriving to have attained with mundane understanding the State of Peace  what should be done is this   what must be done is what should be done  only that is worth doing  is what is meantBut what is thatWhat else should be done but the doing that is the means to that State And of course this means is already expressed by the initial clause with its indication of the Three Trainings in the sense of their being worth doingfor we already said as much in the comment on the meaning namely There is what should be done and there is what should not be doneHerein briefly what should be done is the Three Trainings Now while some of the bhikkhus understood it some did not since the teaching was extremely briefConsequently in order to make those who had not yet understood understand he uttered the second halfstanza namely He would be able right upright And meek and gentle and not proud giving in detail what must especially be done by a forestdwelling bhikkhuWhat is meantA forestdwelling bhikkhu who desires to abide in the State of Peace after having contrived to attain it or whoafter contriving to attain it with only mundane understanding is practising the way finally to arrive at it would be able with the possession of the second and fourth factors of endeavour to practise for the penetration of the Truths without regard for body and life Likewise he would be able that is clever unidle capable in the preliminary work for a Universal  in undertaking the duties etc and in repairing his own bowl robes etc and in these and other such major and minor things to be done for companions in the Divine LifeBeing able he would also be right with possession of the third factor of endeavourBeing right instead of being content with being right once he would be more thoroughly right  that is upright  by repeatedly promoting nonlaxity aslong as he livesOr alternatively he is right by means of nonfraudulence and upright by means of nondeceitfulnessOr he is right with abandonment of crookedness of body and speech and upright with abandonment of crookedness of mindOr he is right by nonpublication of any special qualities of jhana and path that are nonexistent in himself and upright by nonendurance of gain arisen on account of such nonexistent special qualitiesThus he would be right and upright with the purity of ends and means consisting in meditation upon objectsof pure concentration and upon the three General characteristics of impermanence etc which are ensured respectively by the first pair of Trainings namely the Higher Virtue and Higher Cognizance and by the third namely the Higher UnderstandingAnd he would be not only right and upright but also meek as wellfor a person who when told This ought not to be done  says  What has been seen by you What has been heard by you Who are you that you speak to me are you a Preceptor Teacher friend companion or obstructs with silence or accepts the admonition but does not act on it is far from arriving at any distinctionbut one who when advised says Good venerable sir well said What is blameworthy is hard to see in oneself If you should see me again thus tell me out of compassion May I long have advice from you  and practises according as instructed is not far from arriving at distinctionThat is why he would be meek by accepting others advice and acting on itAnd he would be gentle just as he would be meekBut while firm in not practising malleableness with laymen when pressed by them to go with messages go on errands etc he would yet be as malleable in the performance of the duties in the whole Divine Life as wellrefined gold is for employment in this and that Good is the Way or alternatively anything at all that is beneficial to oneself  since it should be honoured  is  good  and  since it should be honoured  means since it should be approached that one is without skill in good is one with skill in good he is also one with skill in good he is also one with skill in good he is also one with skill in goodOr alternatively the word gentle means that he would be without grimaces  opencountenanced easy to talk with and as welcoming as a good ford with an easy approachAnd he would be not only gentle but also not proud as well he would not be proud towards others on account of such grounds for pride as birth race etc but would abide like the Elder Sriputta evenminded to all alike whether outcaste or prince The Blessed One thus told in part what should be done especially by a forestdwelling bhikkhu who desires after contriving to have attained the State of Peace to abide in it or who is practising the way to arrive at that State Being then desirous of saying more than that he uttered the further stanzaHerein he is content with the twelvefold contentment of the kind already stated under And content and grateful bearing   thus he is contented Or alternatively he finds contentment  thus he is one content  he is one content with his own  he is one content with what there is  and he is one content equally with all  thus he is content Herein what is called his own is that indicated in the ceremony of Full Admission thus  Depending onthe lumps of alms food   and it is whatever among the four requisiteconditions for the bhikkhus life has been accepted by himself He is called  one content with his own  when without showing any alteration of expression either at the time of receiving or at the time of using he makes do with it whether it is good or bad whether it is carefully or carelessly given What is called  what there is is what is factual and has been obtained by himselfHe is called one content with what there is  when he is content with that alone without aspiring to more than that and thus abandons excessiveness of wishesWhat is called equallywith all is the abandoning of approval and resistance with respect to the desired and the undesired He is called  one content equallywith all  when he is content with that kind of equality regarding all objectsHe is supported with ease  thus he is easy to support  he is easily sustained is what is meantFor a bhikkhu is hard to support if when given his bowl full of special rice meat and boiled rice he shows a face of gloomy sullenness or is suspicious saying in the givers presence  What is this you have given  and gives it away to novices or laymenWhen people see that they keep far away thinking  A bhikkhu who is hard to support can never be sustainedBut he is easy to support when with cheerfulness and confident face he makes do with what he gets no matter whether it is poor or superior little or muchWhen people see that they are quite trustful and they claim thus  Our venerable is easy to support he is content even with a little We ourselves will sustain him and they do sustain himIt is one such as that who is intended here as easy to supportHis busiedness is little  thus he is unbusy  He is not occupied with the many kinds of busiedness such as love of working love of talking love of company and so on Or alternatively in the whole monastery he is devoid of any busieness concerned with buildingwork property of the Community instruction of novices and monasteryattendants etc and insteadhe is engaged only in the busiedness consisting in the monks True Ideal after doing his own haircutting nailcutting and preparing of his own bowl and robesHis way of life is light  thus he is frugal he is not like some bhikkhus with their many chattels who when it is time to go away do so after they have loaded many people with head packs waist packs etc of bowls robes rugs oils sugar etc but when it is time to go away having little requisiteequipment he carries only the monks eight requisites namely the bowl three robes razor needle waistband and waterstrainer and taking only these he goes away as does a bird with its own wings  It is one such as this that is intended here by  frugalHe has faculties that are serene  thushe is serene in faculties  his faculties are unagitated by lust for desirable objects or ill will towards undesirable objects is what is meantPrudent  knowledgeable intelligent possessed of understanding the intention is that he is possessed of understanding about guarding virtue understanding about managing robes and the restand understanding as the actofunderstanding the seven kinds of suitability namely those regarding the abode almsresort speechperson food climate and posture He is not impudent  thus he is modest  the meaning is that he is devoid of bodily impudence in its eight instances verbal impudence in its four instances and mental impudence in its many instances What is called  bodily impudence in its eight instances is acting unbecomingly by means of the body in the presence of the Community in the presence of a Chapter in the presence of a person in the refectory in the hotbath house at the bathing place on the path for gathering alms and in the entry into housesthat is to say Here someone in the midst of the Community sits lolling with hands clasped round knees or with feet crossed  and so on Likewise in the midst of a chapterAgain in the refectory he does not give a seat to seniors he prevents new bhikkhusthose with less than five years seniority from getting a seat Likewise in the hotbathhouse  and he has fires lighted etc without asking seniors about it And at the bathing placewithout bothering about what is said namely  Without making the standard  junior and senior  bathing should be done in the order of arrival  he arrives after others and enters the water and jostles seniors and new bhikkhus without waiting his turnAnd in the entry into houses he enters before the seniors and plays bodily games with children and so onthat is to say Here someone in the midst of the Community preaches the True Idea unasked   And likewise in the presence of a chapter and of a senior person as stated already And when asked a question by people there he answers them without asking a senior if he may do so And among houses he speaks thus  You soandso what is there Is there any ricegruel or anything to eat or chew What will you give me What shall we eat today Whatshall we drink What is called mental impudence in its many instances is unbecoming thinking namely thoughts of sensual desire of ill will and of cruelty etc in such and such instances doing so only with the mind and with no transgression by body or speechNot fawning upon families  whatever families he approaches he does not fawn upon them either out of craving for the requisiteconditions or owing to association with laymen that is not in conformity with the True Idea what is meant is that he is not one who sorrows with them and relishes with them who is pleased when they are and suffers when they do and who is forward in engaging himself in any business or work that has arisenAnd in this stanza the words  he would be   which were stated in the previous stanza thus  he would be    meek   must be construed also with all the terms in this way  he would be contented he would be easy to support    and  in the midst of a chapter includes a meeting of the four assemblies of bhikkhus bhikkhunis laymen followers and laywomen followers Likewise in the presence of senior personsAnd on the path for gathering alms he goes in front of seniors bumping their arms with his arms in order to get the best seat the best water the best alms foodWhat is called  verbal impudence in its four instances is unbecoming speech utterance in the presence of a Community a chapter and a person and among housesWhen the Blessed One had thus announced what more would be done especially by a forestdwelling bhikkhu who desired after contriving to have attained the State of Peace to abide in it orwho was practising the way to arrive at that State he now uttered the following stanza being desirous of announcing also what should not be doneIts meaning is as follows There are some slight things in bodily verbal or mental misconduct that are called  bad and when he is thus doing what should be done he would do no slight thing in that and in not doing it it is not onlythe gross that he would not do but also anything at all  what is meant is that he would not do even as much as a little evenas much as an atomAnd next he showed the danger to be seen here in this life for him in the doing of such things by saying that other wise men might deplore and here others who are unwise are not the standardsince they do either what is not deplorable or what is deplorable or what is little deplorable or greatly deplorablebut it is only the wise who are the standardsince they after inquiry and investigation speak in dispraise of what deserves dispraise and in praise of what deserves praiseNow the Blessed One stated with these two and a half stanzas the approach to the meditation subject thus And that approach is divided into what should be done and what should not be done especially by a forestdwelling bhikkhu who desires after contriving to have attained the State of Peace to abide in it or who is practising the way to arrive at that Stateand under the heading of forestdweller  are included all those who want to come to abide in that State through taking a meditation subject And so having done that he now began to give an exposition of lovingkindness which begins with the words Sukhino v khemino hontu The purpose of this was to serve those bhikkhus as a safeguard to dispel their fear of deities and as a meditation subject for inducing jhana as the basis for insightHerein joyful is possessing pleasureAnd safe  having safety what is meant is fearless unplaguedEvery without remainderCreatures  breathing thingsHeart rejoice  with pleased cognizanceand here it can be understood that they are  joyful with bodily pleasure that their hearts rejoice  with mental pleasure and that they are safe  with both or else with the disappearance of all fears and plaguesBut why is it stated like thisIn order to show the different modes of maintenance of lovingkindness in beingfor lovingkindness can be maintained in being thus Let all creatures be joyful or Let them be safe  or  Let their hearts rejoice  which is why  other wise men  is saidWhen the Blessed One had thus shown in brief the maintenance of lovingkindness in being from access up to absorption as the limit he now uttered the following pair of stanzas Ye Jceci He did so in order to show that in detail as wellOr alternatively cognizance that is used to ordinary variety in its object does not become steadied on unity at first but it does become steadied gradually by following out a classification of the object and that is why he uttered this pair of stanzas beginning  Whatever the purpose of which is the steadying of it on its object classified under the dyads and triads beginning with  frail or firm  doing so by following these outOr alternatively when an object is fully evident to someone his cognizance easily stays on it and so he uttered this pair of stanzas beginning with  Whatever which illustrate the classification of the object by means of the dyads and triads beginning with frail and firm since he was desirous of steadying those bhikkhus cognizance on an object made fully evident to themAnd in fact he points out four dyads namely the frailfirm dyad the seenunseen dyad the farnear dyad and the thatarethatyetseektobe dyad and then with the six terms beginning with  long he also points out three triads namely the longmiddlesizedshort triad the bigmiddlesizedsmall triad and the thickmiddlesizedsmall triad since the meaning of the term  middlesized is implicit in all three triads and the meaning of the term  small in two of themHerein whatever is a term without remainderBreathing things are themselves beings  thus they are breathing beings or alternatively they breathe thus they are breathing things  by which term he includes creatures belonging to the fiveconstituent kind of being  which are bound up with inbreath and outbreathand then they are  thus they are beings  by which he includes oneconstituent and fourconstituent creaturesThere are atthisanti  they are factualHaving thus pointed out comprehensively with the words whatever breathing beings there are all the creatures about to beincluded under the dyads and triads mentioned above he now pointed them all out again by including them in the first dyad namely no matter whether frail or firm with none excepted Herein they thirst  thus they are frail  this is a designation for those with craving and for those with fearThey stand  thus they are firm  this is a designation for Arahants who have abandoned craving and fearThere is no one of them that is an exception thus they are with none excepted  all is what is meantAnd what is said at the end of the second pair of stanzas should all be construed with the dyads and triads thus  Whatever breathing beings there are no matter whether frail or firm let every creatures heart rejoiceand likewise down as far as the dyad that are or that yet seek to be let every creatures heart rejoiceNow as to the six terms beginning with  long that represent the three triads beginning with longmiddlesizedshort the long are those with a long selfhood such as Ngas  fishes lizards etcfor in the great ocean there are Ngas with a selfhood measuring many hundred fathoms and there are fishes lizards etc with a selfhood measuring many leaguesBig  with a big selfhood such as turtles etc in the water such as elephants Ngas etc on land and such as Dnava Demons etc among nonhuman beingsAnd it is said Rhuis the foremost of those who possess a selfhood  for the selfhood of that Eclipse Demon is four thousand eight hundred leagues in height his arms measure twelve hundred leagues the space between his eyebrows is fifty leagues and so are the spaces between his fingers and toes and the palms of his hands are two hundred leaguesThe middlesized are the selfhoods of horses oxen buffaloes pigs and so onThe short are creatures that in this or that kind of birth fall short of the normal measurement according to the big and middlesized such as dwarfs and so onSmall  these are creatures that are not the resort of the fleshly eye but are the objective field of the heavenly eye and they are generated in water etc with a subtle selfhood or they are lice and so onBesides any creatures in any kind of birth that are of lesser measure than the big or middlesized or than the thick or middlesized can be understood as smallThe thick are creatures with a rounded selfhood such as fishes tortoises oysters clams and so onHaving thus pointed out creatures without exception with these three triads he now pointed them out again by including them in the three remaining dyads beginning with or those seen or unseenHerein those seen are any that have already been seen by their coming to the eyes horizonThe unseen are thosethat remain beyond the sea beyond a mountain beyond this worldsystem and so onWith the dyad or whether dwelling far or near he points out creatures dwelling far or not far from onesown selfhood These can be understood as the footless and as bipedsfor creatures dwelling inside ones own body are near while those dwelling outside it are far Likewise those dwelling in the houseprecincts are near while those dwelling outside the precincts are farAgain those dwelling in ones own abode village country continent worldsystem are near while those dwelling beyond the abode    the worldsystem are respectively farThat are  that have been born generatedthey are reckoned thus They are  they will not be again which is a designation for those with taints exhausted namely ArahantsThat yet seek to besambhavesinosambhavamesanti this is a designation for Initiates and ordinary men who still seek being in the future because they have not abandoned the fetter of being Or alternatively in the case of the four kinds of womb generation  creatures that are eggborn or uterusborn are called those that yet seek to be as long as they have not broken the eggmembrane or the caulmembrane respectively but when they have broken the eggmembrane or the caulmembrane and have come out they are called those that areHowever moistureborn creatures and those of spontaneous appearance are called those that yet seek to be in the first moment of their cognizance and they are called those that are from the moment of the second cognizanceor else they are those that yet seek to be as long as they do not reach any posture other than that in which they were born while after that they are called those that areWhen the Blessed One with these two and a half stanzas beginning with Joyful had thus shown to those bhikkhus in various aspects the maintenance of lovingkindness in being towards creatures by way of an aspiration for their coming to welfare and pleasure he now said Na faro pararh nikubbetha He did so showing that too by way of an aspiration for their noncoming to harm and sufferingThat is the Ancients reading but now they also read param hi instead of param ni which is not creditableHerein one is an individual and another one is another individual Let not    undo  let him not betrayNor slight  nor let him by surmounting show conceit Anywhere  anywhere in the open in a village in a field in the midst of relatives or in the midst of a guild and so onHim  that one At all  any one at all whether WarriorNoble or Priestly Divine or householder or one gone forth whether well off or ill off and so onWith provocation or resistive thought  with provocation by alteration in body or speech and with resistive thought by alteration in mind andvyrosan patighasann contracted instr or abl is said though normally one should say vyrosanya patighasannya normal fem sing instr or abl just as sammad ann vimuccati is said though normally one should say sammad annya vimuccati  and just as anupubbasikkh anupubbakiriy anupubbapatipad is said though normally one should say anupubbasikkhya anupubbakiriyyaanupubbapatipadyaLet them not wish each other ill nnnamannassa dukkhamiccheyyaannamanriassa dukkham na iccheyya What is meantLovingkindness should be maintained in being not only by attention given thus  Joyful and safe etc but it should also be maintained in being as follows Oh that no person at all might undo any other person at all with such undoing as betrayal etc or might slight any other person at all in any place on the grounds for conceit consisting in birth property etc  and that each might not wish another ill with provocation or resistive thoughtWhen he had thus pointed out the maintenance of lovingkindness in being by way as to meaning of aspiration for this noncoming to harm and suffering he now said Mt yath illustrating that same statement with a simileIts meaning is this As a mother might guard her son  the child of her breast born in herself and that being also her only child  might guard it with her life by laying down her own life in order to ward off the coming of suffering thus would he maintain  would he generate again and again would he augment his lovingkindnessthought to every living being and he would maintain it in being unboundedly by means of the object of cognizance consisting of boundless creatures or by means of remainderless extension in a single beingHerein he fattens and tends  thus he is a friend  the meaning is that by his inclination to welfare he acts as a lubricant and protects from harms comingThe state of a friend is love For all  unreservedly for The world  the world of creaturesThought a state of being that is in the mind for that is said because it is associated with cognizanceHe would maintain  would increaseIt has no measure  thus it is done unboundedly  it is stated thus as an object consisting of measureless numbers of creaturesAbove  upwards he refers to formless being by thisBelow  downwards he refers to sensualdesire being by thisAll around  in the middle he refers to formed being by thisUnchecked  devoid of checks with barriers broken down is what is meant It is an enemy that is called a  barrier the meaning is that it should be directed even to himNo malice with  devoid of malice what is meant is devoid of the manifestation even now and then of any choice governed by maliceOr foe  without enemiesfor a person who abides in lovingkindness is dear to human beings and dear to nonhuman beings and he has no enemies at all hence that thought is called  with no foe  because of its enemylessnessAnd these terms namely  enemy  and foe are metaphorical expressionsThis is the wordbyword commentaryNow here is a commentary on the meaning intended He would maintain  would augment would bring to growth increase and fullness unboundedly for all the world his thought of love  which has already been mentioned in this way  Thus   would he maintain unboundedly his thought for every living being  HowAbove and below and all around by extending without remainder above up to the Acme of Existence  that is the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception below down to Avici the lowest hell and all around in all the remaining directionsOr else by pervading without remainder the formless states above the sensualdesireelement below and the formelement all around And while maintaining this thought in this way he would maintain it in being by ensuring the absence of any check malice or foe so that it may be unchecked no malice with or foe Or else when it has reached excellence in maintenanceinbeing and is unchecked since it finds opportunities everywhere has no malice since his own annoyance with others has been removed and has no foe since others annoyance with himself has been removedhe would maintain augment for all the world in the three divisions of above below and all around his thought of love unboundedlyHaving thus shown the maintenance of lovingkindness in being he now said Tittham caram nisinno v He did so showing the posturerule for one who abides devoted to maintaining that in beingIts meaning is this When he is thus maintaining that thought of love  in being instead of adopting any such posturerule as that given in such passages as  he sits down having folded his legs crosswise set his body erect  he instead makes the posturerule here the dispelling as one pleases of any discomfort in any particular posture that constantly supervenes with overlong retention of it so that whether he is standing or walking or seated too or lying down the while he is undrowsing  then he would pursue this lovingkindnessjhana mindfulness Or alternatively having thus shown augmentation of maintenance of lovingkindness in being in the previous stanza he now said Standing walking in order to show masteryfor one who has reached mastery is desirous of pursuing such lovingkindnessjhana mindfulness by posture the while he is either standing or walking Or alternatively the standing etc are no obstacle to him but rather whether he is standing or whether he is walking for the while that he is desirous of pursuing such lovingkindnessjhana mindfulness thus for so long does he being undrowsing  pursue it  he has no sluggishnesshence he said  Standing or walking seated too Or lying down the while undrowsingHe would pursue this mindfulnessThe intention is as follows He would so maintain in being what was stated thus  His thought of love for all the world He would maintain  that were he desirous of pursuing this lovingkindnessjhana mindfulness  by posture he would pursue this mindfulness the while he was engaged in standing etc or else for the while that without bothering whether he was standing etc he might be desirous of pursuing this lovingkindnessjhana mindfulness  for so long he would pursue this mindfulnessHaving given an exhortation to that abiding in lovingkindness thus  He would such mindfulness pursue  pointing out in so doing mastery in the maintenance of lovingkindness in being he now said Brahmam etam vihram idhamhu extolling that abidingThe meaning is this There is this abiding in lovingkindness that is set forth in the way beginning with the words  Joyful and safe  and down as far as the words He would pursue this mindfulnessNow it is this  since among the heavenly abidings divine abidings noble abidings and abidings in the postures it is immaculate and is beneficial both to oneself and to others  that is they say here in the Noble Ones True Idea and Discipline a Divine Abiding  It is a foremost abiding they say and consequently he would such mindfulness pursue constantly continuously and uninterruptedly whether standing or walking seated too or lying down the while undrowsingWhen the Blessed One had finished his teaching thus he told the bhikkhus Go bhikkhus and live in that same forest grove On the eighth days in each month that are for the hearing of the True Idea have the gong struck and recite this discourse and then have a sermon on the True Idea and be careful to give a blessing  Cultivate this same meditation subject maintain it in being and develop it Then instead of showing you dreadful objects those nonhuman beings will most surely wish you well and seek your goodThey agreed and after they had got up from their seats and had paid homage to the Blessed One keeping him on their right they departed to go back to where they had come from and they did as they had been toldNow thinking  The venerable ones wish us well and seek our good  the deities were full of happiness and joy and they themselves swept out the resting places prepared warm water performed backtreatment and foottreatment for them and arranged for their protectionThere the bhikkhus maintained lovingkindness in being and making that the basis they established insight into the three general characteristics of Impermanence suffering and notself till all of them reached Arahantship the highest fruit in that same Rains and they were able to hold the Pavran Ceremony in purityIts meaning is this After emerging from the abiding in lovingkindness jhana which was specified thus  This is Divine Abiding here they say  he discerns the nonmaterialform ideas there in that jhana consisting in thinking and exploring and the rest which he defines as  name  Then following on the defining etc of these jhana factors as  name  he discerns the ideas of material form there which he defines as  form  By means of this delimitation of nameandform he traffics not with views  avoiding that by discerning in the way stated thus A heap of mere determinations No creature can be found herein   till he eventually becomes virtuous with the kind of virtue that is supramundane since he is now perfected in the right view belonging to the Path of Stream Entry which is called seeing  and which is associated with that supramundane virtue After that whatever greed there is in him still remaining unabandoned in the guise of sensual desire as subjective defilement for sensual desires as objects  of that he becomes purged  vineyya vinayitva  that is he becomes cured  by attenuation of certain defilements and by abandoning of certain others without remainder by means of his attaining the Paths of the Once Returner and the Non Returner he will surely come no more to any womb  absolutely never again coming to any wombhe is reborn only in the Pure Abodes where he reaches Arahantship and attains extinctionin the Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning the Commentary on the Minor BooksThe explanation of the Lovingkindness Discourse is endedHerein there follows first a wordcommentarv on the first stanza What should be done by one with skill in good Should be done karaniyamktabbam it is worth doing That is how the classification of the source which illustrates why should be understood in detailAnd at this point namely which illustrates as well By whom twas spoken when where whyI shall set out to clarify Its Source what was laid down in the Schedule has been given in detail in all aspectsThat was the origin of the Goodomen QuestionNow here is the comment on the words and on the meaning in the versesWhen the Blessed One heard the words of the gods son he uttered the stanza  Not consorting with the foolish    Now since the omen as we goBut since it was said  Whereafter when the time falls due We comment on the meaning too the comment on the meaning must beginNow while there are some others who say that  only the first five stanzas were spoken by the Blessed One the rest being spoken by the venerable Ananda at the time of his performing the Protection Ceremony that may be so in fact or it may notBut does that investigation concern us The commentary that we shall make on this Jewel Sutta will actually fit both casesBy developing the four divine abodes on the dissolution of the body after death he passed on to the BrahmaworldNow the Treasurestore Discourse which begins thus A man lays by a treasure store is placed here next after the WithouttheWalls DiscourseSo first I shall the reason state Wherefore they placed this discourse hereHerein the reason for its being placed here should be understood as followsAlthough it is not in the order in which it t that this Treasurestore Discourse was delivered by the Blessed One that is to say next after the Withoutthewalls Discourse it is nevertheless placed here because it is supplementary to the Withoutthewalls Discourse which was uttered as the giving of a blessingOr else it can be understood that it was placed here for the purpose of showing by its means of the the Withoutthewalls Discourse the failure of those devoid of meritThis is the reason for placing it hereAnd make the NeedArisen clear Before the Comment I relateThe NeedArisen for its utterance was this  At Savatthi it seems there was a certain landowner rich in much money and propertyHe lived the household life in faith and confidence uncognizant of the stain of avariceOne day he gave an almsgiving to the Community of Bhikkhus headed by the Enlightened OneIt so happened that on that occasion the king was in need of money so he sent a man telling him Go and fetch the landowner named soandsoThe man went to the landowner and told him Householder the king summons youThe landowner was actually serving the Community of Bhikkhus headed by the Englightened one his mind being graced by the special qualities of faith and so on He replied Go now good man I shall come later Just now I am engaged in laying up a treasure storeThen when the Blessed One had eaten and had shown that he had had enough he uttered these stanzas namely  A man lays by a treasure store  as a blessing in order to show to the landowner how that same excellence in merit is in the ultimate sense a treasure storeThis was the need arisenfirst the reason stated Wherefore they placed this discourse hereAnd made the NeedArisen clear the comment I shall now relate So havingAs regards the first stanza namely A man a treasure store lays by  herein it is stored away  thus it is a treasure store  the meaning is that it is put by protected guardedThat is of four kinds namely a fixture the ambulant a pseudolimb and a followerHerein the  fixture  is any bullion or gold stored away underground or in attics or any field or land or anything else of the sort that is devoid of any alteration of posture this is a treasure store as a fixtureThe  ambulant  consists of bonds  women and bondsmen elephants cattle horses and mares goats and sheep fowls and pigs or anything else of the sort that is associated with alteration of the postures this is a treasure store as the ambulantThe  pseudolimb  is any sphere of work sphere of craft branch of science ample learning  or anything else of the sort acquired by training and bound up with ones own selfhood as if it were a limb this is a treasure store as a pseudolimbThe  follower  is merit consisting in giving consisting in virtue consisting in maintenance of concentration and insight in being consisting in hearing the True Idea and consisting in teaching the True Idea or any other merit of the sort that gives desirable fruit here and there as if it had followed one this is a treasure store as a followerBut in this instance it is the treasure store as a fixture that is intendedLays by  puts away sets apart guardsA man  a human maleOf course a man and a woman and a eunuch can lay by a treasure store but here though the teaching is given under the heading of a man nevertheless as to meaning the others should be regarded as taken in combination as well hereDeep in a waterlevel pit  what is  deep  is in the sense of its having to be plunged down to it is a  water level pit  owing to its proximity to water There is such as is deep but not waterlevel like a hundredfathom hole in a jungle tract and there is such as is waterlevel but not deep like a onespan or twospan hole scooped out in a lowlying marsh and there is such as is both deep and waterlevellike a hole deepened in a jungle tract until it is estimated that water is about to comeIt is with reference to the last that  deep in a waterlevel pit  is saidIf need arise for aid  it is inseparable from aid  thus it is for aid  what is meant is that it brings aid brings welfareNeed  kiccamkatabbam  what is meant is anything at all that ought to be done Arisen is the same as risen  what is meant is that it has appeared as a state of something that has to be done It will be there to aid me then  this demonstrates the purpose of the treasure storeIf that need for aid arisesfor he lays it by for that benefit thus  If need for my doing anything at all that will bring me aid has arisen this treasure store will be able to supply that need of minefor it should be understood that the benefit for him is simply the supplying of the need when the need has arisenHaving thus in showing the purpose of the treasure store shown the intention of acquisition of benefit he now said in order to show the intention of defence against harmIts meaning should be understood by construing the two phrases  it will be there  and  for discharge  as appropriate which are stated thus  It will be there to aid me then  and For my discharge  of debts Here is the constructionNot only does a man lay by a treasure store thinking  It will be there to aid me then  but he also lays by a treasure store thinking  It will be there for my discharge from kings were I denounced by enemies and adversaries in some such way as  He is a brigand  or  He is an adulteror  or  He is a taxevader   or it will be there for my discharge from a brigand if I am held to ransom by brigands either by their stealing money through housebreaking or by their threatening my life thus  Give so much money and gold And then there will be those to whom I owe debts and they will press me to pay off the debts and it will be there for the discharge of my debt when I am pressed by those creditorsAnd there are occasions when there is a famine when harvests fail and food is hard to get and it is not easy for one who is not rich to survive and so it will be there for me in such a famine Having thus shown with these two stanzas of two lines each that the purpose of laying by a treasure store is twofold as the intention to acquire benefit and the intention to defend against harm he now said in order to round off the statement of that same twofold purposeIts meaning is this shown as acquisition of benefit and defence against harm respectively with the words  It will be there to aid me then  and  From kings were I denouncedwith the purpose of supplying those needs With suchlike aims  what is called a store  namely money and bullion etc in the world of location  will be laid by  put away set apartFor my discharge from kings were I  Denounced or from a brigand else If held to ransom or of debts  In famine or in accidents and there are accidents due to fire or water or an unwelcome heir and it will be there for me in such accidents when they arise  With suchlike aims what in the world  Is called a store will be laid by Now since that treasure store thus laid by provides only for those who possess merit and not for anyone else the acquisition of benefits and defence against harm intended he pointed out this meaning by saying the meaning of which is as follows  Though that treasure store be it neer so well laid by be it never so thoroughly dug in and put away is what is meantdeep in a waterlevel pit  till it is reckoned to be deep in a waterlevel pit what is meant is be it never so thoroughly done as thatAnd the word tam should be regarded as a mere particle for filling out the line as in such passages as  Yatha tam appamattassa atapino  or else tam is said with change of gender from masculine to neuter where so referring back to sabbo should have been saidhow thoroughly Though be it neer so well laid by  Deep in a waterlevel pit Not all of it will yet suffice  To serve him all the timeand when taken thus its meaning is easily discoveredstill not all of it will yet suffice To serve him all the time  even all of it will not serve for all of the time that man by whom it was laid by it will not suffice for be capable of answering his aforementioned need is what is meantbut rather only some serves only sometimes or else it does not serve at allHaving thus said  Not all of it will yet suffice To serve him all the time  showing reasons why it will not serve him he now saidIts meaning is this The store gets shifted  may disappear may go away from its place in which it was sell laid by even though it has no choice of its own still with the exhaustion of its owners merit it goes to another placeOr he perhaps forgets the marks  he no longer knows what place he laid the treasure store by in Or then prompted by the exhustion of his merit Naga serpents hale it  that treasure store off remove it to another placeor else spirits fritter it away  take what they like and go off with itSo that treasure store fails to serve him for these reasons beginning with its getting shifted from its placeHaving thus told reasons for its failure to serve namely those beginning with its getting shifted from its place which are those recognized in the world he now said showing the one and only reason which is the root of all those aforesaid reasons namely exhaustion of merit And when his merit is consumed  The whole will vanish utterlyIts meaning is this And when  on the occasion on which there is the consumption of the kind of merit that produces gain in property then the kind of merit that leads to loss of property finds it opportunity and takes over and then the whole of the treasure store consisting of such riches as money bullion etc that was laid by by the layerby will vanish utterly  The store gets shifted from its place  Or he perhaps forgets the marks Or Naga Serpents hale it off  Or spirits fritter it away Or else the heirs he cannot bear  Abstract it while he does not see or else the heirs that he cannot bear dig the treasure store out of the ground and abstract it while he does not see and said to him Come great kingHaving thus stated the kind of treasure store recognized in the world which although laid by with such and such intention yet fails to serve as intended and is in various ways inseparable from the idea of vanishing away the Blessed One now said showing that excellence of merit as a treasure store in the ultimate sense in order to show which he began this TreasureStore Discourse when giving the landowner his blessingHerein with gifts should be taken in the way already stated under  Giving TrueIdeal conduct  virtuousness is bodily and verbal nontransgressionRefraining is the actofrefraining  what is meant is the hindering of cognizances ranging about among a variety of objects This is a designation for concentrationOne possessing this kind of refraining is called  one who has supreme refraining  in the passage  Who can refrain by hand and foot And speech who has supreme refraining  Some others have said that refraining is the actofrefraining and that what is meant is restraint it being then a designation for facultyrestraint Constraint is the act ofconstraining  what is meant is the quieting of defilementThis is a designation for understanding since understanding is in some instances called  understanding   as in such passages as sussūsā labhate pañña and in some instances it is the  True Idea as in such passages as and in some instances it is constraint as in such passages as After defining  gifts and the rest in this way the meaning of this stanza can be understood in brief as follows When a woman or a man shall have  with the four things namely with gifts  with virtue  with refraining and with constraint  a treasure store consisting of merit that by being done thoroughly is well laid by either in the single continuity of cognizance of these things beginning with gifts  or in the instances beginning with  shrines  in the next stanza just as a treasure store consisting of such riches as bullion gold pearls or gems is stored away by putting together in one place those things such as the gold and the restShall have with gifts or virtuousness  Or with refraining or constraint  But when a woman or a man   A store of merit well laid by or else what is intended here by  virtuousness  is all fivefactored and eightfactored virtue  in the case of laymen and virtue as PatimokkhaRule restraint in the case of bhikkhusHaving thus shown treasurestoreness in the ultimate sense by means of excellence of merit with the stanza beginning  But when a woman or a man the Blessed One now said showing the ground wherein that treasure store is well laid byHerein it should be built up  thus it is a shrine  what is meant is that it should be honoured Or it is a shrine because it has been built up That is of three kinds as a shrine by use a shrine by dedication and a relic shrineHerein the Tree of Enlightenment is a shrine by use an image of the Enlightened One is a shrine by dedication and a monument with a relicchamber containing a relic is a relic shrineThe Community is any one among those kinds defined as the Community headed by the Enlightened One and the restA person is anyone whether layman or gone forth from the house lifeHe has no room on any day on which he arrives thus he is a guest The rest is as already statedAfter defining  shrines  and the rest in this way the meaning of this stanza can be understood in brief as follows That treasure store which was called  well laid by  is well laid by on these groundsWhyBecause it is capable of giving longlasting desirable fruitand so those who give even a little at a shrine will for long gain desirable fruitaccording as it is said I gave only a single flower  But then for eighty myriad aeons I knew no woeful destination   Now if a man should see full pleasure  In giving up relative pleasure  And so too should be understood the classification of the fruit of giving on the other grounds beginning with the Community in the way in which it is stated in the Dakkhinavisuddhi Sutta  the Velama Sutta  and so on And just as the occurrence of Giving at shrines etc and the richness of its fruit have been shown so in each case as applicable there can be understood the occurrence of Virtue as Keeping and Avoiding  contingent upon whatever it may be and the richness of its fruit the occurrence of Refraining as Recollection of the Enlightened One and the richness of its fruit and the occurrence of Restraint as Insight Attention and Reviewing with that as the basis and the richness of its fruit In shrines or the Community  Or in a person or in guests Or in a mother in a father  Even in an elder brotherthis is a designation for one who should be given hospitality the moment he arrivesHaving thus shown the ground divided into shrines etc for a treasure store consisting of merit to be laid by in when it is being laid by with giving etc the Blessed One now said He did so showing what distinguishes that treasure store well laid by on these grounds from the treasure store laid by deep in a water level pitHerein with the words this treasure store is well laid by he demonstrates the kind of treasure store that is well laid by with gifts etc stated in the preceding linesUnlosable  it cannot be won from one and taken by others thus it is unlosable Ajjeyyo is also a reading the meaning of that is it ought to be got  is worth getting  ought to be got together   by one who seeks welfare and happinessWith this reading the construction should be made as follows  This treasure store ought to be got  and then after pointing out the connexion by asking Why  the construction should be completed thus  Because it is well laid by and is a follower Otherwise what was stated would be that it was what had been already well laid by that ought to be got but what has been well laid by is not still to be got It follows  thus it is a follower  the meaning is that when a man goes to the other world it does not abandon him in the provision of its fruit wherever that may beAmong what by abandoning Must be gone to he goes with this   when the time of death has appeared then with this treasure store among all the properties that must begone to  having abandoned them he goes to the other world that it would seem is the meaningWhyBecause properties are not what must be gone to Consequently if that were the meaning it would be tantamount to saying  By abandoning properties that are the distinctions of happy destination that must be gone to Therefore the meaning here should be understood as follows From among properties that by abandoning a mortal in the way stated as  The store gets shifted from its place   etc are going  he goes with this for this does not abandon him owing to its being a followerHere it may be objected that the passive gerundive namely gamaniyesu has the meaning of the alternative passive gerundive namely gantabbesu and not the meaning of the active present participle gacchantesu That need not be taken rigidlyfor in the passage  Ariya niyyanika  the meaning is are leading out  and not  must be outled   and here too the meaning is  among those that are going   not  among those that must be gone to  Or alternatively at the time of death one who wants to give something to someone is not able even to handle properties and so first those properties must be abandoned by him bodily and afterwards they must be gone from by him with cognizance that is free from longing they must be surpassed is what is meantTherefore the meaning in this case can be regarded as follows  Among properties which he first having abandoned them bodily afterwards must be gone from with cognizance In the case of the first meaning the use of the locative is in the sense of withdrawal  thus  Among properties that must be gone by abandoning him he having thus withdrawn therefrom the portion of merit as a treasure store takes this and goesfor this treasure stores substantiveessence of beingtakenandgonewithness is characterized by the properties substantiveessence of mustbegonefrom ness This treasure store is well laid by  A follower unlosable Among what by abandoning  Must be gone to he goes with thissince it has already been got before the laying bybut that will not dosince such and such properties have to be abandoned  rather such and such distinctions of destination on rebirth are  what must be gone to  In the case of the second meaning the locative is in the sense of characterizing a substantive by another substantive Having thus shown what distinguishes this merittreasure from the treasure store laid by deep in a waterlevel pit the Blessed One further said  He did so urging gods and men to busy themselves with that merit treasure by detailing  the special qualities of the merittreasure shown by him as a trader in rare goods does when he urges buyers to busy themselves with his wares by detailing the special qualities of his own goodsHerein as to no others have a share in it asddharanamanhesam asddharano annesam  the letter m is for liaison purposes as it is in such passages as adukkhamasukhaya vedandya sampayutta  And robbers cannot steal this treasure  acordharanona corehi dharano  it is not to be taken by robbers is what is meantIt must be stored  thus it is a treasurestore Having thus detailed  the special qualities of merit with two halflines he next urged them to activity in it with two more namely  So let the steadfast merit make  and  The store that is their followerHere is the meaning of them A store that no others own a share of and that robbers cannot steal is what is called merit  and not only is that store one which no others own a share of and robbers cannot steal but also it is  the store that is a follower  of which it was said in the preceding stanza  This treasure store is well laid by a never failing follower No others have a share in it  And robbers cannot steal this store So let the steadfast merit make  The store that is their follower and that follower too consists of merit therefore the steadfast one the person perfected in discovery  perfected in steadfastness let him make kayirathakareyya merit Having thus urged gods and men to activity in the meritstore by detailing its special qualities the Blessed One now said He did so showing in brief what fruit it gives to those who have become active and are pursuing the making of merit This is a store can satisfy  Every desire of gods and menBut this giving all that is desired happens only to one who has bound the merit up with an aspiration none happens without any aspirationWhy is thatBecause he observes conduct in accordance with the True Idea fair conduct  Why is thatBecause he observes conduct in accordance with the True Idea fair conduct  and similarly he said Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu possesses faith possesses virtue learning generosity understanding It occurs to him  Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the WarriorNobles of the great hallsHe exerts that cognizance decides that cognizance maintains that cognizance in beingthose determinations and those abidings of his thus maintained in being and developed lead to his reappearance there   and so onaccording as it is said If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the True Idea fair conduct should wish  Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the WarriorNobles of the great halls  it is possible that on the dissolution of the body after death he might reappear in the company of the Warrior Nobles of the great hallsand likewise   Oh that by realization myself with directknowledge I might here and now enter upon and abide in the heartdeliverance and understandingdeliverance that are taintless with exhaustion of taints  it is possibleThat is why he now said He did so showing the aspiration that causes that merits giving what is desired which aspiration is a procedure of wishing in suchandsuch wise with its requisite equipment of exertion of that cognizance deciding it and maintaining it in beingNo matter what they aspire to have  All that they get by merits graceHe now uttered the following five stanzas beginning with Beauty of looks beauty of voice He did so showing by specific limitation in each case how that all is obtainable by means of that meritHerein in the first stanza of these five to begin with beauty of looks  is goodcoloured complexion golden sheen of the skin for that is got by means of this merit store Bhikkhus since a Perfect One in a former birth formerly existing as a human being was unangry and little given to despair and since when much was said he never answered back was never irritated never felt ill will never resented and never manifested annoyance irritation hate and surliness and since he was a giver of fine soft rugs and cloaks made of fine linen fine cottonfine woolwith that action performed stored up  on his being come again to the same human state he acquires these two characteristics of a Great ManBeauty of voice is a divine kind of voice utterance like that of a karavika bird That too is obtainable by this meansaccording as it is said Bhikkhus since a Perfect One in a former birthabandoning harsh speech became one who abstained from harsh speech became a speaker of such words as are innocent pleasing to the ear and lovable as go to the heart are civil desired of many and dear to manywith that action performed stored up  on his being come again to this same human state he acquires these two characteristics of a Great ManHe has a large tongue and he has a divine voice like the call of a karavika bird Beauty of figure is well shapedness in the places proper for being evenly filled out and rounded  what is meant is construction  with evenly filled out roundedness of limbsAnd that too is obtained by this means Bhikkhus since a Perfect One in a former birthformerly existing as a human being sought the good the welfare the comfort the safety from bondage of the many thinking  How shall these have increase in faith in virtue in learning in generosity in understanding in riches and corn in fields and lands in bipeds and quadrupeds in wives and children in bondsmen servants and men in relatives in friends in kinsmen With that action performed stored up on his being come again to this same human state he acquires these three characteristics of a Great Man He has the upper torso of a lion the furrow between his shoulders is filled in and his neck  is evenly rounded  and so onAnd Sutta passages can be cited from here and there that establish obtainment of the fulfilment of aspirations by means of this meritstore in cases of others as well as of the Perfect One in this waybut this is in brief for fear of too much detail  We shall now comment on the remaining wordsBeauty of  here the whole physical frame can be understood as the  form  as it is in such passages as  When a space is equipped with bones and sinews and flesh and skin there comes to be the term a form  its elegance beauty of form not overtallness notovershortness notoverleanness notoverstout ness notoverdarkness notoverfairness is what is meantLordliness is the lordly state ownership in virtue of the state of a WarriorNoble of the great halls etc is what is meantRetinue is excellence of ones own dependents and retainers in and in the case of those gone forth from the house life it is excellence in the fourfold assembly ādhipaccañca parivāro  ādhipaccaparivāro And here it can also be understood that excellence in physical frame is expressed by  beauty of looks etc excellence of property by  lordliness and excellence of dependents and retainers by  retinue All that is got by merits grace  what he points out is that when it was stated above thus  No matter what they aspire to have all that is got by merits grace   herein this firstly is a set of six things stated with specific limitation as  beauty of looks etc all of which can be understood to be got by means of that meritaccording as it is saidHe is the colour of gold and his skin has a golden sheen  according as it is saidHaving thus shown with this stanza the excellence of godly and human kingship that is to be got by merits might he now uttered the stanza And every human excellence  showing the excellence of extinction preceded by the excellence in combined form that was stated variously in the preceding stanzasHere is a commentary on the words in it Human  it is the offspring of human beings  thus it is human  and manusi is the same as manusikaExcellence is the act of excelling  Any is an inclusion without remainder in this instance They delight by means of that when it is arisen in themselves or when it is become an aid externally thus it is delight  this is a designation either for pleasure or for what is an external basis for pleasureEven is an indefinite term in this instance The word and has the meaning of a conjunction conjoining this with the foregoing excellenceExtinction itself is extinctions excellence Now here is a commentary on the meaning All the human excellence and the delight in godly worlds mentioned by the phrases beginning with  beauty of looks  and also this extinctions excellence that can be reached by means of the states beginning with that beyond that of One Mature in Faith  that as well are the third set of things stated by specific limitation and all that is got by merits graceOr alternatively there is what is not mentioned under  beauty of looks  etc namely the human excellence classed as particular distinction in understanding etc which is demonstrated in the way beennning  They are well endowed with mindfulness  there is the living of the Divine Life here  and also the further delight in jhana etc in the godly world and then extinctions excellence of the kind already stated as well and this is the third  all stated by specific limitation that is  got by merits grace That is how the commentary on the meaning should be understood hereA godly world devaloko devanam loko in that godly worldHaving thus shown with this stanza how the excellence of extinction which can be reached by means of the state of One Mature in Faith ie a Stream Enterer etc  is to be got by merits might he now uttered the following stanza A man has excellence in friends He did so showing what is to be acquired through the state of One BothWaysLiberated  as the three True Knowledges and the means theretoHere is a commentary on the words in it By its means one excells  or one arrives at evidences of special qualities thus it is excellence   the friend himself is the excellence thus there is excellence in friends  that excellence in friendsA man has  depending onReason right together with what is the meansDenoting  he does the maintaining  of devotionOne cognizes by its means thus it is trueknowledge   One is delivered by its means or it itself is delivered  thus it is deliverance  he ivins true knowledge and deliverance  vijjavimuttivasibhavo  vijjavimuttisu vasibhavo Now here is a commentary on the meaning There is this mastery  through nonsluggishness in such andsuchwise  and this masterywon after he has found excellence in friends by depending on the Master or on some venerable companion in the Divine Life and by taking his advice and instruction has devoted reason right by practising the way as instructed this mastery which is both mastery in the three True Knowledges consisting in Recollection of Past Life the Heavenly Eye that sees the passing and reappearance of creatures according to their actions and the Knowledge of Exhaustion of Taints  Herein what is deliveranceIt is the resoluteness of cognizance and it is extinction   and mastery in deliverance classed as the eight attainments  and extinction stated thus is the fourth  all  stated by specific limitation as  got by merits graceHaving thus shown with this stanza the excellence of extinction that is to be got by the might of merit that sides with  mastery in the true knowledge and deliverance just mentioned which is also to be reached by one BothWaysLiberated who possesses the Triple True Knowledge he now uttered the following stanza  Discriminations liberations It was because those BothWaysLiberated who have reached mastery in true knowledge and deliverance and possess the triple true knowledge all get that evidencing of special qualities that consists in the discriminations etc by means of that excellence of merit and because that excellence of merit is also treatable in suchand suchwise as the footing for that evidencing that he therefore uttered this stanza with which this statement of  all  by limitation is completedAnd this understanding with its four divisions dealing with ideas meanings language and perspicuity   which are called discriminations  and these eight liberations  which are set out in the way beginning  Possessed of form he sees forms   and the perfection of disciples  which establishes the disciples excellence reachable by the Blessed Ones disciples and both kinds  namely the Hermit Enlightenment  which establishes selfbecomeness  and the plane of enlightenment  which establishes supremacy over all creatures are the fifth  all  stated by specific limitation that is  got by merits graceHaving thus shown with three stanzas what it is that was stated in general in the lines  No matter what they aspire to have All that is got by merits grace   he now concluded the teaching with the following stanza So great are the rewards it gives And he did so commending all this exercise signalized as the treasure store that can satisfy every desire  Here is a wordcommentary on it So refers back to the previous meaningIt has a great reward  thus it gives great rewards  what is meant is that it conduces to great good  mahiddhika is also a readingIt is an indicative what it indicates is the excellence of the merit stated in the stanzas from  But when a woman or a man Shall have with gifts or virtuousness  down to  So let the steadfast merit make  Namely is only a particle in the sense of confronting it confronts in this way  which is this  in order to demonstrate what was indicated by it Merits excellence punnasampada punnanam sampada For that is a term for a reasonSteadfast  those endowed with steadfastness Commend  praiseWise  those perfect in understandingA store of merit made  the state of having made meritNow here is a comment on the meaning Having thus commended the reward to be arrived ar by the might of merits excellence which begins with beauty of looks and ends with Both kinds of enlightenment the Blessed One now pointed out that same meaning summarily lauding in the same sense the greatness of the rewards of merits excellence of the kinds stated And in so doing what he meant was  It  namely  the merits excellence pointed out by me in the way beginning But when a woman or a man Shall have with gifts or virtuousness  by its bringing such great rewards gives so great rewards  and for that those like me who are the steadfast creatures preaching of the True Idea indefatigability and special quality of being true to what is commend a store of merit made in its several constituent aspects doing so not owing to partiality and with such phrases as No others have a share in it And robbers cannot steal this store  and  Bhikkhus do not fear the kinds of merit that is a designation for pleasure namely  kinds of merit  At the end of the teaching the lay follower along with many other people became established in the fruition of Stream Entry When he went into the presence of King Pasenadi of Kosala he told him what had happened The king was exceedingly contented and saying  Good householder good that you lay by a treasure store that cannot be carried off by those like me he congratulated  and greatly complimented himin the Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning the Commentary on the

HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhusThen in a certain place beside the main road the Blessed One smiledIt Occurred to the venerable Ananda What is the reason what is the cause for the Blessed Ones smileTathagatas do not smile for no reasonSo he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder and extending his hands in

there was a prosperous and busy market town called Vebhalinga with many inhabitants and crowded with peopleNow the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened lived near the market town VebhalingaIt was here in fact that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened had his monasteryThen the venerable Ananda folded his patchwork cloak in four and spreading it out said to the Blessed One Then venerable sir let the Blessed One be seatedThus this place will have been used by two Accomplished Ones Fully Enlightened OnesThe Blessed One sat down on the seatNow the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened lived near the market town VebhalingaIt was here in fact that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened had his monasteryIn Vebhalinga the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened had as a supporter as his chief supporter a potter named GhatikaraGhatikara the potter had as a friend as his close friend a brahmin student named JotipalaI hold that it is good to see that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedThe brahmin student Jotipala replied Enough my dear GhatikaraA second and third time the potter Ghatikara said My dear Jotipala let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightenedI hold that it is good to see that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedAnd a second and a third time the brahmin student Jotipala replied Enough my dear Ghatikara Then my dear Jotipala let us take a loofah and bath powder and go to the river to bathe Very well Jotipala repliedSo the potter

brahmin student Jotipala thought It is wonderful it is marvellousthat this potter Ghatikara who is of a different birth should presume to seize me by the hair when we have washed our heads Surely this can be no simple matter And he said to the potter Ghatikara You go as far as this my dear Ghatikara I go as far as this my dear Jotipala Then my dear Ghatikara let go of me Let us visit himSo Ghatikara the potter and Jotipala the brahmin student went to the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened Ghatikara after paying homage to him sat down at one sideGhatikara then said to the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened Venerable sir this is the brahmin student Jotipala my friend my close friendLet the Blessed One teach him the DhammaThen the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened instructed urged roused and encouraged Ghatikara the potter and Jotipala the brahmin student with an exposition of the DhammaAt the conclusion of the exposition having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One Kassapas words they rose from their seats and after paying homage to the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened keeping him on their right they departedThen Jotipala asked Ghatikara Now that you have heard this Dhamma my dear Ghatikara why dont you go forth from the home life into homelessness My diear Jotipala dont you know that I support my blind and aged parents Then my dear Ghatikara I shall go forth from the home life into homelessnessSo Ghatikara the potter and Jotipala the brahmin student went to the Blessed

accomplished and fully enlightened has reached Benares and is living in the Deer Park at IsipatanaSo he had a number of state carriages made ready and mounting a state carriage drove out from Bepares with the full pomp of royalty in order to see the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightenedHe went thus as far as the road was passable for carriages and then he got down from his carriage and went forward on foot to the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened After paying homage to him he sat down at one sideAt the conclusion of the exposition King Kiki of Kasi said Venerable sir let the Blessed One together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrows meal from meAnd the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened accepted in silenceThen knowing that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened had accepted he rose from his seat and after paying homage to him keeping him on his right he departedThen when the night had ended King Kiki of Kasi had good food of various kinds prepared in his own dwelling  red rice stored in the sheaf with the dark grains picked out along with many sauces and curries  and he had the time announced to the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened thus It is time venerable sir the meal is readyThen it being morning the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the dwelling of King Kiki of Kasi and sat down on the seat made readyThen with his own hands King Kiki of Kasi served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with the various kinds of good foodWhen the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl King Kiki of Kasi took a low seat sat down at one side Enough kingA second and a third time King Kiki of Kasi said Venerable sir let the Blessed One accept from me a residence for the Rains in Benares that will be helpful for the Sangha Enough kingThe king thought The Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened does not accept from me a residence for the Rains in Benares and he was very disappointed and sadThen he said Venerable sir have you a better supporter than I am I have great king There is a market town called Vebhalingawhere a potter named Ghatlkara lives He is my supporter my chief supporterNow you great king thought The Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened does not accept from me a residence for the Rains in Benares and you were very disappointed and sadThe potter Ghatikara has gone for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaHe abstains from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech and from wine liquor and intoxicants which are the basis of negligenceHe has perfect confidence in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and he possesses the virtues loved by noble onesHe is free from doubt about suffering about the origin of suffering about the cessation of suffering and about the way leading to the cessation of sufferingHe eats only in one part of the day he observes celibacy he is virtuous of good characterHe has laid aside gems and gold he has given up gold and silverHe does not dig the ground for clay using a pick with his own handHe supports his blind and aged parentsHaving destroyed the five lower fetters he is one who will reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that worldOn one occasion when I was living at Vebhalinga Venerable sir your supporter has gone out but take rice from the cauldron and sauce from the saucepan and eatI did so and went awayThen the potter Ghatikara went to his parents and asked Who has taken rice from the cauldron and sauce from the saucepan eaten and gone away My dear the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened didThen the potter Ghatikara thought It is a gain for me it is a great gain for me that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened relies on me thusAnd rapture and happiness never left him for a halfmonth or his parents for a weekOn another occasion when I was living at Vebhalinga Venerable sir your supporter has gone out but take some porridge from the vessel and sauce from the saucepan and eatI did so and went awayThen the potter Ghatikara went to his parents and asked Who has taken porridge from the vessel and sauce from the saucepan eaten and gone away My dear the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened didThen the potter Ghatikara thought It is a gain for me it is a great gain for me that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened relies on me thusAnd rapture and happiness never left him for a halfmonth or his parents for a weekOn another occasion when I was living at VebhalingaThen I addressed the bhikkhus thus Go bhikkhus and find out if there is any grass at the potter Ghatikaras house Venerable sir there is no grass at the potter Ghatikaras house there is the grass thatch on his roof Go bhikkhus and remove the grass from the potter Ghatlkaras houseThey did soThen the potter Ghatikaras parents asked the bhikkhus Who is removing the grass from the house Sister the hut of the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened is leaking Take it venerable sirs take it and bless youThen the potter Ghatikara went to his parents and asked Who has removed the grass from the roof The bhikkhus did my dear the hut of the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened is leakingThen the potter Ghatikara thought It is a gain for me it is a great gain for me that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened relies on me thusAnd the rapture and happiness never left him for a halfmonth or his parents for a weekThen that house remained three whole months with the sky for a roof and yet no rain came inSuch is the potter GhatikaraIt is a gain for the potter Ghatikara it is a great gain for him that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened relies on him thusThen King Kiki of Kasi dispatched to the potter Ghatikara five hundred cartloads of red rice stored in the sheaf and also sauce materials to go with itThen the kings men went to the potter Ghatikara and told him Venerable sir there are five hundred cartloads of red rice stored in the sheaf and also sauce materials to go with it dispatched to you by King Kikl of Kasi The king is very busy and has much to doI have enoughLet this be for the king himselfNow Ananda you may think thus Certainly someone else was the brahmin student Jotipala on that occasionBut it should not be regarded thusI was the brahmin student Jotipala oh that occasionThat is what the Blessed One saidThe venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThey abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindnessit was here in fact that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened resided and advised the Sangha of bhikkhusthat had been made ready and addressed the venerable Ananda

eclipse is an obscuration of the sun and moon obscured by which the sun and moon dont glow dont shine dont dazzleThese are the four obscurations of the sun and moon obscured by which the sun and moon dont glow dont shine dont dazzleIn the same way there are four obscurations of contemplatives  brahmans obscured by which some contemplatives  brahmans dont glow dont shine dont dazzleWhich fourThere are some contemplatives  brahmans who drink alcohol and fermented liquor who dont refrain from drinking alcohol and fermented liquorThis is the first obscuration of contemplatives  brahmans obscured

are impure dusty deadCovered with darkness slaves to craving led onthey swell the terrible charnel ground they grab at further becomingAnd a second and a third time the brahmin student Jotipala replied Enough my dear Ghatikarawhat is the use of seeing that bald pated reclusewhat is the use of seeing that baldpated reclusefor so much do I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedwhile Jotipala exchanged greetings with himand when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he too sat down at one sideThen not long after Jotipala the brahmin student had received the full admission a halfmonth after he had received the full admission the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened having stayed at Vebhalinga as long as he chose set out to wander towards Benaresand there he went to live in the Deer Park at Isipatanaand the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened instructed urged roused and encouraged King KikI of Kasi with an exposition of the DhammaI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vārāṇasī in the Deer Park at IsipatanaIf form were the self this form would not lend itself to disease It would be possible with regard to form Let my form be thus Let my form not be thusForm monks is not selfThere he addressed the group of five monksBut precisely because form is not self this form lends itself to disease And it is not possible with regard to form Let my form be thus Let my form not be thusFeeling is not selfPerception is not selfFabrications are not selfIf consciousness were the self this consciousness would not lend itself to disease It would be possible with regard to consciousness Let my consciousness be thus Let my consciousness not be thusConsciousness is not selfBut precisely because consciousness is not self consciousness lends itself to disease And it is not possible with regard to consciousness Let my consciousness be thus Let my consciousness not be thusWhat do you think monks Is form constant or inconstantInconstant lordAnd is that which is inconstant easeful or stressfulStressful lordAnd is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mine This is my self This is what I amNo lord Is feeling constant or inconstant Is perception constant or inconstant Are fabrications constant or inconstantIs consciousness constant or inconstantInconstant lordAnd is that which is inconstant easeful or stressfulStressful lordAnd is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mine This is my self This is what I amNo lordThus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near Every form is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be This is not mine This is not my self This is not what I amAny feeling whatsoeverAny perception whatsoeverAny fabrications whatsoeverAny consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near Every consciousness is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be This is not mine This is not my self This is not what I amSeeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness Disenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is releasedWith release there is the knowledge ReleasedHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for this worldThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the group of five monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the minds of the group of five monks through lack of clingingsustenance were released from effluentsOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrel SanctuaryNow on that occasion the Blessed One was sick afflicted gravely illThen the Venerable Mahacunda approached the Blessed One paid homage to him and sat down to one sideThe Blessed One then said to the Venerable Mahacunda Recite the factors of enlightenment CundaThese seven factors of enlightenment venerable sir have been rightly expounded by the Blessed One when developed and cultivated they lead to direct knowledge to enlightenment to NibbanaWhat sevenThe enlightenment factor of mindfulness has been rightly expounded by the Blessed One when developed and cultivated it leads to direct knowledge to enlightenment to NibbanaThe enlightenment factor of equanimity has been rightly expounded by the Blessed One when developed and cultivated it leads to direct knowledge to enlightenment to NibbanaThese seven factors of enlightenment venerable sir have been rightly expounded by the Blessed One when developed and cultivated they lead to direct knowledge to enlightenment to NibbanaSurely Cunda they are factors of enlightenment Surely Cunda they are factors of enlightenmentThis is what the Venerable Mahacunda saidThe Teacher approvedAnd the Blessed One recovered from that illnessIn such a way the Blessed One was cured of his illnessThus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Rajagaha in the bamboo grove in the squirrels feeding groundAt that time he was afflicted with a disease was suffering therefrom and was gravely illThen the Venerable Maha Cunda arising from his solitude at eventide approached the Blessed One saluted him and sat down beside himTo the Venerable Maha Cunda thus seated the Blessed One said O Cunda let the factors of enlightenment occur to your mindThese seven factors of enlightenment bhante  are well expounded and are cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One They conduce to perfect understanding to full realization and to NibbanaWhat are the seveni Mindfulness the factor of enlightenment bhante is well expounded by the Blessed One and is cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One It conduces to perfect understanding to full realization and to Nibbanaii Investigation of the

Blessed One They conduce to perfect understanding to full realization and to NibbanaMost assuredly Cunda they are factors of enlightenment Most assuredly Cunda they are factors of enlightenmentThus said the Venerable Maha Cundaand the Master approved of itThen the Blessed One recovered from his afflictionand thus disappeared his afflictionand said Venerable sir let the Blessed One accept from me a residence for the Rains in Benares that will be helpful for the Sanghamy residence for the Rains has already been provided formy residence for the Rains has already been provided forbut the potter Ghatikara is not and will not be sowhat is left over from embankments or thrown up by rats he brings home in a carrier when he has made a pot he says Let anyone who likes set down some selected rice or selected beans or selected lentils and let him take away whatever he likesit being morning I dressed and taking my bowl and outer robe I went to the potter Ghatlkaras parents and asked them Where has the potter gone pleaseit being morning I dressed and taking my bowl and outer robe I went to the potter Ghatlkaras parents and asked them Where has the potter gone pleasemy hut leakedplease accept themthey sat down at one side and Ghatikara the potter said to the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened Venerable sir this is the brahmin student Jotipala my friend my close friendTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatti in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas ParkThen the wanderer Vekhanassa went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himBut Kaccana why do you say This is the perfect splendour this is the perfect splendourWhat is that perfect splendourMaster Gotama that splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublimeBut Kaccana what is that splendour that is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublimeMaster Gotama that splendour is the perfect splendour that is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublimeKaccana you might continue for a long time in this wayKaccana there are these five cords of sensual pleasureForms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust Sounds cognizable by the earOdours cognizable by the noseFlavours cognizable by the tongue Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust These are the five cords of sensual pleasureNow Kaccana the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these five cords of sensual pleasure are called sensual pleasureThus sensual pleasure arises through sensual pleasures but beyond sensual pleasure there is a pleasure higher than the sensual and that is declared to be the highest among themWhen this was said the wanderer Vekhanassa said It is wonderful Master Gotama it is marvellousBut those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed who have lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached the true goal destroyed the fetters of being and are completely liberated through final knowledge  it is they who would know what sensuality is what sensual pleasure is and what the pleasure higher than the sensual isWhen this was said the wanderer Vekhanassa was angry and displeased and he reviled disparaged and censured the Blessed One saying The recluse Gotama will be worsted He then said to the Blessed One So then there are some recluses and brahmins here who without knowing the past and without seeing the future yet claim Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had ta be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingWhat they say turns out to be ridiculous it turns out to be mere words empty and hollowIf any recluses and brahmins without knowing the past and without seeing the future yet claim Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being they can be confuted in accordance with the DhammaRather let the past be Kaccana and let the future beLet a wise man come one who is honest and sincere a man of rectitudeI instruct him I teach him the Dhamma in such a way that by practising as instructed he will soon know and see for himself Thus indeed there rightly comes to be liberation from the bond that is from the bond of ignoranceSuppose Kaccana there were a young tender infant lying prone bound by stout bonds at the four limbs with the fifth at the neck and later on as a result of his growth and the maturing of his faculties those bonds loosened then he would know I am free and there would be no more bondageSo too let a wise man comeThus indeed there rightly comes to be liberation from the bond that is from the bond of ignoranceWhen this was said the wanderer Vekhanassa said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clearfor those with eyesight to see forms I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus From today let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finishedhe stood at one side and in the Blessed Ones presence he uttered this exclamation This is the perfect splendour this is the perfect splendouryet you do not indicate what that splendour isWhat fivehow well that has been expressed by Master Gotama Thus sensual pleasure arises through sensual pleasures but beyond sensual pleasure there is a pleasure higher than the sensual and that is declared to be the highest among them Kaccana for you who are of another view who accept another teaching who approve of another teaching who pursue a different training who follow a different teacher it is hard to know what sensuality is or what sensual pleasure is or what the pleasure higher than the sensual isand it was not long before their minds were freed from the corruptions without remainderI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Forest together with a large Saṅgha of approximately five hundred monks all of them arahants And most of the devatās from ten worldsystems had gathered in order to see the Blessed One  the Saṅgha of monksLet us also approach the Blessed One and on arrival let us each speak a verse in his presenceThen the thought occurred to four devatās of the ranks from the Pure Abodes The Blessed One is dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Forest together with a large Saṅgha of about five hundred monks all of them arahants And most of the devatās from ten worldsystems have gathered in order to see the Blessed One  the Saṅgha of monksThen just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm those devatās disappeared from among the Devas of the Pure Abodes and reappeared before the Blessed OneHaving paid homage to him they stood to one sideAs they were standing there one devatā recited this verse in the Blessed Ones presenceA great meeting in the woods The deva hosts have assembledWe have come to this Dhamma meeting to see the unvanquished SaṅghaThen another devatā recited this verse in the Blessed Ones presenceThere the monks are concentrated have straightened their own mindsLike a charioteer holding the reins the wise ones guard their facultiesThen another devatā recited this verse in the Blessed Ones presenceHaving cut through barrenness cut the crossbar having uprooted Indras pillar unstirredthey wander about pure unstained young nāgas well tamed by the One with EyesThen another devatā recited this verse in the Blessed Ones presenceThose who have gone to the Buddha for refuge will not go to the plane of woeOn discarding the human body they will fill the hosts of the devasThen the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks most of the devatās from ten worldsystems have gathered in order to see the Tathāgata  the Saṅgha of monksThose who in the past were Worthy Ones Rightly Self awakened at most had their devatāgathering like mine at the presentThose who in the future will be Worthy Ones Rightly Selfawakened will at most have their devatāgathering like mine at the presentI will tell you the names of the deva hosts I will describe to you the names of the deva hosts I will teach you the names of the deva hostsListen  pay close attention I will speakAs you say lord the monks responded to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One saidI will recite a verse of tributeThose who live where spirits dwell who live in mountain caves resolute concentratedmany like hidden lions who have

factors in no long time with the destruction of the taints he might realize for him self with direct knowledge in this very life the taintless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom and having entered upon it dwell in itAnd how  bhikkhus does a bhikkhu possess five factorsHere a bhikkhu is endowed with faith He has faith in the enlightenment of the Tathagata thus The Blessed One is an arahant perfectly enlightened accomplished in true knowledge and conduct fortunate knower of the world unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed teacher of devas and humans the Enlightened One the Blessed One He is seldom ill or afflicted possessing an even digestion that is neither too cool nor too hot but moderate and suitable for striving He is honest and open one who reveals him self as he really is to the Teacher and his wise fellow monks He has a roused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities he is strong  firm in exertion  not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities He is wise he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away  which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of sufferingIt is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses five factorsAnd how does a lodging possess five factors Here  the lodging is neither too far from a place for alms nor too close and it possesses a means for going and returning During the day it is not disturbed by people and at night it is quiet and still There is little contact With flies mosquitoes wind  the burning sun  and serpents One dwelling in that lodging can easily obtain robes almsfood lodging and medicines and provisions for the sick In that lodging elder bhikkhus are dwelling who are learned heirs to the heritage experts on the Dhamma experts on the discipline experts on the outlines He approaches them from time to time and inquiresHow is this Bhante What is the meaning of this Those venerable ones then disclose to him what has not been disclosed clear up what is obscure and dispel his perplexity about numerous perplexing pointsIt is in this way that a lodging possesses five factorsWhen a bhikkhu who possesses these five factors resorts to and uses a lodging that possesses these five factors in no long time with the destruction of the taints he might realize for himself with direct knowledge in this very life the taintless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom and having entered upon it dwell in itThus have I heard Once the Lord was staying in Rajagaha at the Vultures PeakAnd at that time the wanderer Nigrodha was staying at the Udumbarika lodging for wanderers with a large company of some three thousand wanderersAnd one morning early the householder Sandhana came to Rajagaha in order to see the LordThen he thought It is not the proper time to see the Blessed LordPerhaps I should go to the Udumbarika lodging for wanderers and call on NigrodhaAnd he did soAnd just then Nigrodha was sitting in the midst of a large crowd of wanderers who were all shouting and screaming and making a great clamour and indulging in various kinds of unedifying conversationThen Nigrodha saw Sandhana approaching from a distanceThe householder Sandhana a follower of the ascetic Gotama is approachingHe is one of the number of whiterobed householder followers of the ascetic Gotama in RajagahaAnd these good folk are fond of quiet they are taught to be quiet and speak in praise of quietIf he sees that this company is quiet he will most likely want to come and visit usAt this the wanderers fell silentThen Sandhana approached Nigrodha and exchanged courtesies with himThen he said Reverend sirs the way the wanderers of another faith conduct themselves when they come together is one thing they make a great clamour and indulge in all manner of unedifying conversationThen Nigrodha replied Well now householder do you know whom the ascetic Gotama talks to Whom does he converse with From whom does he get his lucidity of wisdomThe ascetic Gotamas wisdom is destroyed by the solitary life he is unused to assemblies he is no good at conversationJust as bison circling around keep to the fringesso it is with the ascetic Gotama In fact householder if the ascetic Gotama were to come to this assembly we would baffle him with a single questionNow the Lord with his divineearfaculty purified and surpassing human range heard this exchange between Sandhana and NigrodhaAnd descending from the Vultures Peak he came to the Peacocks Feeding Ground beside the Sumagadha Tank and walked up and down there in the open airThen Nigrodha caught sight of himand he called his company to order saying Gentlemen he quiet be less noisy The ascetic Gotama is walking up and down beside the Sumagadha TankHe is fond of quiet he speaks in praise of quietIf he sees that this company is quiet he will most likely want to come and visit usIf he does so we will put this question to him Lord what is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support and the perfection of the holy lifeAt this the wanderers were silentThen the Lord approached NigrodhaAt last the Blessed Lord has gone out of his way to come hereBe seated Lord a seat is preparedThe Lord sat down on the prepared seatand Nigrodha took a low stool and sat down to one sideThen the Lord said to him Nigrodha what was the subject of your conversation just now What talk have I interruptedNigrodha replied Lord we saw the Blessed Lord walking up and down at the Peacocks Feeding Ground by the Sumagadha Tank and we thought If the ascetic Gotama were to come here we could ask him this question Lord what is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support and the perfection of the holy lifeNigrodha it is hard for you holding different views being of different inclinations and subject to different influences following a different teacher to understand the doctrine which I teach my disciplesCome on then Nigrodha ask me about your own teaching about your extreme austerity How are the conditions of austerity and selfmortification fulfilled and how are they not fulfilled At this the wanderers made a great commotion and noise exclaiming It is wonderful it is marvellous how great are the powers of the ascetic Gotama in holding back with his own theories and in inviting others to discuss theirs Silencing them Nigrodha said Lord we teach the higher austerities we regard them as essential we adhere to themSuch being the case what constitutes their fulfilment or nonfulfilment Suppose Nigrodha a selfmortifier goes naked uses no polite restraints licks his hands does not come or stand still when requested He does not accept food out of the pot or panHe wears coarse hemp or mixed material shrouds from corpses rags from the dustheapHe is a pluckerout of hair and beard devoted to this practice he is a coveredthorn man making his bed on them sleeping alone in a garment of wet mud living in the open air accepting whatever seat is offered one who drinks no water and is addicted to the practice or he dwells intent on the practice of going to bathe three times before eveningWhat do you think Nigrodha is the higher austerity thereby fulfilled or notIndeed Lord it is fulfilledBut Nigrodha I maintain that this higher austerity can be faulted in various waysIn what way Lord do you maintain that it can be faultedTake the case Nigrodha of a selfmortifier who practises a certain austerityAs a result he is pleased and satisfied at having attained his endAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierOr else in so doing he elevates himself and disparages othersAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierOr else he has become intoxicated with conceit infatuated and therefore carelessAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierAgain a selfmortifier practises a certain austerity and this brings him gains honours and fame As a result he is pleased and satisfied at having attained his endAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierAgain a selfmortifier practises a certain austerity and he divides his food into two heaps saying This suits me that doesnt suit meAnd what does not suit him he eagerly rejectsAgain a selfmortifier practises a certain austerity for the sake of gains honours and fame thinking Kings and their ministers will honour me Khattiyas and Brahmins and householders and religious teachers And this is a fault in that selfmortifierAgain a selfmortifier disparages some ascetic or Brahmin saying See how he lives in abundance eating all sorts of thingsWhether propagated from roots from stems from joings from cuttings or fifthly from seeds he chews them all up with that thunderbolt of a jaw of his and they call him an ascetic  And this is a fault in that selfmortifierOr he sees another ascetic or Brahmin being made much of by families being honoured and respected and worshippedwhereas I who am a real ascetic and selfmortifier get no such treatment Thus he is envious and jealous because of those householders And this is a fault in that selfmortifierAgain a selfmortifier sits in a prominent position And this is a fault in that selfmortifierOr he goes round ostentatiously among the families as if to say See this is my way of renunciation  And this is a fault in that selfmortifierOr he behaves in an underhand wayOn being asked Do you approve of this although he does not approve he says I doIn this way he becomes a conscious liar And this is a fault in that selfmortifierAgain a selfmortifier when the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata presents the Dhamma in a way that should command his assent withholds that assent And this is a fault in that selfmortifierOr he is angry and badtemperedAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierOr he is mean and spiteful envious and jealous crafty and deceitful obstinate and proud with evil desires and under their sway with wrong views and given to extremist opinions he is tainted with worldliness holding on firmly unwilling to give upAnd this is a fault in that selfmortifierWhat do you think Nigrodha Are these things faults in the higher austerity or notCertainly they are LordIt could happen that a single selfmortifier was possessed of all these faults not to speak of just one or the other Now Nigrodha take the case of a certain selfmortifier who practises a certain austerity As a result he is not pleased and satisfied at having attained his endThis being soAgain he does not elevate himself and disparage others Thus he does not become a conscious liar In this respect he is purifiedAgain a selfmortifier when the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata presents the Dhamma in a way that should command his assent gives his assent In this respect he is purifiedAnd he is not angry or badtemperedIn this respect he is purifiedAnd he is not mean and spiteful envious and jealous crafty and deceitful obstinate and proud he is without evil desires and not under their sway without wrong views and not given to extremist opinions he is not tainted with worldliness does not hold on firmly and is not unwilling to give upIn this respect he is purifiedWhat do you think Nigrodha Is the higher austerity purified by these things or notCertainly it is Lord it attains its peak there penetrating to the pithNo Nigrodha it does not attain its peak there penetrating to the pith It has only reached the outer bark Nigrodha you may think The ascetic Gotama says this in order to get disciplesBut you should not regard it like thatLet him who is your teacher remain your teacherBut you should not regard it like thatLet your rules remain as they areOr you may think He wants us to abandon our way of lifeBut you should not regard it like thatLet your way of life remain as it wasOr you may think He wants to establish us in the doing of things that according to our teaching are wrong and are so considered among usBut you should not regard it like thatLet those things you consider wrong continue to be so consideredOr you may think He wants to draw us away from things that according to our teaching are good and are so considered among usBut you should not regard it like thatLet whatever you consider right continue to be so consideredNigrodha I do not speak for any of these reasonsThere are Nigrodha unwholesome things that have not been abandoned tainted conducive to rebirth fearful productive of painful results in the future associated with birth decay and death It is for the abandonment of these things that I teach DhammaIf you practise accordingly these tainted things will be abandoned and the things that make for purification will develop and grow and you will all attain to and dwell in this very life by your own insight and realisation in the fullness of perfected wisdomAt these words the wanderers sat silent and upset their shoulders drooped they hung their heads and sat there downcast and bewildered so possessed were their minds by Maraso that not a single one of them thinks Let us now follow the holy life proclaimed by the ascetic Gotama that we may learn it  for what do seven days matterThen the Lord having uttered his lions roar in the Udumbarika park rose up in the air and alighted on the Vultures PeakAnd the householder Sandhana also returned to RajagahaAt this Nigrodha said to the Lord Transgression overcame me Lord Foolish blind and evil as I was that I spoke thus of the LordMay the Lord accept my confession of this fault that I may restrain myself in futureIndeed Nigrodha transgression overcame you when through folly blindness and evil you spoke thus of meBut since you recognise the nature of your transgression and make amends as is right we accept your confessionFor Nigrodha it is a mark of progress in the discipline of the Noble Ones if anyone recognises the nature of his transgression and makes amends as is right restraining himself for the futureBut Nigrodha I tell you thisIf he practises what he is taught then within seven years he will attain in this life to that unequalled holy life and goal for the sake of which young men of good family go forth from the household life into homelessness by his own knowledge and realisation and he will abide thereinLet alone seven years Let alone half a month And when the householder Sandhana realised These wanderers of other views are actually listening and attending to the Lords words and inclining their minds to the higher wisdom His wisdom is destroyed by the solitary life he is no good at conversation he is right out of touchAnd at these words Nigrodha was silent and upset his shoulders drooped he hung his head and sat there downcast and bewilderedSeeing the state he was in the Lord said Is it true Nigrodha that you said thatLord it is true that I said that foolishly mistakenly and wickedlyWhat do you think NigrodhaHave you ever heard it said by wanderers who were aged venerable the teachers of teachers that those who in the past were Arahants fullyenlightened Buddhas used to talk when they came together by shouting and screaming and making a great clamour and indulging in unedifying conversationOr did they not say rather that those Blessed Ones sought lodging in the forest in the depths of the jungle free from noise with little sound far from the madding crowd undisturbed by men wellfitted for seclusion just as I do nowLord I have heardNigrodha you are an intelligent man of mature years Did it never occur to you to think The Blessed Lord is enlightened and teaches a doctrine of enlightenment he is selfrestrained and teaches a doctrine of selfrestraint he is calm and teaches a doctrine of calm He has gone beyond and teaches a doctrine of going beyond he has gained Nibbana and teaches a doctrine for the gaining of NibbanaWell then Lord how does austerity reach its peak penetrating to the pithIt would be good if the Blessed Lord were to cause my austerity to attain its peak to penetrate to the pithWell Nigrodha take the case of a selfmortifier who observes the fourfold restraintAnd then with the purified divine eye he sees beings passing away and arising base and noble well favoured and illfavoured to happy and unhappy destinations as kamma directs themWhat do you think Nigrodha Is the higher austerity purified by these things or notCertainly it is Lord It attains its peak there penetrating to the pith So indeed it is Nigrodha that austerity is so purified as to reach its peak and penetrate to the pithAnd so Nigrodha when you ask What Lord is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support and the perfection of the holy lifeI say that it is by something more farreaching and excellent that I train them through which theyrecognise as their principal support and the perfection of the holy lifeAt this the wanderers made a great commotion and noise exclaiming We and our teacher are ruined We know of nothing higher or more farreaching than our teaching Well then Lord how does austerity attain its peak penetrating to the pithIt would be good if the Blessed Lord were to cause my austerity to attain its peak to penetrate to the pithNigrodha take the case of a selfmortifier who observes the fourfold restraintHe recalls various past lives There my name was so andsomy caste was soandso  I experienced suchandsuch pleasant and painful conditions  Having passed from there I arose thereWhat do you think Nigrodha Is the higher austerity purified by these things or notCertainly it is Lord It attains its peak there penetrating to the pithNo Nigrodha it only reaches the fibres surrounding the pith Well then Lord how does austerity attain its peak penetrating to the pithIt would be good if the Blessed Lord were to cause my austerity to attain its peak to penetrate to the pithNigrodha take the case of a selfmortifier who observes the fourfold restraintAnd what is thisHere a selfmortifier does not harm a living being does not cause a living being to be harmed does not approve of such harmingIn this way a selfmortifier observes the fourfold restraintAnd through this restraint through making this his austerityThen he finds a solitary lodging at the root of a forest tree in a mountain cave or gorge a charnelground a junglethicket or in the open air on a heap of strawThen having eaten after his return from the almsround he sits down crosslegged holding his body erect having established mindfulness before himAbandoning illwill and hatred he dwells with a mind freed from them and by compassionate love for the welfare of all living beings his mind is purified of themAbandoning slothandtorpor by the perception of light mindful and clearly aware his mind is purified of slothandtorporAbandoning worryandflurry and with an inwardly calmed heart his mind is purified of worryandflurryAbandoning doubt he dwells with doubt left behind without uncertainty as to what things are wholesome his mind purified of doubtHaving abandoned these five hindrances and in order to weaken by insight the defilements of mind he dwells letting his mind filled with lovingkindness pervade one quarterAnd so he continues to pervade the whole wide world above below across and everywhere with a mind filled with lovingkindness extensive developed measureless free from hatred and illwillAnd he dwells letting his mind filled with compassion  with sympathetic joy with equanimity pervade one quarterWhat do you think NigrodhaIs the higher austerity purified by these things or notCertainly it is Lord It attains its peak there penetrating to the pithNo Nigrodha it does not attain its peak there It has only penetrated to the inner bark I mark the span of life O bird how quickly it is spedAnd standing fast in virtues ten the next world never dreadAlmsgiving justice penitence meek spirit temper mildPeace mercy patience charity with morals undefiledQueen Sīlavatī being a wise woman thought What will be the issue of all this At the end of one or two days she said to the king We are anxious to see our daughterinlawHe readily assented and sent for his daughterPabhāvatī magnificently dressed and surrounded by a band of her attendants came and saluted her motherinlawOn seeing her the queen at once thought This maiden is very lovely and my son is illfavouredShould she see him she will not stay a single day but will run away I must devise some schemeAddressing the Madda king she said My daughterinlaw is quite worthy of my son howbeit we have an hereditary observance in our family If she will abide by this custom we will take her to be his brideWhat is this observance of yoursIn our family a wife is not allowed to see her husband by daylight until she has conceivedIf she will act up to this we will take herThe king asked his daughter My dear will you be able to act thusYes dear father she repliedThen king Okkāka bestowed much gear on the Madda king and departed with herAnd the Madda king despatched his daughter with a vast retinueOnce upon a time when Brahmadatta was ruling in Benares a forester named Sura who dwelt in the kingdom of Kāsi went to the Himalayas to seek for articles of merchandiseThere was a certain tree there that sprang up to the height of a man with his arms extended over his head and then divided into three partsIn the midst of its three forks was a hole as big as a wine jarand when it rained this hole was filled with water Round about it grew two myrobalan  plants and a pepper shrub and the ripe fruits from these when they were cut down fell into the holeNot far from this tree was some selfsown paddy The parrots would pluck the heads of rice and eat them perched on this treeAnd while they were eating the paddy and the husked rice fell thereSo the water fermenting through the suns heat assumed a bloodred colourIn the hot season flocks of birds being thirsty drank of it and becoming intoxicated fell down at the foot of the tree and after sleeping awhile flew away chirping merrilyAnd the same thing happened in the case of wild dogs monkeys and other creaturesThe forester on seeing this said If this were poison they would die but after a short sleep they go away as they list it is no poison And he himself drank of it and becoming intoxicated he felt a desire to eat fleshand then making a fire he killed the partridges and cocks that fell down at the foot of the tree and roasted their flesh on the live coals and gesticulating with one hand and eating flesh with the other he remained one or two days in the same spotLargeeyed and peerless one etcThis was a story the Master while sojourning at Jetavana told of a female noviceA girl of good family at Sāvatthi they say recognizing the misery of the lay life embraced asceticism and one day went with other Sisters to hear the Law from the Bodhisatta as he sat preaching from a magnificent throne and observing his person to be endued with extreme beauty of form arising from the power of illimitable merit she thought I wonder whether in a former existence those I once ministered to were this mans wivesThen at that very moment the recollection of former existences came back to her In the time of Chaddanta the elephant I was previously existing as this mans wifeAnd at the remembrance great joy and gladness sprang up in her heartIn her joyous excitement she laughed aloud as she thought Few wives are well disposed to their husbands most of them are ill disposed I wonder if I were well or ill disposed to this manAnd calling back her remembrance she perceived that she had harboured a slight grudge in her heart against Chaddanta the mighty lord of elephants who measured one hundred and twenty cubits and had sent Sonuttara a hunter who with a poisoned arrow wounded and killed himThen her sorrow awoke and her heart grew hot within her and being unable to control her feelings bursting into sobs she wept aloudOn Seeing this the Master broke into a smile and on being asked by the assembly of the Brethren What Sir was the cause of your smiling he said Brethren this young Sister wept on recalling a sin she once committed against me And so saying he told a story of the pasthe is in retreatit is not the proper time to see the meditating monksthey are in retreatabout kings robbers ministers armies dangers war food drink clothes beds garlands perfumes relatives carriages villages towns and cities countries women heroes street and wellgossip talk of the departed desultory chat speculation about land and sea talk of being and nonbeingand he called his followers to order saying Be quiet gentlemen dont make a noise gentlemenand then sat down to one sideThe Blessed Lords way is different he seeks a lodging in the forest in the depths of the jungle free from noise with little sound far from the madding crowd undisturbed by men well fitted for seclusionhe is right out of touchwe would knock him over like an empty potand Nigrodha said Come Blessed Lord welcome Blessed LordOr else he elevates himself and disparages othersOr else he becomes intoxicated with conceit infatuated and therefore carelesswhile what suits him he eats up greedily recklessly and passionately not seeing the peril with no thought for the consequences And this is a fault in that selfmortifierand he thinks They make much of that richliver they honour him respect him and worship himor although he does approve he says I do notin this respect he is purifiedhe does not take what is not given or cause it to be taken or approve of such takinghe does not tell a lie or cause a lie to be told or approve of such lyinghe does not crave for sensepleasures cause others to do so or approve of such cravinghe takes an upward course and does not fall back into lower thingsAbandoning hankering for the world he dwells with a mind freed from such hankering and his mind is purified of itthen a secondthen a thirdthen a fourth extensive developed measureless free from hatred and illwillfree from hatred and illwillThus he remembers various past lives their conditions and detailsfree from hatred and illwillThus he remembers various past lives their conditions and detailshe said to Nigrodha Reverend Nigrodha you said to me Come now householder do you know whom the ascetic Gotama talks toSo now that the Blessed Lord has come here why dont you baffle him with a single question and knock him over like an empty potthe way you and your teachers doit said that those who were Arahants fullyenlightened Buddhas did not indulge in loud talkbut sought lodging in the forestjust as the Blessed Lord does nowLet an intelligent man come to me who is sincere honest and straightforward and I will instruct him I will teach him Dhammain six yearsfive four three two yearsseven monthssix months five four three two months one month half a monthin seven days he can gain that goalOr you may think He wants us to abandon our rulesThen the Lord said Every one of these foolish men is possessed by the evil oneThus have I heard Once the Lord was styaing at Nalanda in Pavarikas mangogroveAnd the Venerable Sariputta came to see the Lord saluted him sat down to one sideYou have spoken boldly with a bulls voice Sariputta you have roared the lions roar of certaintyHow is this Have all the Arahant Buddhas of the past appeared to you and were the minds of all those Lords open to you so as to say These Lords were of such virtue such was their teaching such their wisdom such their way such their liberationNo LordAnd have you perceived all the Arahant Buddhas who will appear in the futureNo LordWell then Sariputta you know me as the Arahant Buddha and do you know The Lord is of such virtue such his teaching such his wisdom such his way such his liberationNo LordSo Sariputta you do not have knowledge of the minds of the Buddhas of the past the future or the presentThen Sariputtahave you not spoken boldly with a bulls voice and roared the lions roar of certainty with your declaration Lord the minds of the Arahant Buddhas of the past future and present are not open to meBut I know the drift of the DhammaLord it is as if there were a royal frontier city with mighty bastions and a mighty encircling wall in which was a single gate at which was a gatekeeperAnd he constantly patrolling and following along a path might not see the joins and clefts in the bastion even such as a cat might creep throughBut whatever larger creatures entered or left the city must all go through this very gateAnd it seems to me Lord that the drift of the Dhamma is the sameAll those Arahant Buddhas of the past attained to supreme enlightenment by abandoning the five hindrances defilements of mind which weaken understanding having firmly established the four foundations of mindfulness in their minds and realised the seven factors of enlightenment as they really areAll the Arahant Buddhas of the future will do likewiseSo I came once to the Blessed Lord to listen to DhammaAnd the Blessed Lord taught me Dhamma most excellently and perfectly contrasting the dark with the lightAnd as he did so I gained insight into that Dhamma and from among the various things I established one in particular which was serene confidence in the Teacher that the Blessed Lord is a fullyenlightened Buddha that the Dhamma is well taught by the Blessed Lord and that the order of monks is welltrainedAlso lord the Blessed Lords way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the

the telling of thoughts in four waysAlso unsurpassed is the Blessed Lords way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the attainment of visionHere some ascetic or Brahmin by means of ardour endeavour

passing away and arising base and noble wellfavoured and illfavoured to happy and unhappy destinations as kamma directs them and he knows These beings on account of misconduct of body speech or thought or disparaging the Noble Ones have wrong view and will suffer the kammic fate of wrong viewAt the breakingup of the body after death they are reborn in a lower world a bad destination a state of suffering hellBut these beings on account of good conduct of body speech or thought of praising the Noble Ones have right view and will reap the kammic reward of right viewAt the breakingup of the

for a clansman endowed with confidence to achieve by putting forth effort and by persistence by human effort human exertion and human endurance that the Blessed Lord has achievedFor the Blessed Lord gives himself up neither to the pleasures of the senses which are base vulgar for worldlings and not for the Noble and unprofitable nor to selftorment which is painful ignoble and unprofitableLord if I were asked Well now friend Sariputta have there ever been in the past any ascetics and Brahmins more exalted in enlightenment than the Blessed Lord  I should say NoIf asked Will there be any such in the future  I should say NoIf asked Is there any such at present  I should say NoAgain if I were asked Have there been any such in the past equal in enlightenment to the Blessed Lord  I should say YesIf asked Will there be any such in the future  I should say YesBut if I were asked Are there any such at present equal in enlightenment to the Blessed Lord  I should say NoAnd if I were then asked Venerable Sariputta why do you accord this highest recognition to one and not the other  I should say I have heard and received it from the Blessed Lords own lips There have been in the pastI have also heard and received it from the Blessed Lords own lips that it is not possible it cannot be that in one and the same worldsystem two Arahant supreme Buddhas should arise simultaneously No such situation can existLord if I were to reply thus to such questions would I be speaking in conformity with the Blessed Lords word and not misrepresenting him by departing from the truth Would I be explaining Dhamma correctly so that no fellowfollower of the Dhamma could contest it or find occasion for censure Certainly Sariputta if you answered like this you would not misrepresent me you would be explaining Dhamma correctly and not laying yourself open to censureAt this the Venerable Udayi said to the Lord It is wonderful Lord it is marvellous how content the Blessed Lord is how satisfied and restrainedIf the wanderers professing other doctrines were able to discern in themselves even one of such qualities they would proclaim it with a bannerIt is wonderfulWell then Udayi just observeIf such wanderers were able to discern in themselves even one of such qualities they would proclaim it with a bannerBut the Tathagata is contentThen the Lord said to Sariputta And therefore you Sariputta should frequently speak about this matter to monks and nuns to male and female layfollowersAnd any foolish people who have doubts or queries about the Tathagata will by listening to such talk have their doubts and queries resolvedThis was how the Venerable Sariputta proclaimed his confidence in the LordAnd so one name for this exposition is The Serene Faithand said It is clear to me Lord that there never has been never will be and is not now another ascetic or Brahmin who is better or more enlightened than the Lordwise skilled and clever who kept out strangers and let in those he knewand you Lord who are now the Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha have done the sameSince this commentary will be clearer if we first examine the grounds on which the Exalted One delivers a sutta we will deal with this matter first There are four grounds for the delivery of a sutta personal inclination  the inclination of others  the proposal of a question  and the occurrence of a special incident Among these those suttas which the Exalted One declares entirely through his own inclination without being requested by others have personal inclination as the ground for their deliverySome examples of this class are the Akankheyya Sutta  the Vattha Sutta  the Mahasatipatthana Sutta  the Mahasalayatanavibhanga Sutta  the Ariyavamsa Sutta  and many suttas on the right endeavours the bases of spiritual success the faculties powers factors of enlightenment and factors of the pathThose suttas which he declares by reason of the inclinations of others after discerning their inclination acquiescence state of mind aspiration and capacity for understanding have the inclinations of others as the ground for their delivery An instance is the case of Rahula when the Exalted One perceiving that the factors maturing towards emancipation had reached maturity in Rahula thought Let me now lead Rahula to the destruction of the cankersSome suttas of this class are the Ciilarahula Sutta  the Maharahula Sutta  the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta  and the Dhatuvibhanga Sutta When the four assemblies the four classes nagas supannas gandhabbas asuras yakkhas the gods of the sense sphere heavens and Mahabrahmas approach the Exalted One and ask questions about the factors of enlightenmentthose suttas have the proposal of a question as the ground for their delivery To this class belong numerous suttas of the Samyuttanikaya and the Sakkapanha  Culavedalla  Mahavedalla  Samannaphala  and other suttasAnd those suttas declared because a special incident has occurredExamples are the Dhammadayada  Culasihanada  the Candupama Puttamamsupama Darakkhandhupama Aggikkhandhupama Phenapindupama and Paricchattakupama SuttasOf these four this sutta has the occurrence of a special incident as the ground for its deliveryAnd what was that incidentThe arising of conceit on account of learningFor it is told five hundred brahmins who were masters of the three Vedas heard the Exalted One teaching the Dhamma and recognizing the danger in sense pleasures and the benefit in renunciation went forth into homelessness in his presence In no long time they mastered the entire word of the Buddha and on account of their learning gave rise to conceit Whatever the Exalted One says they thought that we quickly understand The Exalted One does not say anything which does not come within scope of the three genders the four kinds of terms and the seven declensions Thus there is nothing in what he says that presents a knotty problem to usAs a result they neglected to show proper reverence for the Exalted One rarely going to attend upon him or to listen to him teach the DhammaThe Exalted One understood the course their minds were taking and aware that it would not be possible for them to realize the path or the fruit so long as the pillar of conceit was not uprooted from their minds he made their conceit the occasion for the delivery of a sutta Skillful in teaching he undertook this teaching on  the exposition of the root of all dhammas for the purpose of shattering their conceitOf all means without exception For the word all expresses the lack of an exceptionThe word dhamma is found used in the following senses the scriptures  the Truths  concentration  wisdom  nature  things endowed with a specific nature  emptiness  merit  a disciplinary offense  the knowable  etcHe saw the Dhamma understood the Dhamma in the sense of the TruthsThose Exalted Ones were of such dhammas concentrationTruth dhamma fortitude generosity Of a nature to be born of a nature to grow old of a nature to die natureWholesome dhammas  things endowed with a specific natureOn that occasion there are dhammas emptinessDhamma well practised issues in bliss meritTwo dhammas are unfixed a disciplinary offenseAnd in the passage All dhammas in all their modes enter the threshold of the Exalted Ones portal of knowledge it is the knowableHere the word occurs in the sense of things endowed with a specific natureThis is the wordmeaning They hear their own characteristics thus they are dhammas The word root The word pariyaya occurs in the texts in the sense of teaching Here it has the meaning of teaching and causeThus the phrase the exposition of the root of all dhammas signifies the cause designated the particular rootcause of all dhammas or the teaching of the cause of all dhammas But this sutta has to be carefully interpreted It is not all specific natured dhammas of the four planes that is indicated by the words all dhammasbut only all dhammas pertaining to the three planes included in personality  This here is the purportHerein he is uninstructed needs to be taught because he possesses neither learning nor spiritual achievement For he who possesses neither the learning running counter to the activity of conceiving because he has neglected to study question and discriminate the aggregates elements sense bases truths law of conditionality and foundations of mindfulness etc nor spiritual achievements because he has failed to achieve what should be achieved by practice is said to be  uninstructed  on account of his deficiency in learning and spiritual achievementHe is one who needs to be taughtHe isThe worldling is socalled because he generates a multitude of diverse defilements etcAs it is said  They generate a multitude of defilements hence they are worldlings They have not destroyed the multiple forms of personalityview they look up to a multitude of teachers they have not emerged from the multitude of destinations they form multiple kammaformations they are swept away by a multitude of floods afflicted by a multitude of afflictions consumed by a multitude of fevers hence they are worldlings They are lustful and greedy for the five multiple strands of sense pleasure therein they are bourd infatuated addicted attached fastened and confinedhence they are worldlings They are obstructed hindered and enveloped by the five multiple hindrances there they are enclosed concealed and incarceratedhence they are worldlings Again one who is included among the incalculable multitude of people who live according to an inferior doctrine and are averse to the doctrine of the ariyans is called a worldlingAnd a person distinct or remote from the ariyans endowed with such noble qualities as virtue learning etc is called a worldlingBetween the two types of worldlings mentioned in the following verse it is the blind worldling who is called the uninstructed worldlingThe Enlightened One the kinsman of the sun Speaks of the worldling in a twofold wayOne is the worldling blinded by darkness The other the worldling noble and goodThe ariyans are socalled because they are remote from the defilements because they are not heading towards decline because they are heading towards growth and because they are worthy of being honoured by the world together with its gods  Buddhas paccekabuddhas and disciples of the Buddhas are called ariyans Or the Buddhas alone are called ariyans herewhile the phrase the good men applies to paccekabuddhas and disciples as wellMen who shine through their possession of supramundane qualities are called good men Or both words apply to all threeNow he who by nature has no regard for the ariyans and does not welcome their sight is one  who is without regard for the ariyansThis type of man is of two kinds he who does not see them with the eye and he who does not see them with knowledge And here it is not seeing them with knowledge that is intendedFor even though they be seen with the fleshly eye or with the divine eye they are still unseenThough Sona Sigala and others saw ariyans with their eyesHere is a story to illustrate this A cankerless elder had a personal attendant who had become a monk in old age One day after the two had walked for alms while following the elder carrying the latters bowl and outer robe the attendant asked Venerable sir the ariyans what are they likeThe elder replied  Here there is an old man walking together with an ariyan doing his duties towards him carrying his bowl and robe yet even he does not know what the ariyans are like So difficult to know are the ariyans friendAnd though this was said still the attendant didnt get the pointThence it is not seeing with the eyes that is meant by the phrase regard  but seeing with knowledgeAs it is said What is your purpose Vakkali in seeing this foul body He who sees the Dhamma Vakkali he sees me Therefore even though one sees the ariyans with ones eyes so long as one does not see the characteristics of impermanence seen by the ariyans and does not achieve the Dhamma achieved by the ariyans for so long the ariyan state and the dhammas constituting an ariyan remain unseen and one is described as a person  without regard for the ariyansThat is without skill in the ariyan Dhamma classified into the foundations of mindfulness etcBecause he lacks in all of this Hes said to be undisciplinedThis discipline is twofold the discipline of restraint and the discipline of abandoning And each part of this twofold discipline is again divided into fiveThe discipline of restraint is fivefold as restraint by virtue  by mindfulness  by knowledge  by patience  and by energy He guards the faculty of the eye he acquires restraint over the faculty uf the eye this is restraint by mindfulnessThose streams which flow throughout the world Ajita said the LordHe patiently endures cold and heat  this is restraint by patience He does not tolerate an arisen thought of sensual desire he abandons it  this is restraint by energyThis entire fivefold restraint is called  restraint  and discipline  because it respectively restrains and disciplines any bodily misconduct which should be restrained and disciplinedThus the discipline of restraint is classified as fivefoldThus personalityview is abandoned by the defining of mentalitymateriality the views of acausality and wrong causal relationships by the discernment of conditions uncertainty in regard to this by the subsequent transcending of doubts the assumption of  I  and  mine  by the insightcomprehension of groups the perception of the path in what is not the path by the discrimination of the path from what is not the path annihilationism by the perception of arising eternalism by the perception of fall the perception of fearlessness in the fearful by the perception of fear the perception of satisfaction by the perception of unsatisfactoriness the perception of delight by the contemplation of disenchantment the nondesire for release by the knowledge desiring release nonequanimity by the knowledge of equanimity running contrary to the structure of dhammas and to nibbana by conformityknowledge and the assumption of the sign of formations by changeoflineage  This is called  abandoning by factorsubstitutionAbandoning by suppression is the abandonment of the hindrances etc by the obstructive power of concentration either at the level of access or absorption  This is likened to preventing the growth of watermoss by striking the surface of the water with a potAbandoning by eradication is the abandonment of the flock of defilements by completely severing the possibility of their occurrence It is achieved through the development of the four supramundane paths and occurs in the individual mentalcontinua of the four individuals attaining to these pathsThe subsiding of the defilements at the four moments of fruition is the abandoning by subsidingNibbana in which all that is conditioned is abandoned by the escape from all that is conditioned is the abandoning by escapeSince this entire fivefold abandoning is abandoning in the sense of giving up  and discipline in the sense of disciplining it is called the discipline of abandoningOr else it is called the discipline of abandoning because whatever is abandoned is also disciplinedThus this discipline of abandoning is classified as fivefoldBecause his restraint is repeatedly disrupted and because he has not abandoned what should be abandoned the uninstructed worldling lacks this discipline that is described briefly as twofold and in detail as tenfold And lacking it he is said to be  undisciplinedThe same method applies to the corresponding statements in terms of the good menAs it is said  Those who are ariyans are also good menand those who are good men are also ariyansIn order to show this topic by means of a teaching which has a dhamma as subject and an individual as term of expressionFor the teaching of the Buddha is of four kinds a teaching which has dhammas as subject and dhammas as terms of expression  a teaching which has individuals as subject and dhammas as terrms of expression  a teaching which has individuals as subject and individuals as terms of expression  and a teaching which has dhammas as subject and individuals as terms of expression Therein There are bhikkhus these three feelingsWhat are the threePleasant feeling painful feeling and neither pleasant nor painful feelingThis person consists of six elements six bases of contact eighteen mental rangings and four determinations  this is a teaching which has individuals as subject and dhammas as terms of expression There are bhikkhus three kinds of individuals existing in the worldWhat are the threeThe blind the oneeyed and the twoeyedAnd What bhikkhus is the fear of a bad destinationHerein bhikkhus someone reflects  The result of bodily misconduct in the life to come is evilIn the present case since the worldling consists of the bases which have not been fully understood  and the conceiving which is the root of all the dhammas intended here is itself rooted in lack of full understanding  therefore he describes the worldling first for when he is introduced the meaning will be made clear through a teaching which has individuals as terms of expressionhindrancesclingingaggregatesthe best treasure of man and so onand the Exalted One speaks a sutta in reply these have the occurrence of a special incident as the ground for their pronouncementsince it was delivered by the Exalted One on account of the occurrence of a special incidentand signifies the lack of an exception in whatever term it comes into connection withIn the passage Herein a bhikkhu masters the Dhamma the suttas songs etc  it occurs in the sense of the scriptureswisdomhere means particular root cause cause and turn called a worldling for such reasons As that he generates a multitude of thingsBecause he is immersed in the herd And because he is a man who is distinctthat is Buddhas paccekabuddhas and disciples are all both ariyans and good menfor these eyes apprehend only the outer appearance of the ariyans not their interior ariyan statethey were not seers of the ariyansHereThe discipline is first twofold Each part again divides by fiveTherein He is endowed perfectly endowed with this restraint of the Patimokkha  this is restraint by virtueMindfulness serves to curb them inThis I call the restraint of the streamsBut wisdom only turns them off this indicates restraint by knowledgeThe discipline of abandoning is also fivefold as abandoning by factorsubstitution  by suppression  by eradication  by subsiding  and by escape Among these the abandoning by factor substitution is the abandoning of a negative factor by the class of insightknowledge opposed to it in the same way that darkness is abandoned when a lamp is litfor there is no difference in meaningWhether the ariyans is said or the good men the Dhamma of the ariyans or the Dhamma of the good men the discipline of the ariyans  or  the discipline of the good men these are one identical the same equivalents interchangeable termsWhy does the Exalted One after announcing I will teach you bhikkhus the exposition of the root of all dhammas proceed to describe the worldling without even teaching the exposition of the root this is a teaching which has dhammas as subject and dhammas as terms of expression this is a teaching which has individuals as subject and individuals as terms of expression this is a teaching which has dhammas as subject and individuals as terms of expressionthat is to say the four foundations of mindfulness the four right efforts the four roads to power the five spiritual faculties the five mental powers the seven factors of enlightenment the Noble Eightfold PathBy these a monk through the destruction of the corruptions cay in this very life by his own superknowledge realise and attain the corruptionfree liberation of heart and liberation by wisdom and abide thereinHE PERCEIVES EARTH AS EARTH Having thus described the worldling the Master goes on to show his manner of conceiving the bases such as earth etc which is the generative source of all the dhammas included in personalityTherein earth is fourfold characteristicearth  composite earth  objectified earth  and earth as conventional designations In the passage What friends is the internal earth elementThat which is internal belonging to oneself hard solid  this is characteristicearthIn the passage  If he should dig the earth or cause the earth to be dug this is composite earthThe twenty parts of the body beginning with headhairs etc and the external elements such as iron and copper are also included in composite earthFor composite earth consists of earth together with its accompanying material dhammas such as colour etc somebody who obtains jhana with the earthkasina as basis and is reborn in the world of the gods gains the name  earth deity  after his means of arriving at such a stateAll these meanings of the word  earth  are relevant to the present contextFor whatsoever instance among these four kinds of earth the worldling perceives as earth he perceives  it is earth  he perceives as a segment of earth  he perceives through a perversion of perception seizing upon the conventional expression it is earth  Or without releasing this segment of earth he perceives it as a being or as belonging to a beingWhy does he perceive it in this way This should not be askedfor like a madman the worldlingOr else the reason is that he has no regard for the ariyans etcHAVING PERCEIVED EARTH AS EARTH Having perceived earth with a perverted perception the worldling afterwards conceives it ie construes or discriminates it through the gross proliferating tendencies of craving conceit and views which are here called conceivings  This accords with the statement Concepts due to proliferation are grounded upon perception  He apprehends it in diverse ways contrary Thence it is said  He conceives earthTo show the ways in which he conceives it by a gross method the twenty parts of the body such as headhairs bodyhairs etc may be mentioned as internal earth  The external earth may be understood throughthe passage in the Vibhanga  What is the external earth elementWhatever is external and is hard solid hardness the state of being hard exterior not kammically acquired such asiron copper tin lead silver pearl gem cats eye shell stone coral silver coin gold ruby variegated precious stone grass wood gravel potsherd earth rock mountain The earthsign in the triad of internal objects may also be included  This is the interpretation of the meaningHE CONCEIVES EARTH Through the three conceivings he conceives  I am earth earth is mine  another is earth earth belongs to another Or else he conceives internal earth through the conceiving of craving through the conceiving of conceit and through the conceiving of views Or alternatively he conceives internal earth by the conceiving of craving through the conceiving of conceit and through the conceiving of viewsHowHe arouses desire and lust for the headhairs etc he relishes them delights in them welcomes them and remains cleaving to themAnd so too for the bodyhairs nails teeth skin or any other stimulating objectThus he conceives internal earth by the conceiving of cravingLet my head hairs etc be thus in the futureLet my bodyhairs be thus  etc Or he yearns for them with delight Or resolving his mind on the acquisition of what he has not obtained he thinks  By this virtue  or by this holy life may I have moist soft delicate blueblack hair etcAgain on account of the beauty or ugliness of his own head hairs etc he arouses conceit  I am superior  or  I am equal  or I am inferiorThus he conceives internal earth through the conceiving of conceitHe adheres to the headhairs etc as a soul  according to the method that has come down The soul and the body are the same thus he conceives internal earth through the conceiving of viewsOr else in direct contrast to the method given in the suttas   The internal earth element and the external earth element are only the earth element This is not mine  he adheres to the earth element in the headhairs etc as  This is mine this am I this is my selfIn this way too he conceives internal earth through the conceiving of viewsThus he conceives internal earth through the three conceivingsAs the internal so the externalHowHe arouses desire and lust for iron copper etcThinking  iron is mine copper is mine he takes possession of them  guards them and keeps watch over them Thus he conceives external earth through the conceiving of cravingAgain on account of the beauty or ugliness of his own iron or copper possessions etc he arouses conceit  I am superior  or  I am equal  or  I am inferior Thus he conceives external earth through the conceiving of conceitThen perceiving a soul in iron he adheres to iron as a soulOr else  Herein someone considers the earthkasina as the self thinkingThe earthkasina is I I am the earthkasina In this way too he conceives external earth through the conceiving of viewsThus he conceives external earth through the three conceivingsIn this way the statement he conceives earth is to be interpreted in terms of the three conceivingsThe remainder we will discuss only in briefHE CONCEIVES IN EARTH Here in earth is the locative caseTherefore he conceives  I am in earth he conceives  There is an obstruction  an impediment  for me in earth he conceives Another is in earth he conceives There is an obstruction an impediment for another in earth This is the meaning hereOr alternatively this statement may be interpreted according to the following method  How does one consider the self to be in material formHere someone regards feeling perception the mental formations and consciousness as the self and thinks This self of mine in material form Thus he regards the self as in material form  In this way assuming feeling etc to be the self he misconstrues some instance of earth either internal or external to be the locus for this self Conceiving  This self of mine is in earth he conceives in earth This is the way he conceives through viewsThe conceiving of craving and conceit should be understood as the affection he arouses for this self of his and the conceit based upon itWhen in this same way he conceives the self of another to be in earth this is the conceiving of viewsBut the other types of conceiving are also recognizedHE CONCEIVES FROM EARTH Here  from earth  is the ablative caseTherefore he conceives from earth should be understood to mean that he conceives himself or another together with their accessories to originate or to emanate from earth or he conceives the self to be other than the earth  This is his conceiving of viewsThe conceivings of craving and conceit can be understood as the affection and conceit he arouses in regard to the base conceived with the conceiving of viewsOthers take the phrase  he conceives from earth  to mean that after developing meditation upon a limited earthkasina he assumes the existence of an immeasurable self which is different from the kasina object and conceives  my self is external to earthHE CONCEIVES EARTH IS MINE Here he lays claim to the entire great earth by way of craving thus in this case only one conceiving the conceiving of craving is relevantThis interpretation applies to all instances of earth internal and external divided according to the aforesaid classification eg  headhairs are mine bodyhairs are mine iron is mine copper is mineHE DELIGHTS IN EARTH He delights in earth with its aforementioned classifications he relishes it clings to itIf this meaning has already been shown by the statement  he conceives earth why is it here said  he delights in earth This has not been explained by the ancients For the Exalted One has fully penetrated that element of Dhamma which when fully penetrated confers elegance in teaching through diverse and variegated methodsTherefore after first showing the origination of defilements by way of conceiving he now shows the same thing by way of delighting as an example of his elegance in teachingOr  For one who conceives earth conceives in earth conceives from earth conceives earth is mine is not able to abandon the craving or views founded upon earth therefore he also delights in earthBut he who delights in earth delights in suffering  and suffering is the danger he says this in order to point out the dangerFor the Exalted One has said  Bhikkhus he who delights in the earth element delights in suffering He who delights in suffering I declare is not released from suffering WHAT IS THE REASON BECAUSE IT HAS NOT BEEN FULLY UNDERSTOOD BY HIM I DECLARE Having thus shown the worldlings conceiving and delight based upon earth with these words the Master reveals the reason why the worldling conceives and delights in earthThis is the meaningIf it is asked For what reason does the worldling conceive earth Why does he conceive and delight in earththe answer is  because it has not been fully understood by him ie because he has not fully understood the baseHe who fully understands the earth understands it by the three types of full understanding the full understanding of the known  the full understanding of scrutinization  and the full understanding of abandoning Therein what is the full understanding of the knownHe fully understands the earth element thus  This is the internal earth element this the external earth element This is its characteristic this its function manifestation and proximate cause This is full understanding of the knownWhat is the full understanding by scrutinizationHaving known it in this way he scrutinizes the earth element in fortytwo modes as impermanent suffering a sickness etc  This is full understanding by scrutinizationWhat is the fall understanding by abandoningHaving scrutinized it in this way he abandons desire and lust for the earth element through the supreme path  This is full understanding by abandoningOr alternatively the defining of mentalitymateriality is the full understanding of the knownHe who fully understands earth undetstands it by these three full understandings But for the worldling there is no such full understanding Therefore due to his lack of full understanding he conceives earth and delights in itSomeone perceives the earthkasina here the objectified earth is the earthkasina also called the earthsign  Earth as conventional designationseizes upon anything he can in whatever way he canor as the Exalted One will say later on because it has not been fully understood by himThus in this way he conceives internal earth through the conceiving of cravinghe relishes them delights in them welcomes them and remains cleaving to themthe same method in regard to copper etcThus he conceives external earth by the conceiving of viewshe considers the earthkasina and the self as nondual   he interprets the earthsign as a self according to the method given in the Patisambhidamagga but I offer my own opinion as a display of elegance of teaching or in order to point out the danger the insight comprehension of the groups as far as conformity knowledge is the full understanding by scrutinizationand the knowledge of the ariyan path is the full understanding by abandoningin four waysthus one descends into the mothers womb unknowing stays there unknowing and leaves it unknowingin four waysbut through hearing a sound made by humans nonhumans or devas That is the second waybut by applying ones mind and attending to something conveyed by SoundThat is the third wayby divining anothers thoughts in ones mind and one says As far as soandsos mindforce is directedso his thoughts will turn to that thingWater as water  Water like earth is fourfold characteristic composite objectified and conventional designationAmong these  What is the internal waterelementThat which is internal belonging to oneself water liquidity moisture moistness the internal coherence factor of matter kammically acquired etc  characteristicwater is explained thus Taking up the water kasina he apprehends the sign in water this is composite waterThe rest is the same as in the case of earthBut by way of interpretation the internal water element is given with the twelve items beginning thus Bile phlegm etc  The external water element should be understood thus  What is the external water elementThat which is external water liquidity moisture moistness the external coherence factor of matter not kammically acquiredsuch as the sap of roots the sap of tree trunks the sap of bark the juice of leaves fruit juice milk curd ghee butter oil honey molasses and waters in the earth or atmosphere  The watersign in the triad of internal objects is also included Fire as fire  In the section on fire the detailed account should be understood according to the aforementioned methodBut by way of interpretation the internal fire element is stated in terms of a fourfold division thus  That by which one is warmed by which one ages by which one is heated and by which whatever is eaten drunk chewed and tasted gets fully digested  What is the external fire elementThat which is external fire fiery heat hotness warmth warmness external not kammically acquiredAir as air  The same method as above applies in this section on air but by way of interpretation the internal air element is stated thus Winds moving upwards winds moving downwards winds residing in the bowels winds residing in die abdomen winds moving along in all the limbs sharp winds cutting winds rending winds inhalation exhalation   What is the external air elementThat which is external air airy the external oscillation of matter not kammically acquiredThe rest by the aforesaid methodThis is the conveyancemode of the characteristic  defined in the Nettippakarana By this principle when the four primary elements are mentioned derivative materiality is implied along with them since it shares the characteristic of material formThe primaries together with derivative materiality make up the aggregate of material formTherefore the assertion that the uninstructed worldling conceives earth water fire and air signifies that he regards material form as the selfThe assertion that he conceives in earth in air signifies that he regards the self to be in material formThe assertion that he conceives from earth from air which implies the self to be other than material form signifies that he regards the self to be possessed of material form or material form to be in the selfThese are the four conceivings of personalityview based upon materialityThese reduce to only two views one is the annihilationist view  three are the eternalist view  This distinction should be understoodsuch as a log fire a splint fire a grass fire a cowdung fire a husk fire a rubbish fire lightning  the heat of a fire the heat of the sun the heat from an accumulation of logs the heat from an accumulation of grass grain and wares  The external fire element should be understood thus such as the easterly winds the westerly winds northerly winds southerly winds cold winds hot winds gentle winds strong winds black winds highaltitude winds wing winds supaIJJa winds winds from a palmleaf winds from a fan  The external air element should be understood thus When one idea is mentioned all Ideas of like characteristicAre mentioned too this constitutes The Mode Conveying CharacteristicsHE PERCEIVES BEINGS AS BEINGS  Since the worldling arouses conceivings towards the beings who are discerned by reference to formations  as well as towards formations themselves after having explained the conceiving based on formations under the heading of material form the Exalted One sets out to expound these living beings beginning with the above wordsTherein the word being is found in the following senses the five aggregates  nonhumans  elements  existing  the cankerless saint  living beings  trees  etcWhatever beings are here assembled  here it is nonhumansThe four primary elements are the cause here it is the elementsIf a fact an offence requiring expiation  here existing The being who swallows time here the cankerless saintAll beings lay down the body in the world here living beingsThe destruction of plant life  here treesIn the present case the meaning of living beings applies But not without a distinctionfor here beings signifies only living beings below the heaven of the Four Great Kings Therein  he perceives beings as beings the method has been statedHow He sees a householder or a householders son supplied and furnished with the five strands of sense pleasure having apprehended beings in this way he takes hold of the notion that  beings are beautiful  or  beings are happy  and becomes attached Having seen them having heard smelled tasted touched cognized them he becomes attachedthus he conceives beings through the conceiving of cravingOr resolving his mind on the acquisition of what he has not obtained he thinks O that I may be reborn in the company of great wealthy Khattiyas etc  Thus too he conceives beings through the conceiving of cravingWhen depending on his excellence or deficiency in relation to other beings he ranks himself as superior to othersAs it is said  Herein someone on account of birth or an a certain ground previously ranked himself as equal to othersat a later time he ranks himself as superiorand others as inferior Such a kind of conceit is called arrogance  When he conceives beings thus  Beings are permanent stable eternal not subject to change or All living beings all creatures all beings all souls are without power without strength without energy evolving in the grip of fate chance or nature experiencing pleasure and pain in the six classes  this is the conceiving of viewsIn this way he conceives beings through the three conceivingsHow does he conceive himself in beings When he wishes for his own rebirth or attainment of happiness among such and such beingsOr when he gives a gift undertakes precepts or observes the Uposatha  wishing for rebirth among those beings When having apprehended beings in terms of an aggregation  he ranks some beings as superior some as equal some as inferior So too he conceives some beings as permanent and stableHe conceives from beings  he conceives from beings when he conceives himself or others together with their accessories to originate from some being this is his conceiving of viewsWhen he arouses affection and conceit for the base conceived through the conceiving of views these are his conceivings ofcraving and conceit He conceives  beings are mine   here the conceiving of craving is alone relevantThis occurs when he lays claim to beings thus  My sons my daughters my goats and sheep my poultry and swine my elephants cattle horses and maresHe delights in beings  the method has been stated Because they have not been fully understood by him   the beings are not fully understood because he has not fully understood the formations by reference to which beings are discernedThe interpretation should be made by the method statedHaving shown in brief the bases of conceiving by way of formations and living beings with the words gods as gods the Exalted One sets out to show the same thing in detailed classification according to the division of planesTherein they revel in the five strands of sense pleasure or in their own psychic powers thus they are called gods  they play or they shine is the meaningThere are three kinds of gods gods by convention  gods by rebirth  and gods by purification Gods by convention are kings queens and princesGods by rebirth are the gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings and the higher heavenly worldsAnd gods by purifiation are arahants cankerless saintsHere gods by rebirth are meant But not without a distinctionfor Mara and his retinue in the Paranimmitavasavatti heavenly world are excepted only the remaining gods in the remaining six sense sphere heavenly worlds are intendedThe entire explanation of the meaning should be understood in the way set forth in the section on beings Pajapati  here Pajapati is MaraSome say that this is a designation for the great kings etc who are overlords in the various groups of godsbut the Great Commentary  rejects this as incorrect for these are already included under the category of gods Mara alone is intended here by the word Pajapati for he is the overlord of this generation made up of living beingsWhere does he resideIn the Paranimmita vasavatti heavenly worldSome say that the king of the Vasavattis exercises rule therewhile Mara lives in one place wielding sovereignty over his own retinue like a rebel prince in a frontier corner of a kingdomHere is the interpretation When he arouses desire after seeing or hearing that Pajapati is beautiful of longlife and abundant happiness then he conceives him through the conceiving of cravingWhen he resolves his mind on the acquisition of what he has not obtained thinking O that I may be reborn in the company of Pajapati in this way too he conceives Pajapati through the conceiving of cravingWhen after attaining the state of Pajapati he gives rise to the conceit  I am the ruler of creatures the overlord  he conceives Pajapati through the conceiving of conceitThinking  Pajapati is permanent and stable or Pajapati will he annihilated and destroyed or  Pajapati is without power without strength without energy evolving in the grip of fate chance or nature experiencing pleasure and pain in the six classes he conceives Pajapati through the conceiving of views In Pajapati  here the conceiving of views is alone applicablesomeone conceives Those dhammas which are found in Pajapati are permanent stable eternal not subject to changeOr else he conceives There is no evil in Pajapati nor are any evil deeds found in him From Pajapati  here the three conceivings are relevantHowHere someone conceives himself or another together with their accessories to originate or emanate from Pajapati this is his eonceiving of viewsWhen he arouses affection and conceit for the base conceived through the conceiving of views these are his conceivings of craving and conceit Pajapati is mine  here the conceiving of craving is alone relevantThis occurs when he lays claim to Pajapati thus Pajapati is my master he is my lordThe rest by the method statedBrahma as Brahma  he is magnified with distinguished qualities thus he is BrahmaMahabrahma is called  Brahma  so too is the Tathagata brahmins mother and father and what is supremeIn the passage  Brahma of one thousand Brahma of two thousand   it is MahabrahmaBrahma bhikkhus this is a designation for the Tathagata  here it is the TathagataDispeller ofdarkness enlightened one universal eye Mother and father are called  Brahma  teachers of old He sets in motion the wheel of Brahma   here supremeHere it is the Brahma who is first to be born and whose lifespan lasts for the aeon that is intendedThe ministers of Brahma and the assembly of Brahma should also be included The gods of Streaming Radiance  a radiance streams forth  streams out  from their bodies like light from the flame of a torch penetrating further and further and descending thus they are gods of Streaming Radiance By mentioning these all beings occupying the plane of the second jhanathe gods of Limited Radiance  of Immeasurable Radiance  as well as of Streaming Radianceshould be included for all these occupy a single levelThe gods of Refulgent Glory  they are covered with glory  bestrewn with glory their bodies are a single mass radiant and beautiful like a resplendid blazing piece of gold placed in a golden casketthe gods of Limited Glory  of Immeasurable Glory as well as of Refulgent Gloryshould be included for all these occupy a single levelThe gods of Abundant Fruit these are Brahmas on the plane of the fourth jhanaThey vanquish thus they are Vanquishers What do they vanquishThe four immaterial aggregatesThis is a designation for the beings of the nonpercipient realmThe nonpercipient gods occupy one section of the same plane as the gods of Abundant Fruit where they remain in the same posture in which they are reborn throughout their lives all with similar material form resulting from the similarity of their productive kamma consciousnessSome say the Vanquishers are the thousand Brahmas who are overlords among the BrahmasIn the interpretation when he arouses desire and lust after hearing that the Vanquishers are beautiful and longlived then he conceives the Vanquishers through the conceiving of cravingWhen he resolves his mind on the acquisition of what he has not obtained thinking O that I may be reborn in the company of the Vanquishers in this way too he conceives the Vanquishers through the conceiving of cravingRanking himself as inferior and the Vanquishers as superior he conceives them through the conceiving of conceitMisapprehending the Vanquishers as permanent and stable he conceives them through the conceiving of viewsThe rest follows the method stated in the section on PajāpatiIn the passage  Do you see bhikkhus that this has come into being   it is the five aggregates He conceives beings  this and the following can be interpreted through the three conceivingsor as inferioror as equal he conceives beings through the conceiving of conceithe conceives in beings through the conceiving of cravingin this way too he conceives in beings through the conceiving of cravinghe conceives in beings through the conceiving of conceitsome as impermanent and unstable or he conceives I too am a certain somebody among beingsthus he conceives in beings through the conceiving of viewsThe retinue of Mara should be understood as included along with MaraIt arises whenGone to the worlds end transcending all existenceThe cankerless released from all sufferingThe bringer of truth honoured by Brahma here it is a brahminhere mother and fatherThe explanation of the meaning should be understood by the method stated in the section on PajapatiBy mentioning these all beings occupying the plane of the third jhanaThe interpretation of the meaning for these three sections is the same as the method in the section on beingsbut this is incorrect since those are already included in the Brahma sectionDiscussing the heavenly worlds in succession the Exalted One shows the nonpercipient realm and then skips over the pure abodes in order to discuss the base of infinite space  The reason he omits the pure abodes is because his is an explanation of the round of existence  and the pure abodes pertain to the ending of the round  since they are inhabited exclusively by gods who are nonreturners and arahatsOr the reason is that the lifespan of these gods is only a few thousands of aeons and they only exist during the time when a Buddha has appeared in the worldBut Buddhas sometimes do not appear for an incalculable number of aeons and during this time the plane of the pure abodes is emptyFor the realm of the pure abodes belongs to the Buddhas like a campground to a kingFor this reason they are not included in the stations of consciousness or the nine abodes of beings But these conceivings occur at all timestherefore the Buddha only speaks of the planes which always existThe base of infinite space is the four aggregates based on this planethe wholesome  resultants  and inoperatives But here only the aggregates of those reborn on that plane are meant for this is a discussion delimiting the planes of existenceThe same method in the case of the base of infinite consciousness etcBut here the conceiving of conceit should be interpreted according to the method of the section on PajapatiThe interpretation of the meaning in these four sections follows the method given in the section on the VanquishersHaving thus shown the bases of conceiving in detail by classifying them into their distinct planes etc the Exalted One now shows all the dhammas of the three planes inluded in personality which function as the bases of conceiving by classifying them into a fourfold scheme as the seen heard sensed and cognizedTherein the seen  means what is seen by the fleshly eye and by the divine eyeThis is a designation for the visible form base He conceives the seen  he conceives the seen with the three conceivingsHowSeeing the visible form base in terms of the perception of beauty and the perception of pleasure  he arouses desire and lust for it relishes it and delights in itFor this has been said by the Exalted One Beings become lustful bhikkhus over the form of a woman entranced infatuated intoxicated and fettered Coming under the sway of the form of a woman they sorrow for a long time Thus he conceives the seen with the conceiving ov crayingOr he thinks  May my body be thus in the future and brings delight to bear upon it or he gives alms yearning for the attainment of physical beauty and so on in detailIn these ways too he conceives the seen with the conceiving of cravingHe arouses conceit on account of the excellence or deficiency of his own form in relation to anothers thinking I am superior to him or  I am equal or  I am inferior Thus he conceives the seen with the conceiving of conceitHe conceives the visible form base as permanent stable and eternal or as a self or the property of a self or as auspicious or inauspicious Thus he conceives the seen with the conceiving of viewsIn this way he conceives the seen with the three conceivingsHow does he conceive himself  in the seen He conceives in the seen when he regards the self to be in visible form Or just as milk is in the mothers breastThis is his conceiving of viewsThe conceivings of craving and cenceit are the affection and conceit he arouses in regard to the base conceived by the conceiving of viewsThus he conceives in the seenThe remainder should be understood by the method stated in the section on earthLust etc are in visible form  he conceives in the seen when he thinks The heard  what is heard by the fleshy ear or by the divine ear This is a designation for the sound base The sensed  that which is apprehended by sensing ie by approach and contact What is meant is that it is cognized through the mutual adherence of the sense faculty and objects  This is a designation for the bases of odour flavour and touch The cognized  cognized with the mind This is a designation for the remaining seven sense bases or for the mental object But here only that which is included in personality is applicableIn detail these sections should be understood by the method used in the section on the seenHaving thus shown all personality distributed into four classes as the seen etc the Exalted One with the words unity and diversity  now shows the same as divided into two classes through a section on the attainer and on the nonattainer By the word unity he shows the attainerThis is the wordmeaning unityoneness The four immaterial aggregates pertain to the case of the attainer all five aggregates to the case of the nonattainer The interpretation can be made by the method of the Dispensation  thus He regards material form as the self etc or by the commentarial method given in the section on earth having determined by investigation which is appropriateBut some say that unity indicates the method of unity and diversity the method of diversity Others say the adherence to the views  the self is immutable after death and percipient of unity percipient of diversity is meantNeither of these is correct for they arent intended hereHaving thus shown all personality as twofold now collecting it together he shows the same thing again as singlefold with the words cc all as all This is the method of interpretation Relishing all  he conceives all through the conceiving of cravingConceiving all as created by himself thus These beings have been created by me he conceives all with the conceiving of conceitAll is caused by past kamma All is created by God All is without cause without condition All exists All does not exist etcin these ways he conceives all through the conceiving of viewsHow does he conceive himself  in allHere someone holds such a view  My self is great Imagining all the world to be the container for the self he conceives This self of mine is in all  This is his conceiving of viewsHis conceivings of craving and conceit are the affection he arouses for this self and the conceit based upon it respectivelyThe rest should be understood by the method given in the section on earthHaving shown all personality as singiefoid with the words  nibbana as nibbana  he shows the same as again singlefold by a different methodHere  nibbana   When this self furnished and supplied with the five strands of sense pleasure revels in themRelishing this nibbana he conceives it with the conceiving of cravingHolding that which is in reality not nibbana to be nibbana and to be permanent etc he conceives nibbana through the conceiving of viewsTaking his self to be other than nibbana conceiving  This is nibbana this the self This self of mine is in nibbana he conceives himself  in nibbana  This is his conceiving of viewsThe affection he arouses for this self and the conceit based on it are his conceivings of craving and of conceit respectivelyThis is the method he conceives himself apart  from nibbana The affection he arouses for this self and the conceit based upon it are his conceivings of craving and of conceit respectivelyHe conceives  nibbana is mine  thus O how blissful is my nibbanaThe rest by the method statedHere is the summing up verseBecause he does not understand The person as it really isThe worldling only generates Conceivings in the persongroup Though in truth foul and perishable Painful void of an inner lord The fool takes it in the opposite way Grasps hold of it through his conceivingsHe contemplates the persongroup As beautiful and pleasurablePlunging in through conceivings of craving Like a moth into a candle flameStanding on ideas of permanence Extolling himself for his excellenceLike filth being poured into filth Conceivings of conceit ariseLike a madman his image in a glass The fool takes the self to be realAnd so too property of this self These are his conceivings in terms of viewsThis that we have called  conceiving  Is the very subtle bondage of MaraFlexible and difficult to break By this the worldling is held in thrallThough struggling and striving with all his might He does not escape the round of birthsBut circles on like a leashbound dog Tied to a firmly planted postThis worldling attached to the persongroup Is constantly slain with vehement forceBy the pains of birth disease and age By all the sufferings of the roundTherefore I say to you good sir Discern the person with sharp insightAs bound to pain an impure mass Subject to break up void of selfThe sage perceiving as it is This the true nature of our beingAbandons all conceivings modes And from all suffering finds releaseand by the word diversity the nonattainerdiversity manyness then it has attained to supreme nibbana here and now  should be understood as the five kinds of supreme nibbana here and now  which have come down in the passage beginning The conceit he arouses because of this nibbana when he thinks I have attained nibbanathis is the way he conceives nibbana through the conceiving of conceittaking his self to be other than nibbana conceiving  This is nibbana this the self This self of mine comes from nibbiina it is other than nibbana he conceives himself apart from nibbana This is his conceiving of viewsSo far the Exalted One has shown the cognitive process of the worldling in regard to the bases such as earth etc which process becomes the root of all the dhammas included in personality Now with the words  A bhikkhu who is a learner he undertakes to show the cognitive process of the learner  as it occurs in regard to these same basesIn what sense is the learner called by this nameHe is a learner because he has obtained the dhammas that make him a learnerFor this is said  To what extent Lord is one a learner Here bhikkhu a bhikkhu is endowed with a learners right view a learners right concentrationTo this extent a bhikkhu is a learner Moreover he learns  therefore he is a learnerFor this is said  He learns bhikkhu thus he is called a learnerAnd what does he learnHe learns the higher virtue the higher consciousness and the higher wisdom He learns bhikkhu thus he is called a learner The nobleminded worldling who fulfils the practice in conformity  who is endowed with virtue restrained over the doors of the senses moderate in eating who applies himself to wakefulness and is devoted to the development of the constituents of enlightenment in the first and last watches of the night thinking  Today or tomorrow I will achieve one of the fruits of recluseship he too is called a learner because he learnsBut in this place only the learner who has attained to penetration is meant not even the nobleminded worldlingWho has not attained his hearts ideal In the passage The heart is a snare that wanders about in midair  it means lustMind mentality mentation here mindA learner who has not attained his hearts ideal here arahatshipIn the present case arahatship is intendedThus the meaning is  who has not attained arahatshipSecurity from bondage   security from the four bondsYearning  there are two yearnings the yearning of craving and the yearning of desire here is intendedThe phrase means that he desires to attain security from bondage desires to achieve it he slants slopes and inclines to it as his goalHE DIRECTLY KNOWS EARTH AS EARTH He directly knows earth in its nature as earth  unlike the worldling who perceives it with a completely perverted perceptionFurther he knows it with distinguished knowledge  What is meant is that resolving upon the earth in accordance with its real nature he knows it as impermanent suffering and nonselfHe cannot be described either as one who conceives or as one who does not conceiveWhat is the purportBecause he has not abandoned any of the conceivings the worldling is described as one who conceivesThe arahat who has abandoned them all is described as one who does not conceiveThe learner has abandoned the conceiving of views and has diminished the others Therefore he cannot be described as one who conceives like the worldling nor can he be described as one who does not conceive like the arahatIN ORDER THAT HE MAY FULLY UNDERSTAND IT The base of conceiving should be fully understood by the learner through the three full understandings for he has entered the course of rightness  and is bound for enlightenment Unlike the worldling he is not wholly lacking in full understanding and unlike the arahat he has not completed full understandingthe word manasa has the meanings of lust  mind  and arahatshipyearning as desire to do the wholesome LET HIM NOT CONCEIVE EARTH Having thus shown the cognitive process of the learner in regard to the bases such as earth etc with the words A bhikkhu who is an arahat the Exalted One next undertakes to show the cognitive process of the cankerless saint Therein arahat  one who is remote from the defilements  far from the defilements The meaning is one who has abandoned the defilementsAs the Master says And how bhikkhus is a bhikkhu an arahatHe is remote from evil unwholesome dhammas from dhammas which are defiling leading to renewed existence disturbing bringing painful results conducing to birth ageing and deathThus bhikkhus a bhikkhu is an arahat  A cankerless saint the four cankers are the canker of sensual desire the canker of desire for existence the canker of wrong views and the canker of ignorance For the arahat these four cankers are destroyed abandoned eradicated silenced consumed by the fire of knowledge so that they can no more arise again therefore he is called a cankerless saint Lived the holy life  he has lived in coresidence with his teacher dwelt in the ariyan path and abided in the ten ariyan abidings He has lived the life completed the course thus he is one who has lived the holy life Done what had to be done  in comparison to the nobleminded worldling the seven learners are doing what has to be done by the four paths For the cankerless saint all that should be done has been done and completed There is nothing further for him to do to achieve the destruction ofsuffering thus he has done what had to be doneFor this is saidThere is nothing to add to what he has done Nor does anything remain that he must doLaid down the burden  there are three burdens the burden of the aggregates the burden of the defilements and the burden of kammaformations  For the arahat these three burdens have been laid down thrown down deposited cast down therefore he is called one who has laid down the burdenAttained his own goal For that is ones own goal ones personal goal in the sense that it is connected with oneself that it can never be abandoned by oneself and that it is ones supreme goalEliminated the fetters of existence  the ten fetters are the fetters of sensual lust aversion conceit views doubt clinging to rules and rituals lust for existence jealousy stinginess and ignoranceThese are called fetters because they fetter  connect beings to the states of existence or because they fetter one existence to the nextThese fetters of existence are eliminated by the arahat abandoned consumed by the fire of knowledge therefore he is called one who has eliminated the fetters of existenceEmancipated through final knowledge  what is meant by  final knowledgeHe has known scrutinized investigated clarified and illuminated with knowledge perfectly as it really is the aggregates  meaning of aggregates the bases  meaning of bases the elements meaning of elements sufferings meaning of oppressing the origins meaning of source cessations meaning of peace the paths meaning of seeing or the division beginning thus All formations are impermanent etcSince his mind is emancipated from all defilements the arahat is emancipated by the emancipation of mindAnd since he is resolved upon nibbiina he is also emancipated in nibbanaTherefore he is called  emancipated by final knowledgeBECAUSE IT HAS BEEN FULLY UNDERSTOOD BY HIM The arahat has fully understood the bases of conceiving through the three kinds of full understandingTherefore he neither conceives the base nor does he conceive the conceiving The remainder by the method statedAt the end of the nibbana section three additional sections are stated in terms of the destruction of lust hate and delusionEach should be applied to each of the sections dealing with the bases beginning with earthBECAUSE HE IS DEVOID OF LUST THROUGH THE DESTRUCTION OF LUST Those outside who are devoid of lust for sensual pleasures are not  devoid of lust through the destruction of lustThe arahat alone is Therefore it is said  Because he is devoid of lust through the destruction of lustThis method should also be applied to the cases of hate and delusionJust as when it is said  because it has been fully understood by him the meaning is that because it has been fully understood he conceives neither the base nor the conceiving so here too because he is devoid of lust he conceives neither the base nor the conceivingAnd here the section on full understanding is stated for the purpose of showing the fulfilment of the development of the path Or else the arahat does not conceive for two reasons because he has fully understood the base and because he has eradicated the unwholesome rootsTherefore the section on full understanding shows his full understanding of the base the others his eradication of the unwholesome rootsIn the three latter sections the following distinction should be understood Having seen the danger in lust he dwelt in the contemplation of suffering became emancipated through the deliverance of the wishless  and is devoid of lust through the destruction of lustHaving seen the danger in hate he dwelt in the contemplation of impermanence became emancipated through the deliverance of the signless  and is devoid of hate through the destruction of hateAnd having seen the danger in delusion he dwelt in the contemplation of nonself became emancipated through the deliverance of emptiness  and is devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusionIf such is the case since no one becomes emancipated through three deliverances shouldnt two sections be omitted NoWhyBecause there is no specificationFor it was said a bhikkhu who is an arahat without specificationIt was not said that he is emencipated by the wishless deliverance or by either of the other two therefore all that is appropriate for the arahat should be mentionedOr else without distinction whoever is an arahat by fully understanding the suffering in change  becomes devoid of lust through the destruction of lust by fully understanding the suffering in painful feeling  becomes devoid of hate through the destruction of hateOr by fully understanding a desirable object  he becomes devoid of lust through the destruction of lustand by fully understanding a neutral object  he becomes devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusionOr by eradicating the latent tendency to lust for a pleasant feeling he becomes devoid of lust through the destruction of lust and by eradicating the latent tendencies to aversion and delusion for painful and neutral feelings respectively he becomes devoid of hate and devoid of delusionTherefore showing these distinctions the Exalted One says  devoid of lust devoid of hate devoid of delusionFor such a bhikkhu perfectly released Who dwells with ever tranquil mindby own goal arahatship is meant Emancipated  there are two emancipations emancipation of mind and nibbanaOnly one condensed statement is given since the meaning is the same in all casesjust as the statement on full understanding should be applied to all termsthe others for the purpose of showing the fulfilment of the realization of the fruit and by fully understanding the suffering in formations  becomes devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusionby fully understanding an undesirable object  he becomes devoid of hate through the destruction of hateHaving thus shown the cognitive process of the cankerless saint in regard to the bases such as earth etc with the words  The Tathagata bhikkhus the Exalted One next undertakes to show his own cognitive processTherein  the Tathagata  the Exalted One is called the Tathagata for eight reasons because he has thus come  hecause he has thus gone  because he has arrived at the real characteristic  because he has awakened to real dhammas in accordance with actuality  because he is a seer of the real  because he is a speaker of the real  because he acts in accordance with his teaching  and in the sense of surpassing He is an  arahat for the following reasons because he is remote from the defilements  because his enemies and the spokes have been destroyed  because he is worthy to receive the requisites etc and because ot absence of secret evildoingAnd he is a perfectly enlightened Buddha because he is perfectly and by himself enlightened to all dhammasThis is a summaryfor a detailed treatment of these two words consult the Visuddhimagga the chapter on the Recollection of the BuddhaBECAUSE IT HAS BEEN FULLY UNDERSTOOD TO THE END BY THE TATHAGATA  Here the base of conceiving has been fully understood by the TathagataIt has been  fully understood to the end  fully understood to the conclusion fully understood to the limit fully understood without any remainder is meantFor although there is no distinction between Buddhas and disciples in regard to the abandoning of defilements by the four paths there is a distinction in regard to their range of full understandingDisciples can attain nibbana after insightcomprehension of only one segment of the four elementsBut for the Buddhas there isnt even the slightest thing in the formations which hasnt been seen weighed scrutinized and realized with knowledgeDelight is prior craving Having understood he has known that the delight in the previous existence is the root of the present suffering Existence   kammaexistence Birth   the resultant aggregatesSince those are born they are called birthWhat has come to be a living being This is meant he has known that ageing and death come upon the aggregates of the living being that has come to be through rebirthexistenceTo this extent showing the cause for his elimination of the conccivings to be his penetration of dependent origination when he attained omniscience after comprehending the formations with insight while sitting in the invincible posture at the foot of the Bodhi tree he shows dependent origination with its four sections  three links  three periods of time and twenty modes How is all this shownHere delight is one sectionSuffering is given as a second existence is a third and birth ageing and death are the fourthThus the four sections should be understoodThus just as there are three links between the four fingers there are also three links between the four groupsDelight belongs to the past period of time birth ageing and death to the future and suffering and existence to the present Thus the three periods of time should be understoodIn the past there were five modes of which craving alone has come down under the name delight But though they are not mentioned in the text ignorance formations clinging and existence are included along with craving since they all share the characteristic of being conditionsThe phrase  birth ageing and death  indicates the aggregates which are subject to birth ageing and death and thus future consciousness mentality materiality the sixfold base contact and feeling are impliedThese twenty modes have the characteristics described as follows  In the previous kammaexistence ignorance with its characteristic of delusion formations of accumulating craving of attachment clinging of involvement and existence of volitionthese five dhammas in the previous kammaexistence are conditions for rebirthlinking in this existenceHere consciousness with its characteristic of rebirthlinking mentalitymateriality of des cending the bases of sensitivity contact of touching and feeling of being feltthese five dhammas in the rebirthexistence in this life are conditioned by previously done kammaWith the maturation of the sense bases here ignorance with its characteristic of delusion formations of accumulating craving of attachment clinging of involvement and existence of volitionthese five dhammas in the present kammaexistence are conditions for future rebirthlinkingIn the future consciousness with its characteristic of rebirthlinking mentalitymateriality of descen ding the bases of sensitivity contact of touching and feeling of being feltthese five dhammas in future rebirthexistence are conditioned by kamma done hereThus by the statement  He has understood that delight is the root of suffering and that with existence there is birth and that for what has come to be there is ageing and death this entire dependent origination with its four sections three links three periods of time and twenty modes is shownNext the Exalted One says THEREFORE BHIKKHUS THROUGH THE COMPLETE DESTRUCTION FADING AWAY CESSATION ABANDONING AND RELINQUISHING OF ALL CRAVINGS THE TATHAGATA HAS AWAKENED TO THE SUPREME PERFECT ENLIGHTENMENT I DECLAREDestruction is the ultimate destruction by the supramundane pathThe following words are synonyms for destructionFor those cravings that are destroyed have also faded away ceased been abandoned and been relinquishedOr else  destruction  can be interpreted as the common function of the four pathsOr else through the destruction of those by which he might conceive earth and so forth until through the  relinquishing  of those through which he might delight in earth These interpretations are all possible there is nothing to exclude them Supreme  which is unsurpassed the best of allThe word bodhi is used in the texts to signify a tree the path the knowledge of omniscience  and nibbanaIn the passages  first enlightened at the foot of the Bodhi tree  and  between Bodhi and Gaya  it is the tree that is called bodhiIn the passage  the knowledge of the four paths is called bodhi  it is the pathIn the passage He of the most excellent profound wisdom attained bodhi  it is the knowledge of omniscienceIn the following it is nibbana  Having attained to bodhi the deathless the unconditioned  Here the Exalted Ones knowledge of the path of arahatship is intendedIs the path of arahatship attained by disciples the supreme enlightenment or notIt is notWhyBecause it does not yield all the noble qualities For some disciples the path of arahatship yields only the fruit of arahatship for some the threefold knowledge for some the six abhinnas for some the four discriminations  for some the knowledge of the pāramī of disciplesFor paccekabuddhas it yields only the knowtedge of a paccekabuddhas enlightenmentBut for Buddhas it yields the endowment with all noble qualities just as the coronation of a king confers sovereignty over all the nationTherefore any other degree of enlightenment is not the supreme enlightenmentAwakened to  directly known penetrated attained achieved I declare  I explain I teach proclaim establish reveal analyze make manifestTherein this is the interpretation  The Tathagata bhikkhus does not conceive earth  does not delight in earthWhat is the reason Because he has understood that delight is the root of suffering and that with existence there is birth and that for what has come to be there is ageing and deathAnd what is more since he has understood dependent origination thus the craving called  delight  has been abandoned in all its aspects by the Tathagata Through the complete destruction of all cravings the Tathagata has awakened to the supreme perfect enlightenmenttherefore he does not conceive earth  does not delight in earth I declare This is meant by reason of his awakening he does not conceive and does not delight I declareOr else Since cravings have gone to complete destruction through his understanding of dependent origination by the method Delight is the root of suffering therefore bhikkhus through the complete destruction of all cravings the Tathagata has awakened to the supreme perfect enlightenment I declareBy reason of his awakening he does not conceive earth  does not delight in earth Thus spoke the Exalted One  the Exalted One spoke this entire sutta from the end of the introduction to the words  awakened to the supreme perfect enlightenment I declare showing his supremely deep knowledge of omniscience which does not yield a foothold to the wisdom of others The text comprises two recitation sections and eight major expository sectionsone on the worldling one on the learner four on the arahat and two on the Tathagata Each major section in turn contains twentyfour minor sections from earth down to nibbanaBut though this sutta endowed with variegated methods and elegance of teaching was spoken by the Exalted One with a Brahmalike voice sweet as the song of the cuckoo pleasing to the ear consecrating the hearts of the wise with the ambrosia of the deathlessWhy notBecause they didnt understand itSince they didnt understand the meaning of the sutta they didnt rejoice in itFor though endowed with variegated methods and elegance of teaching at the time this sutta was for them like delicious food placed before a man with his mouth bound by a thick broad clothBut didnt the Exalted One fulfil the paramis for four immeasurables plus a  aeons and attain omniscience all for the purpose of teaching the Dhamma to others in a way they could understandIf so why didnt they understand it in the way he taught itThe reason has been given in the section explainining the grounds for the delivery of this sutta  he undertook this teaching for the purpose of shattering their conceit Therefore this need not be repeated here Having heard this sutta taught for the purpose of shattering their conceit they thought The theorist he says perceives earth The learner the arahat and the Tathagata directly know itWhat is this How is this Previously we could quickly understand whatever the Exalted One said But now we cannot make head or tail out of this exposition of the root O the Buddhas are immeasurable and unfathomable  Thus they became humble like snakes with drawn fangs and went respectfully to attend upon the Buddha and listen to the DhammaA short time afterwards a number of bhikkhus sitting together in the Dhamma hall started the following conversation O the spiritual power of the Buddhas Those brahminmonks were so puffed up with conceit but the Masters teaching on the exposition of the root made them humble This was the talk going on among these bhikkhusThen the Exalted One came out from his Fragrant Cottage went to the Dhamma hall displaying a wonder appropriate for the occasion sat down in the special seat reserved for him and said to the bhikkhus  What kind of conversation were you having just now bhikkhusThey reported the matter to the MasterThe Master said It is not only now bhikkhus but in the past as well that I humbled these men while they were going about with their heads swollen with conceitThen the Exalted One related the following story of the past a parallel to the present incident Once upon a time bhikkhus a certain famous brahmin was living in Benares a master of the three Vedas knowing the text and context of the Itihasas the fifth of the brahminical authorities with their invocations liturgy and wordanalysis and he was fully versed in Natural Science and that of the marks of the Great Man He taught mantras to five hundred brahmin youthsThose youths being clever learned much quickly bore it well in mind and did not forget what they learnedThe brahmin too did not have the closed fist of some teachers but taught them every branch of knowledge as though pouring water into a jar telling them  This branch of knowledge leads to so much welfare in this life and in the nextIn time those brahmin youths aroused the conceit Whatever our teacher knows that we know We too can now be teachers From then on those youths became disrespectful towards their teacher and neglectful of their dutiesThe teacher aware of the situation thought  I will cut down their conceit One day when they came to attend on him after they had done homage and took their seats he said  Dears I will give you a riddle Solve it if you can  Give it teacher give it  they eagerly replied so intoxicated were they with the pride of their learningThe teacher said Answer this riddle dearsBut though they pondered it over and over they couldnt figure it out but could only remain silentThe teacher dismissed them  Enough for today Go by tomorrow you should be able to answer itBut even though ten and twenty of them tried to solve it together still they couldnt make head or tail out of the riddleThe next day they went to the teacher and reported  We cant understand the meaning of this riddleThe teacher in order to cut down their conceit recited this stanzaHearing this those youths became silent shamefaced shoulders slumped downcast scratching the ground with their fingersThen the teacher seeing that they were ashamed said  Learn dears the solution to this riddleThen he explained  Time  is the earlier part of the day and the later part of the dayBeings are living beingsTime does not eat the skin and flesh of beings but swallows and devours them by depriving them of life beauty and strength by crushing their youth and by destroying their healthTogether with itself thus devouring them it does not omit anything but devours allNot only does it devour all beings but it also devours itselfFor the earlier part of the day does not remain when the later part arrivesThe being who swallows up this time this is the arahat the cankerless saintFor he is called one who swallows up time because he has eaten up time by barring out the possibility of future rebirth He consumes the consumer of beings  it is craving which consumes beings in the planes of misery This the arahat has burnt up with the fire of knowledge and reduced to ashes Thence he is said to  consume the consumer of beings When this explanation was given those youths perceived the meaning of the riddle as clearly as the smooth and rough parts of a road illuminated at night by the light of a thousand lamps They all vowed  As long as life lasts we will live under our teacher Great indeed are these teachers We were so puffed up with conceit on account of learning that we did not even know the meaning of a four line stanza  Humbled from then on they performed their proper duties towards their teacher as they did in the past and in the next life were born in heavenAt that time bhikkhus I was the teacher and these bhikkhus were the brahmin youthsThus in the past as well I humbled these men when they were going about with their heads swollen with conceitHearing this story of the past thinking  in the past as well we were knocked down because of conceit those bhikkhus became even more humble and applied themselves even more to their individual meditationsubjectsOn a later occasion the Exalted One walking on tour through the country reached Vesali where he dwelt at the Gotamaka shrine Knowing that the understanding of those five hundred bhikkhus had become mature he taught them the Gotamaka Sutta Through direct knowledge  bhikkhus I teach Dhamma not without direct knowledge I teach a firmly ground Dhamma with firm grounds  not groundlessly I teach Dhamma that is convincing  not unconvincingAnd since I teach Dhamma through direct knowledge etcIt is sufficient for you to be pleased bhikkhus sufficient for you to be exultant sufficient for you to be joyfulThe Exalted One is a perfectly enlightened Buddha the Dhamma is wellexpounded the Sangha is practising the good pathThus spoke the Exalted One And while this exposition was being spoken the ten thousandfold world system shookHaving heard this sutta those five hundred bhikkhus attained arahatship together with the four discriminations right in their very seats Thus on this occasion the present teaching reached the fulfilment of its purposesuffering is the five aggregates  root  is the beginning This is the meaning he has known that with kammaexistence rebirthexistence occursBetween craving and suffering there is one link between suffering and existence a second and between existence and birth a thirdHere all cravings  is the same as delightfading away as the first path  cessation as the second  abandoning  as the third and  relin quishing  as the fourth Or else through the destruction of those cravings by which he might perceive earth as earththrough the  fading away  of those by which he might conceive earththrough the cessation of those by which he might conceive in earththrough the abandoning of those by which he might conceive from earthand through the  relinquishing  of those by which he might conceive  earth is mineperfect enlightenment the perfect enlightenment and selfenlightment others say the knowledge of omniscience as wellthose bhikkhus did not delight in the word of the Exalted One Time swallows all beings that live Together with itself as wellBut the being that swallows up this time He consumes the consumer of beings Many downy heads were held high with conceitBut some clever man has bound them by their necks and the later part of the day does not remain when the next day arrivesmy exhortation and my instruction should be put into practicein four waysThat is the first attainment of visionhe comes to know the unbroken stream of human consciousness as established both in this world and in the nextThat is the third attainmenthe comes to know the unbroken stream of human consciousness that is not established either in this world or in the nextThat is the fourth attainment of visionThere are these seven typesthe BothWaysLiberated the WisdomLiberated the BodyWitness the VisionAttainer the FaithLiberated the DhammaDevotee the FaithDevoteeThis is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the designation of individualsThere are these seven factors of enlightenment mindfulness investigation of states energy delight tranquillity concentration and equanimitywhich are four painful progress with slow comprehension painful progress with quick comprehension pleasant progress with slow comprehension pleasant progress with quick comprehensionhow one should avoid not only any speech involving lying but also speech that is divisive or sneeringly triumphant but should use wise words words to be treasured words in seasonof which there are four The Blessed Lord knows by his own skilled observation That one will by following instructions by the complete destruction of three fetters become a StreamWinner no more subject to rebirth in lower worlds firmly established destined for full enlightenmentthen with the reduction of greed hatred and delusion become a OnceRetumerby the complete destruction of the five lower fetters be spontaneously rebornby the destruction of the corruptions gain in this very life the deliverance of mind the deliverance through wisdom which is uncorruptedThere are three such theoriesHere some ascetic or Brahmin by means of ardour endeavourrecalls various past existences up to several hundred thousand births and he says I know the past whether the universe was expanding or contractingbut I do not know the future whether it will expand or contractThe word all is found to be applied to four cases the allinclusive all  the all of restricted reference  the all of the sense bases  and the all of personality Thus in the passage All dhammas in all their modes enter the threshold of the Exalted Ones portal of knowledge  the allinclusive all is intendedIn the passage You have all spoken well Sariputta  it is the all of restricted referenceIn the passage I will teach you the all bhikkhus The eye and visible forms  the mind and mental objects  it is the all of the sense basesAnd in the passage He perceives all as all  it is the all of personalityAmong these four the allinclusive all has unrestricted application the other three restricted application In the present case the all of personality is meant They bear their own characteristics  although there are no dhammas devoid of their own characteristics this is still said for the purpose of showing that these are mere dhammas endowed with their specific natures devoid of such attributions as that of a being etc Whereas such entities as self beauty pleasurableness and permanence etc or nature  substance  soul  body etc which are mere misconstructions due to craving and views or such entities as skyflowers etc which are mere expressions of conventional discourse  cannot be discovered as ultimately real actualities  these dhammas can These dhammas are discovered as ultimately real actualitiesAnd though there is no real distinction  still in order to facilitate understanding the exposition makes a distinction as a mere metaphorical device  Also they are borne or they are discerned known according to their specific nature thus they are dhammas The meaning is the unique condition for each of the dhammas included in personalityAnd what is thatCraving conceit and views or ignorance etc For just as the conceivings of craving  which arise in reference to the bases of conceiving such as earth etc are the rootcause for their occurrence so also is ignorance etcThus it is said below  in conformity with this The uninstructed worldling etc Because it is not fully understood by him and  Delight is the root of suffering  and in addition  Because he is devoid of lust hate and delusion Hence their functioning as rootcauses is provedThe purport is all the dhammas beginning with earth which function as the bases for conceiving The worldling consists of the bases which have not been fully understood  the aggregates which have not been fully understood through the three kinds of full understanding For the aggregates are the bases of full understandingThe base of conceiving is apprehended merely through hearsay etcBut some raise the objection No conceiving takes place when the characteristic is seen and the perception which seizes upon as a solid mass and becomes the root for the assumption of views does not recognize the characteristic Therefore characteristicearth should not be included This is incorrect for the penetration of the characteristic is not intended herethence the commentator says seizing upon the conventional expressionAnd not all perception seizes upon the mass nor does all become the root for the assumption of views Therefore conceiving also occurs in regard to the characteristicearth which appears through the bodydoor and elsewhereThence it was said that the base is apprehended merely through hearsay etcSeizing upon the conventional expression Objection If the conventional expression is applied what is the fault Dont ariyans also make use of the conventional expression as when they say This venerable sir is the great earth etcReply It is not the mere employment of the expression that is intended here but the wrong adherence which is working through the conventional expression Thence he says he perceives through a perversion of perceptionThis is the meaningHe perceives it as beautiful  etc  through a perverted perception springing from unwise reflection By this weak conceiving through craving conceit and views is shownIf so  why is perception mentionedBecause it is evidentJust as when a fire is smouldering and smoke is seen although the fire still exists we say  there is smoke  rather than  there is fire because the smoke is more evidentin an analogous way although conceiving is already exercising its function  this function is not distinct The function of perception alone is distinct for perception is more evident But this perception accords with the conceiving and works in conjunction with the latter therefore he says he perceives through a perversion of perceptionAnd when it is said that he perceives it thinking  it is earth it means that without releasing a segment of earth from among these four kinds he perceives what is in its true nature devoid of self etc as endowed with a self etc  like one perceiving a lump on the head as a piece of goldPapañcasaṅkhā portions of papanca Because of these beings are detained in samsara ie delayed thus these are proliferating tendencies  Conceiving  because of these people conceive ie misconstrue  things as This is mine etc Craving conceit and views are referred to here by two synonymous terms conceivings and proliferating tendenciesHe apprehends it  contrary   like the conceiving of views the conceivings of craving and conceit also apprehend things contrary to realitycraving assuming the repulsive to be beautiful conceit the inferior to be superior etcThe earthsign is the counterpart sign of the earthkasiṇaThe commentary shows the three conceivings in relation to ones own continuum and the continua of others in a condensed interpretation I am earth  by this he shows the conceiving of views and the conceiving of conceit with an internal object for this phrase implies adherence to a view of self or Imaking Earth is mine this signifies the conceiving of craving and the conceiving of conceit the latter is a possible interpretation because through conceit one considers oneself superior on account of some segment of earth which has come into ones possessionConceiving may be analyzed in relation to the other two phrases in the same wayOne who obtains jhana through the earthkasiṇa may adhere to the object perceived in his meditationvision as a self or he may take that object as a sign of his superiority Thus he conceives  I am earth  Apprehending this kasiṇa object as my self he conceives  earth is mineOn the other hand if he adheres to this object doctrinally as another person or as a god he conceives  another is earth  and if he adheres to it as the self of another he conceives earth belongs to anotherSince in earth is a locative expression the statement means that he construes the basis for conceiving as a receptacle for his self for the self of another and for the accessories of bothQuery Isnt it true that composite earth is a receptablesupport for the succession of dhammas both those connected and unconnected with the faculties And the otherscharacteristicearth the earthkasina sign and the earth deitiesobjectsupports for the mental factors which take them as their objects So there is nothing wrong here Reply No because he misconstrues the basis of conceiving as a supportFor through the conceivings of views and conceit he takes earth as the support for  I ie for a self the reference of these conceivings Thus he conceives  I am in earth And through the conceiving of craving he takes earth as the support for the selfs accessories the reference of this conceiving Thus he conceives  There is an obstruction an impediment for me in earthWhen he says in material form he includes the part by mentioning the whole Since the whole can never be found without its parts by mentioning the whole the part is also included The other types of conceiving are also recognized  when one regards another as superior etc on account of his success power etc taking his self to exist with earth as dependence support this is the conceiving of conceit And when one resolves ones mind upon these objects this is the conceiving of craving To originate or to emanate from earth origination from earth can be interpreted by way of the doctrine of the primordial egg   Then there existed an egg made of gold Brahma himself originated in that  Or it can be understood by way of the doctrine of atomism  which holds that the molecule originates from the coupling of atoms Emanation from earth can be interpreted by way of theism with its doctrine of the creative play of God  which maintains that all this world emerged from GodHe conceives the self to be other than the earth he takes the self to be water etc In the first alternative the ablative has the characteristic of agency  in the second it has the characteristic of contrast Just as when affection and conceit are aroused for a base conceived by views the conceiving of craving and conceit arise so we can understand that when one ranks oneself as superior etc on account of a base conceived by craving or misconstrues that base as the property of a self and the self as its permanent master then the conceivings of conceit and views arise That element of Dhamma the supreme enlightenmentThis is called an element because it bears  bears up  all knowable dhammas according to their specific nature or because it bears up the entire succession of dhammas of the beings to be trained preventing them from falling into the suffering of the planes of misery and the suffering of samsara and because it occurs in an unperverted modeThe supreme enlightenment is the path knowledge  founded upon his knowledge of omniscience and his knowledge of omniscience founded upon his pathknowledge Conceiving  is the misconstruing of the object which occurs by way of desiring selfpromotion and misapprehension Delighting on the other hand is that through which cleaving occurs This is the difference between conceiving and delighting Therein the  full understanding of the known  is the wisdom of full understanding by which one fully understands delimits  the plane of insight For this understands the dhammas of the three planes delimiting them as internal and external and defining their characteristics functions etc thereby it makes it known understood evident that  this is the plane of insightHere it should be understood in terms of the earth elementThe  full understanding of scrutinization understands the five clingingaggregates in their true nature as impermanent  by delimiting them through insightcomprehension and scrutinizing their modes of impermanence etc together with their accompanimentsThe supreme path is the path of arahatshipEither is the full understanding of abandoning which in the abstract sense is the wisdom which abandons by eradicating them Thus characteristicearth is included by mentioning  hard solid etcSince the worldling when he perceives any of these four kinds of earth perceives it only as a portion of earth and not as a portion of water etc it is said he perceives as a segment of earthin this way the commentator shows that the perception of characteristicearth also occurs through the medium of the conventional expressionJust as applied thought and the other jhana factors despite their distinct specific natures are nevertheless all jhana factors in so far as they share the common nature of closely contemplating the object in the same way craving conceit and viewsdespite their distinct specific natures as yearning  selfinflation  and misapprehension  respectivelyare all forms of conceiving in so far as they occur in the common mode of misconstruing the object The misconstruing is the adherence to the object as I  and mineor it is the supramundane path for this abandons desire and lust without remainderBy showing the conceiving of personalityview the conceivings of craving and conceit based on materiality are also shownFor these take the form of the affection and conceit he arouses for the base he conceives through the conceiving of viewsOr else the conceiving of craving based on materiality is shown by the statements that he conceives the elements as  mine  and delights in them with the conceiving of conceit following it in conformity When he regards the self as in visible form  taking the immaterial dhammas such as feeling etc to be the self or all dhammas apart from the visible form base imagining the visible form base internally or externally as its container  he conceives This self of mine is in this visible form base Thus he conceives in the seen A section on the attainer  on the occasion of a jhana pertaining to the finematerial sphere or the immaterial sphere Since the jhana occurs in a single mode on a single object it is called unity The occurrence of the resultant jhana may also be included in the section on the attainer A section on the nonattainer  on the occasion of the occurrence of sense sphere dhammasFor even in access concentration  the mind has not completely attained to unity Relishing all  when there is no perception of the danger in all dhammas pertaining to the three planes due to the absence of disenchantment they are contemplated as satisfaction and craving increasesFor this has been said by the Exalted One  For one who dwells contemplating satisfaction in dhammas subject to the fetters craving increases   Conceiving all as created by himself through conceit he conceives himself to be the creator and ranks himself as superior etc by conceiving all to be created by him for such a conceit only arises when he conceives himself to be the creatorThe etc after all does not exist indicates that fatalism  etc should be included My self is great  by this he shows the doctrine which regards all as the manifestation of the self The rest should be understood by the method given in the section on earth  the conceiving which occurs thus  I am in all an obstacle an impediment for me is in all another is in all an obstacle an impediment for another is in allHe conceives himself apart  from all  when he holds the view that All this world is made of spirit  and conceives the origination or emanation of the self to proceed from the all consisting in spirit The affection and conceit he arouses for the base conceived by the conceiving of views are his conceivings of craving and conceit respectivelyConceiving All is my self or my creator or my master he conceives all is mine Delighting in it with craving and views he delights in all Thus the occurrence of the conceivings should be understood hereThose who hold the doctrine of supreme nibbana here and now conceive the five aggregates which have attained to the ultimate happiness to be nibbana but in reality they remain only personality The five kinds are the happiness of sense pleasures mentioned in the commentary and the happiness of the four finematerial sphere jhanas With distinguished knowledge  without falling short of the true nature of dhammas and without overshooting the mark as confused comprehension and wrong understanding do he knows it with distinguished knowledge which directly confronts the true nature of dhammas without falling away from it The meaning is with the full understanding through scrutinization based on the full understanding of the known and with one section of the full understanding of abandoningMā maññi ma he conceives by way of the unabandoned forms of conceiving amaññī  he does not conceive by way of the abandoned forms of conceiving Combined the two yield mā maññiThe learner cannot be described as  one who conceives  like the worldling who has not abandoned any of the conceivings nor as  one who does not conceive  like the arahat who has abandoned them allFor him part of the conceivings are abandoned part unabandonedAnd though the conceivings that are unabandoned have been greatly diminished by him he still should not conceive through those much less through the others due to the absence of a more distinct conceivingSince it is possible for him to fully understand that which should be fully understood conceivings do not arise for him in the way they do for the worldling who is destitute This absence of conceiving is for the purpose of fully understanding the base it is not an absence of conceiving achieved through the full understanding of the base as is the case with the arahatOr else mā maññī is a command prohibiting an optional action like Do not injure do not hurt etc The meaning is he should not conceive Thus I heard The Mahāsuññatā Sutta Of Kāḷakhemaka  He was called Black because of the colour of his skin but his name was KhemakaDwelling a dwelling made in that same Nigrodhas park in one part by erecting a surrounding wall building a gate house constructing dwellings like those called haṃsavaṭṭaka  such as a meeting hall a refectory and so forthMany resting places bed chair mattress pillow straw mat leather mat spread grass spread leaves spread straw and so forth were prepared They were placed bed touching bed  spread straw touching spread straw so that it resembled the dwelling place of bhikkhus who have formed themselves into a societyDo many The Blessed One has no doubts because of the complete destruction of all his defilements during the Session of Enlightenment The question is a rhetorical one and the word do is merely rhetoricalNo one who is uncertain gets to the acme of attainmentBefore this it seems the Blessed One had not seen ten or twelve bhikkhus living in one placeThen it occurred to him This social life is developed to the utmost in the round of becoming As water collects into rivers so social life is developed by beings in hell in the animal world in the realm of ghosts and in the Asura group and also in the human world the divine world and the Brahma worldFor hell is ten thousand leagues across and is crammed with beings like a tube packed with bath powder There is no counting or reckoning the beings in the place of torture by the fivefold binding see MN  and  likewise in the places of paring with adzes and so forth see MN  and  Such is the way they roast in societyAs to the animal world there is no counting or reckoning the termites in a single termite hill and likewise ants in each ants nestSuch is social life in the animal world tooAnd there are ghost cities a quarter or half a league across crowded with ghostsSuch is social life in the ghost realm tooThe tenthousand league sphere of Asura demons is like an earring or hole when the needle is put into the ear  Such is social life in the Asura Group tooAs regards the human world there were  in the large clans living at Sāvatthī and inside and outside Rājagaha  people  koṭisSuch is social life in certain places of the human world tooBeginning with the earth deities there is social life in the divine world and the Brahma world alsoEach deity has two and a half koṭis of dancers even up to nine koṭis Also there are ten thousand Brahmas living in one placeThereupon he thought For four incalculable ages and a hundred thousand aeons the Perfections have been fulfilled by me for the purpose of undoing living in societies And as soon as these bhikkhus have formed themselves into a society and get to delight in society they will act contrary to thatThen feeling concern for the Dhamma he thought again If it were possible to announce a training precept that two bhikkhus should not live in one place I would do so but that is not possibleSo I shall expound the discourse called The Great Way of Voidness which for training clansmen will be like an announced training precept like a fulllength looking glass placed at the city gateAfter that just as Khattiyas nobles and so on seeing their blemishes in that looking glass get rid of them and become unblemished so indeed even for  years after I have attained complete extinction clansmen delighting in solitude will make an end of the suffering due to the round of becoming by harkening to this discourse and avoiding societyAnd the number of clansmen who by harkening to this discourse and avoiding society have as though fulfilling the Blessed Ones wish made an end of suffering and attained complete extinction is past reckoningFor in the Vālikapiṭṭhi Monastery in Ceylon the Abhidhamma scholar called the Elder Abhaya after reciting this discourse together with a number of bhikkhus on the occasion of taking up residence for the rainy season exclaimed The Fully Enlightened One enjoins us to act thus and what are we doingAnd by avoiding society and delighting in solitude all of them attained arahatship within that same rainy seasonThis discourse is called the breakerup of societiesOf Ghatā of the one so namedAt the dwelling This dwelling too was built like Kāḷakhemakas dwelling in a part of Nigrodhas parkMaking robes the repairing of those already made by patching washing and so forth old and dirty ones and it is also the making up of unmade ones by arranging and sewing cloth provided for the purpose of robes Both are right but here making up of unmade ones is intendedfor people had given the Elder nanda material for robesAnd those bhikkhus sitting from the time announced for the needle work in the morning get up from it some time unannouncedIt is our time for robe making The Elder it seems thought Surely it is those resting places that have not been arranged by those bhikkhus that will have been seen by the Blessed Oneconsequently the Master is displeased and desires to give a severe reproof I will be a support for those bhikkhus That is why he spoke as he didBut the intention here is this Venerable Sir these bhikkhus are living in this way not just because they delight in being busy but on account of robemakingA bhikkhu nanda does not shine forth nanda whether it is an instance of being busy or whether it is an instance of robemaking or not still a bhikkhu who delights in company does not shine forthDo not be a support where there is no occasion for supportHere company is gathering with ones own communitySo whether he delights in company or in society in either case a bhikkhu who likes the fullness of society who is bound by the ties of society does not shine forthBut it is when a bhikkhu sweeps out his daytime quarters after his meal and after washing his feet well takes up his basic meditation subject and devotes himself to delight in solitude he shines forth in the Enlightened Ones DispensationThe bliss of renunciation the bliss in him who has renounced sensedesiresThe bliss of seclusion is the bliss of seclusion from sensedesires tooBut what leads to the pacification of greed and so forth is the bliss of peaceObtain  at will one who obtains his desire who obtains his wish without troubleTemporary free from defilement on any occasion of full absorptionDelectable agreeableMind deliverance the mind deliverance of the finematerial and immaterial worldsFor it is said The four absorptions jhāna and the four immaterial attainments these are the temporary liberationPermanent not deliverance from defilements occasionally but rather deliverance which is perpetual and supramundaneFor it is said The four noble paths and the four fruitions of recluseship these are the permanent liberationUnshakeable not to be shaken by defilementsSo far what has been saidA bhikkhu who delights in company who is bound by the ties of society will be unable to produce either mundane or supramundane special qualities But by avoiding society and delighting in solitude he can do soFor just as in the case of the Bodhisatta Vipassi as long as he wandered during seven years surrounded by eightyfour thousand homeless ones he was unable to produce the special quality of omniscience but by avoiding society and delighting in solitude he climbed to the summit of enlightenment and produced the special quality of omniscience in seven daysAlso as long as our Bodhisatta wandered with the Group of Five during six years he was unable to produce the special quality of omniscience but when they left him by delighting in solitude he climbed the summit of enlightenment and produced the special quality of omniscienceHaving thus pointed out the lack of attainment of special qualities of one who delights in company he said I do not see nanda etc in order to point out how this flaw arisesHere one material form is a physical bodyIn him who delights  therein in him who delights through greed for that material formwill not cause  to arise that would not cause these things to arise in him who delights in that material form I do not see any such material form And then they arise too as they did in Sañjaya owing to the changed state of Sāriputta and Moggallāna called their coming to the discipleship of Him of the Ten Powers see Vinaya Mahā Vagga as they did in Nāthaputa owing to the changed state of the householder UPali see MN  and as they did in the rich man in the Piyajātika Sutta see MN But this  nanda What is the sequence of meaningFor the purpose of removing the occasion in which any unintelligent bhikkhu newly gone forth should say The Fully Enlightened One leads us away from society like cattle sent into a field and he exhorts us to solitude but he himself lives surrounded by kings kings ministers and so on he began this part of the teaching in order to show that the Perfect One is alone even when sitting in the midst of a community extending over a world sphereHis mind tends to seclusion tends to NibbānaIt has put an end to is without remainder of unsupported by dissociated from states which give rise to cankersAssociated with dismissal associated with such words as You may goBut at what periods did the Blessed One speak thusEither during the period of activity following the meal or during the period of activity in the first watch of the nightFor after the meal the Blessed One adopts the lions pose in the Perfumed Cell and then he rises and sits absorbed in fruition attainmentAt that time the community gathers for the purpose of hearing the DhammaThen the Blessed One who knows the time comes forth from the Perfumed Cell and goes to the Enlightened Ones exalted seat and he teaches the Dhamma Then not exceeding the time like one judging the cooking of a medicinal oil he dismisses the community with his mind inclining to seclusionAlso in the first watch of the night he dismisses the community thus The night is well advanced now it is time to do as you think fitFor since reaching enlightenment even the Buddhas twofold fivedoor consciousness incline to NibbānaTherefore nanda because dwelling in voidness is peaceful and sublime thereforeInternally only internally as to the range of object Possessed of full awareness fully aware through successfully knowing the meditation subjectExternally in regard to anothers five aggregatesInternally and externally at one time internally at another time externallyThe imperturbable āneñjā this is a term for the four immaterial attainments of the sphere of boundless space and so forth he brings to mind the imperturbable immaterial attainment resolving I will become one who is Both Ways Released ubhato bhāgavimatto that is one who has attained both all eight meditative attainments and arahatshipFor when one who has emerged from a basic jhāna which is still unfamiliar and brings to mind voidness internally his mind does not enter into voidnessThereupon thinking How about anothers continuity of aggregates he brings it to mind externally There also it does not enter into itThereupon thinking How about at one time in my own continuity and another time in anothers continuity he brings to mind internally and externally There also it does not enter into itThereupon desiring to become one who is Both Ways Released thinking How about the immaterial attainment he brings to mind the imperturbable There also it does not enter into voidnessNow in that case he should not give up his effort and go following after supporters and so on but the same basic jhāna should be thoroughly brought to mind again and againThus he said In that same and so on in order to point out that it is like a tree cutters axe that does not have its effect but by resharpening the edge the axe may cut Similarly his repeatedly bringing to mind the basic jhāna will have its effect in regard to the meditation subjectNow in order to point out that when one has practised this his bringing to mind succeeds in respect to whatever he brings to mind he enters intoThus he is possessed of full awareness therein so when the meditation subject succeeds while he is walking he is possessed of full awareness through knowing that his meditation subject has succeededLies down stretches himself outThus he is possessed of full awareness thus he is one who practises full awareness through knowing I shall not indulgeIn the second paragraph he is one who practises full awareness through knowing In such talk I shall indulge This bhikkhus serenity and insight are fresh  and for the purpose of guarding them the seven kinds of suitable things are neededAbode resort and speech and person The foodThis is said for the purpose of pointing these outAs regards the two paragraphs dealing with thoughts full awareness should be understood as knowing respectively the not thinking and the thinking of the thoughtsHaving thus stated two of the paths by the abandoning of wrong thoughts he now said There are nanda these five cords of sensedesire and so on speaking of the insight for the third pathConcerned with any source of defilement concerned with any reason whatever among these five cords of sense desire for the arising of defilementsAttachment unabandoned defilement which appears as attachmentThen it being presentPossessed of full awareness possessed of full awareness through knowing the insuccess of the meditation subjectIn the second paragraphFor when he reviews thus Is desire and greed in regard to these five cords of sensedesire abandoned in me or not and knows that it is not abandoned this bhikkhu exerts energy and abolishes it by means of the path of NonReturn Thereupon when he reviews after emerging from the fruition which follows next upon the path he knows that it is abandoned He is possessed of full awareness through knowing that is what is meantNow speaking of the Arahat path he said There are nanda the five aggregates as objects of clinging and so onIs abandoned means that the conceit I am the desire the inherent tendency to assert I am based on materiality is abandonedlikewise that based on feeling and so on Full awareness should be understood as previously statedThese nanda are states is said with reference to the states of serenity samatha and insight vipassana and path and fruition set forth aboveOf  profitable origin come from what is profitableFor profitable states can be both profitable and derived from the profitable that is to say the first jhāna is profitable the second jhāna is both profitable and derived from the profitable the sphere of nothingness is profitable and the sphere of neither perceptionnornonperception is both profitable and derived from the profitable the sphere of neither perceptionnornonperception is profitable and the path of Streamentry is both profitable and derived from the profitable the path of NonReturn is profitable and the path of Arahatship is both profitable and derived from the profitableLikewise the first jhāna is profitable and states associated therewith are both profitable and derived from the profitable the path of Arahatship is profitable and the states associated therewith are both profitable and derived from the profitableNoble free from defilements and purifiedSupramundane beyond the world and purifiedInaccessible to the Evil One inaccessible to Māra the Evil OneFor Māra does not see the mind of a bhikkhu who sits absorbed in the eight attainments when they are made the basis of insight Nor is he able to know the consciousness that occurs in dependence on that as objectThat is why inaccessible is saidWhat do you think Why did he say thisHe said it in order to point out that there is one advantage in societyIn seeking the Masters company in going to in frequentingNow because there are some who dwell alone and who are not successful in getting at the meaning of the scriptures he therefore said Yet when this is so ananda and so on pointing out the disadvantage in solitude with reference to thatHere Yet when this is so nanda means when this solitary state existsThe teacher is a teacher who is a sectarian outside the DispensationBy the teachers undoing the undoing of the teacher is by the undoing due to defilements that have arisen inside himSo with the other kinds of undoingHe has been struck down they that is the unsuitable things have killed himBut why is it said that the undoing of the dweller in the life of purity has a more painful result a more bitter result and it even leads to rebirth in states of woeGoing into homelessness outside the Dispensation brings small gain there is no outstandingly great or special quality to be developed there but only the eight meditative attainments and the five supernormal powers beginning with the miraculous powersAccordingly just as there is no great suffering for one who falls from the back of a donkey  so since in a sect outside the Dispensation he falls only from worldly special qualities lokiyaguṇa it is not said in this way of the first two kinds of undoingBut going into homelessness in the Dispensation brings great gain Here the outstandingly special qualities are the four paths the four fruitions and nibbānaAccordingly just as when a noble youth wellborn on both parental sides traversing a city and seated in the place of honour on the back of an elephant falls from the elephants back he comes to great suffering so since in falling away from the Dispensation he falls away from the expectation of the aforesaid nine supramundane special qualities lokuttaraguṇaTherefore the construing should be done both with the preceding meaning and with the following meaning thus because the undoing of the dweller in the life of purity leads to greater suffering than the other two kinds because the practice of hostility towards the Blessed One see the Discourse  for long leads to harm and suffering but the practice of amity towards the Blessed One leads to welfareIn amity by the practice of amityIn hostility by the practice of hostilityErring do they turn aside from the Masters teaching one who transgresses on purpose even by as much as an offence of wrongdoing dukkata or wrong speech dubbhāsita is called one who errs turns asideIt is one who does not so transgress that is called one who does not err does not turn asidewhich is why he was doing work on robes there with a number of bhikkhusthinking When the sewing is finished we shall set our resting places in order They had not set them in order associety is gathering with different sorts of peoplewhat leads to the enlightenment due to the path is the bliss of enlightenmentone who obtains without painone who obtains in abundanceAny sign any sign mark of visible objects and so forth of materiality and so forthInternally internally as regards place of occurrenceVoidness fruition attainment through VoidnessVoidness internally in himself internally the meaning is produced in regard to his own five aggregatesIn that same sign of concentration as before is said with reference to jhāna treated as the basis for insightDwelling in this way in this way consisting of serenity concentration and insight samathavipassanāHere after walking for any given length of time now knowing I am able to walk for so long he should stand without breaking the sequence of posturesand so in each sectionthe climate and posture Select and cultivate of each The kind that is most suitablepossessed of full awareness means possessed of full awareness through knowing the success of the meditation subjectthe death of his special qualities and virtues is stated by thisit is said in this way of the undoing of the dweller in the life of purityI Shall not nanda treat you as I shall not behave towards you like Raw unbakedDamp clay a raw not quite dry potFor a potter takes the raw not quite dry clay pot gently with both hands lest it should breakAccordingly I shall not behave towards you as the potter behaves towards the damp clayRepeatedly admonishing after advising once I shall not be silent I shall advise and instruct by repeatedly admonishingRepeatedly testing by repeatedly testing for flawsJust as the potter tests for those that are cracked split or faulty among the baked pots and puts them aside and he takes only those that are wellbaked after he has tapped them again and again so I too shall advise and instruct by repeatedly testingThe rest is clear throughoutHe who is sound will stand the test he among you thus advised by me who is sound through having reached the path and its fruition will stand the testFurthermore the worldly special qualities as well are here intended by soundA disciple nanda is not Here though one who is welltaught who has studied much has been compared by the Blessed One to a soldier possessed of the five weapons in the passage The welltaught noble disciple bhikkhus abandons the unprofitable and develops the profitable he abandons the reproachable and develops the irreproachable and so he safeguards himself A IV Therefore one who explains the ten examples of talk in this sutta should do so pausing here for that purposeSo in this sutta the ten examples of talk that is talk of wanting little of contentment and so forth are given in three placeshe therefore said a disciple nanda is not and so on pointing out that he is not justified in seeking his company with that aim alone in viewbut he who does so has themNevertheless since he who does not after learning the scriptures practise in conformity with them lacks those weaponsNow in order to point out with what aim in view the Masters company should be sought he said But such talk as is and so onin such talk I shall indulge Paragraph  they are given by way of the suitable and the unsuitable in the passage for the sake of expositions of discourses and stanzas Paragraph  they are given as scriptures learned by ear and in this place Paragraph  they are given directly as something to be fulfilledTalk of kings is talk about kings proceeding like this Mahāsammata Mandhātu Dhammāsoka had so much power and so onSo too in the case of robbers and so onAs regards these such talk as such and such a king is handsome good looking and so forth is both worldly talk and animal talk that is pointlessBut if it proceeds So and so who was so powerful came to destruction it keeps within the meditation subjectAnd as regards robbers talk about Mūladeva or Meghamāla being so powerful and about their deeds thus Ah what heroes  is worldly talk and animal talkAnd as regards battles it is animal talk when it is instigated by satisfaction of sensedesires thus In the Bhārata battle and so forth so and so was killed thus was wounded thusMoreover it is wrong to talk about food and so forth according to satisfaction of sensedesires thus We chewed we ate we drank we used what looked like this smelt like this tasted like this was like this to touch But it is right to talk of it meaningfully thus Formerly we gave food drink clothing beds garlands and perfumes that looked like this and so forth to the virtuous we made such an offering at the shrineAs regards relatives and so on it is wrong to say according to satisfaction of sensedesires our relatives are brave capable or formerly we went about in vehicles like this But it should be said meaningfully thus even those relatives of ours have passed away or formerly we gave sandals like this to the OrderVillages it is wrong to talk of villages as good or bad to live in or easy or hard to get alms in or according to satisfaction of sensedesires thus The inhabitants of such and such a village are brave capable But it is right to talk meaningfully thus They have faith they have confidence or They have come to destruction and have passed awaySo too in the case of towns cities and countriesTalk of women is wrong when instigated by satisfaction of sense desires and is about appearance figure and so forth it is right only if it proceeds thus they have faith confidence or they have come to destructionTalk of heroes is wrong if it is in accordance with satisfaction of sensedesires thus the soldier called Nandamitta was a hero it is right only if it proceeds thus He had faith or He has come to destructionTalk of street inhabitants is wrong if it accords with satisfaction of sensedesires thus The people of such and such a street are easy to live with brave capable it is right only if it proceeds thus They have faith or They have come to destructionTalk of wells is said of talk of places for getting water or it is talk of women watercarriersIt is wrong when concerned with satisfaction of sensedesires thus She is pretty she is clever at dancing and singing it is right only if it begins She has faith has confidenceTalk of the dead is talk of past relativesTalk of trivialities is meaningless talk of different kinds that is not included in those already dealt with and still to be dealt withTalk of the origin of the world is talk of the Lokāyatas sophists vitanḍa and chatter of the kind beginning This world was created by whom It was created by so and so A crow is white because its bones are white A crane is red because its blood is redTalk of the origin of the sea is meaningless talk of the seas origin of the kind beginning thus Why is it called sea samudda Because it was excavated by the god Sagara Because he marked it with the seal mudd of his hand saying The ocean sgara has been excavated by me it is called sea samuddaWhether things are or are not is talk asserting that for some meaningless reason or other there is consequently existence there is consequently nonexistenceAnd here existence is eternity and nonexistence is annihilationSo with this talk on whether things are or are not animal talk is of thirty two kindsbut when it proceeds even they came to destruction then talk in each case conforms to a meditation subjectthe definition here is the same as that for present relativesexistence is increase nonexistence is diminutionexistence sensepleasure non existence is self mortificationone birth two births three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand lives many aeons of contraction of expansion of contraction and expansion

circumstances Passing away from there I was reborn hereyet whatever existence they have previously experienced whether in the World of Form or in the Formless World whether conscious unconscious or neitherconsciousnorunconsciousthey remember the details of those past livesand there is the kind that is free of the corruptions and not bound up with attachment which is called Ariyanbeing one he

waterhe walks on the water without breaking the surface as if on landhe flies crosslegged through the sky like a bird with wingshe even touches and strokes with his hand the sun and moon mighty and powerful as they areand he travels in the body as far as the Brahma worldand if he wishes Let me abide with the nondisgusting feeling disgust he can so abidealso feeling either disgust or nondisgust in the presence of bothor Ignoring both the disgusting and the nondisgusting may I abide in equanimity mindful and clearly aware he can so abideThe Exalted One is called the Tathāgata for eight reasons because he has thus come  because he has thus gone  because he has come to the real characteristic  because he has awakened to real dhammas in accordance with actuality  because he is a seer of the real  because he is a speaker of the real  because he practices what he teaches  and in the sense of vanquishing or surpassing  Why is the Exalted One called the Tathāgata because he has thus comeBecause he has come in the same way that the previous perfectly enlightened Buddhas came engaged in exertion for the welfare of the whole world camethat is as the Exalted Vipassī Sikhī Vessabhū Kakusandha Koṇāgamana and Kassapa What is meantOur Exalted One has come through the very same aspiration that these Exalted Ones came throughOr just as the Exalted Vipassī  the Exalted Kassapa came after they had fulfilled the full thirty pāramīsie the ten basic ten intermediate and ten ultimate pāramīs of giving virtue renunciation wisdom energy patience truthfulness determination loving kindness and equanimity made the five great relinquishingsie the relinquishing of limbs eyes wealth kingdom and children and wife fulfilled the preliminary effort the preliminary conduct the preaching of the Dhamma conduct for the good of relatives etc and reached the summit in conduct developing intelligenceexactly thus has our Exalted One come Or else just as the Exalted Vipassī  Kassapa came by developing and cultivating the four foundations of mindfulness the four right endeavors the four bases of spiritual success the five faculties the five powers the seven factors of enlightenment and the Noble Eightfold Pathexactly thus has our Exalted One comeHence he is the Tathāgata because he has thus comeAs Vipassī in the world and the otherThus he the allseeing is called TathāgataWhy is he called the Tathāgata because he has thus goneBecause as soon as he was born he went in the same way that the Exalted Vipassī Kassapa went as soon as they were bornAnd how did the Exalted One goAs soon as he was born he stood with his feet planted evenly on the ground and then facing north went forward with a stride of seven stepsAs it is said As soon as the bodhisattva was born nanda he stood with his feet planted evenly on the ground then while a white parasol was held over him facing north he went forward with a stride of seven steps Having surveyed all the directions he then uttered the roar of the Leader of the Herd I am the foremost in the world I am preeminent in the world I am supreme in the world This is my last birth There is now no renewal of existence not unreal  for it foretokened his numerous achievements of spiritual distinction as followsWhen as soon as he was born he stood with his feet planted evenly on the groundWhen he walked facing north  that was the foretoken of his supremacy in all the world When he stood surveying all the directions after completing the seventh step that foretokened his obtaining the unobstructed knowledge of omniscienceAnd his uttering the roar of the Leader of the Herd was the foretoken of his setting in motion the supreme irreversible Wheel of the DhammaJust as the previous Exalted Ones went thus exactly thus did the present Exalted One go  And his way of going was real not unreal for it foretokened the above achievements of spiritual distinctionHence the ancients have saidThe very moment the master bull was bornGotama took a stride of seven stepsAnd like a lion poised on a mountain topHence he is the Tathāgata because he has thus goneOr alternatively as the Exalted Vipassī  Kassapa went exactly thus did the present Exalted One go That is abandoning sensual desire by renunciation ill will by benevolence slothandtorpor by the perception of light restlessnessandremorse by nondistraction and perplexity by the defining of dhammas shattering ignorance with knowledge dispelling discontent with joy knocking away the panel of the hindrances with the first jhāna making applied and sustained thought subside with the second jhāna making rapture fade away with the third jhāna and abandoning pleasure and pain with the fourth jhāna surmounting perceptions of material forms impingement and diversity with the attainment of the base of infinite space the perception of the base of infinite space with the attainment of the base of infinite consciousness the perception of the base of infinite consciousness with the attainment of the base of nothingness and the perception of the base of nothingness with the attainment of the base of neither perception nor nonperceptionIn that very same way the Sakyan sage camegreat sages of the past Came to the state of omniscienceHis way of going was real that was the foretoken of his obtaining the four bases of spiritual success His stride of seven steps foretokened his obtaining the gems of the seven factors of enlightenmentthe golden staffed chowries that appeared his defeat of all the sectarian teachersthe white parasol his obtaining the stainless white parasol of the supreme deliverance of arahatshipHe stood upon the earth with even feetBeneath the parasol the Maruts heldWhen he finished taking seven stepsHe surveyed all directions with his gazeUttered his roar complete in factors eightThen he went abandoning the perception of permanence with the contemplation of impermanence the perception of pleasure with the contemplation of suffering the perception of self with the contemplation of nonself delight with the contemplation of disenchantment lust with the contemplation of fading away origination with the contemplation of cessation grasping with the contemplation of relinquishment the perception of compactness with the contemplation of destruction accumulation with the contemplation of fall the perception of stability with the contemplation of change the sign with the contemplation of the signless wish with the contemplation of the wishless adherence with the contemplation of emptiness adherence due to grasping at substance with the higher wisdom of insight into dhammas adherence due to confusion with the knowledge and vision of things as they really are the adherence due to reliance with the contemplation of danger nonreflection with the contemplation of reflection and adherence due to bondage with the contemplation of the rounds end Then he went demolishing the defilements coexisting with wrong view with the path of streamentry abandoning the gross defilements with the path of the oncereturner extirpating the defilements accompanied by subtle with the path of the nonreturner and eradicating all defilements with the path of arahatshipThus he is the Tathāgata because he has thus gone Why is he called the Tathāgata because he has come to the real characteristics   The earth element has the characteristic of hardnessthat is real not unreal the water element of flowing Material form has the characteristic of deformation The faculty of faith has the characteristic of resolution The power

accordance with actualityIt is the Four Noble Truths that are called real dhammasAs it is said These Four Noble Truths bhikkhus are real not unreal not otherwise What fourThis is suffering bhikkhusthis is real not unreal not otherwise and so on in detailThe Exalted One awakened to those truths Therefore because he awakened to real dhammas he is called the Tathāgatafor here the word gone has the meaning awakened Further the fact that aging and death originate and commence with birth as condition is real not unreal not otherwise  The fact that the kammaformations originate and commence with ignorance as condition is real not unreal not otherwise The fact that ignorance is the condition for the kammaformations the kamma formations for consciousness  birth for aging and death is real not unreal not otherwiseAll that the Exalted One awakened to Because he awakened to real dhammas he is called the TathāgataHence he is the Tathāgata because he awakened to real dhammas in accordance with actualityWhy is he called the Tathāgata because he is a seer of the realIn this world together with its gods etc in this generation with its rulers and its men whatever visibleform object there is that enters the threshold of the eyedoor of the innumerable beings throughout the innumerable world systemsthat the Exalted One knows and sees in all its modesAnd knowing and seeing it thus  as desirable or undesirable etc and as found under the applicable term among the seen heard sensed and cognized according to the method given thusWhat is the material form that is the visibleform baseThe material form derivative upon the four primary elements that is of colored appearance visible impinging blue yellow etc  he has analyzed it under numerous names in thirteen sections and by fiftytwo methods This is real not unrealThe same method applies to sounds entering the threshold of the eardoor For the Exalted One has said In this world bhikkhus together with its gods etc in this generation with its rulers and its men whatever is seen heard sensed cognized reached sought after or examined by the mindthat I knowthat I have directly known That the Tathāgata has understood But the Tathāgata does not take a stand upon it Hence he is the Tathāgata because he is a seer of the realHere the term Tathāgata should be understood to mean a seer of the realWhy is he called the Tathāgata because he is a speaker of the realIn the fortyfive year interval between the night when the Exalted One sitting in the invincible posture on the terrace of enlightenment crushed the heads of the three Māras and awakened to the supreme perfect enlightenment and the night when he attained parinibbāna in the nibbānaelement without residue while lying between the twin Sāl trees whatever the Exalted One spoke whether in the first middle or final periods following the enlightenmentthe discourses mixed prose and verse expositions stanzas joyous exclamations sayings birth stories wonders and miscellaniesall this is irreproachable in meaning and in phrasing free from excess and deficiency perfect in all its modes crushing the vanity of lust hatred and delusionThere is not even as much as a hairs tip in this that is defective It all appears as though it had been stamped with a single seal measured with a single ruler or weighed upon a single pair of scales It is all real not unreal not otherwiseAs it is said Between the night when the Tathāgata awakens to the supreme perfect enlightenment and the night when he attains parinibbāna in the nibbānaelement without residue whatever he speaks utters or expoundsall that is real not otherwiseTherefore he is called the Tathāgata For here the word gata has the meaning of enunciation Hence he is the Tathāgata because he is a speaker of the realFurther the word āgada or āgadana means pronouncement that is a statement His pronouncement is real and undistorted Thus changing the letter d to a t the derivation of the word Tathāgata may be understood in this senseWhy is he called the Tathāgata because he practices what he teachesThe bodily action of the Exalted One conforms to his speech and his speech conforms to his bodily action therefore he is one who practices what he teaches and teaches what he practicesSince he is of such a nature his bodily action has gone thus  proceeding in accordance with his speechAs it is said As the Tathāgata says so he doesTherefore he is called the Tathāgata Hence he is the Tathāgata because he practices what he teachesand his speech has gone thus proceeding in accordance with his bodily action thus he is the Tathāgataas he does so he says Why is he called the Tathāgata in the sense of vanquishing or surpassing From the pinnacle of existence downwards and from the Avīci hell upwards throughout the innumerable world systems the Tathāgata surpasses all beings in regard to virtue concentration wisdom emancipation and knowledgeandvision of emancipation There is none his equal or measure He is unequalled immeasurable incomparablethe king of kings the god of gods the Sakka above all Sakkas the Brahmā above all BrahmāsThus it is said In this world bhikkhus together with its gods etc in this generation with its rulers and its men the Tathāgata is the vanquisher the unvanquished the universal seer the wielder of power Therefore he is called the TathāgataHere the wordderivation should be understood as followsWhat kindHis elegance of teaching and his accumulation of meritFor by means of these he vanquishes all the rival teachers as well as this world together with its gods in the same way that a powerful physician vanquishes snakes with a divine medicineThus his medicine for vanquishing all the world is his real undistorted elegance of teaching and his accumulations of meritChanging the letter d to a t the derivation of the word Tathāgata may be understood thus he is the Tathāgata in the sense of vanquishingFurthermore he is the Tathāgata because he has gone through reality and because he has really gone Here gone has the meanings of undergone  gone beyond  attained  and practiced Thus he is the Tathāgata because he has gone throughie undergonereality by fully understanding the entire world through the scrutinization He is the Tathāgata because he has gone throughie gone beyondreality by fully understanding the world through the abandonment of its originHe is the Tathāgata because he has gone throughie attainedreality by realizing the cessation of the worldAnd he is the Tathāgata because he has really gone alongie practicedthe way leading to the cessation of the worldThus the Exalted One has saidThe world bhikkhus has been awakened to by the Tathāgata the Tathāgata is detached from the worldThe cessation of the world has been awakened to by the Tathāgata the Tathāgata has realized the cessation of the worldThe way leading to the cessation of the world has been awakened to by the Tathāgata the Tathāgata has developed the way leading to the cessation of the worldWhatever there is in this world together with its gods etc all that has been awakened to by the TathāgataTherefore he is called the Tathāgata The meaning of the word Tathāgata should be understood as givenBut this is the mere introduction to the explanation of the nature of a TathāgataAgada is as it were a kind of medicineThe origin of the world has been awakened to by the Tathāgata the Tathāgata has abandoned the origin of the worldFor only a Tathāgata himself can explain the nature of a Tathāgata in its completenessThough the five great relinquishings belong to the perfection of giving they are mentioned separately in order to show that they are distinct forms of relinquishing that they are extremely difficult to practice and that they are distinct requisites for enlightenment For the same reasons the relinquishing of the eyes is mentioned separately from the relinquishing of the limbs And though they all involve possessions the relinquishing of children and wife is mentioned separately from the relinquishing of wealth and kingdomThe preliminary effort is the achievement of the meditative attainments and the direct knowledges together with the preliminary portion of practice for these consisting in the duties of advancing and retreating The preliminary conduct is the achievement of extraordinary practice in giving etc included in the CariyāpiṭakaBut some say the preliminary effort is the aspiration and the preliminary conduct either the practice of giving etc or solitary wandering by way of bodily seclusionThe preaching of the Dhamma is talk that establishes and matures beings in the three types of enlightenment by explaining to them the practice of giving etc fewness of wishes etc the unsatisfactoriness of saṃsāra and the benefit of nibbānaConduct developing intelligence is the widening of knowledge by means of the knowledge of the ownership of action  the study of blameless occupations and blameless fields of knowledge the study of the aggregates bases etc and the scrutinization of the three characteristics In denotation it is the same as the perfection of wisdom but is mentioned separately in order to show the requisite of knowledgeBy mentioning the foundations of mindfulness  he shows the way of arrival that has been brought to its climax for those states can be understood as the constituents of the supramundane paths and fruits Or the foundations of mindfulness etc can be considered only as the accompaniments of insight by taking them as the preliminary portion of practiceAnd here it should be understood that by mentioning the aspiration he shows the beginning of the way of arrival by mentioning the pāramīs he shows the middle and by mentioning the four foundations of mindfulness etc he shows the consummationIn the first case the participle gone in the word Tathāgata is explained in the sense of bodily movement In the second case it is explained in the sense of the movement of knowledgeHere he first shows the Exalted Ones state of Tathāgatahood distinguished by its movement of knowledge by way of the preliminary practice for the first jhāna stated as the abandoning of the five hindrances sensual desire and the rest next by the eight meditative attainments together with their means and then by the eighteen principal insightsSince the perception of impermanence and the rest come to perfection for one established in the full understanding of the known which drives away the delusion obstructing the discernment of mentalitymateriality and the overcoming of doubt the shattering of ignorance is the means for insight So too since the jhānas etc are easily achieved when discontent is dispelled by joy based on delight in the attainments the dispelling of discontent is the means for the meditative attainmentsThe contemplation of impermanence is a name for the insight apprehending the impermanence of the dhammas pertaining to the three planesThe perception of permanence is the wrong perception of conditioned dhammas as permanent or eternal Under the heading of perception views and cognition should also be includedThe same method applies to the cases that followThe contemplation of disenchantment is the contemplation that occurs in the mode of becoming disenchanted with formationsDelight is craving accompanied by raptureThe contemplation of fading away is contemplation that occurs in the mode of fading awayContemplation of cessation is either the contemplation of the cessation of formationsor the contemplation that formations cease only and do not arise again by way of a future reoriginationthus it is said by the contemplation of cessation he makes cease and does not originate themThis is powerful desire for liberationThe contemplation of relinquishment is contemplation that occurs in the mode of relinquishingthis is the establishing of reflectionGrasping is the apprehension as permanent etcThe perception of compactness is the apprehension of identity because of continuity aggregation function or objectAccumulation is the forming Change is the attainment of distinct stagesThe perception of stability is the apprehension of lastingnessThe sign is the apprehension of formations as graspable entities due to the compactness of their aggregation etc and to the delimitation of their individual functionsWish is the wishing of lust etc in denotation it is the inclination towards formations because of cravingAdherence is the settled view of a selfHigher wisdom of insight into dhammas is the scrutinization of all dhammas as impermanent suffering etcAdherence due to grasping at substance is the inversion of apprehending a substance in the insubstantialAdherence due to confusion is the adherence the world originated through the creative play of God etcAdherence due to reliance is the apprehension of formations as a shelter and a haven the reliance is cravingThe contemplation of reflection is the knowledge that formations of such and such a kind are being relinquishedThe ending of the round is nibbāna the departure from the round The contemplation of the ending of the round is changeoflineage  the contemplation which occurs taking nibbāna as its objectThe adherence due to bondage is the adherence to formations due to being boundUnder numerous names the visible form object is described as desirable undesirable neutral inferior past future present internal external seen cognized visible form visibleform base visibleform element a colored appearance visible impingent blue yellow etcIn thirteen sections this is said in reference to the thirteen expository sections which have come down in the chapter on material form By fiftytwo methods this is said in reference to the four methods of defining contained in each of the thirteen sectionsThis is real because of the undistortedness of his vision and the incontrovertible character of his teachingThe analytical derivation of the word Tathāgata should be understood thus he goes to ie he sees and knows these dhammas beginning with the visibleform object in the very way they exist in their specific nature and modeis this the mere introductionWhyBecause the word Tathāgata like the word diligence contains the entire practice of the Dhamma as well as all the qualities of a BuddhaWe now undertake a detailed explanation of the pāramīs for clansmen following the suttas who are zealously engaged in the practice of the vehicle to great enlightenment  in order to improve their skillfulness in accumulating the requisites for enlightenment In what sense are they called pāramīs How many are there What is their sequence What are their characteristics functions manifestations and proximate causes What is their condition What is their defilement What is their cleansing What are their opposites How are they to be practiced How are they analyzed How are they synthesized By what means are they accomplished How much time is required to accomplish them What benefits do they bring What is their fruitThe answers follow What are the pāramīsThe pāramīs are the noble qualities such as giving etc accompanied by compassion and skillful means and untainted by craving conceit and viewsThe bodhisattvas the great beings are supreme  since they are the highest of beings by reason of their distinguished qualities such as giving virtue etc The pāramīsthe activities of giving etcare their character or their conductOr else he excels thus he is supreme  the bodhisattva is the fulfiller and guardian of the noble qualities such as giving etc that which belongs to the supremethe character or conduct of the one who is supreme is a pāramī ie the activities of giving etcIn brief there are tenThese have come down in the texts in their specific characterAs it is saidAnd again it is said How many dhammas are there venerable sir culminating in BuddhahoodThere are Sāriputta ten dhammas culminating in BuddhahoodWhat are the tenGiving Sāriputta is a dhamma culminating in Buddhahood Virtue renunciation wisdom energy patience truthfulness determination loving kindness and equanimity are dhammas culminating in BuddhahoodThus spoke the Exalted One Having spoken thus the WellFarer the Teacher further saidGiving virtue then renunciation Wisdom and energy come to fiveThis is said by way of their synthesis What is their sequenceHere sequence means sequence of teaching This sequence is rooted in the order in which the pāramīs are initially undertaken which in turn is rooted in the order in which they are investigated The quality that is investigated and undertaken at the beginning is taught firstTherein giving is stated first for giving assists virtue and is easy to practiceGiving accompanied by virtue is abundantly fruitful and beneficial so virtue is stated immediately after givingVirtue accompanied by renunciation  renunciation by wisdom  wisdom by energy  energy by patience  patience by truthfulness  truthfulness by determination  determination by loving kindness  and loving kindness accompanied by equanimity is abundantly fruitful and beneficial thus equanimity is stated immediately after loving kindnessEquanimity is accompanied by compassion and compassion by equanimity How can the bodhisattvas the great compassionate ones look upon living beings with equanimitySome teachers say Sometimes they show equanimity towards living beings when it is necessary to do soBut others say They do not show equanimity towards living beings but towards the offensive actions performed by beingsAnother method may be given Giving is stated at the beginning because it is common to all beings since even ordinary people practice giving because it is the least fruitful and because it is the easiest to practiceVirtue is stated immediately after giving because virtue purifies both the donor and the recipient to show that while giving benefits others virtue prevents the affliction of others in order to state a factor of abstinence immediately after a factor of positive activity and in order to show the cause for the achievement of a favorable state of future existence right after the cause for the achievement of wealthEnergy is stated immediately after wisdom because the function of wisdom is perfected by the arousing of energy to show the miraculous work the bodhisattva undertakes for the welfare of beings after he has reached reflective acquiescence in their emptiness to state the causal basis for exertion right after the basis for equanimity and to state the arousing of energy right after the activity of careful consideration according to the statement The activity of those who have carefully considered brings excellent results to show that the bodhisattva must patiently endure the suffering created by others even when he is working to the utmost for their welfare  Patience is mentioned immediately after energyTruthfulness is stated immediately after patience because the determination to practice patience continues long through truthfulness having first mentioned the patient endurance of wrongs inflicted by others to mention next fidelity to ones word to render them help in order to show that a bodhisattva who through patience does not vacillate in the face of abuse through truthful speech does not relinquish  and to show the truthfulness of the knowledge developed through reflective acquiescence in the emptiness of beingsand to show right after the veracity of knowledge the complete accumulation of the requisites of enlightenment  for one who knows things as they really are determines upon the requisites of enlightenment and brings them to completion by refusing to vacillate in the face of their opposites   Determination is stated immediately after truthfulnessEquanimity is mentioned immediately after loving kindness because equanimity purifies loving kindness in order to show the indifference one must maintain towards the wrongs inflicted by others when one is providing for their welfare having mentioned the development of loving kindness to state next the development of the quality which evolves from it and to show the bodhisattvas wonderful virtue of remaining impartial even towards those who wish him well Thus the sequence of the pāramīs should be understood as explainedThis is the schedule of the questions What are the pāramīs In what sense are they called pāramīs How many are thereReflecting then I saw the first pāramī is givingThe great way followed by the sages of the pastPatience truth resolution love With equanimity these are tenBut some say there are sixwhich we will explain below Renunciation is mentioned immediately after virtue because renunciation perfects the achievement of virtue in order to list good conduct of mind immediately after good conduct of body and speech because meditation succeeds easily for one who has purified virtue in order to show that the purification of ones end through the abandoning of the offensive mental defilements follows the purification of ones means by the abandoning of offensive actions and to state the abandoning of mental obsessions immediately after the abandoning of bodily and verbal transgressionsWisdom is mentioned immediately after renunciation because renunciation is perfected and purified by wisdom to show that there is no wisdom in the absence of meditation since concentration is the proximate cause of wisdom and wisdom the manifestation of concentration in order to list the causal basis for equanimity immediately after the causal basis for serenity and to show that skillful means in working for the welfare of others springs from meditation directed to their welfare because patience is perfected by energy as it said The energetic person by arousing energy overcomes the suffering imposed by beings and formations because patience is an adornment of energy as it is said The patience of the energetic person shines with splendor in order to state the causal basis for serenity immediately after the basis for exertion for restlessness due to excessive activity is abandoned through reflective acquiescence in the Dhamma  in order to show the perseverance of an energetic person since one who is patient and free from restlessness perseveres in his work in order to show the absence of craving for rewards in a bodhisattva diligently engaged in activity for the welfare of others for there is no craving when he reflects on the Dhamma in accordance with actuality andand because the undertaking proceeds imperturbably only when determination is unshakable  Loving kindness is mentioned immediately after determination having first shown nondeception in speech to show next unshakable commitment to ones word for a bodhisattva devoted to truth proceeds to fulfill his vows of giving etc without wavering because truthfulness is perfected by determination since abstinence becomes perfect in one whose determination is unshakable because loving kindness perfects the determination to undertake activity for the welfare of others in order to list the work of actually providing for the welfare of others right after stating the determination to do so for one determined upon the requisites of enlightenment abides in loving kindness What are their characteristics functions manifestations and proximate causes Firstly all the pāramīs without exception have as their characteristic the benefitting of others as their function the rendering of help to others or not vacillating as their manifestation the wish for the welfare of others or Buddhahood and as their proximate cause great compassion or compassion and skillful meansTaken separately the perfection of giving is the volition of relinquishing oneself and ones belongings accompanied by compassion and skillful means The perfection of virtue is good conduct of body and speech accompanied by compassion and skillful means in denotation it is the abstinence from what should not be done the volition to do what should be done etcThe perfection of renunciation is the act of consciousness that occurs renouncing sense pleasures and existence preceded by the perception of their inherent unsatisfactoriness and accompanied by compassion and skillful means The perfection of wisdom is the comprehension of the general and particular characteristics of dhammas accompanied by compassion and skillful meansThe perfection of energy is bodily and mental work for the welfare of others accompanied by compassion and skillful means The perfection of patience is the endurance of harm imposed by beings and formations or the act of consciousness occurring in such a mode predominated by nonaversion and accompanied by compassion and skillful means The perfection of truthfulness is nondeceptiveness in speech analyzed into an abstinence a volition etc accompanied by compassion and skillful means The perfection of determination is the unshakable determination to undertake  accompanied by compassion and skillful means or it is the act of consciousness occurring in such a mode The perfection of loving kindness is the wish to provide for the welfare and happiness of the world accompanied by compassion and skillful means in denotation it is benevolence The perfection of equanimity is the attitude of impartiality towards desirable and undesirable beings and formations dispelling attraction and repulsion accompanied by compassion and skillful means Giving has the characteristic of relinquishing its function is to dispel greed for things that can be given away its manifestation is nonattachment or the achievement of prosperity and a favorable state of existence an object that can he relinquished is its proximate causeVirtue has the characteristic of composing  coordinating and establishing are also mentioned as its characteristicIts function is to dispel moral depravity or its function is blameless conduct its manifestation is moral purity shame and moral dread are its proximate causeRenunciation has the characteristic of departing from sense pleasures and existence its function is to verify their inherent unsatisfactoriness its manifestation is the withdrawal from them a sense of spiritual urgency is its proximate causeWisdom has the characteristic of penetrating the real specific nature  or the characteristic of sure penetration like the penetration of an arrow shot by a skillful archer its function is to illuminate the objective field like a lamp its manifestation is non confusion like a guide in a forest concentration or the four truths is its proximate causeEnergy has the characteristic of striving its function is to fortify its manifestation is indefatigability an occasion for the arousing of energy or a sense of spiritual urgency is its proximate causePatience has the characteristic of acceptance its function is to endure the desirable and undesirable its manifestation is tolerance or nonopposition seeing things as they really are is its proximate causeTruthfulness has the characteristic of nondeceptiveness in speech its function is to

characteristic of promoting the aspect of neutrality its function is to see things impartially its manifestation is the subsiding of attraction and repulsion reflection upon the fact that all beings inherit the results of their own kamma is its proximate causeAnd here it should be mentioned that accompaniment by compassion and skillful means is the distinguishing feature of the characteristic of each virtueeg of relinquishing in the case of giving etcFor the virtues such as giving etc which occur in the mental continuities of bodhisattvas are always accompanied by compassion and skillful means It is this which makes them pāramīs What is their conditionThe condition of the pāramīs is firstly the great aspiration This is the condition for all the pāramīs without exceptionThe aspiration for Buddhahood only succeeds when made by one who has attained to the human state of existence not when made by one existing as a nāga supaṇṇa etcThe male sex  For one who has attained to the human state the aspiration only succeeds when made by a man not when made by a woman eunuch neuter or hermaphroditeWhyFor the aforesaid reason  and because there is no fulfillment of the required characteristics As it is said This is impossible bhikkhus this cannot come to pass that a woman might become a Holy One a perfectly enlightened Buddha The cause  the achievement of the necessary supporting conditionsEven for a man the aspiration only succeeds for one endowed with the necessary supporting conditions that is one who has achieved the requisite causal foundation not for anyone elseThe sight of the Master  the personal presence of the MasterThe aspiration only succeeds when made by one aspiring in the presence of a living Buddha When made after the Exalted One has passed into parinibbānabefore a shrine at the foot of the Bodhi Tree in front of an image or in the presence of paccekabuddhas or the Buddhas disciplesthe aspiration does not succeedWhyBecause the recipient lacks the power The aspiration only succeeds when made in the presence of the Buddhas for they alone possess spiritual power adequate to the loftiness of the aspirationThe going forth  The aspiration succeeds only when made in the presence of the Exalted Buddha by one who has gone forth  either as a bhikkhu or as an ascetic who maintains the doctrine of kamma and the moral efficacy of action it does not succeed for one living in the household stateWhyBecause the household state does not correspond with that of a Buddha The great bodhisattvas attain the supreme enlightenment only after they have gone forth into homelessness not while they are still householders Therefore at the time of making the resolution it is only one who has gone forth endowed with the appropriate qualities and determination who can succeedThe achievement of noble qualities  the achievement of such noble qualities as the direct knowledges etcFor the aspiration only succeeds when made by one who has gone forth and gained the eight meditative attainments and the five mundane kinds of direct knowledge it does not succeed for one devoid of these qualitiesWhyBecause one devoid of them is incapable of investigating the pāramīs It is because he possesses the necessary supporting conditions and the direct knowledges that the Great Man after he has made the aspiration is able to investigate the pāramīs by himselfExtreme dedication  extreme devotionThe aspiration only succeeds for one endowed with the aforesaid qualities who at the time has such strong devotion for the Buddhas that he is prepared to relinquish his very life for themStrong desire  wholesome desire the wish for accomplishmentOne possessed of the aforesaid qualities must have strong desire yearning and longing to practice the dhammas culminating in Buddhahood Only then does his aspiration succeed not otherwiseThe following similes illustrate the magnitude of the desire required If he were to hear He alone can attain Buddhahood who can cross a whole world system filled with water and reach the farther shore by the bare strength of his armshe would not deem that difficult to do but would be filled with desire for the task and would not shrink awayIf he were to hear He alone can attain Buddhahood who can tread across a whole world system filled with flameless smokeless redhot coals cross over and reach the other side etcIf he were to hear Buddhahood can only be attained after being tortured in hell for four incalculables and a  aeonshe would not deem that difficult to do but would be filled with desire for the task and would not shrink away Such is the magnitude of the desire requiredThe aspiration made by one endowed with these eight factors is in denotation the act of consciousness occurring together with the collection of these eight factorsIts characteristic is rightly resolving to attain the supreme enlightenmentIts function is to yearn Oh may I awaken to the supreme perfect enlightenment and bring wellbeing and happiness to all beings  It is manifest as the root cause for the requisites of enlightenment Its proximate cause is great compassion or the achievement of the necessary supporting conditionsSince it has as its object the inconceivable plane of the Buddhas and the welfare of the whole immeasurable world of beings it should be seen as the loftiest most sublime and most exalted distinction of merit endowed with immeasurable potency the root cause of all the dhammas culminating in BuddhahoodSimultaneous with its arising the Great Man enters upon the practice of the vehicle to great enlightenment He becomes fixed in his destiny irreversible and therefore properly gains the designation bodhisattva His mind becomes fully devoted to the supreme enlightenment in its completeness and his capacity to fulfill the training in the requisites of enlightenment is establishedFor when their aspiration succeeds the Great Men correctly investigate all the pāramīs with their selfevolved knowledge which prefigures their future attainment of omniscience Then they undertake their practice and fulfill them in due orderas was done by the wise Sumedha when he made his great aspirationThe aspiration has four conditions  four causes  and four powers Therein what are the four conditionsFirst the Great Man sees a Tathāgata performing a miracle replete with wonders and marvels through the great spiritual power of a BuddhaHis mind taking this display as its object and support becomes fixed upon the great enlightenment and he thinks This Dhammaelement is indeed endowed with tremendous spiritual power since by penetrating it the Exalted One has acquired such a wonderful and marvelous nature and such inconceivable spiritual powerTaking this display of the Buddhas spiritual power as condition and support he resolves upon the supreme enlightenment and fixes his mind on this goalIn the second case he does not see the great spiritual power of the Tathāgata but he hears The Exalted One is of such and such a natureTaking this as condition and support he resolves upon the supreme enlightenment and fixes his mind on this goalIn the third he neither sees the great spiritual power of the Tathāgata nor hears about it from another but he hears someone expounding the Tathāgatas Dhamma with a discourse concerning the spiritual power of a Buddha such as a discourse on the ten powers of a Tathāgata Taking this as condition and support he resolves upon the supreme enlightenment and fixes his mind on this goalIn the fourth case he neither sees the great spiritual power of the Tathāgata nor hears about it from another nor hears the Dhamma of the Tathāgata But he is a man of lofty temperament and a noble disposition and he thinks I will protect the heritage lineage tradition and law of the Buddhas To this end he honors reveres esteems worships and venerates the Dhamma Taking this as condition and support he resolves upon the supreme enlightenment and fixes his mind on this goalWhat are the four causes for the great aspirationFirst the Great Man is naturally endowed with the necessary supporting conditions  having observed his course of duties under former BuddhasThe Great Man is naturally endowed with a compassionate temperament and disposition He desires to alleviate the suffering of beings and is even ready to relinquish his own body and life to do soUntil he reaches his goal the Great Man is willing to struggle and strive for an extremely long time along a course involving great hardship without fear and without becoming disenchanted with all the suffering of the round all for the sake of the welfare of other beingsThe Great Man relies upon good friends who restrain him from evil and establish him in what is goodThese are the necessary supporting conditions with which the Great Man is endowed Just as his temperament slants slopes and slides without deviation to full enlightenment so too it inclines to conduct for the welfare of beingsBecause he is endowed with such supporting conditions the following traits appear in him creating a sharp distinction between himself and beings bound for the enlightenment of a disciple or the enlightenment of a paccekabuddha  with regard to their faculties  ways of practice  and skillfulness First the Great Man endowed with the necessary supporting conditions possesses lucid faculties and lucid knowledge but not so the othersSecond the Great Man practices not for his own welfare but for the welfare of othersAnd third he applies skillfulness to his practice through his ingenuity in creating opportunities and his skill in distinguishing what is possible from what is not possibleThus the Great Man is naturally inclined to giving and delights in giving Whenever he has anything that may be given away he gives it away and does not feel any annoyance on account of giving He is constantly and continually in the habit of sharing He gives joyfully full of solicitude not with an apathetic mind Even after giving a large gift he does not become complacent much less after giving a small gift To generate zeal in others he speaks in praise of giving he delivers discourses concerned with giving he is elated when he sees others practicing giving and he gives fearlessness to others in fearful situations These are some of the Great Mans traits indicating the perfection of giving due to his inclination towards givingAgain the Great Man feels shame and moral dread over evil deeds such as taking life etc He is benevolent towards living beings He is meek goodnatured free from craftiness and hypocrisy upright easy to admonish and endowed with qualities which make him easy to admonish gentle compliant and humble He never takes an article belonging to someone else not even a blade of grass If he offers to cover anothers expenses himself he does not break his word If someone through forgetfulness or negligence leaves some article behind he reminds him and endeavors to prevent it from falling into anothers hands He is not lustful does not arouse even an evil thought over women bound to other men and avoids misconduct with women from afar He is a speaker of truth devoted to truth one who reconciles those who are at variance and promotes friendships his speech is endearing preceded by a smile congenial he speaks on the good speaks on the Dhamma He is free from covetousness ill will and inverted views possessing the knowledge of the ownership of action and the knowledge in conformity with the Four Noble Truths He is grateful and thankful venerates his elders is completely pure in his livelihood and a lover of the Dhamma He exhorts others to undertake the Dhamma restrains beings in every possible way from doing what is improper and establishes them in the fulfillment of their duties He himself endeavors to fulfil his own duties and if he finds that he has done something he should not have done he immediately desists These are some of the Great Mans traits indicating the perfection of virtue due to his inclination towards virtueAgain his defilements and hindrances are feeble He inclines towards solitude and is generally free from distraction Evil thoughts do not invade his mind When he has gone into solitude he can concentrate his mind with little trouble Thoughts of loving kindness readily flow from him even towards those who are hostile towards him how much more then towards others He is mindful remembering and recollecting what was done and said long ago and intelligent being endowed with wisdom nourished by the Dhamma He is adroit in the fulfilment of his various duties and energetic in working for the welfare of beings Through the power of his patience he can endure anything His determination is unshakable and he stands firm in his undertakings  And he remains equanimous in all situations requiring equanimity These are some of the Great Mans traits indicating the remaining pāramīs due to his inclination towards the qualities for which they standWhen it is said of the Great Man endowed with these traits indicating the requisites of enlightenment that reliance upon good friends is a cause for the great aspirationthis in brief is the characteristic of the good friend The good friend possesses faith virtue learning renunciation energy mindfulness concentration and wisdomThrough his accomplishment in faith he has faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata and in kamma and its fruits thus he does not abandon his wish for the welfare of beings the root cause for the supreme enlightenment Through his accomplishment in virtue he is dear and agreeable to beings revered and esteemed an exhorter a censor of evil a teacher patient in speech Through his accomplishment in learning he gives profound discourses leading to the welfare and happiness of beings Through his accomplishment in renunciation he is of few wishes content secluded and aloof Through his accomplishment in energy he is energetic in promoting the welfare of beings Through his accomplishment in mindfulness his mindfulness is established in blameless states Through his accomplishment in concentration he is undistracted and concentrated in mind Through his accomplishment in wisdom he understands things in their undistorted nature Through mindfulness he examines the consequences of wholesome and unwholesome actions through wisdom he understands as they really are what is beneficial and harmful for beings through concentration he unifies his mind on that matter and through energy he restrains beings from what is harmful and enjoins them in what is beneficialHence it is saidThe talks he gives are deep and profound He does not enjoin one in improper waysRelying on a good friend possessed of these qualities the Great Man brings to perfection his own achievement of the necessary supporting conditionsHaving fully purified his end and means and come into possession of the four powers it is not long before he acquires the eight factors makes the great aspiration and becomes established in the state of a bodhisattvairreversible fixed in destination bound for full enlightenmentThese are his four powersThe external power is the longing or undeviating inclination for the supreme enlightenment which is grounded upon consideration for others through this power the Great Man dominated by a consideration for the world and upheld by a sense of moral dread forms the aspiration fulfills the pāramīs and attains the supreme enlightenmentThe power of the supporting conditions is the longing or undeviating inclination for the supreme enlightenment based on the achievement of the necessary supporting conditions through this power the Great Man endowed with sharp faculties and a lucid constitution and upheld by mindfulness forms the aspiration fulfills the pāramīs and attains the supreme enlightenmentThe power of effort is the Great Mans endowment with the appropriate effort for supreme enlightenment that is his thoroughness and perseverance in his work through this power the Great Man with purified effort and uninterrupted work forms the aspiration fulfills the pāramīs and attains the supreme enlightenmentThe aspiration originating by means of the four conditions the four causes and the four powers and succeeding when it becomes endowed with the collection of eight factors is the conditionthe root causefor the pāramīsWhen it arises four wonderful and marvellous qualities establish themselves in the Great Man He develops a heart of love for all living beings in every realm of existence just as if they were his own dear childrenHis inclination and efforts turn towards promoting the welfare and happiness of beingsThe potential Buddhaqualities within himself grow more and more prominent and come to maturitySince the Great Man possesses the condition for the loftiest flood of merit and goodness the very nutriment of happiness he becomes worthy of gifts the ultimate receptacle for the reverence of beings an unequalled field of merit for the worldIt is in this way that the great aspiration with its numerous noble qualities and benefits functions as the condition for the pāramīsLike the aspiration great compassion and skillful means are also conditions for the pāramīsTherein skillful means is the wisdom which transforms giving into requisites of enlightenment Through their great compassion and skillful means the Great Men devote themselves to working uninterruptedly for the welfare of others without any concern for their own happiness and without any fear of the extremely difficult course of conduct that great bodhisattvas must follow And their nature is such that they are able to promote the welfare and happiness of beings even on occasions when they are merely seen heard of or recollected inspires confidenceThrough his wisdom the bodhisattva perfects within himself the character of a Buddha and through his compassion the ability to perform the work of a Buddha Through wisdom he brings himself across  through compassion he leads others across Through wisdom he understands the suffering of others through compassion he strives to alleviate their suffering Through wisdom he becomes disenchanted with suffering through compassion he accepts suffering Through wisdom he aspires for nibbāna through compassion he remains in the round of existence Through compassion he enters saṃsāra through wisdom he does not delight in it Through wisdom he destroys all attachments but because his wisdom is accompanied by compassion he never desists from activity that benefits others Through compassion he shakes with sympathy for all but because his compassion is accompanied by wisdom his mind is unattached Through wisdom he is free from Imaking and my making through compassion he is free from lethargy and depression So too through wisdom and compassion respectively he becomes his own protector and the protector of others a sage and a hero one who does not torment himself and one who does not torment others one who promotes his own welfare and the welfare of others fearless and a giver of fearlessness dominated by consideration for the Dhamma and by consideration for the world grateful for favors done and forward in doing favors for others devoid of delusion and devoid of craving accomplished in knowledge and accomplished in conduct possessed of the powers and possessed of the grounds of self confidence Thus wisdom and compassion as the means for attaining each of the specific fruits of the pāramitās is the condition for the pāramīsAnd the same pair is a condition for the resolution as wellThe four factorszeal intelligence stability and beneficent conductare likewise conditions for the pāramīs Because they serve as the basis for the arising of Buddhahood these factors are called grounds for Buddhahood Herein zeal means energy in striving for the requisites of enlightenmentIntelligence is wisdom in applying skillful means to the requisites of enlightenmentStability is determination an unshakable determination of the willBeneficent conduct is the development of loving kindness and compassionFor bodhisattvas seeing the fault in sense pleasures and in household life incline to renunciation Seeing the fault in company they incline to solitude Seeing the faults in greed hatred and delusion they incline to nongreed nonhatred and nondelusion Seeing the fault in all the realms of existence bodhisattvas incline to escapeTherefore these six inclinations of bodhisattvas are conditions for the pāramīsFor the pāramīs do not arise without seeing the danger in greed etc and the superiority of nongreed etc The inclination to nongreed etc is the slanting of the mind towards relinquishing etc because of the superiority of nongreed etcFor bodhisattvas through their inclination towards giving see the fault in its opposite ie in stinginess and therefore fulfill the perfection of givingThrough their inclination towards virtue they see the fault in moral depravity and therefore fulfill the perfection of virtueThrough their inclination towards renunciation they see the fault in sense pleasures and in household life through their inclination towards knowing things as they really are they see the faults in ignorance and perplexity through their inclination towards energy they see the fault in laziness through their inclination towards patience they see the fault in impatience through their inclination towards truthfulness they see the fault in deceptive speech through their inclination towards determination they see the fault in lack of determination through their inclination towards loving kindness they see the fault in ill will and through their inclination towards equanimity they see the danger in the vicissitudes of the world Thus they fulfill the perfection of renunciation and the other perfections down to equanimityIn this way the inclination towards giving and towards the other nine virtues by bringing about the achievement of all the pāramīs serve as their conditionReviewing the danger in their opposites and the benefits in their practice is another condition for the pāramīs eg in the case of the perfection of giving the danger in nonrelinquishing and the benefit in relinquishingThis is the method of reviewing The perfection of giving should be reflected upon thus Possessions such as fields land bullion gold cattle buffaloes slaves children wives etc bring immense harm to those attached to them Because they stimulate desire they are wanted by many people they can be confiscated by kings and thieves they spark off disputes and create enemies they are basically insubstantial to acquire and protect them one has to harass others when they are destroyed many kinds of calamities such as sorrow etc follow and because of attachment to these things the mind becomes obsessed with the stain of stinginess and as a result one is reborn in the plane of miseryOn the other hand one act of relinquishing these things is one step to safety Therefore one should diligently relinquish themFurther when a suppliant asks for something a bodhisattva should reflect He is my intimate friend for he divulges his own secret to me He is my teacher for he teaches me When you go you have to abandon all Going to the world beyond you cannot even take your own possessions He is a companion helping me to remove my belongings from this world which like a blazing house is blazing with the fire of death In removing this he helps me to get rid of the worry it costs me He is my best friend for by enabling me to perform this noble act of giving he helps me to accomplish the most eminent and difficult of all achievements the attainment of the plane of the BuddhasHe should further reflect He honors me with a lofty task therefore I should acknowledge that honor faithfully And Since life is bound to end I should give even when not asked much more when asked And Those with a lofty temperament search for someone to give to but he has come to me on his own accord because of my merit And Bestowing a gift upon a suppliant will be beneficial to me as well as to him And Just as I would benefit myself so should I benefit all the world And If there were no suppliants how would I fulfill the perfection of giving And Everything I acquire should be obtained only to give to others And When will beggars feel free to take my belongings on their own accord without asking And How can I be dear and agreeable to beggars and how can they be dear and agreeable to me How can I give and after giving be elated exultant filled with rapture and joy And how can beggars be so on my account How can my inclination to giving be lofty How can I give to beggars even without beings asked knowing their hearts desire And Since there are goods and beggars have come not to give them something would be a great deception on my part And How can I relinquish my own life and limbs to those who ask for themHe should arouse a desire to give things away without concern by reflecting Good returns to the one who gives without his concern just as the boomerang returns to the one who threw it without his concernIf a dear person asks for something he should arouse joy by reflecting One who is dear is asking me for somethingIf an indifferent person asks for something he should arouse joy by reflecting Surely if I give him something he will become my friendAnd if a hostile person asks for something he should be especially happy thinking My foe is asking me for something though he is hostile towards me by means of this gift he will surely become my dear friendThus he should give to neutral and hostile people in the same way he gives to dear people having first aroused loving kindness and compassionIf due to their cumulative force states of greed should arise for things that can be given away the bodhisattvaaspirant should reflect Well now good man when you made the aspiration for full enlightenment did you not surrender this body as well as the merit gained in relinquishing it for the sake of helping all beings Attachment to external objects is like the bathing of an elephant therefore you should not be attached to anythingSuppose there is a great medicine tree and someone in need of its roots takes away its roots someone in need of its shoots bark trunk limbs heartwood branches foliage flowers or fruits takes away its shoots bark trunk etc The tree would not be assailed by such thoughts as They are taking away my belongings In the same way when I have undertaken to exert myself for the welfare of all the world I should not arouse even the subtlest wrong thought over this wretched ungrateful impure body which I have entrusted to the service of othersAnd besides what distinction can be made between the internal material elements and the external material elements  They are both subject to inevitable breaking up dispersal and dissolution This is only confused prattle the adherence to this body as This is mine this am I this is my selfI should have no more concern over my own hands feet eyes and flesh than over external things Instead I should arouse the thought to surrender them to others Let those who need them take them away As he reflects in this way resolved upon full enlightenment without concern for his body or life his bodily vocal and mental actions will easily become fully purifiedWhen his bodily vocal and mental actions along with his livelihood become purified he abides in the practice of the true way and through his skillful means in regard to gain and loss he is able to benefit all beings to an even greater extent by relinquishing material gifts and by giving the gift of fearlessness and the gift of the true Dhamma This is the method of reflecting on the perfection of givingThe perfection of virtue should be reflected upon as follows Even the waters of the Ganges cannot wash away the stain of hatred yet the water of virtue is able to do so Even yellow sandalwood cannot cool the fever of lust yet virtue is able to remove it Virtue is the unique adornment of the good surpassing the adornments cherished by ordinary people such as necklaces diadems and earrings It is a sweetscented fragrance superior to incense as it pervades all directions and is always in place a supreme magical spell which wins the homage of deities and of powerful khattiyas etc a staircase ascending to the world of the gods to the heaven of the Four Great Kings etc a means for achieving the jhānas and the direct knowledges a highway leading to the great city of nibbāna the foundation for the enlightenment of disciples paccekabuddhas and perfectly enlightened Buddhas And as a means for the fulfilment of all ones wishes and desires it surpasses the tree of plenty and the wishfulfilling gemAnd the Exalted One has said The hearts resolution of the virtuous bhikkhus succeeds on account of his purity And If bhikkhus a bhikkhu should wish May I be dear and agreeable to my companions in the Holy Life revered and esteemed he should be perfect in fulfilling the rules of conduct And Wholesome virtues nanda lead to freedom from remorse And These householders are the five benefits of the virtuous mans endowment with virtue  Thus the noble qualities of virtue should be reflected upon by way of these suttasand the danger in moral depravity by way of such suttas as The Simile of the Mass of Fire Virtue should be reflected upon as the basis for rapture and joy as giving immunity from fear of selfreproach the reproach of others temporal punishment and an evil destination after death as praised by the wise as the root cause for freedom from remorse as the basis for security and as surpassing the achievements of high birth wealth sovereignty long life beauty status kinsmen and friendsFor great rapture and joy arise in the virtuous man when he reflects on his own accomplishment in virtue I have done what is wholesome I have done what is good I have built myself a shelter from fearThe virtuous man does not blame himself and other wise men do not blame him and he does not encounter the dangers of temporal punishment or an evil destination after deathTo the contrary the wise praise the noble character of the virtuous manAnd virtue is the supreme basis for security since it is the foundation for diligence a blessing and a means for achieving great benefits such as preventing the loss of wealth etc Accomplishment in virtue surpasses birth in a good family since a virtuous man of low birth deserves to be worshipped even by great powerful khattiyasVirtue surpasses material wealth for it cannot be confiscated by thieves follows one to the world beyond produces great fruit and acts as the foundation for such qualities as serenity etcAnd because of their virtue beings attain sovereignty in their respective orders Virtue is superior even to life for it is said that a single day in the life of the virtuous is better than a hundred years of life devoid of virtue  and there being life the disavowal of the training is called death Virtue surpasses the achievement of beauty for it makes one beautiful even to ones enemies and it cannot be vanquished by the adversities of aging and sicknessAs the foundation for distinguished states of happiness virtue surpasses such distinguished dwellings as palaces mansions etc and such distinguished social positions as that of a king prince or generalBecause it promotes ones highest welfare and follows one to the world beyond virtue surpasses kinsmen and friends even those who are close and affectionateAgain in accomplishing the difficult task of selfprotection virtue is superior to troops of elephants horses chariots and infantry as well as to such devices as mantras spells and blessings for it depends on oneself does not depend on others and has a great sphere of influenceThus it is said The Dhamma protects the one who lives by the Dhamma When one reflects in this way upon the numerous noble qualities of virtue ones unfulfilled achievement of virtue will become fulfilled and ones unpurified virtue will become purifiedIf due to their cumulative force states antithetical to virtue such as aversion should arise from time to time the aspirant should reflect Did you not make the resolution to win full enlightenment One defective in virtue cannot even succeed in mundane affairs much less in supramundane matters You should reach the peak of virtue for virtue is the foundation for supreme enlightenment the foremost of all achievements You should always be well behaved safeguarding your virtue perfectly more carefully than a hen safeguarding its eggsFurther by teaching the Dhamma you should help beings to enter and reach maturity in the three vehicles But the word of a morally dubious man is no more reliable than the remedy of a doctor who does not consider what is suitable for his patients How can I be trustworthy so that I can help beings to enter and reach maturity in the three vehicles I must be pure in character and in virtueHow can I acquire the distinguished attainments such as the jhānas etc so that I will be capable of helping others and of fulfilling the perfection of wisdom etc The distinguished attainments such as the jhānas etc are not possible without purification of virtue Therefore virtue should be made perfectly pureThe perfection of renunciation should be reflected upon by first discerning the dangers in household life according to the text Household life is constricting a path for the dust of passions etc  in sense pleasures according to the text Sense pleasures are like a skeleton etc  and in sensual desire according to the text Suppose a man borrowed a loan and undertook work etc  Then in the opposite way one should reflect upon the benefits in going forth according to the text Going forth is like open space etc This is a brief statement For details one should consult such suttas as The Great Mass of Suffering or The Simile of the Venomous Snakes For the perfection of wisdom the noble qualities of wisdom should be considered as follows Without wisdom the virtues such as giving do not become purified and cannot perform their respective functionsJust as without life the bodily organism loses its luster and cannot perform its proper activities and as without consciousness the sense faculties cannot exercise their functions in their respective spheres just so without wisdom the faculties such as faith etc cannot perform their functions Wisdom is the chief cause for the practice of the other pāramīsBy means of wisdom the act of relinquishing exercised with skillful means and practiced for the welfare of others attains the status of a pāramīAgain without wisdom virtue cannot be severed from the defilements of craving etc and therefore cannot even reach purification much less serve as the foundation for the qualities of an omniscient BuddhaOnly the man of wisdom clearly recognizes the dangers in household life in the strands of sense pleasure and in saṃsāra and sees the benefits in going forth in attaining the jhānas and in realizing nibbāna and he alone goes forth into homelessness develops the jhānic attainments and directed towards nibbāna establishes others thereinEnergy devoid of wisdom does not accomplish the purpose desired since it is wrongly aroused and it is better not to arouse energy at all than to arouse it in the wrong wayBut when energy is conjoined with wisdom there is nothing it cannot accomplish if equipped with the proper meansAgain only the man of wisdom can patiently tolerate the wrongs of others not the dullwitted manIn the man lacking wisdom the wrongs of others only provoke impatience but for the wise they call his patience into play and make it grow even strongerThe wise man having understood as they really are three noble truths their causes and opposites never speaks deceptively to othersSo too having fortified himself with the power of wisdom the wise man in his fortitude forms an unshakable determination to undertake all the pāramīsOnly the man of wisdom is skillful in providing for the welfare of all beings without discriminating between dear people neutrals and enemiesAnd only by means of wisdom can he remain indifferent to the vicissitudes of the world such as gain and loss without being affected by themIn this way one should reflect upon the noble qualities of wisdom recognizing it to be the cause for the purification of all the pāramīsFurthermore without wisdom there is no achievement of vision and without the achievement of vision there can be no accomplishment in virtue One lacking virtue and vision cannot achieve concentration and without concentration one cannot even secure ones own welfare much less the lofty goal of providing for the welfare of others Therefore a bodhisattva practicing for the welfare of others should admonish himself Have you made a thorough effort to purify your wisdomFor it is by the spiritual power of wisdom that the Great Beings established in the four foundations benefit the world with the four bases of beneficence help beings enter the path to emancipation and bring their faculties to maturityWithout energy a man cannot even achieve success in worldly works directed to visible ends But there is nothing the energetic indefatigable man cannot achieveOne lacking energy cannot undertake to rescue all beings from the great flood of saṃsāraBut one bristling with energy can achieve perfection in all he undertakes The perfection of energy should be reflected upon thus The noble qualities of energy should be further reviewed as follows One intent on rescuing himself alone from the mire of saṃsāra cannot fulfil his ideal if he relaxes his energy how much less one who aspires to rescue the entire world And Through the power of energy such wrong thoughts as the following are kept away It is quite right for you to escape from the suffering of saṃsāra by yourself alone for so long as you are a foolish worldling the host of defilements is as difficult to restrain as a herd of mad elephants the kamma caused by them is like a murderer with drawn sword the evil destinations based on these actions stand constantly before you with open doors and evil friends are always around to enjoin you in those actions and admonish you to practice them  And If even full enlightenment can be achieved by ones own energy what can be difficultThe perfection of patience should be considered next Patience is the unimpeded weapon of the good in the development of noble qualities for it dispels anger the opposite of all such qualities without residue It is the adornment of those capable of vanquishing the foe the strength of recluses and brahmins a stream of water extinguishing the fire of anger the basis for acquiring a good reputation a mantra for quelling the poisonous speech of evil people the supreme source of constancy in those established in restraint Patience is an ocean on account of its depth a shore bounding the great ocean of hatred a panel closing off the door to the plane of misery a staircase ascending to the worlds of the gods and Brahmās the ground for the habitation of all noble qualities the supreme purification of body speech and mindPatience should be further strengthened by reflecting Those who lack patience are afflicted in this world and apply themselves to actions that will lead to their affliction in the life to come And Although this suffering arises through the wrong deeds of others this body of mine is the field for that suffering and the action which is its seed was sown by me alone And This suffering will release me from the debt of that kamma And If there were no wrongdoers how could I accomplish the perfection of patience And Although he is a wrongdoer now in the past he was my benefactor And A wrongdoer is also a benefactor for he is the basis for the developing of patience And All beings are like my own children Who becomes angry over the misdeeds of his own children And He wrongs me because of some residue of anger in myself I should remove this residue And I am just as much the cause as he is for the wrong on account of which this suffering has arisen And All those dhammas by which wrong was done and those to whom it was doneall those at this very moment have ceased With whom then should you now be angry and by whom should anger be aroused When all dhammas are nonself who can do wrong to whomIf due to its cumulative force anger caused by the wrongs of others should continue to overpower the mind one should reflect Patience is the contributive cause for rendering help to others in return for their wrongs And This wrong by causing me suffering is a condition for faith since suffering is said to be the decisive support for faith and it is also a condition for the perception of discontent with all the world  And This is the nature of the sense facultiesto encounter desirable and undesirable objectsHow then is it possible not to encounter undesirable objects And Under the control of anger a person becomes mad and distraught so why retaliate And All these beings are watched over by the Buddha as if they were his own dear children Therefore I should not be angry with them And When the wrongdoer is endowed with noble qualities I should not be angry with him And when he does not have any noble qualities then I should regard him with compassion And Because of anger my fame and noble qualities diminish and to the pleasure of my enemies I become ugly sleep in discomfort etc And Anger is the only real enemy for it is the agent of all harm and the destroyer of all good And When one has patience one has no enemies And Because of his wrong the wrongdoer will meet suffering in the future but so long as I remain patient I will not And Enemies are the consequence of my angry thought When I vanquish anger by patience my foe who is the byproduct of my anger will also be vanquished And I should not relinquish the noble quality of patience because of a little anger Anger is the antithesis and obstruction to all noble qualities so if I become angry how can my virtue etc reach fulfilment And when those qualities are absent how can I devote myself to helping other beings and attain the ultimate goal in accordance with my vows And When there is patience the mind becomes concentrated free from external distraction With the mind concentrated all formations appear to reflection as impermanent and suffering all dhammas as nonself nibbāna as unconditioned deathless peaceful and sublime and the Buddhaqualities as endowed with inconceivable and immeasurable potencyThen established in acquiescence in conformity the groundlessness of all Imaking and minemaking becomes evident to reflection thus Mere dhammas alone exist devoid of a self or of anything pertaining to a self They arise and pass away in accordance with their conditions They do not come from anywhere they do not go anywhere they are not established anywhere There is no agency in anything whatsoever In this way a bodhisattva becomes fixed in his destiny bound for enlightenment irreversible This is the method of reflecting upon the perfection of patienceThe perfection of truthfulness should be reviewed thus Without truthfulness virtue etc is impossible and there can be no practice in accordance with ones vows All evil states converge upon the transgression of truth One who is not devoted to truth is unreliable and his word cannot be accepted in the future On the other hand one devoted to truth secures the foundation of all noble qualities With truthfulness as the foundation he is capable of purifying and fulfilling all the requisites of enlightenment Not deceived about the true nature of dhammas he performs the functions of all the requisites of enlightenment and completes the practice of the bodhisattva pathThe perfection of determination should be reviewed thus Without firmly undertaking the practice of giving  maintaining an unshakable determination in the encounter with their opposites and practicing them with constancy and vigor the bases of enlightenmentie the requisites such as giving etcdo not ariseThe noble qualities of loving kindness should be reflected upon as follows One resolved only upon his own welfare cannot achieve success in this world or a happy rebirth in the life to come without some concern for the welfare of others how then can one wishing to establish all beings in the attainment of nibbāna succeed without loving kindness And if you wish to ultimately lead all beings to the supramundane achievement of nibbāna you should begin by wishing for their mundane success here and now And I cannot provide for the welfare and happiness of others merely by wishing for it Let me put forth effort to accomplish it And Now I support them by promoting their welfare and happiness afterwards they will be my companions in sharing the Dhamma And Without these beings I could not acquire the requisites of enlightenment Since they are the cause for the manifestation and perfecting of all the Buddhaqualities these beings are for me a supreme field of merit the incomparable basis for planting wholesome roots the ultimate object of reverence Thus one should arouse an especially strong inclination towards promoting the welfare of all beings And why should loving kindness be developed towards all beings Because it is the foundation for compassionFor when one delights in providing for the welfare and happiness of other beings with an unbounded heart the desire to remove their affliction and suffering becomes powerful and firmly rootedAnd compassion is the first of all the dhammas culminating in Buddhahoodtheir footing foundation root head and chiefThe perfection of equanimity should be considered thus When there is no equanimity the offensive actions performed by beings cause oscillation in the mind And when the mind oscillates it is impossible to practice the requisites of enlightenment And Even though the mind has been softened with the moisture of loving kindness without equanimity one cannot purify the requisites of enlightenment and cannot dedicate ones requisites of merit along with their results to furthering the welfare of beings Moreover the undertaking determination fulfilment and completion of all the requisites of enlightenment succeed through the power of equanimity For without equanimity the aspirant cannot relinquish something without making false discriminations over gifts and recipients Without equanimity he cannot purify his virtue without always thinking about the obstacles to his life and to his vital needs Equanimity perfects the power of renunciation for by its means he overcomes discontent and delight It perfects the functions of all the requisites to examine them according to their origin When energy is aroused to excess because it hasnt been examined with equanimity it cannot perform its proper function of striving Forbearance and reflective acquiescence are possible only in one possessed of equanimity Because of this quality he does not speak deceptively about beings or formations By looking upon the vicissitudes of worldly events with an equal mind his determination to fulfil the practices he has undertaken becomes completely unshakable And because he is unconcerned over the wrongs done by others he perfects the abiding in loving kindness Thus equanimity is indispensable to the practice of all the other pāramīs Such is the reflection on the perfection of equanimityThus reviewing the danger in their opposites and the benefits in their practice is a condition for the pāramīsAnother condition for the pāramīs consists in the fifteen dhammas comprising right conduct and the five mundane kinds of direct knowledge together with their requisitesThe thirteen ascetic practices and the qualities such as fewness of wishes are the requisites for the four states beginning with restraint by virtueAmong the seven good dhammas the requisites for faith are the seven recollectionsof the Buddha the Dhamma and the Saṅgha of virtue generosity the deities and peace the avoidance of mean people and association with affectionate people reflection upon things inspiring confidence and the disposition towards faithThe requisites for shame and moral dread are reflection upon the danger in immoral conduct reflection upon the danger in the plane of misery reflection on the fortifying character of wholesome states the avoidance of people devoid of shame and moral dread and association with people endowed with these qualities and the disposition towards shame and moral dreadThe requisites for learning are previous effort interrogation application to the true Dhamma the study of blameless branches of knowledge maturity of the faculties remoteness from the defilements the avoidance of ignorant people and association with learned people and the disposition towards eruditionThe requisites for energy are reflection upon the fearfulness in the plane of misery reflection upon the course to be followed reflection upon the greatness of the Dhamma the dispelling of sloth and torpor the avoidance of lazy people and association with energetic people reflection upon right endeavor and the disposition towards energyThe requisites for mindfulness are mindfulness and clear comprehension the avoidance of people with confused mindfulness and association with people with established mindfulness and the disposition towards mindfulnessAnd the requisites for wisdom are interrogation the cleansing of the bases  the harmonization of the faculties the avoidance of dullwitted people and association with wise people reflection upon the profound course of knowledge and the inclination towards wisdomThe requisites for the four jhānas are the four factors beginning with restraint by virtue the development of meditation in the preliminary portion with a certain object among the thirtyeight objects of meditation and the five achievements of masteryBut we do not adduce it at length for fear of getting caught up in excessive detailsSo too the wheels of achievement etc are also conditions for the pāramīsThis is the aspiration supported by the eight qualifications  which occurs thus Crossed I would cross freed I would free tamed I would tame calmed I would calm comforted I would comfort attained to nibbāna I would lead to nibbāna purified I would purify enlightened I would enlightenThe human state the human state the male sex the cause the sight of the Masterthe going forth the achievement of noble qualities extreme dedication and strong desire The eight qualifications through which the aspiration succeeds are Because these other states do not correspond with the state of a Buddha WhyIf he were to hear He alone can attain Buddhahood who can tread across a whole world system that has become a solid mass of sharp pointed swordstakes cross over and reach the other side etcIf he were to hear He alone can attain Buddhahood who can cut through a whole world system that has become a jungle of thorny creepers covered by a solid thicket of bamboo cross over and reach the other side etcfor in the presence of former Buddhas he has made the resolution for full enlightenment declaring mentally or verbally I too would become a perfectly enlightened Buddha and promote the welfare and happiness of all beingsfor the welfare and happiness of the many out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of gods and men but not so the othersHe is dear revered and esteemed A teacher patient in speechThe internal power is the longing or undeviating inclination for the supreme enlightenment which is grounded upon personal ideals and in reverence for the Dhamma through this power the Great Man dominated by his personal ideals and upheld by a sense of shame forms the aspiration fulfills the pāramīs and attains the supreme enlightenmentyet his mind does not become defiled by worldly affection for childrenAnother set of conditions is the six inclinationsthe inclinations towards renunciation solitude nongreed nonhatred nondelusion and escapeSo too for bodhisattvas striving for enlightenment the inclination towards each of the ten pāramīs is a condition for the practice of eachsince giving to those who ask wins their affectionand the virtuous man is not subject to the remorse which arises in the immoral man when he thinks I have committed evil wicked sinful deedsBecause it enables one to achieve supreme sovereignty over ones own mind virtue surpasses the sovereignty of khattiyas etcFor when their wisdomeyes open up the great bodhisattvas give even their own limbs and organs without extolling themselves and disparaging others Like medicinetrees they give devoid of discrimination filled with joy throughout the three timesbut giving for ones own benefit is like an investmentThrough the power of wisdom again they are devoted to the investigation of the aggregates sense bases etc fully comprehend the processes of origination and cessation in accordance with actuality develop the qualities of giving etc to the stages of distinction and penetration and perfect the training of bodhisattvas Thus the perfection of wisdom should be reinforced by determining the noble qualities of wisdom with their numerous modes and constituentseven if his energy is only moderate he will give up in the middleHerein the dhammas comprising right conduct are restraint by virtue guarding the doors of the sense faculties moderation in eating application to wakefulness the seven good dhammas and the four jhānasThe way the factors of right conduct etc serve as conditions for the requisites of enlightenment  can be adduced as follows He is capable of offering the gift of fearlessness to beings through the purification of his means by virtue etc of offering material gifts through the purification of his end  and of offering the gift of the Dhamma through the purification of both and so on as is appropriate in each caseWhat is their defilement In general being misapprehended by craving etc is the defilement of all the pāramīsTaken separately discriminating thoughts over gifts and recipients are the defilement of the perfection of giving Discriminating thoughts over beings and times are the defilement of the perfection of virtue Discriminating thoughts of delight in sense pleasures and existence and of discontent with their pacification are the defilement of the perfection of renunciation Discriminating thoughts of I and mine are the defilement of the perfection of wisdom discriminating thoughts leaning to listlessness and restlessness of the perfection of energy discriminating thoughts of oneself and others of the perfection of patience discriminating thoughts of avowing to have seen what was not seen etc of the perfection of truthfulness discriminating thoughts perceiving flaws in the requisites of enlightenment and virtues in their opposites of the perfection of determination discriminating thoughts confusing what is harmful with what is beneficial of the perfection of loving kindness and discriminating thoughts over the desirable and undesirable of the perfection of equanimity Thus the defilements should be understoodWhat is their cleansing Their cleansing is the removal of the taints of craving etc and the absence of the aforementioned discriminationsFor the pāramīs become pure and luminous when untainted by such defilements as craving conceit views anger malice denigration domineering envy stinginess craftiness hypocrisy obstinacy presumption vanity and negligence and when devoid of the discriminating thoughts over gifts and recipients etcFurther giving is opposed to greed hatred and delusion since it applies the qualities of nongreed non hatred and nondelusion to gifts recipients and the fruits of giving respectively Virtue is opposed to greed hatred and delusion since it removes crookedness and corruption in bodily conduct etc Renunciation is opposed to these three corruptions since it avoids indulgence in sense pleasures the affliction of others and self mortification Wisdom opposes them in so far as greed etc create blindness while knowledge restores sight Energy opposes them by arousing the true way free from both listlessness and restlessness Patience opposes them by accepting the desirable the undesirable and emptiness Truthfulness is their opposite because it proceeds in accordance with fact whether others render help or inflict harm Determination is the opposite of these three defilements since after vanquishing the vicissitudes of the world it remains unshakable in fulfilling the requisites of enlightenment in the way they have been undertaken Loving kindness is the opposite of greed hatred and delusion through its seclusion from the hindrances And equanimity is their opposite by dispelling attraction and repulsion towards desirable and undesirable objects respectively and by proceeding evenly under varying circumstances What are their opposites In general all the defilements and all unwholesome dhammas are their opposites Taken separately stinginess is the opposite of giving and so on as mentioned earlier How are they to be practicedThe perfection of giving firstly is to be practiced by benefitting beings in many waysby relinquishing ones happiness belongings body and life to others by dispelling their fear and by instructing them in the DhammaHerein giving is threefold by way of the object to be given the giving of material things  the giving of fearlessness  and the giving of the Dhamma Among these the object to be given can be twofold internal and externalThe external gift is tenfold food drink garments vehicles garlands scents unguents bedding dwellings and lampsThese gifts again become manifold by analyzing each into its constituents eg food into hard food soft food etcThe sense objects such as visible forms become manifold when analyzed into blue etcHe gives generously not ungenerously He gives sufficiently not insufficiently when there is something to be givenAnd when there is not enough to give sufficiently to all he distributes evenly whatever can be sharedBut he does not give things that bring affliction to others such as weapons poisons and intoxicants Nor does he give amusements that are harmful and lead to negligenceAnd he does not give unsuitable food or drink to a person who is sick even though he might ask for it and he does not give what is suitable beyond the proper measureAgain when asked he gives to householders things appropriate for householders and to monks things appropriate for monks He gives to his mother and father kinsmen and relatives friends and colleagues children wife slaves and workers without causing pain to anyone Having promised an excellent gift he does not give something mean He does not give because he desires gain honor or fame or because he expects something in return or out of expectation of some fruit other than the supreme enlightenment He does not give detesting the gift or those who ask He does not give a discarded object as a gift not even to unrestrained beggars who revile and abuse him Invariably he gives with care with a serene mind full of compassion He does not give through belief in superstitious omens but he gives believing in kamma and its fruit When he gives he does not afflict those who ask by making them do homage to him etc but he gives without afflicting others He does not give a gift with the intention of deceiving others or with the intention of injuring he gives only with an undefiled mind He does not give a gift with harsh words or a frown but with words of endearment congenial speech and a smile on his face Whenever greed for a particular object becomes excessive due to its high value and beauty its antiquity or personal attachment the bodhisattva recognizes his greed quickly dispels it seeks out some recipients and gives it away And if there should be an object of limited value that can be given and a suppliant expecting it without a second thought he bestirs himself and gives it to him honoring him as though he were an uncelebrated sageAsked for his own children wife slaves workers and servants the Great Man does not give them while they are as yet unwilling to go afflicted with grief But when they are willing and joyful then he gives themBut if he knows that those who ask for them are demonic beingsogres demons or goblinsor men of cruel disposition then he does not give them away So too he will not give his kingdomto those intent on the harm suffering and affliction of the world but he would give it away to righteous men who protect the world with DhammaThis firstly is the way to practice the giving of external giftsThe internal gift should be understood in two waysHowJust as a man for the sake of food and clothing surrenders himself to another and enters into servitude and slavery in the same way the Great Man wishing for the supreme welfare and happiness of all beings desiring to fulfil his own perfection of giving with a spiritually oriented mind for the sake of enlightenment surrenders himself to another and enters into servitude placing himself at the disposal of othersWhatever limbs or organs of his might be needed by others hands feet eyes etche gives them away to those who need them without trembling and without cowering He is no more attached to them and no more shrinks away than if they were external objects Thus the Great Man relinquishes an internal object in two ways for the enjoyment of others according to their pleasure or while fulfilling the wishes of those who ask for his own selfmastery In this matter he is completely generous and thinks I will attain enlightenment through nonattachmentThus the giving of the internal gift should be understoodHerein giving an internal gift he gives only what leads to the welfare of the recipient and nothing elseThe Great Man does not knowingly give his own body limbs and organs to Māra or to the malevolent deities in Māras company thinking Let this not lead to their harmAnd likewise he does not give to those possessed by Māra or his deities or to madmenBut when asked for these things by others he gives immediately because of the rarity of such a request and the difficulty of making such a giftThe giving of fearlessness is the giving of protection to beings when they have become frightened on account of kings thieves fire water enemies lions tigers other wild beasts dragons ogres demons goblins etcThis is the method In brief he gives a talk on giving on virtue and on heaven on the unsatisfactoriness and defilement in sense pleasures and on the benefit in renouncing themIn detail to those whose minds are disposed towards the enlightenment of disciples he gives a discourse establishing and purifying them by elaborating upon the noble qualities of whichever among the following topics is appropriate going for refuge restraint by virtue guarding the doors of the sense faculties moderation in eating application to wakefulness the seven good dhammas application to serenity by practicing meditation on one of the thirtyeight objects  application to insight by contemplating the objects of insight interpretation such as the material body the progressive stages of purification the apprehension of the course of rightness the three kinds of clear knowledge the six direct knowledges the four discriminations and the enlightenment of a discipleThus the Great Man gives the gift of the Dhamma to beingsWhen he gives a material gift the Great Man gives food thinking May I by this gift enable beings to achieve long life beauty happiness strength intelligence and the supreme fruit of unsullied bliss He gives drink wishing to allay the thirst of sensual defilements garments to gain the adornments of shame and moral dread and the golden complexion  vehicles for attaining the modes of psychic potency and the bliss of nibbāna scents for producing the sweet scent of virtue garlands and unguents for producing the beauty of the Buddhaqualities seats for producing the seat on the terrace of enlightenment bedding for producing the bed of a Tathāgatas rest dwellings so he might become a refuge for beings lamps so he might obtain the five eyes He gives visible forms for producing the fathomwide aura  sounds for producing the Brahmālike voice  tastes for endearing himself to all the world and tangibles for acquiring a Buddhas elegance He gives medicines so he might later give the ageless and deathless state of nibbāna He gives slaves the gift of freedom so he might later emancipate beings from the slavery of the defilements He gives blameless amusements and enjoyments in order to produce delight in the true Dhamma He gives his own children as a gift in order that he might adopt all beings as his children by granting them an ariyan birth He gives his wife as a gift in order that he might become master over the entire world He gives gifts of gold gems pearls coral etc in order to achieve the major marks of physical beauty  and gifts of the diverse means of beautification in order to achieve the minor features of physical beauty He gives his treasuries as a gift in order to obtain the treasury of the true Dhamma the gift of his kingdom in order to become the king of the Dhamma the gift of monasteries parks ponds and groves in order to achieve the jhānas etc the gift of his feet in order that he might approach the terrace of enlightenment with feet marked with the auspicious wheels the gift of his hands in order that he might give to beings the rescuing hand of the true Dhamma to help them across the four floods the gift of his ears nose etc in order to obtain the spiritual faculties of faith etc the gift of his eyes in order to obtain the universal eye the gift of his flesh and blood with the thought May my body be the means of life for all the world May it bring welfare and happiness to all beings at all times even on occasions of merely seeing hearing recollecting or ministering to me  And he gives the gift of his head in order to become supreme in all the worldGiving thus the Great Man does not give unwillingly nor by afflicting others nor out of fear moral shame or the scolding of those in need of gifts When there is something excellent he does not give what is mean He does not give extolling himself and disparaging others He does not give out of desire for the fruit nor with loathing for those who ask nor with lack of consideration Rather he gives thoroughly with his own hand at the proper time considerately without discriminationfilled with joy throughout the three times Having given he does not become remorseful afterwardsThe external gift can also become sixfold when analyzed by way of sense object  visible forms sounds smells tastes tangibles and nonsensory objectsSo too the external gift is manifold by way of the divers valuables and belongings such as gems gold silver pearls coral etc fields lands parks etc slaves cows buffaloes etcWhen the Great Man gives an external object he gives whatever is needed to whomever stands in need of it and knowing by himself that someone is in need of something he gives it even unasked much more when askedHe does not give because he expects something in returnThe giving of the Dhamma is an undistorted discourse on the Dhamma given with an undefiled mind that is methodical instruction conducive to good in the present life to good in the life to come and to the ultimate good By means of such discourses those who have not entered the Buddhas Dispensation enter it while those who have entered it reach maturity thereinSo too for beings whose minds are disposed towards the enlightenment of paccekabuddhas and of perfectly enlightened Buddhas he gives a discourse establishing and purifying them in the two vehicles by elaborating upon the greatness of the spiritual power of those Buddhas and by explaining the specific nature characteristic function etc of the ten pāramīs in their three stagesHe does not become either conceited or obsequious in relation to the recipients but behaves amiably towards them Bountiful and liberal he gives things together with a bonusFor when he gives food thinking I will give this along with a bonus he gives garments etc as wellAnd when he gives garments thinking I will give this along with a bonus he gives food etc as wellAnd when he gives a gift of one of the sense objects such as visible forms he gives the other sense objects also as a bonusThe gift of visible forms should be understood thus Having gained something such as a flower garment or relic of a blue yellow red or white color etc considering it in terms of its visible form thinking to make a gift of a visible form he offers it to a worthy recipient together with its baseThe gift of sounds should be understood by way of the sounds of drums etcIt is certainly not possible to give a sound as one gives a cluster of lotuses tearing it out by its bulb and roots and placing it in the hands But one gives a gift of sound by giving its baseThus he makes a gift of sound by presenting a musical instrument such as drums or tom toms to the Triple GemThe gift of scents is made when after getting a delightfully scented object such as scented roots powdered scent etc considering it in terms of its scent thinking to make a gift of scent he offers it to the Triple Gem He relinquishes a scented object such as agaru or sandalwood for the purpose of making an offering of scentThe gift of tastes is made when after getting a delightfully flavored object such as flavored roots etc considering it in terms of its taste thinking to make a gift of taste he gives it to worthy recipients Or he relinquishes a flavorful object such as grain cows etcThe gift of tangibles should be understood by way of beds chairs etc and by way of coverlets and mantels etcThe gift of mental objects  should be understood by way of nutriment drink and life since it is the mentalobject base that is intended hereHaving gained a delightful object such as nutriment considering it as part of the mentalobject base thinking to make a gift of a nonsensory object he gives nutrimentie ghee butter etcThis entire accomplishment in giving he dedicates to the welfare and happiness of the whole world and to his own unshakable emancipation through supreme enlightenmentHe dedicates it to the attainment of inexhaustible desire  inexhaustible concentration ingenuity knowledge and emancipationIn practicing the perfection of giving the Great Being should apply the perception of impermanence to life and possessions He should consider them as shared in common with many and should constantly and continuously arouse great compassion towards beingsJust as when a house is blazing the owner removes all his property of essential value and himself as well without leaving anything important behind so does the Great Man invariably give without discrimination and without concernThis is the method of practicing the perfection of givingNow comes the method of practicing the perfection of virtue Since the Great Man desires to adorn beings with the adornment of the virtue of the omniscient at the beginning he must first purify his own virtueHerein virtue is purified in four modes by the purification of ones inclinations  by the undertaking of precepts  by nontransgression  and by making amends for transgressions For someone who is dominated by personal ideals is naturally disgusted with evil through the purity of his own inclinations and purifies his conduct by arousing his inward sense of shameSomeone else who is dominated by a consideration for the world afraid of evil purifies his conduct by receiving precepts from another person and by arousing his sense of moral dreadBoth establish themselves in virtue through non transgressionBut if due to forgetfulness they sometimes break a preceptVirtue is twofold as avoidance and performance Herein this is the method by which virtue as avoidance should be practiced A bodhisattva should have such a heart of sympathy for all beings that he does not feel any resentment towards anyone even in a dreamBecause he is dedicated to helping others he would no more misappropriate the belongings of others than he would take hold of a poisonous watersnakeIf he is a monk he should live remote from unchastity abstaining from the seven bonds of sexuality not to speak of adulteryWhen he speaks his statements should be truthful beneficial and endearing and his talk measured timely and concerned with the Dhamma His mind should always be devoid of covetousness ill will and inverted views He should possess the knowledge of the ownership of kamma and have settled faith and affection for recluses and brahmins who are faring and practicing rightlyBecause he abstains from unwholesome states and from the unwholesome courses of kamma leading to the four planes of misery and the suffering of the round and because he is established in the wholesome courses of kamma leading to heaven and liberation through the purity of his end and the purity of his means the Great Mans wishes for the welfare and happiness of beings succeed immediately exactly in the way they are formedSince he desists from injuring others he gives the gift of fearlessness to all beings He perfects the meditation on loving kindness without trouble and enjoys the eleven benefits of loving kindness  He is healthy and robust attains longevity abundant happiness and distinguished characteristics and eradicates the mental impression of hatredSo too because he desists from taking what is not given his possessions cannot be confiscated by thieves etcBy desisting from unchastity he becomes unexcitable peaceful in body and mind dear and agreeable unsuspicious to beings A good report circulates concerning him He is without lust or attachment to women is devoted to renunciation achieves distinguished characteristics and eradicates the mental impression of greedBy desisting from false speech his word comes to be authoritative for others He is regarded as reliable and trustworthy one whose statements are always accepted He is dear and agreeable to deities His mouth gives off a sweet fragrance and his bodily and vocal conduct are protected He achieves distinguished characteristics and eradicates the mental impressions of the defilementsBy desisting from slander he obtains a retinue and following that cannot be divided by the attacks of others He possesses unbreakable faith in the true Dhamma He is a firm friend as exceedingly dear to beings as though they were acquainted with him in the last existence And he is devoted to nondefilementBy desisting from harsh speech he becomes dear and agreeable to beings pleasant in character sweet in speech held in esteem And he develops a voice endowed with eight factorsBy desisting from idle chatter he becomes dear and agreeable to beings revered held in esteem His statements are accepted and his talk is measuredHe acquires great influence and power and becomes skillful in answering the questions of others with the ingenuity that creates opportunities  And when he reaches the plane of Buddhahood he becomes capable of answering the numerous questions of beings speaking numerous languages all with a single replyThrough his freedom from covetousness he gains what he wishes and obtains whatever excellent possessions he needs He is honored by powerful khattiyas He can never be vanquished by his adversaries is never defective in his faculties and becomes the peerless individualThrough his freedom from ill will he gains a pleasant appearance He is esteemed by others and because he delights in the welfare of beings he automatically inspires their confidence He becomes lofty in character abides in loving kindness and acquires great influence and powerThrough his freedom from wrong view he gains good companions Even if he is threatened with the guillotine he will not perform an evil deed Because he holds to the ownership of kamma he does not believe in superstitious omens His faith in the true Dhamma is established and firmly rooted He has faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgatas and no more delights in the diversity of outside creeds than a royal swan delights in a dung heap He is skillful in fully understanding the three characteristics  and in the end gains the unobstructed knowledge of omniscience Until he attains final enlightenment he becomes the foremost in whatever order of beings  and acquires the most excellent achievementsThus esteeming virtue as the foundation for all achievementsas the soil for the origination of all the Buddhaqualities the beginning footing head and chief of all the dhammas culminating in Buddhahoodand recognizing gain honor and fame as a foe in the guise of a friend a bodhisattva should diligently and thoroughly perfect his virtue as a hen guards its eggs through the power of mindfulness and clear comprehension in the control of bodily and vocal action in the taming of the sense faculties in purification of livelihood and in the use of the requisitesThis firstly is the method of practicing virtue as avoidanceThe practice of virtue as performance should be understood as follows Herein at the appropriate time a bodhisattva practices paying homage rising up making reverential salutations and courteous conduct towards good friends worthy of reverence At the appropriate time he renders them service and he waits upon them when they are sickWhen he receives wellspoken advice he expresses his appreciation He praises the noble qualities of the virtuous and patiently endures the abuse of antagonists He remembers help rendered to him by others rejoices in their merits dedicates his own merits to the supreme enlightenment and always abides diligently in the practice of wholesome dhammas When he commits a transgression he acknowledges it as such and confesses it to his coreligionists Afterwards he perfectly fulfils the right practiceHe is adroit and nimble in fulfilling his duties towards beings when these are conducive to their good He serves as their companionWhen beings are afflicted with the suffering of disease etc he prepares the appropriate remedyHe dispels the sorrow of those afflicted by the loss of wealth etc Of a helpful disposition he restrains with Dhamma those who need to be restrained rehabilitates them from unwholesome ways and establishes them in wholesome courses of conductHe inspires with Dhamma those in need of inspirationAnd when he hears about the loftiest most difficult inconceivably powerful deeds of the great bodhisattvas of the past resulting in the ultimate welfare and happiness of beings by means of which they reached perfect maturity in the requisites of enlightenment he does not become agitated and alarmed but reflects Those Great Beings were only human But by developing themselves through the orderly fulfilment of the training they attained the loftiest spiritual power and the highest perfection in the requisites of enlightenment I too should practice the same training in virtue etc In that way I too will gradually fulfil the training and in the end attain the same stateThen with unflagging energy preceded by this faith he perfectly fulfils the training in virtue etc Again he conceals his virtues and reveals his faults He is few in his wishes content fond of solitude aloof capable of enduring suffering and free from anxiety He is not restless puffed up fickle scurrilous or scattered in speech but calm in his faculties and mind Avoiding such wrong means of livelihood as scheming etc he is endowed with proper conduct and a suitable resort  He sees danger in the slightest faults and having undertaken the rules of training trains himself in them energetic and resolute without regard for body or life He does not tolerate even the slightest concern for his body or life but abandons and dispels it how much more then excessive concernHe abandons and dispels all the corruptions such as anger malice etc which are the cause for moral depravityHe does not become complacent over some minor achievement of distinction and does not shrink away but strives for successively higher achievementsIn this way the achievements he gains do not partake of diminution or stagnation The Great Man serves as a guide for the blind explaining to them the right path To the deaf he gives signals with gestures of his hands and in that way benefits them with good So too for the dumbTo cripples he gives a chair or a vehicle or some other means of conveyanceHe strives that the faithless may gain faith that the lazy may generate zeal that those of confused mindfulness may develop mindfulness that those with wandering minds may become accomplished in concentration and that the dullwitted may acquire wisdomHe strives to dispel sensual desireOut of gratitude to those who have helped him he benefits and honors them with a similar or greater benefit in return congenial in speech and endearing in his wordsHe is a companion in misfortuneUnderstanding the nature and character of beings he associates with whatever beings need his presence in whatever way they need itBut he proceeds only by rehabilitating them from the unwholesome and establishing them in the wholesome not in other waysFor in order to protect the minds of others bodhisattvas behave only in ways which increase the wholesomeHe does not criticize those who are dear to others in front of them nor praise those who are resented by themHe is not intimate with those who are not trustworthyHe does not refuse a proper invitationHe encourages those endowed with faith with a discourse on the benefits of faithIf the bodhisattva has attained to the direct knowledges he may inspire a sense of spiritual urgency in the negligent by showing them the fate of those in hell etc as is fit Thereby he establishes the faithless in faith and brings to maturity those already endowed with these qualitiesIn this way through his virtuous conduct the Great Mans immeasurable flood of merit and goodness ascends to ever increasing heightsThe detailed explanation of virtue is given in diverse ways in the Visuddhimagga in the passage beginning Virtue is the states beginning with volition present in one who abstains from the destruction of life etc or in one who fulfills the practice of the duties  All that should be brought in hereThe same method with gifts of vehicles etcor by giving medicine for the voice such as oil and molasses to preachers of the Dhamma or by announcing a lecture on the Dhamma chanting the scriptures giving a discourse on the Dhamma holding a discussion or expressing appreciation for the good deeds of othersFor having gained some soft delightful blameless tangible object such as a bed chair cushion pillow undergarment or upper garment considering it in terms of its tangible qualities thinking to make a gift of a tangible item he gives it to worthy recipientshaving gained the aforesaid tangible objects he relinquishes themor a drinkie the eight kinds of drink such as mango juice etc or considering it a gift of life he gives a ticketmeal or a fortnightly meal etc gets doctors to wait upon the sick and afflicted liberates animals from a net has a fishing net or birdcage destroyed releases prisoners from prison causes an injunction to be given forbidding the slaughter of animals or undertakes any action of a similar nature for the sake of protecting the life of beingsthrough their sense of shame and moral dread respectively they quickly make amends for it through the proper means of rehabilitationIf he is a householder he should never arouse even an evil thought of lust for the wives of othersand his pāramīs reach fulfilment for such is his natureHe is unsuspicious to others dear and agreeable trustworthy unattached to prosperity and success inclined to relinquishing and he eradicates the mental impression of greedill will slothandtorpor restlessnessandworry and perplexity in those obsessed by these hindrancesand to dispel wrong thoughts of sensuality ill will and aggression in those subjugated by these thoughtsand he practices together with whatever beings need to practice with him in whatever way of practice is necessary for themSo too because his inclination is to benefit others he should never harm them abuse them humiliate them arouse remorse in them or incite them to act in ways that should be avoided Nor should he place himself in a higher position than those of inferior conduct He should be neither altogether inaccessible to others nor too accessible and he should not associate with others at the wrong timeHe associates with beings whom it is proper to associate with at the appropriate time and placeor engage in persuasion or accept excessivelyand he encourages as well those endowed with virtue learning generosity and wisdom with a discourse on the benefits of those qualitiesHe makes them enter the Buddhas DispensationOnly there is this distinction in that work the discussion of virtue has come down for beings who seek the enlightenment of disciples  but here because the discussion is intended for great bodhisattvas  it should be explained making compassion and skillful means the forerunnersJust as the Great Man does not dedicate the merits from his practice of virtue to his own release from affliction in the unfortunate destinations or to his own achievement of kingship in the fortunate destinations or to becoming a worldruling monarch a god Sakka Māra or Brahmā so too he does not dedicate it to his own attainment of the threefold knowledge the six direct knowledges the four discriminations the enlightenment of a disciple or the enlightenment of a paccekabuddhas But rather he dedicates it only for the purpose of becoming an omniscient Buddha in order to enable all beings to acquire the incomparable adornment of virtueThis is the method of practicing the perfection of virtueThe perfection of renunciation is the wholesome act of consciousness that occurs renouncing sense pleasures and existence preceded by the perception of their inherent unsatisfactoriness and accompanied by compassion and skillful means The bodhisattva should practice the perfection of renunciation by first recognizing the unsatisfactoriness in sense pleasures etc according to the following method For one dwelling in a home there is no opportunity to enjoy the happiness of renunciation etc because the home life is the dwelling place of all the defilements because a wife and children impose restrictions  and because the diverse crafts and occupations such as agriculture and trade lead to numerous entanglements And sense pleasures like a drop of honey smeared over the blade of a sword give limited satisfaction and entail abundant harm They are fleeting like a show perceived in a flash of lightning enjoyable only through an inversion of perception like the adornments of a madman a means of vengeance like a camouflaged pit of excrement unsatisfying like a thin drink or water moistening the fingers afflictive like food inwardly rotten a cause for calamity like a baited hook the cause of suffering in the three times like a burning fire a basis for bondage like monkeys glue a camouflage for destruction like a murderers cloak a place of danger like a dwelling in an enemy village food for the Māra of the defilements like the supporter of ones foes subject to suffering through change like the enjoyment of a festival inwardly burning like the fire in the hollow of a tree fraught with danger like a ball of honey suspended from bīrana grass in an old pit intensifying thirst like a drink of salt water resorted to by the vulgar like liquor and wine and giving little satisfaction like a chain of bones Having recognized the unsatisfactoriness in sense pleasures in accordance with this method he should then by the reverse method contemplate the benefits in renunciation with a mind slanting sloping and inclining towards the happiness of renunciation solitude and peaceSince renunciation is rooted in the going forth  the going forth should be undertakenIf the Great Being is living at a time when no Buddha has arisen in the world he should go forth under ascetics or wanderers who maintain the doctrine of kamma and the moral efficacy of actionBut when the perfectly enlightened Buddhas appear in the world he should go forth only in their DispensationHaving gone forth he should establish himself in virtue as described above and in order to cleanse his virtue should undertake the ascetic practicesFor Great Men who undertake the ascetic practices and maintain them properly become content and few in their wishes The stains of their defilements are washed off in the waters of such noble qualities as effacement solitude aloofness from society the arousal of energy and ease of maintenance and all their conduct becomes purified through their blameless rules observances and noble qualities Established in three of the ancient traditions of the ariyans they are able to achieve the fourth of the ariyan traditions ie delight in meditation entering and abiding in jhāna both access and absorption through whichever among the forty subjects of meditation are appropriateThus they completely fulfil the perfection of renunciationAt this point it would be proper to explain in detail the thirteen ascetic practices and the forty meditation subjects for the development of concentration ie the ten kasiṇadevices the ten impurities the ten recollections the four divine abodes the four immaterial states the one perception and the one analysisBut since all these are explained in complete detail in the Visuddhimagga it should be understood in the way stated thereOnly there is this distinction in that work the subject is explained for beings who seek the enlightenment of disciples But here because it is intended for great bodhisattvas it should be explained making compassion and skillful means the forerunnersThis is the method of practicing the perfection of renunciationJust as light cannot coexist with darkness wisdom cannot coexist with delusion Therefore a bodhisattva wishing to accomplish the perfection of wisdom should avoid the causes of delusionThese are the causes of delusion discontent languor drowsiness lethargy delight in company attachment to sleep irresoluteness lack of enthusiasm for knowledge false overestimation of oneself non interrogation not maintaining ones body properly lack of mental concentration association with dullwitted people not ministering to those possessed of wisdom selfcontempt false discrimination adherence to inverted views athleticism lack of a sense of spiritual urgency and the five hindrancesAvoiding these causes of confusion one should apply effort to learning as well as to the jhānas etcSo too out of his wish for the welfare of others the bodhisattva should develop the wisdom of ingenuity in creating opportunities to fulfil his various duties to his fellow beings and the skillful means in understanding their happiness and miseryThen he should develop wisdom born of reflection by first reflecting upon the specific nature of the dhammas such as the aggregates and then arousing reflective acquiescence in themNext he should perfect the preliminary portion of the wisdom born of meditation by developing the mundane kinds of full understanding through the discernment of the specific and general characteristics of the aggregates etcTo do so he should fully understand all internal and external dhammas without exception as follows This is mere mentalitymateriality  which arises and ceases according to conditions There is here no agent or actor It is impermanent in the sense of not being after having been suffering in the sense of oppression by rise and fall and nonself in the sense of being insusceptible to the exercise of mastery Comprehending them in this way he abandons attachment to them and helps others to do so as well Entirely out of compassion he continues to help his fellow beings enter and reach maturity in the three vehicles assists them to achieve mastery over the jhānas deliverances concentrations attainments and mundane direct knowledges and does not desist until he reaches the very peak of wisdom and all the Buddhaqualities come within his graspThe wisdom born of meditation may be divided into two groups The first comprises the mundane direct knowledges together with their accessories namely the knowledge of the modes of psychic power the knowledge of the divine earelement the knowledge of penetrating other minds the knowledge of recollecting past lives the knowledge of the divine eye the knowledge of kammic retribution and the knowledge of the future The second comprises the five purificationspurification of view purification by overcoming doubt purification by knowledge and vision of what is and what is not the path purification by knowledge and vision of the way and purification by knowledge and vision The first four of these are mundane the last is supramundane After acquiring through study and interrogation a knowledge of the dhammas such as the aggregates etc constituting the soil of wisdom he should establish himself in the two purifications constituting its roots purification of virtue and purification of mind and then accomplish the five purifications just mentioned which constitute the trunk of wisdom Since the method for accomplishing these along with the analysis of their objective sphere is explained in complete detail in the Visuddhimagga it should be understood in the way given thereOnly in that work the explanation of wisdom has come down for beings seeking the enlightenment of disciples But here because it is intended for the great bodhisattvas it should be explained making compassion and skillful means the forerunners One further distinction must also be made here insight should be developed only as far as purification by knowledge and vision of the way without attaining purification by knowledge and visionA Great Being who has formed his aspiration for supreme enlightenment should for the sake of fulfilling his pāramīs always be devoted to what is proper and intent upon service Therefore he should be zealous in providing for the welfare of beings and from time to time day by day should reflect Have I accumulated any requisites of merit and knowledge today What have I done for the welfare of othersIn order to help all beings he should surrender some possession of his with a mind unconcerned with body or lifeWhatever action he does bodily or vocal all should be done with a mind slanting towards full enlightenment all should be dedicated to enlightenmentHe should turn his mind away from sense pleasures whether superior or inferiorHe should work energetically for the welfare of beings be capable of enduring everything whether desirable or undesirable and should speak without deceptionWhatever causes suffering for beings all that he should be ready to take upon himselfHe should frequently reflect upon the greatness of the Buddhas and the greatness of their spiritual powerWhatever action he does by body or speech all should be preceded with a mind slanting towards full enlightenmentIn this way the Great Being the bodhisattva devoted to what is proper endowed with strength firm in striving day by day accumulates immeasurable requisites of merit and knowledge through the practice of the pāramīsFurther having relinquished his own body and life for the use and protection of beings the bodhisattva should seek out and apply the antidotes to the various kinds of suffering to which beings are exposedhunger thirst cold heat wind sun etcThis firstly is the method for a bodhisattva not yet established on the plane of concentrationOne established on the plane of concentration bestows upon beings the rapture tranquillity happiness concentration and true knowledge produced in the achievements of distinction as they are experienced by himself He procures them and dedicates them to allSuch a bodhisattva should contemplate the whole world of sentient beings immersed in the great suffering of saṃsāra and in the sufferings of the defilements and kamma formations at its base He should see the beings in hell experiencing violent racking agonizing pains uninterruptedly over long periods produced as they are cut up dismembered split pulverized and roasted in scorching fires the great suffering of the animals due to their mutual hostility as they afflict harass and kill one another or fall into captivity at the hands of others and the suffering of the various classes of ghosts going about with their bodies aflame consumed and withered by hunger thirst wind and sun weeping and wailing as their food turns into vomit and spittle He should contemplate as well the suffering experienced by men which is often indistinguishable from the suffering in the plane of misery the misery and ruin they encounter in their search  the various punishments they may meet such as the cutting off of their hands etc ugliness deformity and poverty affliction by hunger and thirst being vanquished by the more powerful pressed into the service of others and made dependent upon others and when they pass away falling over into the hells the realm of ghosts and the animal kingdom He should see the gods of the sensesphere being consumed by the fevers of lust as they enjoy their sense objects with scattered minds living with their fever unextinguished like a mass of fire stoked up with blasts of wind and fed with a stock of dry wood without peace dejected and dependent on others And he should see the gods of the finematerial and immaterial spheres after so long a life span in the end succumb to the law of impermanence plunging from their heights back down into the round of birth aging and death like birds swooping swiftly down from the heights of the sky or like arrows shot by a strong arm descending in the distance And having seen all his he should arouse a sense of spiritual urgency and suffuse all beings universally with loving kindness and compassionAccumulating the requisites of enlightenment in this way by body speech and mind without interruption he should fulfil the perfection of energy arousing zeal while working thoroughly and perseveringly and acting without cowering in order that all the pāramīs may reach fulfilmentWhile striving for the state of Buddhahood the store and repository of inconceivable immeasurable vast lofty stainless incomparable undefiled qualities he should encourage the arising of energy for such energy is endowed with inconceivable spiritual power which common people cannot even hear about much less practiceIt is entirely through the spiritual power of energy that the practice of all the requisites of enlightenment succeedsthe threefold arising of the great aspiration the four grounds for Buddhahood the four bases of beneficence the single flavor of compassion the reflective acquiescence which is the specific condition for the realization of the Buddhaqualities being untainted amidst all things the perception of all beings as his own dear children not being fatigued by all the sufferings of saṃsāra the relinquishing of everything that may be given away delight in so giving the determination upon the higher virtue etc unshakeableness therein rapture and exultation in wholesome actions the inclination towards seclusion application to the jhānas being insatiable in blameless states teaching the Dhamma to others as he has learned it out of the wish for their welfare firm initiative in setting beings upon the true path sagacity and heroism being imperturbable in face of the abusive speech and wrongs of others the determination upon truth mastery over the meditative attainments the attainment of power through the direct knowledges the comprehension of the three characteristics the accumulation of the requisites for the supramundane path by practicing meditation in the foundations of mindfulness etc and the descent on to the nine supramundane dhammas Thus from the time of forming the aspiration until the great enlightenment a bodhisattva should perfect his energy thoroughly and uninterruptedly without surrendering so that it might issue in higher and higher states of distinctionAnd when this energy succeeds all the requisites of enlightenmentpatience truthfulness determination etc as well as giving virtue etcwill succeed for all these occur in dependence on energy The practice of patience and the rest should be understood in accordance with the same methodThus through giving relinquishing his own happiness and belongings to others he practices the benefitting of others in many ways through virtue the protection of their lives property and wives the nonbreach of his word endearing and beneficial speech non injury etc through renunciation many kinds of beneficial conduct such as giving the gift of the Dhamma in return for their material gifts through wisdom skillful means in providing for their welfare through energy the arousing of zeal in his work without slacking off through patience the enduring of the wrongs of others through truthfulness not breaking his pledge to help others without deception through determination remaining unshakable in rendering them help even when encountering difficulties through loving kindness concern for their welfare and happiness and through equanimity remaining imperturbable whether others render help or inflict harm This is the practice that the great bodhisattva compassionate for all beings undertakes for the sake of incalculable beings by means of which he accumulates immeasurable requisites of merit and knowledge not shared by worldlingsTheir condition has been stated They should be accomplished thoroughlyor in brief any states which when indulged in prevent the unarisen wisdom from arising and cause the arisen wisdom to diminishThis is an analysis of the sphere of learning the five aggregates the twelve sense bases the eighteen elements the four truths the twentytwo faculties the twelve factors of dependent origination the foundations of mindfulness etc the various classifications of dhammas such as the wholesome etc as well as any blameless secular fields of knowledge that may be suitable for promoting the welfare and happiness of beings particularly grammar Thus with wisdom mindfulness and energy preceded by skillful means a bodhisattva should first thoroughly immerse himself in this entire sphere of learningthrough study listening memorization learning and interrogation then he should establish others in learning In this way the wisdom born of learning can be developedand should apply skillful means to the fulfilment of his various dutiesHe should suffuse all beings with universal loving kindness and compassionand he should rejoice in the merits of all beingsAnd whatever happiness he himself gains by alleviating these kinds of suffering and the happiness he gains when his own bodily and mental afflictions subside in delightful parks gardens mansions pools and forest abodes and the happiness of the blissful jhānic attainments he hears are experienced by the Buddhas their enlightened disciples paccekabuddhas and great bodhisattvas established in the practice of renunciationall that he seeks to procure universally for all beingsHow are they analyzed They are analyzed into thirty pāramīs ten pāramīs ten intermediate pāramīs  and ten ultimate pāramīs Herein some teachers say that the ten basic pāramīs are the intermingled bright and dark dhammas practiced by a bodhisattva who has just formed his aspiration whose end is the welfare of others and whose means are directed towards working for this end the intermediate pāramīs are the bright dhammas untainted by any darkness and the ultimate pāramīs are the dhammas which are neither dark nor brightOthers say that the basic pāramīs are being filled at the time of the commencement the intermediate pāramīs are filled on the plane of bodhisattvahood and the ultimate pāramīs reach perfect fulfilment in all modes on the plane of BuddhahoodOr alternatively the basic pāramīs involve working for the welfare of others on the plane of bodhisattvahood the intermediate pāramīs working for ones own welfare and the ultimate pāramīs the fulfilment of the welfare of both oneself and others with the achievement of the Tathāgatas powers and grounds of selfconfidence on the plane of BuddhahoodThus they analyze the pāramīs according to the beginning middle and consummation by way of the resolution  the undertaking  and their completion respectivelyStill others analyze them according to the division in the accumulation of merit of those who are by nature compassionate and free from hate according to whether they have attained to the happiness of existence the happiness of emancipation or the ultimate happinessAgain some say that among those upheld by a sense of shame mindfulness and selfesteem who give predominance to the supramundane Dhamma and revere virtue concentration and wisdom the pāramīs are analyzed according to their ability to facilitate the attainment of the three types of enlightenmentthe basic pāramīs issuing in the enlightenment of a disciple who requires the help to cross  the intermediate pāramīs in the enlightenment of a paccekabuddha who crosses over himself  and the ultimate pāramīs in the enlightenment of a supreme Buddha who helps others acrossOthers hold that the basic pāramīs are the requisites occurring from the time of the mental resolution until the resolution by speech the intermediate those which occur from the time of the spoken resolution until the resolution by body and the ultimate those which occur following the resolution by bodyBut still others explain that the basic pāramīs are the requisites which occur by rejoicing in the merits of others the intermediate those which occur by exhorting others to practice and the ultimate those which occur through ones own practiceSo too some say the basic pāramīs are the requisites of merit and knowledge issuing in a happy state of existence the intermediate those issuing in the happiness of nibbāna for oneself and the ultimate those issuing in both kinds of happiness for othersThe basic perfection of giving is the relinquishing of ones children wife and belongings such as wealth the intermediate perfection of giving  the relinquishing of ones own limbs and the ultimate perfection of giving  the relinquishing of ones own lifeThe three stages in the perfection of virtue should be understood as the nontransgression on account of the three children and wife limbs and life the three stages in the perfection of renunciation as the renunciation of those three bases after cutting off attachment to them the three stages in the perfection of wisdom as the discrimination between what is beneficial and harmful to beings after rooting out craving for ones belongings limbs and life How are they synthesizedJust as the ten pāramīs become thirtyfold through analysis so they become sixfold through their specific nature as giving virtue patience energy meditation and wisdomOne part of the perfection of truthfulness ie its aspect of truthful speech or abstinence from falsehood is included in the perfection of virtue and one part ie its aspect of truthful knowledge in the perfection of wisdomThe perfection of loving kindness is included in the perfection of meditationThe perfection of determination is included by allThese six pāramīs fall into at least fifteen pairs of complementary qualities which perfect fifteen other pairs of qualitiesHow The pairgiving and virtueperfects the pair of doing what is beneficial for others and abstaining from what is harmful to them The pairgiving and patienceperfects the pair of nongreed and nonhatred The pairgiving and energyperfects the pair of generosity and learning The pairgiving and meditationperfects the abandoning of sensual desire and hatredThe pair giving and wisdom the ariyan vehicle and burden The dyad of virtue and patience the purification of means and the purification of the end The dyad of virtue and energy the dyad of meditative development  The dyad of virtue and meditation the abandoning of moral depravity and of mental obsession The dyad of virtue and wisdom the dyad of giving The dyad of patience and energy the dyad of acceptance and heat The dyad of patience and meditation the abandoning of opposing and favoring The dyad of patience and wisdom the acceptance and penetration of emptiness The dyad of energy and meditation the dyad of exertion and nondistraction The dyad of energy and wisdom the dyad of refuges The dyad of meditation and wisdom perfects the dyad of vehicles  The triad of giving virtue and patience perfects the abandoning of greed hatred and delusion The triad of giving virtue and energy perfects the giving of wealth life and bodily vitality The triad of giving virtue and meditation perfects the three bases of meritorious deeds The triad of giving virtue and wisdom perfects the triad of giving material gifts fearlessness and the DhammaIn the same way the other triads and tetrads may be applied to one another as is appropriate in each caseThese six pāramīs are also included in the four foundations which provide a synthesis of all the pāramīsWhat are they The foundations of truth the foundation of relinquishment the foundation of peace and the foundation of wisdomHere is the word explanation it is a foundation because it is founded by this or it is founded upon this or it itself is a foundation It is truth and it is a foundation or it is the foundation for truth or truth is the foundation for thisthus it is the foundation of truthThe same with the restTherein taking them first without distinction after making his aspiration for the supramundane qualities the Great Being filled with compassion for all beings establishes the foundation of truth by acquiring all the pāramīs in conformity with his vowTaken separately giving is a proximate cause for the four foundations of wholesome dhammas as follows since one vows to give to those who ask without deceiving them gives without violating ones vows and rejoices without deceiving them about the gift through the relinquishing of the opposite qualities such as stinginess etc through the pacification of greed hatred delusion and fear in regard to the objects to be given the recipients the act of giving and the loss of the objects to be given respectively through giving according to desert at the proper time in the appropriate manner and through the preeminence of wisdomVirtue is a proximate cause for the four foundations thus through non transgression of the restraint undertaken through the relinquishing of moral depravity through the pacification of misconduct and through the preeminence of wisdomPatience is a proximate cause for the four foundations thus through patient acceptance in accordance with ones vow through the relinquishing of discrimination against others on account of their wrongs through the pacification of the obsession of anger and through the pre eminence of wisdomEnergy is a proximate cause for the four foundations through working for the welfare of others in accordance with ones vows through the relinquishing of dejection through the pacification of unwholesome dhammas and through the preeminence of wisdomMeditation is a proximate cause for the four foundations through concern for the welfare of the world in accordance with ones vow through the relinquishing of the hindrances through the pacification of the mind and through the preeminence of wisdomAnd wisdom is a proximate cause for the four foundations through skillful means in promoting the welfare of others in accordance with ones vow through the relinquishing of unskillful activity through the pacification of the fevers springing from delusion and through the attainment of omniscienceThe foundation of truth is practiced by acting in accordance with ones vow and understandingThe foundation of truth is embraced by the threefold truth and opposed to the three corruptions The foundation of relinquishing is embraced by the threefold relinquishment and opposed to the three corruptionsThe foundation of peace is embraced by the threefold pacification and opposed to the three corruptionsAnd the foundation of wisdom is embraced by the threefold knowledge and opposed to the three corruptionsThe foundation of truth embraces the foundations of relinquishment peace and wisdom through nondeceptiveness and through acting in accordance with ones vow The foundation of relinquishment embraces the foundations of truth peace and wisdom through the relinquishing of their opposites and as the fruit of relinquishing everything The foundation of peace embraces the foundations of truth relinquishment and wisdom through the pacification of the fever of defilement and the fever of kamma And the foundation of wisdom embraces the foundations of truth relinquishment and peace since they are all preceded and accompanied by knowledge Thus all the pāramīs are grounded in truth clarified by relinquishment intensified by peace and purified by wisdomFor truth is the cause for their genesisIn the beginning truth is the foundation since his vow is made in accordance with truth In the middle relinquishment is the foundation since after forming his aspiration the bodhisattva relinquishes himself for the welfare of othersIn the end peace is the foundation since the consummation is the attainment of perfect peaceAnd in every phasethe beginning the middle and the endwisdom is the foundation since the entire career originates when wisdom is present does not exist when it is absent and because the nature accords with the vowThrough the foundations of truth and relinquishment which promote ones own and others welfare and create reverence and love the Great Men as laymen benefit others with material giftsAnd through the foundations of peace and wisdom which likewise promote ones own and others welfare and create reverence and love the Great Men as monks benefit others with the gift of the DhammaThe fulfilment of the four foundations takes place in the bodhisattvas last existenceSome say that rebirth into the final existence takes place when the four foundations are fulfilled the bodhisattva descends into his mothers womb remains there and emerges mindfully and clearly comprehending through his commencement of the foundation of wisdom Through his fulfilment of the foundations of truth as soon as he is born he goes forward with a stride of seven steps facing north surveys all the directions and with a voice encompassed by truth roars his lions roar three times I am the foremost in the world I am preeminent in the world I am supreme in the worldThrough the commencement of the foundation of peace when he sees the old man the sick man the corpse and the monk skilled in a section of the four truths his intoxication with youth health and life becomes pacifiedAnd through the commencement of the foundation of relinquishment he is able to relinquish without concern a great circle of relatives and the sovereignty of a worldruling monarch that lay within his graspOthers hold as a second position that the four foundations are fulfilled with the enlightenmentFor through the commencement of the foundation of truth in accordance with his vow he penetrates the Four Noble Truths thus the foundation of truth is fulfilledThrough the commencement of the foundation of relinquishment he relinquishes all the defilements and corruptions thus the foundation of relinquishment is fulfilledThrough the commencement of the foundation of peace he attains the supreme peace thus the foundation of peace is fulfilledAnd through the commencement of the foundation of wisdom he obtains the unobstructed knowledge thus the foundation of wisdom is fulfilledBut despite the ultimacy of the enlightenment this position is untenableOthers hold as a third position that the four foundations are fulfilled with the setting in motion of the Wheel of the DhammaFor having commenced the foundation of truth he fulfils the foundation of truth by teaching the Four Noble Truths in their twelve modesHaving commenced the foundation of relinquishment he fulfils the foundation of relinquishment by making the great offering of the true DhammaHaving himself attained the supreme peace through his commencement of the foundation of peace he fulfils the foundation of peace by to othersAnd having commenced the foundation of wisdom he fulfils the foundation of wisdom by understanding the propensities etc of the people to be trainedThis position too is not tenable for even at this point the function of a Buddha has not yet been concludedStill others hold as a fourth position that the four foundations are fulfilled with the parinibbānaFor with the parinibbāna the foundation of truth is fulfilled by the attainment of the ultimate truthThe virtue of one who has commenced the foundation of truth is to be known by living together with himThe honesty of one who has commenced the foundation of relinquishment is to be known through intercourse with himThe fortitude of one who has commenced the foundation of peace is to be known on occasions of misfortuneAnd the wisdom of one who has commenced the foundation of wisdom is to be known through discussion with himThus his purification of virtue livelihood mind and view should be knownAgain through his commencement of the foundation of truth he does not follow a wrong course out of hatred since he is free from deceptivenessThrough his commencement of the foundation of relinquishment he does not follow a wrong course out of greed since he is without attachmentThrough his commencement of the foundation of peace he does not follow a wrong course out of fear since he is without obstructionAnd through his commencement of the foundation of wisdom he does not follow a wrong course out of delusion since he comprehends things as they really areThus through the first foundation he tolerates without hatred through the second he uses without greed through the third he avoids without fear and through the fourth he dispels without delusionThrough the first he attains the happiness of renunciation and through the others the happiness of solitude of peace and of enlightenment respectivelySo too through the four foundations he attains respectively the rapture and happiness born of seclusion the rapture and happiness born of concentration the bodily happiness unaccompanied by rapture and the happiness of equanimity born of the purification of mindfulnessThus it should be understood how the body of the pāramīs is included in the four foundations which are adorned with numerous noble qualitiesAnd just as the pāramīs are all included in the four foundations they are also included in wisdom and compassionFor all the requisites of enlightenment can be included in wisdom and compassion By what means are they accomplishedThe means by which the pāramīs are accomplished is the four factored method the accumulation without omission of all the requisites of merit etc for the sake of supreme enlightenment by performing them without deficiency performing them thoroughly with respect and high esteem performing them perseveringly without interruption and enduring effort over a long period without coming to a halt halfwayWe will explain the length of time laterFor the sake of the supreme enlightenment the Great Being striving for enlightenment should first of all surrender himself to the Buddhas thus I offer myself up to the BuddhasAnd whenever he obtains any possession he should first of all resolve upon it as a potential giftWhen he has made a mental determination to completely relinquish whatever possessions come his way whether animate or inanimate there are four shackles to giving  namely not being accustomed to giving in the past the inferiority of the object to be given the excellence and beauty of the object and worry over the loss of the object When the bodhisattva possesses objects that can be given and suppliants are present but his mind does not leap up at the thought of giving and he does not want to givehe should conclude Surely I have not been accustomed to giving in the past therefore a desire to give does not arise now in my mindSo that my mind will delight in giving in the future I will give a gift With an eye for the future let me now relinquish what I have to those in need Thus he gives a gift generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharingIn this way the Great Being destroys shatters and eradicates the first shackle to givingAgain when the object to be given is inferior or defective the Great Being reflects Because I was not inclined to giving in the past at present my requisites are defective Therefore though it pains me let me give whatever I have as a gift even if the object is low and inferior In that way I will in the future reach the peak in the perfection of givingThus he gives whatever kind of gift he can generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharingIn this way the Great Being destroys shatters and eradicates the second shackle to givingWhen a reluctance to give arises due to the excellence or beauty of the object to be given the Great Being admonishes himself Good man havent you made the aspiration for the supreme enlightenment the loftiest and most superior of all states Well then for the sake of enlightenment it is proper for you to give excellent and beautiful objects as giftsThus he gives what is excellent and beautifulgenerous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharingIn this way the Great Man destroys shatters and eradicates the third shackle to givingWhen the Great Being is giving a gift and he sees the loss of the object being given he reflects thus This is the nature of material possessions that they are subject to loss and to passing awayMoreover it is because I did not give such gifts in the past that my possessions are now depleted Let me then give whatever I have as a gift whether it be limited or abundant In that way I will in the future reach the peak in the perfection of givingThus he gives whatever he has as a giftgenerous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharingIn this way the Great Being destroys shatters and eradicates the fourth shackle to givingReflecting upon them thus in whatever way is appropriate is the means for dispelling the harmful shackles to the perfection of givingThe same method used for the perfection of giving also applies to the perfection of virtue and the other perfectionsFurther selfsurrender to the Buddhas is also a means for the complete accomplishment of the pāramīsFor when the Great Man straining and striving for the fulfilment of the requisites of enlightenment encounters troubles difficult to endure depriving him of happiness and his means of support or when he encounters injuries imposed by beings and formationsdifficult to overcome violent sapping the vitalitythen since he has surrendered himself to the Buddhas he reflects I have relinquished my very self to the Buddhas Whatever comes let it come For this reason he does not waver does not quake does not undergo the least vacillation but remains absolutely unshaken in his determination to undertake the goodFor by fully understanding all dhammas in accordance with their nature the Great Being who has formed the resolution to attain the supreme enlightenment remains untainted by them and his selflove thereby becomes eliminated and exhausted Then since through the repeated practice of great compassion he has come to regard all beings as his dear children his loving kindness compassion and affection for them increase In conformity with this stage the Great Man having expelled the defilements such as stinginess etc opposed to the requisites of enlightenment and dispelled greed hatred and delusion in regard to himself and others further causes people to enter and reach maturity in the three vehicles by benefitting them to the utmost with the four bases of beneficence which accompany the four foundations namely giving loving speech beneficent conduct and equality of treatmentFor the great compassion and the great wisdom of the Great Beings are adorned by giving Their giving is adorned and accompanied by loving speech loving speech by beneficent conduct and beneficent conduct by equality of treatmentWhen the bodhisattvas are practicing the requisites of enlightenment they treat all beings without exception as equal with themselves and perfect their sense of equality by remaining the same under all circumstances pleasant or painfulAnd when they become Buddhas their ability to train people is perfected by benefitting them to the utmost with these same four bases of beneficence brought to fulfilment by the four foundationsFor the perfectly enlightened Buddhas the base of giving is brought to fulfilment by the foundation of relinquishment the base of loving speech by the foundation of truth the base of beneficent conduct by the foundation of wisdom and the base of equal treatment by the foundation of peaceFor in regard to parinibbāna all the disciples and paccekabuddhas are completely equal to the TathāgatasThus it is said There is no diversity among them in regard to emancipation He is truthful generous and peaceful Endowed with wisdom and sympathyHe is the great compassionate Teacher Equanimous yet seeking the welfare of allStill he abides devoted to their welfare Oh how wonderful is the ConquerorAlways engaged in work promoting The welfare and happiness of all living beingsthe three stages in the perfection of energy as striving for the relinquishing of the aforementioned things the three stages in the perfection of patience as the endurance of obstacles to ones belongings limbs and life the three stages in the perfection of truthfulness as the non abandoning of truthfulness on account of ones belongings limbs and life the three stages in the perfection of determination as unshakable determination despite the destruction of ones belongings limbs and life bearing in mind that the pāramīs ultimately succeed through unflinching determination the three stages in the perfection of loving kindness as maintaining loving kindness towards beings who destroy ones belongings etc and the three stages in the perfection of equanimity as maintaining an attitude of impartial neutrality towards beings and formations whether they are helpful or harmful in regard to the aforementioned three bases  In this way the analysis of the pāramīs should be understoodWhen this set is considered the perfection of renunciation as the going forth into homelessness is included in the perfection of virtue as seclusion from the hindrances in the perfection of meditation and as a generally wholesome dhamma in all six pāramitāsand the perfection of equanimity in the perfections of meditation and of wisdomthe foundation of relinquishment by relinquishing their oppositesthe foundation of peace by pacifying their opposites with all the qualities of the pāramīsand the foundation of wisdom by skillful means in promoting the welfare of others through those same qualitiesthe foundation of relinquishment by relinquishing objects of sense enjoyment and the defilement of sensualitythe foundation of peace by the pacification of hatred and sufferingand the foundation of wisdom by understanding and penetrationrelinquishment the cause for their acquisition peace the cause for their growth and wisdom the cause for their purificationthe foundation of relinquishment by the relinquishing of all the strata of existencethe foundation of peace by the pacification of all formationsHerein after he has commenced the foundation of truth the Great Mans fulfilment of the foundation of truth is particularly evident at his birth which is the field for his loving kindness After he has commenced the foundation of wisdom his fulfilment of the foundation of wisdom is particularly evident at his enlightenment which is the field for his compassion After he has commenced the foundation of relinquishment his fulfilment of the foundation of relinquishment is particularly evident when he sets in motion the Wheel of the Dhamma which is the field for his sympathetic joy And after he has commenced the foundation of peace his fulfilment of the foundation of peace is particularly evident at his parinibbāna which is the field for his equanimityand the foundation of wisdom by the completion of the purpose of wisdomand the noble qualities such as giving  accompanied by wisdom and compassion are the requisites for the great enlightenment culminating in the perfection of BuddhahoodWhatever requisite of life comes my way that I will give to those who need it and I myself will only use what remains over from this giftIn brief the destruction of selflove and the development of love for others are the means for the accomplishing of the pāramīsthey are identical without any distinctionComplete in all the requisites What good can he not achieveFree from concern on all occasions Oh how wonderful is the ConquerorDispassionate towards all dhammas And towards all beings of equal mindHe never ceases on account of the trouble Oh how wonderful is the ConquerorThe Blessed Lord is able here and now to enjoy the surpassing happiness of dwelling in the four jhanasand there will be in the future Arahant Buddhas equal in enlightenment to myselfwhen being endowed with such power and influence he does not make a display of himselfHow much time is required to accomplish themAs a minimum four incalculables and a hundred thousand great aeons  as a middle figure eight incalculables and a hundred thousand great aeons and as a maximum sixteen incalculables and a hundred thousand great aeonsFor those in whom wisdom is predominant faith is weakest and wisdom keenest for those in whom faith is predominant wisdom is middling  and for those in whom energy is predominant wisdom is weakest  But supreme enlightenment must be achieved by the power of wisdom so it is said in the commentaryBut others say that the classification of the time required for bodhisattvas obtains by way of the keen middling and tender quality of their energyStill others say that without distinction the three divisions of time correspond to the time required for their requisites of enlightenment to reach fulfilment which in turn is determined by the keen middling and tender quality of their factors maturing towards emancipation Bodhisattvas also become threefold at the moment they form the aspiration according to their division into those who comprehend through a condensed teaching  those who comprehend through an elaborated teaching  and those who are capable of training The second has such supporting conditions that if he were disposed towards the enlightenment of a disciple he could attain arahatship together with the six direct knowledges while listening to a fourline stanza from the lips of the Exalted One even while the fourth line has not yet been concludedAnd the third has the supporting conditions to attain arahatship together with the six direct knowledges when the fourline stanza he hears from the Exalted One has been concludedThese three types who form their aspirations without any allotted division of time receive predictions directly from the BuddhasThen they fulfil the pāramīs in order and reach the supreme enlightenment according to the aforementioned time allotted to each type But that these Great Beingsday by day giving great gifts like those given by Vessantara accumulating all the other pāramīs in the same way making the five great relinquishings reaching the summit in conduct for the good of relatives conduct for the good of the world and conduct developing intelligenceshould become perfectly enlightened Buddhas before the time allotted to their respective types is fulfilled this is not possibleWhyBecause their knowledge is not yet mature enough and their accumulation of the factors culminating in Buddhahood not yet completeFor just as grain ripens only after the lapse of the time required  so too the supreme enlightenment is perfected only after the lapse of the aforementioned periods of time Before then even though striving with all his might the bodhisattva cannot attain enlightenment The pāramīs are fulfilled according to the aforementioned distinction of time Thus it should be understood What benefits do they bringThe benefits obtained by bodhisattvas who have formed their aspirations are explained thusThey never appear as tawny titans Or ghosts consumed by hunger and thirstThough reborn in the plane of woe They do not take on minor formsTheir hearing is intact from birth Nor are they dumb or lame of limbThey never become of female sex Eunuchs or hermaphroditesThose men bound for enlightenmentThey never hold inverted views But recognize the law of kammaThey are born at times in heavenly worlds But not in the insentientThose true men bent on renunciation Detached from all the planes of existenceSome other benefits of the pāramīs are the following the sixteen wonderful and marvellous qualities that begin Mindful and clearly comprehending nanda the bodhisattva passes away from the Tusita heaven and descends into his mothers womb  the thirty two portents such as cold disappears and heat is allayed and when the bodhisattva is born this tenthousandfold world system shakes trembles and quakes etc  and the other qualities shown here and there in the Jātakas the Buddhavaṃsa etc such as the fulfilment of the bodhisattvas wishes his mastery over kamma and so forthOther benefits are the pairs of complementary qualities such as non greed and nonhatred already discussedMoreover from the time that he makes the aspiration the bodhisattva becomes like a father to all beings wishing for their welfare By reason of his distinguished qualities he is worthy of offerings worthy of reverence worthy of esteem a supreme field of meritHe is generally dear to humans and to nonhumans alike and is protected by deitiesBecause his mind is grounded in loving kindness and compassion he cannot be harmed by wild beasts etc Whatever order of beings he is reborn in on account of his distinguished merit he surpasses the other beings there in his superior beauty fame happiness strength and dominion He is healthy and robust His faith is very pure and lucid His energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom are also very pure and lucid His defilements disturbances and passions are weak Because his defilements are weak he is easy to admonish adroit patient meek congenial and hospitable He is free from anger malice denigration domineering envy stinginess craftiness hypo crisy obstinacy pride presumption and negligence He endures torments at the hands of others but never torments anyone himself Whenever he enters a village area the unarisen dangers and calamities facing the beings there generally do not arise and those that have arisen subside And whenever he is reborn in the planes of misery unlike the common inhabitants there he is not oppressed by excessive suffering but acquires an even greater sense of spiritual urgencyTherefore these distinguished qualities of the Great Mansuch as being like a father to beings being worthy of offerings etcfound in this or that state of existence are the benefits of the pāramīsFurther the accomplishment of life span the accomplishment of form the accomplishment of family the accomplishment of sovereignty credibility and greatness of spiritual power are also benefits of the Great Mans pāramīsTherein the accomplishment of life span is length of life or longevity in whatever state of exist ence he takes rebirth in by this means he concludes whatever wholesome undertakings he began and accumulates many wholesome qualitiesThe accomplishment of form is beauty of form comeliness or loveliness by this means he inspires confidence and esteem in beings who take physical form as their standardThe accomplishment of family is rebirth in excellent families by this means he is to be worth approaching and ministering to by beings who are intoxicated with the vanity of birth etcCredibility means trustworthiness reliability by this means he becomes an authority for beings and his command cannot be disregardedGreatness of spiritual power means magnitude of spiritual power by this means he cannot be vanquished by others but he himself invari ably vanquishes themby Dhamma by righteousness and by his genuine noble qualities Thus the accomplishment of life span and the rest are benefits of the Great Mans pāramīs These are the cause for the growth of his own boundless requisites of merit and the means by which he leads other beings to enter and reach maturity in the three vehicles What is their fruitTheir fruit is in brief the state of perfect Buddhahood In detail it is the acquisition of the formbody resplendent with the multitude of meritorious qualities such as the thirtytwo characteristics of a Great Man the eighty minor marks of physical beauty the fathomwide aura etc and founded upon this the glorious Dhamma body radiant with its collection of infinite and boundless meritorious qualitiesthe ten powers the four grounds of selfconfidence the six kinds of knowledge not held in common with others the eighteen unique Buddhadhammas and so forthAnd so numerous are the Buddhaqualities that even a perfectly enlightened Buddha could not finish describing them even after many aeons This is their fruitAnd it is saidIf a Buddha were to speak in praise of a Buddha Speaking nothing else through the duration of an aeonThis threefold division obtains by way of those in whom wisdom is predominant those in whom faith is predominant and those in whom energy is predominant respectivelyAmong these he who comprehends through a condensed teaching has such supporting conditions that if he were disposed towards the enlightenment of a disciple he could attain arahatship together with the four discriminations and the six direct knowledges while listening to a fourline stanza from the lips of a perfectly enlightened Buddha even while the third line has not yet been concludedThose men in all factors complete Bound for perfect enlightenmentThough wandering through the round of births For countless aeons yet to comeNever arise in Avīci hell Nor in the intermundane voidsAnd when reborn in the world of men They never come deprived of sightNever commit the five dark deeds Always pure in their way of lifeor pure abodesPlough their course for the good of the world Striving to fulfil the pāramīsThe accomplishment of sovereignty is great ness of power greatness of influence and greatness of retinue by means of these he is able to benefit with the four bases of beneficence those who need to be benefited and to restrain with Dhamma those who need to be restrainedSooner would the longstanding aeon reach its end But the praise of the Tathāgata would not reach its endthat the Blessed Lorddoes not make display of himself so it ishe does not make a display of himselfthat one will by following instructions by the complete destruction of three fetters and the reduction of greed hatred and delusion become a OnceRetumer and having returned once more to this world will put an end to sufferingthat one will by following instructions by the complete destruction of the five lower fetters be spontaneously reborn and there will reach Nibbana without returning from that worldthat one will by following instructions by the destruction of the corruptions gain in this very life the deliverance of mind the deliverance through wisdom which is uncorrupted and which one has understood and realised by ones own superknowledgeI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans in the mansion in the mango grove of the Sakyan family called Vedhañña ArcherAnd on that occasion Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta had just died in PāvāOn his death the Nigaṇṭhas had split into two factions They kept

out not conducive to calming expounded by one who was not rightly selfawakened its foundation now broken without an arbiterThen Cunda the novice who had spent the Rains at Pāvā went to Ven nanda at Sāmagāma and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to Ven nanda Venerable sir Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta has just died in PāvāOn his death the Nigaṇṭhas have split

novice Friend Cunda there is warrant here for talking to the Blessed OneLets go to the Blessed One and on arrival report this matter to himAs you say venerable sir Cunda the novice responded to Ven nandaThen Ven nanda  Cunda the novice went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there Ven nanda said to the Blessed One Lord Cunda the novice

Uruvelāon the bank of the river Nerañjarā at the root of the Goatherds Banyan tree in the first period after attaining AwakeningThen at that time the Fortunate Onewas sitting in one crosslegged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of freedomThen with the passing of those seven days the Fortunate Onearose from that concentrationThen a certain brāhmaṇa who was by nature a grumblerwent to the Fortunate Oneand after going he exchanged greetings with the Fortunate OneAfter exchanging courteous talk and greetings he stood on one sideWhile stood on one side that brāhmaṇa

Saṅgāmajīwas neither looking at the boy nor was he speaking to himHaving seen that this occured to herThis ascetic does not even have need of a sonTherefore after turning back and taking the boy she went awayThe Fortunate One saw with the divineeyewhich is purified and surpasses that of normal menthat venerable Saṅgāmajīs former wife had such bad mannersThen the Fortunate One having understood the significance of iton that occasion uttered this exalted utteranceIn her coming he does not rejoice  in her leaving he does not grieveSaṅgāmajī Victorious in Battle free from the shackle  him I call a brāhmaṇaat one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthīin Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen at that time many young boyswho were between Sāvatthī and Jetas Wood were catching

suffering  if suffering is unpleasant to youDont do any bad deeds  whether in the open or in secretBut if you will do or now do do bad deedsFor you there is no freedom from suffering  even after going while running awayThus I heardat one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthīin Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen at that time the Fortunate One was instructing rousing enthusing and cheeringthe monks with a Dhamma talk connected with EmancipationThose monks after making it their goal applying their mindsconsidering it with all their mind were listening to Dhamma with an attentive earThen the Fortunate One having understood the significance of iton that occasion uttered this exalted utteranceThere is monks an unborn unbecome unmade unconditionedIf monks there were not that unborn unbecomeunmade unconditioned you could not know an escape herefrom the born become made and conditionedBut because there is an unborn unbecomeunmade unconditioned therefore you do know an escapeat one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthīin Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monasterywas living near Suppāraka on the bank of the oceanbeing venerated respected revered honoured esteemedin receipt of robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sickThen when Bāhiya of the Bark Robe had gone into hiding into seclusionthis reflection arose in his mindAmong those in the world who are Worthy Onesor have entered the path to Worthiness I am one of themThen a devatā who was a former bloodrelative of Bāhiya of the Bark Robebeing compassionate and desiring his welfareknowing with his mind the reflection in the mind of Bāhiya of the Bark Robewent to Bāhiya of the Bark Robeand after going he said this to Bāhiya of the Bark RobeYou are certainly not a Worthy One BāhiyaNor have you entered the path to WorthinessThis practice of yours is not one whereby you could be a Worthy Oneor one who has entered the path to WorthinessThen who now in this world with its devas are Worthy Onesor have entered the path to WorthinessThere is Bāhiya in the northern countries a city by the name of SāvatthīThere the Fortunate One dwells at the present time who is a Worthy One a Perfect SambuddhaHe Bāhiya the Fortunate One is certainly a Worthy One and teaches the Dhamma for attaining WorthinessThen Bāhiya of the Bark Robe being greatly moved by that devatāimmediately went away from Suppāraka and staying for only one night in every placewent to Sāvatthī Jetas Wood and to Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen at that time many monks were walking in meditation in the open airThen Bāhiya of the Bark Robe went to those monksand after going he said this to those monksWhere reverend Sirs is the Fortunate One living at presentthe Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha We have a desire to seethe Fortunate One the Worthy One the Perfect SambuddhaThe Fortunate One Bāhiya has entered among the houses for almsThen Bāhiya of the Bark Robe having hurriedlyleft Jetas Grove and having entered Sāvatthīsaw the Fortunate One walking for alms in Sāvatthīconfident inspiring confidence with sense faculties at peace mind at peacehaving attained supreme selfcontrol and calmcontrolled guarded with restrained faculties a true nāgaAfter seeing him he went to the Fortunate Oneand after going and prostrating himself with his head at the Fortunate Ones feethe said this to the Fortunate OneLet the Fortunate One preach the Dhamma to me reverend Sir let the Happy One preach the Dhammathat will be for my benefit and happiness for a long timeAfter that was said the Fortunate One said this to Bāhiya of the Bark RobeIt is the wrong time for you Bāhiya we have entered among the houses for almsFor a second time Bāhiya of the Bark Robe said this to the Fortunate OneBut it is hard to know reverend Sir the dangers to the Fortunate Ones lifeor the dangers to my lifeLet the Fortunate One preach the Dhamma to me reverend Sir let the Happy One preach the Dhammathat will be for my benefit and happiness for a long timeFor a second time the Fortunate One said this to Bāhiya of the Bark RobeIt is the wrong time for you Bāhiya we have entered among the houses for almsFor a third time Bāhiya of the Bark Robe said this to the Fortunate OneBut it is hard to know reverend Sir the dangers to the Fortunate Ones lifeor the dangers to my lifeLet the Fortunate One preach the Dhamma to me reverend Sir let the Happy One preach the Dhammathat will be for my benefit and happiness for a long timeIn that case Bāhiya you should train yourself thusin what is heard there must be only what is heardin what is sensed there must be only what is sensedin what is cognized there must be only what is cognizedThis is the way Bāhiya you should train yourselfAnd since for you Bāhiya in what is seen there will be only what is seenin what is heard there will be only what is heardin what is sensed there will be only what is sensedin what is cognized there will be only what is cognizedtherefore Bāhiya you will not be with thatand since Bāhiya you will not be with that therefore Bāhiya you will not be in thatand since Bāhiya you will not be in that therefore Bāhiya you just this is the end of sufferingThen through the Fortunate Ones brief teaching of this DhammaBāhiya of the Bark Robes mind was immediatelyfreed from the pollutants without attachmentThen the Fortunate One having advisedBāhiya of the Bark Robe with this brief advice went awayThen not long after the Fortunate One had gonea cow with a young calf having attacked Bāhiya of the Bark Robe deprived him of lifeThen the Fortunate One after walking for alms in Sāvatthīwhile returning from the almsround after the mealafter going out from the city with many monkssaw that Bāhiya of the Bark Robe had diedAfter seeing him he addressed the monks sayingMonks take up Bāhiya of the Bark Robes bodyand after putting it on a bier carrying it away and burning it make a memorial mound for himyour

practiced Dhamma in accordance with the Dhammaand did not trouble me on account of the DhammaCompletely emancipated monks is Bāhiya of the Bark RobeThen the Fortunate One having understood the significance of iton that occasion uttered this exalted utteranceIn the place where the water earth   fire and wind find no footingThere the stars do not shine  nor does the sun give lightThere the moon does not glow  there darkness is not foundAnd when the sage the brāhmaṇa has experienced nibbāna through his own sagacityThen from both form and formless  happiness and suffering he is freeThis exalted utterance was also said by the Fortunate One so I have heardat one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthīin Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen at that time venerable Sāriputtawas sitting not far away from the Fortunate Oneafter folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straightand was attending to mindfulness at the frontThe Fortunate One saw that venerable
