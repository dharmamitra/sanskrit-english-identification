Herein the nondelusion is the cause and that it establishes two ideas namely the undistorted seeing in right view and the directaddressing  in right mindfulness this is its outcome
The fruit of this divine life is the two kinds of deliverance namely the heartdeliverance due to fading of lust and the understanding deliverance due to fading of ignorance This is the fruit
So these three roots of the profitable have been demonstrated as to cause as to outcome and as to fruit
This is how the kinds of the profitable can be penetrated as shared in common
Now here is a relevant verse
 The Stilled One dropped the beingdeterminant That gives existence measured and unmeasured
As to  That gives existence measured and unmeasured  the measured is the determined and the unmeasured is the undetermined
The unmeasured cannot be measured for two reasons 
The rejection  of the being determinants known therein is nongreed
The words happy in himself and concentrated which deny distraction signify nonhate
So these are the three roots of the profitable
 That gives existence measured and unmeasured   this is nondelusion
the greed for the beingdeterminants meeting together which is the gratification due to right concentration  is the cause
The breaking happy in oneself of the eggshell of ignorance is the outcome
That is occurrence    These three roots of the profitable have now been demonstrated as to cause as to outcome and as to fruit
Up to this point this is both occurrence and stopping It occurs by means of the roots of unprofit and it stops  by means of the roots of profit thus all the unprofitable meets together with these three roots of profit
For any  defilement verbally demonstrated in the True Idea too as say craving or as anger or as  unawareness  or  underlying tendency  as  contempt  or  domineering  as  unmindfulness  as  envy  or  avarice     as  unknowing   can be demonstrated  by those three basic examples too 
of which defilement in general these twoterm  Traces of the True Idea are demonstrated In fact there is no defilement that comes to be combined and to meet together in these nine terms 
And the roots of unprofit like the roots of profit can be demonstrated in the opposite sense
Herein what is that expressed in terms of bodily action
 Let him do  profit by the body His body being then restrained
and There are these three kinds of good bodily conduct
abstention from killing breathing things  from taking what is not given abstention from misconduct in sensual desires    This is expressed in terms of bodily action
Herein what is that expressed in terms of verbal action
 The just say that what is well spoken is best  And speak what is right and not wrong for the second
and  This is expressed in terms of verbal action
Herein what is that expressed in terms of mental action
Let there be mental acts of profit Let him be well restrained in mind
and  This is expressed in terms of mental action
These are unshared Threads
Herein what are Shared Threads
 Who guards his speech is well restrained in mind Does no unprofit through the bodys means
and  Bhikkhus there are these three purities  purity of bodily action purity of verbal action purity of mental action
Herein what is purity of bodily action
It is abstention from killing breathing things abstention from taking what is not given abstention from misconduct in sensual desires
Herein what is purity of verbal action
It is abstention from false speech  abstention from gossip
Herein what is purity of mental action
It is noncovetousness nonillwill right view  
This is the shared type of Thread
That is how shared Threads and unshared Threads can be penetrated
After penetrating them thus the Threads meaning can be demonstrated as to speech and as to body
He is not one they call a pauper His life has not been lived in vain 
and all of 
and  the Blessed One   
This is expressed in terms of the faith faculty
Herein what is that expressed in terms of the energy faculty
 Instigate yourselves launch out devote Yourselves in the Enlightened Ones Dispensation 
and  This is expressed in terms of the energy faculty
Herein what is that expressed in terms of the mindfulness faculty
 The mindful man has always  luck Let there be luck for the mindful man
One mindful always  comes off better One mindful easily succeeds 
and  can be quoted in detail This is expressed in terms of the mindfulness faculty
Herein what is that expressed in terms of the concentration faculty
 Leader of men to be tamed When you intend No gods or men or even all
The whole array Of breathing things can know what is Thought in your mind Using the quiet concentration Without conflict 
and 
This is expressed in terms of the concentration faculty
Herein what is that expressed in terms of the understanding faculty
  in detail
and  This is the type of Thread expressed in terms of the understanding faculty
 One not without lust for sense desires And whose five faculties are blunt
Copy not such as him o bhikkhu   For he is still attached thereto  
and 
namely the faithfaculty etc see the Indriya Samyutta and
These are Threads expressed in terms of the faculties shared
Whichever the faculty may be  whether its context  is that of profit or unprofit the Thread in question  should be demonstrated by those terms of expression no other idea than that should be demonstrated
Herein the shared is only the profitable there is no profitable unprofitable as there are shared profitable roots and shared unprofitable roots  namely  and the right endeavours  are in  profitable and unprofitable contexts 
Here is a mnemonic verse 
When a man is engrossed in thoughts Also when giving a man is dear
And then who always guards his speech   And the three kinds of Purity
Who in a Perfect One has faith And what is taught in coarising 
So in the Elder MahaKaccayana
and likewise in the case of proseexpositions 
And that
and that he dies without remorse   this is the Outcome
who in the world Takes to himself what is not given Who goes too with anothers wife
Who has the habit to indulge In drinking spirituous liquor
 
 
and he who indulges  in drinking spirituous liquor finds like him who goes with anothers wife  that enemies spring up
And likewise the false speech he speaks as already demonstrated is his state of a speaker of the illspoken 
This is expressed in terms of hate
and that on the dissolution of the body he reappears in hell is the fruit 
 Were one to go the round of births As much as a hundred thousand aeons
Or even more than that besides Travelling on from womb to womb
Never accepting the Buddhas word Accepting determinations as self
That one shall make an end of pain Is utterly impossible 
when he does so through hate this is simply hate 
and when he does so through delusion this is simply delusion
Where one is demonstrable there  he demonstrates one 
 When a man strays from the True Idea Through will hate fear or else delusion
He finds his good fame wanes away As in its dark half does the moon 
Knowing the right amount in eating Faithful and energetic too
Him Mara sure no more can shake Than can the wind a rocky peak  
Knowing the right amount in eating  is the abandoning of craving for tastes
The basis for nongreed is this 
namely skilled just as it is owing to understanding that he is so described as having understanding and owing to wisdom that he is so described as wise
that he is skilled is the outcome
is the fruit
Best in the world is understanding The kind that deals with penetration 
The kind that rightly understands  The exhaustion of birth and death  
and so it should be quoted for the rest of the four Truths
and that he is taintless 
and the words there is no more of this beyond  refer to knowledge of nonarising
 
It is nongreed nonhate and nondelusion
It is the eight rightnesses  right view  down to  right concentration
and that nongreed moulds the three kinds of action namely the right intention right effort and right concentration this is the outcome of the nongreed
and that it founds right speech right action and right livelihood this is its outcome
both where there are two so shared and where there are three
And happy in himself and concentrated Selfexistence he sundered like a mailcoat 
Herein there are two ideas which as measured are determined namely gratification and disappointment and they are measured as follows   In the case of sensual desires
the gratification is this much
the disappointment is this much  and he understands extinction thus  in the case of this the escape is this 
it is not measured as follows  This is just so much there is not more of it past this point 
and then it is not measured in its wonderfulness by making some jewel reach it 
Herein the actofknowing and actofseeing that give existence to the profitable  are nondelusion
which defilement is not greed and not hate and not delusion
Leaving misconduct by the body Let him pursue good bodily conduct 
And speak what is kind not unkind for the third And speak what is trite and not false for the fourth 
Mental misconduct abandoning Pursuing good conduct in the mind  
Who purifies this triple course of action Will win the path the Seers have divulged 
 Who in a Perfect One has faith Immovable and well established
Herein what is that expressed in terms of the faith faculty
Whose own good virtue is the kind Desired and praised by Noble Ones
With confidence in the Community Whose seeing has been straightened too
Scatter the armies of Mortality As does an elephant a hut of reeds  
If that has been said by the Blessed One sire then it is so
so too Mallika no matter what the recluse Gotama says you applaud it thus
If that has been said by the Blessed One sire then it is so
quote the Thread in detail about the three kinds of confidence due to undergoing
Someone who kills a breathing thing  Three characteristics of a fool 
As much as a hundred thousand aeons  Also whatever monks or divines 
Through will hate fear or else delusion When going on the four bad ways 
Who contemplating ugliness  And ugliness in signs as well 
Should a man love a single creature  Lovingkindness if kept in being 
Best in the world is understanding  Three faculties there are no less 
The root of profit and unprofit  Gives being measured and unmeasured 
When doing profit by the body  And then the three bodily misconducts
The just call best what is well spoken Good kinds of verbal conduct too 
By mind  let there be profit done  Good kinds of mental conduct  too

 THUS have I heardOnce the Lord was staying at Savatthi in Anathapindikas park in the Jeta grove in the Kareri hutment
And among a number of monks who had gathered together after their meal after the almsround sitting in the Kareri pavilion there arose a serious discussion on former lives as they said This is how it was in a former life or That was how it was
 And the Lord with the purified divineear faculty surpassing the powers of humans heard what they were talking about
Getting up from his seat he went to the Kareri pavilion sat down on the prepared seat and said Monks what was your conversation as you sat together What discussion did I interrupt
And they told him
 Well monks would you like to hear a proper discourse on past lives
Lord it is time for that WellFarer it is time for that If the Lord were to give a proper discourse on past lives the monks would listen and remember it
Well then monks listen pay close attention and I will speak
Yes Lord the monks replied
 Monks ninetyone aeons ago the Lord the Arahant the fullyenlightened Buddha Vipassi arose in the world
Thirty one aeons ago the Lord Buddha Sikhi arose
And in this present fortunate aeon the Lords Buddhas Kakusandha
And monks in this present fortunate aeon I too have now arisen in the world as a fullyenlightened Buddha
The Lord Buddha Vipassi was born of Khattiya race and arose in a Khattiya family
The Lord Buddha Vipassi was of the Kondanna clan
In the time of the Lord Buddha Vipassi the lifespan was eighty thousand years
In my time the lifespan is short limited and quick to pass it is seldom that anybody lives to be a hundred
The Lord Buddha Vipassi gained his full enlightenment at the foot of a trumpetflower tree
The Lord Buddha Vipassi had the pair of noble disciples Khanda and Tissa
The Lord Buddha Vipassi had three assemblies of disciples
one of a hundred thousand one of eighty thousand and one of seventy thousand monks
all Arahants
 all Arahants
The Lord Buddha Vipassis personal attendant was the monk Asoka
The Lord Buddha Vipassis father was King Bandhuma
The Lord Buddha Sikhis father was King Arana
The Lord Buddha Vessabhus father was King Suppatlta
The Lord Buddha Kakusandhas father was the Brahmin Aggidatta
his mother was the Brahmin lady Visakha
The Lord Buddha Konagamanas father was the Brahmin Yannadatta
The king at that time was Sobha
The Lord Buddha Kassapas father was the Brahmin Brahmadatta
The king at that time was Kiki
And now monks my father was King Suddhodana my mother was Queen Maya and the royal capital was Kapilavatthu
Thus the Lord spoke and the WellFarer then rose from his seat and went to his lodging
the way he recalls past Buddhas who have gained Parinibbana having cut away the hindrances cut off the road of craving put an end to the round of becoming overcome all suffering He recalls their birth their name their clan their lifespan the disciples and assemblies connected with him Being bom thus these Blessed Lords were suchandsuch such were their names their clans their discipline their Dhamma their wisdom their liberation
Well now friends how did the Tathagata come by the penetrative knowledge through which he remembers all this  Did some deva reveal this knowledge to him
This was the conversation of those monks which came to be interrupted
Then the Lord rising from the seclusion of the restperiod went to the Kareri pavilion and sat down on the prepared seat
He said Monks what was your conversation as you sat together What discussion did I interrupt
And the monks told him
The Tathagata understands these thingsby his own penetration of the principles of Dhamma and devas too have told him
Well monks do you wish to hear still more about past lives
 Lord it is time for that WellFarer it is time for that If the Lord were to give a proper discourse on past lives the monks would listen and remember it
Well then monks listen pay close attention and I will speak
Yes Lord the monks replied

Herein what is Investigation of Threads
A Thread is thoroughly scrutinized as to the profitable and unprofitable ideas there according to consecutivity thus 
 How then did he instigate this Thread in its beginning   etc  Is it construable with those Threads that are fully agreed upon  or is it not so construable
According as the Blessed one teaches defilement there in the beginning 
it should be scrutinized as follows How then is the abandoning of those defilements taught there too or is it not taught 
If it is not taught then the profitable ideas which bring about the abandoning of those defilements must be sought in the kind of divine life lived under the Blessed One 
If in searching one does not find where those unprofitable ideas come to their abandonment
then those unprofitable ideas must be reserved  and inquired into further taking the type of Thread in this case to be that Dealing with Corruption where no profit is explicitly taught
So wherever on the level of any one of the four paths any defilements come to their abandonment any defilements so far not construable as opposites of noble ideas there in that particular plane say that of Seeing must be reserved  If when they are thus reserved they give the construction
still that Thread must be inquired into herein in regard to those defilements as follows
Or even if not capable of being demonstrated in thls way still the Thread need not on that account alone be the object of uncertainty 
Whatever the defilements as to how they are abandonable
Just as in the case of the first statement   namely that of defilements coming first now again any noble ideas taught for the abandoning of any defilements must be investigated as to whether they are abandoned by these particular noble ideas or not
If when so scrutinized they are construable then they can be accepted as such 
For noble ideas do not arrive at the abandonment of defilements that are future  to them Neither does any noble idea alone indiscriminately bring about the abandoning of all defilements
As for example while loving kindness is profitable and lust unprofitable yet taking loving kindness as profitable does not bring about the abandoning of lust it is in fact ill will not lust that comes to abandonment by means of lovingkindness
So both sorts of defilement have to be scrutinized
If these namely ill will and lust in this case  are construed when reserved then there is nothing more to be scrutinized
Either the two defilements may be abandonable by the one noble idea  or else either one of the two defilements may be abandonable by two noble ideas successively
Or alternatively also when only one on being scrutinized is construed herein it must be inquired into how it is construed namely by which noble idea or it must be inquired into why it is that the Thread cannot  be demonstrated  for no Thread must remain an object of uncertainty 
Any defilements lapse  when any noble ideas that are taught must be scrutinized in both the ways indicated above for lovingkindness as follows
Or conversely do these noble ideas lead to the abandonment of these defilements
still not all unprofitable ideas come to abandonment indiscriminately by means of any profitable ideas indiscriminately
nor simply by taking a profitable idea in a given Thread  in this case lovingkindness does that lead to the abandonment of all defilements indiscriminately
In fact it is only when a noble idea belonging to a particular Thread is a defilements opposite that that defilement comes to be abandoned by means of that noble idea
Herein when the profitable taught in a particular verse or proseexposition in the Thread and the corruptions taught there do not construe or the noble ideas do not construe  these should be reserved in accordance with the parts of the formula for scrutinizing demonstrable in the Principal Appeals to Authority 
Herein if with the defilements taught and with that noble idea among the noble ideas those defilements do come to abandonment
For there is one defilement abandonable by only one  noble idea not in any other way while view and lust  are abandonable by Seeing in the first Path not so ignorance which is only abandonable by Arahantship
And if ignorance or ideas belonging to the plane of KeepinginBeing ie the last three paths and second and third fruits are abandonable in this way regarded collectively under KeepinginBeing
it is precisely that ignorance which belongs to the further side fetters which is abandoned through the kind of nonattention that is due to the deliverances signless heartconcentration for the purpose of seeing the undetermined
That is how the Thread should be scrutinized in order to verify that it is 
When defilements are of the kind abandonable by Seeing then the noble idea is taught in the mood of Seeing when they are of the kind abandonable by KeepinginBeing then the noble idea is taught in the mood of KeepinginBeing When of the kind abandonable  by right use of the four requisites of the bhikkhus life then the noble idea is taught in the mood of right use  and so on from those abandonable by removal down to the end of the Thread dealing with the seven kinds of taints  which can be quoted
In so far as this defilement idea is abandonable in the various other stages than that of Seeing the noble idea will be appropriately taught in another mood and so that noble idea must be sought otherwise according to the mood
If this defilementidea gives the construing  for one when one is seeking it thus then in whichever mood that noble idea can be sought out that is the mood in which the particular defilement is abandoned
And so that noble idea must be scrutinized therein with respect to the seven moods mentioned above 
and in so far as it is construable it can be accepted
but in so far as it is not construable it cannot be accepted   which is demonstrable according to the prescribed way of searching in the Principal Appeals to Authority What is taught by the Blessed One is according to how things are  Whatever the idea taught profitable as well as unprofitable that ideas condition must be sought out 
for no idea arises unconditioned without a condition
Herein what is the mood for the search
Herein this Thread to be sought must be inqired into as to whether this  idea in question has been stated with the cause and with the condition appropriate thereto
And the condition is of three kinds slight medium and outstanding
When the condition is slight what is unoutstanding  owing to it must be sought
What is the reason
It may be that a certain condition  comes to occurrence  or fulfilment through other conditions
Herein whatever the idea taught in this Thread that is being scrutinized the cause of that must be sought either through that idea or through a Pathfunction
And like the condition the outcome of that idea must be sought by cause and by condition
That condition should be sought in the way that one seeks how the basic state was demonstrated  in the terms of expression of the particular Thread 
for there is no slight idea that has an outstanding outcome nor  does any outstanding outcome have a slight conditionidea If  the slight is construable of the slight  the medim of the medium and the outstanding of the outstanding that can be accepted But if  it does not so construe it cannot be accepted
And whatever idea the Blessed One instigates initially in order to teach a particular teaching that he teaches also in the middle and the end of it  he demonstrates in the beginning the idea  according as it is given in the terms of expression of that particular teaching and only that idea appears much in it and is that Threads end
for it is in virtue of that idea that that Thread comes to be such as it is in type whether verse or proseexposition whether small or large  But as the fixing  is twofold namely fixing that is in conformity as well as fixing the actual teaching
And just as the restraining of the five faculties of the eye etc taught by the Blessed One in having for its purpose the curbing of craving
teaches that that idea conveys his wish  as  in the simile of the Cattleherd Thread in the Anguttara  when tested also by means of other Threads that the Blessed One has uttered namely the thought  in the Majjhima Nikaya  it conveys his wish This is what is in conformity with the Blessed Ones teaching So this idea has to be sought also in other proseexpositions 
for it cannot be regarded as sought out in only a single Thread
When it construes it can be accepted
Herein what is the agreed 
When any Thread whatever is not uttered by the Blessed One and that Thread is found among the Threads too
That Thread must be inquired into as follows   How then does this Thread allow of the Blessed Ones agreement or does it not allow of his agreement And some Threads allow of the Blessed Ones agreement  and some Threads do not allow of his agreement
When someone teaches what is the Ten Powered Ones  province doing so altogether without giving a way of entry to the main ideas in his teaching  that Thread does not allow of the Blessed Ones agreement 
But there is also the kind of hearer who knows the Ten Powered Ones province doing so either limitedly or unlimitedly yet he does not know that power itself at all beyond the hearing of it as for instance in the case of the divine exhorted by the venerable Sariputta Now that venerable one had no Knowledge of Variety in Faculties and Powers  hence by his not knowing the Encompassing of Other Persons while the divine had more he could still have done ie by attaining the Noble Path he was made to reappear after death in the world of High Divinity and so the venerable Sariputta was not congratulated by the Blessed One 
And as for instance in the case of the venerable MahaKassapa  when he advised his nephew  though he the nephew was possessed of unprofitable action ripening straightway upon rebirth  the Elder lighting a finger by a feat of supernormal power   but since no  knowledge of how things are by cause and instance in the case of all Undertaking of Action existed in that venerable one hence the Blessed One  advised him saying
 Even o Kassapa if thou Wilt carry ten such luminaries
And again like a messenger who informs a creature of the kings word so the mere emulator  teaches to others speech he does not himself understand
A Thread which has the agreed approval can be accepted 
that which has not the agreed approval cannot be accepted
Herein what is MixingUp of Threads
If one type would requite he teaches another and he demonstrates in one type of Thread the meaning of another type of Thread
Or he demonstrates a Threads meaning  in several moods 
He demonstrates  in those dealing with Seeing the meaning of one dealing with Morality
He demonstrates in the furtherside fetters the meaning of higherside fetters
He demonstrates in Threads dealing with outstanding faculties  the meaning of those dealing with blunt and medim faculties 
So this Thread is thus broken up by him The breaking up as to cause outcome and fruit as to the blunt medium and outstanding state  and as to meaning and phrasing is what is called MixingUp of Threads
The nonbreakingup is what is called  Investigation of Threads 
Herein this is a mnemonic verse 
The Elder MahaKaccayanas
If when the defilements or any one of themare thus reserved they still do not give the construing then the ideas belonging to the noble paths must be scrutinized as follows  Do these particular defilements come to abandonment in these particular planes namely those of Seeing and KeepinginBeing or do they not  
Now a certain specific number of defilements may be taught eg the ten fetters
without any correspondingly equal number of noble ideas being taught eg the four paths
Do two or three or more  defilements come to their abandonment by means of any single Path
If when thus inquired into they give the construction then that Thread must be scrutinized therein in regard to those defilements as follows
What is the Threads meaning and what is not its meaning according to the traditional interpretation or by what is given in the texts
rather it should be further investigated according as to whether the iaeas in the beginning are profitable instead of unprofitable 
 they must be scrutinized
whether the profitable comes first or whether it is arrived at through its opposites coming first The teaching must be taken as having nothing lacking or superfluous
but if they are not so construable then any defilements that are not opposites of those particular noble ideas cannot be opposed to them
and any idea so disclosed whether profitable or unprofitable must be reserved
It seems that these  particular defilements are taught in this verse or proseexposition How then are these defilements abandoned by these noble ideas or are they not
For although unprofitable ideas do come to abandonment by means of profitable ideas
As for example while lovingkindness is profitable and lust unprofitable yet taking lovingkindness as profitable and lust as unprofitable lust does not come to abandonment by means of lovingkindness  it is in fact ill will not lust that comes  to abandonment by means of loving kindness 
Consequently defilement does not come  to abandonment in a given Thread simply by taking it as  defilement indiscriminately
then it should also be scrutinized as follows
 In which Pathfunction are these defilements abandonable In which Pathfunction  are these noble ideas taught
In whichever mood that is as Seeing or as one of the stages of KeepinginBeing the noble ideas are taught that is the aspect in which this defilement stands in relation thereto
Then if it still does not construe the meaning of the actual Thread itself which is being sought out by means of that already tested other Thread must be inquired into
Herein when the condition is slight the idea conditioned must be taken as slight That being so  this condition is again of two kinds condition in remote relation and condition in immediate proximity 
the fixing of that idea must also be sought as to whether it is in conformity  with other Threads
then according as it is uttered by whomsoever it may be so it should be borne in mind 
Not even then will he see forms  That eye does not exist in him 
The Thread is fivefold the type of Thread Dealing with Corruption the type of Thread Dealing with Morality the type of Thread Dealing with Seeing the type of Thread Dealing with KeepinginBeing and the type of Thread Dealing with the Adept 
and in the establishing of the particular noble idea taught there he divulges  a meaning not there

his mother was Queen Bandhumati
and King Bandhumas royal capital was Bandhumati
his mother was Queen Pabhavati
King Arunas capital was Arunavatl
his mother was Queen Yasavafi
King Suppatltas capital was Anopama
The king at that time was called Khema
his capital was Khemavatl
his mother was the Brahmin lady Uttara
his capital was Sobhavat
his mother was the Brahmin lady Dhanavati
his capital was Varanasi
Soon after the Lord had gone another discussion arose among the monks It is marvellous friends it is wonderful the Tathagatas great power and ability 
and the Lord said
one of six million eight hundred thousand one of a hundred thousand and one of eighty thousand monks all Arahants
his mother was Queen Bandhumati
And so monks the Bodhisatta Vipassi descended from the Tusita heaven mindful and clearly aware into his mothers womb
This monks is the rule
It is the rule monks that when a Bodhisatta descends from the Tusita heaven into his mothers womb
And whatever dark spaces lie beyond the worlds end chaotic blind and black such that they are not even reached by the mighty rays of sun and moon are yet illumined by this immeasurable splendid light surpassing the glory of the most powerful devas
And those beings that have been reborn there recognise each other by this light and know Other beings too have been bom here
And this tenthousandfold worldsystem trembles and quakes and is convulsed
And this immeasurable light shines forth
That is the rule
It is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mothers womb four devas come to protect him from the four quarters saying Let no man no nonhuman bei no thing whatever harm this Bodhisatta or this Bodhisattas mother
That is the rule
It is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mothers womb his mother becomes by nature virtuous refraining from taking life from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from lying speech or from strong drink and slothproducing drugs
That is the rule
It is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mothers womb she has no sensual thoughts connected with a man and she cannot be overcome by any man with lustful thoughts
That is the rule
It is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mothers womb she enjoys the fivefold pleasures of the senses
That is the rule
It is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mothers womb she has no sickness of any kind
Monks it is as if a gem a beryl pure excellent well cut into eight facets clear bright flawless and perfect in every respect
And a man with good eyesight taking it in his hand would describe it as such
Thus does the Bodhisattas mother with no sickness see him complete with all his members and faculties
That is the rule
It is the rule that the Bodhisattas mother dies seven days after his birth and is reborn in the Tusita heaven
It is the rule that whereas other women carry the child in their womb for nine or ten months before giving birth
That is the rule
It is the rule that whereas other women give birth sitting or lying down
That is the rule
It is the rule that when the Bodhisatta issues from his mothers womb devas welcome him first and then humans
That is the rule
It is the rule that when the Bodhisatta issues from his mothers womb he does not touch the earth Four devas receive him and place him before his mother saying Rejoice Your Majesty a mighty son has been born to you
That is the rule
It is the rule that when the Bodhisatta issues from his mothers womb he issues forth stainless not defiled by water mucus blood or any impurity pure and spotless
Just as when a jewel is laid on muslin from Kasi the jewel does not stain the muslin or the muslin the jewel
Why not
Be cause of the purity of both
In the same way the Bodhisatta issues forth stainless
It is the rule that when the Bodhisatta issues forth from his mothers womb two streams of water appear from the sky one cold the other warm with which they ritually wash the Bodhisatta and his mother
That is the rule
It is the rule that as soon as he is bom the Bodhisatta takes a firm stance on both feet facing north then takes seven strides and under a white sunshade he scans the four quarters and then declares with a bulllike voice I am chief in the world supreme in the world eldest in the world This is my last birth there will be no more rebecoming
That is the rule
It is the rule that when the Bodhisatta issues from his mothers womb there appears in this world an immeasurable splendid light 
This is the rule
there appears in this world with its devas maras and Brahmas its ascetics and Brahmins princes and people an immeasurable splendid light surpassing the glory of the most powerful devas
and takes delight being endowed and possessed of them
she is at ease and without fatigue of body and she can see the Bodhisatta inside her womb complete with all his members and faculties
were strung on a blue yellow red white or orange cord
That is the rule
it is not so with the Bodhisattas mother who carries him for exactly ten months before giving birth
it is not so with the Bodhisattas mother who gives birth standing up
That is the rule
whose father diedwhose brother diedwhose sister diedwhose son diedwhose daughter diedwhose wife died
whom she did not want
whom I do not want
Herein what is the Separate Treatment of the Modes of Conveying
Where the sixteen Modes of Conveying a Communication are separately handled according to the letter
Here is a verse for it Profit Unprofit All Truths or but one part of Truths
Inquiring thus into a Thread This Mode it is Conveys a Teaching
As shown in the presentation of Noble Truth  there are four Truths shared and unshared 
These are the eighteen terms  As to Suffering there are in brief the seven terms with bodily and mental pain association with the loathed dissociation from the loved and the three characteristics of the determined 
Herein the three characteristics of the determined are the three kinds of painfulness  Arisingasacharacteristicof thedetermined is a painfulness in virtue of the painfulnessin determinations  subsidence asacharacteristicofthedetermined is a painfulness in virtue of the painfilnessinchange  alteration ofwhatissteadyasacharacteristicofthedetermined is a pain fulness in virtue of the painfulnessaspain  As to the three feelingplanes of these three characteristics of the determined neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling is arisingasa characteristicofthedetermined  and is a painfulness in virtue of the painfulnessindeterminations Pleasant feeling is subsidenceas acharacteristicofthedetermined and is a painfulness in virtue of the painfulnessaschange Painful feeling is alterationofwhatis steadyasacharacteristicofthedetermined and is a painfulness in virtue of the painfulnessaspain  So suffering can be sought for in these sixteen terms that is in these nine  terms and in the previous seven  Also a characteristic of suffering is demonstrated in the Book of Demonstrations by eleven kinds of painfulness 
Also the fifteen terms namely  Birth has the characteristic of causing to be manifest  down to  Deceaseand Reappearance has the characteristic of decease and manifestation can be quoted in detail  So this Truth is taught and is taught how it comes to be thus  shared and unshared Threads in the seven and in the ten  terms  and in the fiftyfold  Pattern of the Dispensation   and in the eighteenfold   Terms of Expression of the Thread   and in the tenfold   Testings of the Thread  and in the sixteenfold Modes of Conveying  and in the twentyonefold Investigation Inquiry 
This is called the Mode of Conveying a Teaching
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying an Investigation
 Term  questions  asking  what before What after
 Term  first the term
When the Blessed One was asked by the venerable Ajita that can be taken thus how many terms  are asked about Like what The verse  How many terms are these Four So much is the asking for an answer
The terms are answered by the Blessed One with the same number of terms as in the asking and these are the explaining of the terms This is what is called  term 
One or two or more than that  These four terms are one question   for the phrasing is subordinate to the meaning  Although the terms are several the meaning he asks about is only one
That these four terms are subordinate is due to the phrasing the question being only one
For with the term  Tell what is the world shut in by   he asks with reference to the world And with the terms And whereby is it not displayed And what is it besmeared with Say he asks about the same world and with the term
And what will be its greatest fear   he asks about that same world
That is how the phrasing is subordinate to the meaning and how the question is only one Now question is of four kinds declarable unilaterally declarable after analysis declarable by asking a counterquestion and unacceptable 
Herein when it is asked Is the eye impermanent  that is declarable unilaterally in the affirmative When it is asked Is what is impermanent painful that is declarable after analysis  for there is what is impermanent and not an eye and also the bases that are not the eyebase are also impermanent not only the eye This is what is declarable after analysis When it is asked  Does the eye guide  the eye faculty   that is declarable by asking a counterquestion When it is asked  Is that eye a Perfect One   that is an unacceptable question
and likewise Is a Perfect One apart from the eye
This is questions   As to what the Blessed One is asked  he is asked about the worlds corruption
For what reason 
Because corruption is of three kinds corruption by craving corruption by view and corruption by misconduct 
Herein with the reply  he teaches ignorance By  hankering  he teaches craving By  greatest fear  he teaches ripening of unprofitable action What the Blessed One answers is this That such kind of ripening of action as is experienceable as pleasure shall be experienceable as pain no such instance is found  When it was said by the Blessed One with four terms namely  By ignorance is the world shut in  
then it was asked further  in which he asks four terms and the Blessed One answers it with two terms as follows 
 Whatever streams are in the world They are shut off by mindfulness
What is this that is asked   What is asked about is the cleansing of that corrupted world  The streams are the  which are demonstrated in the plural in virtue of all the six external bases
With the question  What is it that shuts off the streams he asks about the abandoning of obsession With the question  Whereby is it that streams are sealed  he asks about eradication of underlying tendencies 
Herein the Blessed One teaches by way of mindfulness in the six doors for when someone abides aware with mindfulness as doorkeeper his faculties beginning with that of the eye are  guarded
Herein the faculties being guarded when there is any insight that conduces to the complete abandonment of any streams and of that ignorance  whereby the world is shut in
That is how the streams are sealed off  After that he asked further
  having come in order to ask  the Blessed One where nameandform is set at rest The Blessed One answered these four terms with one term
  As to the question that you ask Ajim I shall tell you now
With cessation of consciousness Tis here that this is set at rest  
What does he ask with this question
He asks about  the element of extinction without trace left The Blessed One answered him with the element of extinction without trace left
Herein with the first question he asks about corruption
There are these Masters of ideas  And several Initiates here
Now how many questions are these They are those about the Arahant Masters of ideas and about the  Initiates 
  What is before what after  the meaning is this 
Herein which does he ask about first and which last
He asks about the Arahant first
and about the ideas of the Initiate with the corresponding term The Arahants are referred to by the phrase Masters of ideas while the Initiates are referred to by the phrase the several
With the phrase You have skill to tell me their  he asks the Blessed One a term shared in common with both
Now shared and unshared questions can be asked of him
The Blessed One sometimes as in this case answers such questions
not in the same order as that in which the questions are asked Here he answers afterwards what was asked first
And what is this that he asked  He asks this What is the behaviour of those already purified and of those still being purified  That is answerable as follows   Sensual desires he would not want
He would be undisturbed in mind     Here the Blessed One shuts off the obsessions produced by the thought of sensual desires but  there is also the obsession due to disturbedness by the other two kinds of thoughts namely those of ill will and cruelty as demonstrated among the inshuttings 
With the phrase Skilled  in all ideas he answers about the Arahant asked about first
Now as to the verse beginning  these are four terms in the whole verse
The questions are four too
What is the reason It is because here the phrasing is not subordinate to the meaning  like Ajitas first question  where the answers were not unilaterally plural since the questions there though plural in phrasing were only one in meaning  Also while in the first Ajita question the fourth was answered after he had already asked the other three questions and had been answered it is not so here since here it is a seeking out how things come to be and accordingly one seeks the answers  as to how things come to be doing so by the termconnexion
As to the question  which he asks here again  in this way herein this is simply  a mood of the questioning   Now the verse  beginning  must be traced out by means of the answer to this question
How is it answered Herein the Blessed One answers with the
Herein keeping a pure heart in being is quiet while keeping understanding in being  is insight
Herein he infers as follows  The inner tangle and the outer tangle are any ideas abandoned by means of quiet and insight
As to the answer herein lust is abandoned by means of quiet and ignorance is abandoned by means of insight
The lust which has what is in oneself for its ground is the  inner tangle  while the lust which has what is external for its ground is the  outer tangle 
And the embodimentview with what is in oneself for its ground is the  inner tangle 
while the sixtyone  types of view with what is external for their ground are the outer tangle In fact whatever due to lust and to viewtype will exist there regarding what is in oneself and what is external this is the tangle
So in brief any craving and view whatever with what is in oneself for their ground are the  inner tangle 
And according as a deity asked the Blessed One there is the verse 
Herein the Blessed One answered with the verse    What the Blessed One answers with is the Way Leading to Cessation of Suffering
With this answer the Blessed One infers the defilements here from what is demonstrable by the first verse
For either the  four wheels  are the four hands and feet
and the  nine doors  are the nine bodily orifices
or else  the  four wheels are the four assumingsand with assuming as condition being  with cessation of assuming cessation of being 
Full of associated greed is lust for the five strands of sensual desire
Herein it is  the tie  that is answered by craving
and the trace by conceit Evil greed for wishes is lust for the five strands of sensual desire
Herein it is  he demonstrates as  evil 
 Craving with its root   is  Expelling  is the abandoning of the craving rooted in unknowing and of view
And again any other ideas leading to the roundabout whatever that construe  for that same reason in association with the four wheels  can all be demonstrated
So  this verseanswer agrees with the question
 Now if there is any recapitulation with a summary then this Investigation becomes an inquiry into a paraphrasingverse together with its proseexposition that it recapitulates and this in order to see whether the Blessed One paraphrases in verse as many terms as he presents in the proseexposition
For example  
Now these eight meaningterms presented here in this proseexposition
the Blessed One paraphrases in verse by six terms  as follows 
He is undismayed when come before A parliament assembly
He does not lose his thread of Speech He does not hide his missions aim
He can expound views not his own When questioned he is undisturbed 
 and the paraphrasingverse  can be quoted in detail This where seven terms are presented in the prose the Blessed One paraphrases in verse by seven terms
So sometimes the verseparaphrases with more when the presentation in the prose has fewer terms or when the prose presentation has more terms he verseparaphrases with fewer
This is what was called  and a verseparaphrases investigation   This is the Mode of Conveying an Investigation
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Construing
In the case of the Threads Conveyings Plane resort outcome
Such inquiry as  Does this question construe or does it not construe in the Threads  is Construing
Now what  is the cause what is the condition for that path  There are four  causes and four conditions for the Virtue Category of the Path
 waiting on True Men and living in befitting places are a condition through assumptive conditionality
 When there is any old appropriate action its ripening is a condition And through that same conditionality  there is right direction in selfguidance which is a cause 
So the Paths Virtue Category has a cause and has a condition This is virtue belonging to worlds
But as to virtue dissociated from worlds that has three faculties as condition namely the faith faculty the energy faculty and the concentration faculty These are a condition
The mindfulness faculty and the understanding faculty are a cause
and also the virtue of the fruit of StreamEntry Hence these faculties are the cause these are the condition
Since moreover the tranquillity and happiness  and  gladness  are a condition for concentration
and since the  pleasure  is a cause hence the Concentration Category of the Path has a cause and has a condition
And since one who is concentrated understands how things are this is understanding
For that anothers utterance and reasoned attention in oneself are the cause and the condition  So these three categories of the Path have a cause and have a condition
Inquiry thus Does this construe or does it not construe in regard to Threads concerning what is declarable unilaterally or after analysis or by a counterquestion  
is the Mode of Conveying a Construing
And that Mode of Conveying can also be seen in the four Principal Appeals to Authority 
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Footings
The five faculties beginning with the eye are a footing for lust for form
The mind facultyis a footing for lust for being
The five categories beginning with form are a footing for the embodimentview
The sixtyone  types of view are a footing for lust for views
The sensualdesire element is a footing for lust for sensual desires
The formless element is a footing for lust for the formless
Perception of pleasure is a footing for lust for sensual desires
Perception of ill will is a footing for ill will
Unawareness is a footing for confusion
The nine grounds for annoyance are a footing for ill will
The nine positions of conceit  are a footing for conceit
Pleasant feeling is a footing for the underlying tendency to lust
Painful feeling is a footing for the underlying tendency to resistance
Neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling is a footing for the underlying tendency to ignorance 
Selftheory assuming and false speech are a footing for greed
Killing breathing things and malicious speech and harsh speech are a footing for ill will
Wrongness and gossip are a footing for delusion
Inequality in existence and in property is a footing for Imaking
Appropriation of external objects is a footing for mymaking
Bodily crookedness is a footing for view
Bodily fault is a footing for hate 
Bodily coloration is a footing for greed
Or in fact when any  idea arises by means of any object whether the idea is expressed in terms of creatures  or expressed in terms of ideas  its footing is accordingly 
Just as when a man  finds a  footing for his foremost foot he raises his second foot and brings it forward past that foot
but if he  finds no footing for his second foot he does not  raise the other foot
since there is no condition for it
so too an idea whether profitable or unprofitable or undeclared does not occur when it finds no footing
owing to  nonobtainment  of a reason for the idea so  produced This is called the Mode of Conveying Footings
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Characteristics
When one idea is mentioned all Ideas of like characteristic
Are by that mentioned  here abides The Mode Conveying Characteristics
For example when in the verse  mindfulness occupied with the body is mentioned then mindfulness occupied with feelings with cognizance and with ideas are also mentioned by the single Fonndation of Mindfulnesss representing all four Foundations of Mindfulness  
for cognizance does not occur in only a single Steadyingpoint for consciousness  it occurs in the different ways simultaneously so when mindfulness occupied with the body is mentioned then that occupied with feelings with cognizance and with ideas is mentioned as well
For it is not that when mindfulness occupied with the body is kept in being then the rest of the four Fonndations of Mindfulness do not  come to fulfilment by keeping in being
So when any among like ideas  are mentioned then all those ideas with that same general characteristic are mentioned
Again in the verse And purifying ones own heart This is the Buddhas Dispensation ideas concomitant with cognizance are mentioned And when heart  is mentioned form is also mentioned
This is the nameandform that is the Noble Truth of Suffering
Consequently in the purifying of ones own heart  what one purifies is Suffering
what one purifies by is the Path
what one purifies from is origin and  the purifying is Cessation
Again  Herein the conascent feeling perception choice contact and attention  are ideas with a single general characteristic in virtue of the characteristic of assuming
He who  finds dispassion in form finds dispassion in feeling and he also finds dispassion in perception determinations and consciousness
So when any one of those ideas that have a single general characteristic is demonstrated all the rest of those ideas with that same general characteristic are demonstrated too This is called the Mode of Conveying Characteristics
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold Array
 Language by way of phrasing Purport The Teachings Source and
 Herein what is Language How is that to be seen
According as it is said by the Blessed One  
What is taught past future and present
He  looks that Thread over as to phrasing and as to languageskill for the correctness or incorrectness of the Threads language thus This should be inflected  thus
This is called Skill in Language
 Herein what is Skill in Purport
It is skill in knowing how a section of a Thread taught comes to be taught by the Blessed One with this particular intent 
Like what  As follows 
What is the Blessed Ones Purport here
It is that those who wish  for coolness  will abide diligent This is the purport here 
Again   No one turns back time for devotion and while Feelings there are not yet overwhelming let one keep in being
What is the Blessed Ones Purport here
This is the Blessed Ones purport here
So the Purport in what is taught by verse or by proseexposition is the establishment  that through such a Thread one practises an idea in accordance with the True Idea This is what is called the Teachings purport
 Herein what is ConsecutiveSequence 
Since in a verse or in prose  Threads the terms are multiple  in this way or in that the preceding terms and the subsequent terms belonging to such  verse or prose Threads must be taken together
That sequence is known  as to its consecutivity as follows 
When one verse in two or three  is embarked upon for search the meaning of the verse spoken  as one part thereof is  yet undemonstrated owing to some verses being still not spoken   what is still to be said  must be compared with that
So while he who is searching has doubts about the search  that person has still  to search further in another of the descriptions still unspoken  
This is what is called sequence by consecutivity
Skill   Skill in source as circumstance
 skill in the teachings purport
Herein when a verse is searched for that in order to obtain the source etc
the meaning does not have to be demonstrated separately since skill in sources as circumstances is skill in meanings When the meaning  is being sought out by means of these four terms it is sought out according to how it is
And then all  that is either the source as circumstance or the purport the language as phrasing and the sequence  is in consecutivity when not a conclusion That is how it can be taught as to the Threads meaning
This is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold Array
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Conversion
The Mode that when there is one footing Seeks out the footing that remains
Like what For example the verse  
This  negligence what is it the footing for
Now the relinquishment of profitable ideas what is that the footing for
Using unprofitable ideas what is that the footing for
So in the case of negligence  while it is view that sides  with delusion it is craving  that sides with will and lust
The craving and the view herein are the four taints  the craving is the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being while the view  is the taint of views and the taint of ignorance
Herein the view that there is self  in cognizance is the taint of views  and that there is permanence in the concomitants of cognizance is the taint of ignorance   the taint of sensual desire is due to bias  towards sensual desires and the taint of being consists in clutching at reappearance
while the namebody is a footing for the taint of views and the taint of ignorance
Herein the characteristic of the taint of sensual desire is any sticking to and bias  towards the external five bases adhered to
The characteristic of the taint of being is the determining of a physical or mental body by aspiration ties and determinative acts  The characteristic of the taint of views is insistence and misapprehension
The characteristic of the taint of ignorance is nonpenetration of the four Truths and unawareness of ideas
These four taints are the four assumings 
the taint of sensual desire is sensualdesireassuming the taint of being is beingassuming the taint of views is viewassuming and the taint of ignorance is selftheoryassuming  With these four assumings there are the five categories
Herein the taint of views  can be abandoned in cognizance it is abandoned in one contemplating cognizance as cognizance
The taint of ignorance  can be abandoned in ideas it is abandoned in one contemplating ideas as ideas
The taint of being can be abandoned in clutching at reappearance it is abandoned in one contemplating feelings as feelings
The taint of sensual desire can be abandoned in the five strands of sensual desire  it is abandoned in one contemplating the body as a body
Herein contemplation of the body belongs with the Noble Truth of Suffering
Contemplation of feelings since the condition for the five affective facultiesfor the pleasure faculty pain faculty joy faculty grief faculty and onlookingequanimity facultyis the approach thereto by craving as creatures defilement belongs therefore with the Noble Truth of Origin
Contemplation of cognizance belongs with Cessation
Contemplation of ideas belongs with the Path
And by this seeing of his in the four instances all his taints are abandoned which  were earlier demonstrated thus And for the proud the negligent their taints increase  
One seeks profitable  ideas in the sense opposite to the unprofitable and to like extent One converts by the abandoning  of these defilements
Herein the plane of the Mode of Conveying a Conversion is this Mindfulness and its four Foundations  and their opposites the four Perversions and the four kinds of knowledge of the four Truths the way leading to arising of embodiment and the way leading to cessation of embodiment
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying an Analysis
Anything at all that is  declarable after analysis  is called the Mode of Conveying an Analysis
Like what   this being in no way the kind of question for further questioning This is called the Mode of Conveying an Analysis
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Reversal
Any demonstration of an opposite is called the Mode of Conveying a Reversal
according as it is said by the Blessed One  which can be quoted in detail in regard to all the remaining pathfactors
This is called the Mode of Conveying a Reversal
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Synonyms
Displayed by many synonyms So synonyms this Mode conveys
As for example when the venerable Siriputta was praised in one instance namely that of understanding by the Blessed One with variously stated synonyms thus   These are synonyms for understanding
And as for example the meaning of outlet in the Magga Vibhanga  where each pathfactor is demonstrated by synonyms
So too the synonyms for ignorance
which is one of the unprofitable roots and which while it remains that same unprofitable root people understand by means of this or that synonym in such and such countries 
In the passage  sensual desires are called by that synonym for them
In the passage  he calls  those same sensual desires  mire  
In the passage  those same sensual desires he calls   dirt 
So when any such idea is taught in the Thread  thus the search is as follows  What  idea is this a name for 
This is the Mode of Conveying Synonyms
When he demonstrates a Thread thus  that is a description in terms of presentation
Description in terms of origin is as follows 
If there is will and there is lust  for physical nutriment  down to  a standingpoint
By  he describes a description in terms of abandoning
Now by the verse  he describes craving by a description in terms of the agreeable 
but with a description in terms of the agreeable thus it is still the same one idea the Blessed One describes 
for while taking it that craving is the origin of suffering nevertheless craving is not demonstrable as origin in every instance as for example in the passage
  which is a description in terms of rejection
So for all ideas both profitable and unprofitable  And whatever is a particular ideas own field it is only  that idea that occurs there
For this description is of two kinds descriptionintermsof dependenceonanother and descriptionintermsofselfdependence
What is the description in terms of selfdependence
 Bkikkhus keep concentration in beingOne who is concentrated  understands how it is 
 Form is impermanent   that is how he understands how it is   this is a description in terms of selfdependence  when applied to the concentration category And that  description is also a description in terms of dependence onanother when applied to the associated Pathcategories of understanding and virtue As for example in the passage 
while that statement has the concentration faculty outstanding the other four faculties are blunt and they in fact are dependentonanother with respect to that concentration In the case of the three  kinds of confidence due to undergoing which are faiths field the concentration faculty is dependentonanother namely faith In the case of the four Truths the four faculties of faith energy mindfulness and concentration are dependent onanother  namely understanding and the understanding faculty which has the Truths for its field is then not dependentonanother In the case of the Foundations of Mindfullness the mindfulness faculty  is not dependentonanother and in the case of the Right Endeavours the energy faculty is not
So when any idea has selfdependence in its own footing and its own field  that idea should be described with respect thereto
The counteraction of it can be demonstrated from its opposite
Here in this Mode of Conveying description has many moods which is why this idea is described thus
This is called Description
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Ways of Entry
In what six
There is no Thread whether verse or proseexposition
that does not exhibit one or other of these  six ideas
For the whole extent of the Teaching  is about either the Categories or the Bases or the Faculties  or the Truths or Dependent Arising  Herein it is the feeling category that among the five categories is the footing for lust hate and delusion
Herein there are three kinds of feeling in that feeling category wherein the pleasant feeling has the approach with joy the painful has the approach with grief and the neitherpainfulnorpleasant has the approach with onlookingequanimity
Again whatever is felt there among these three kinds of feeling is the Truth of Suffering   Now as to the determinations category among the categories herein a body occurs for one  who has acted negligently And that negligent action is included among determinations  and action is a way of entry to the factors of being  in two ways And the three kinds of determinationsdeterminative acts of merit determinative acts of demerit and determinative acts of imperturbability are a rootcause for all kinds of personalities with lust though not for the lustfree  And likewise the determinative acts of hate It is one not without lust who  chooses and determinatively acts   it is one without lust  who cc neither  chooses nor determinatively acts  
Just as a hot thunderbolt falling on a log or a tree or elsewhere splits and burns it so does choice with lust choose and determinatively act as a cold  thunderbolt neither splits nor burns it so lustfree choice neither chooses nor determinatively acts
Herein there is one among the five categories which belongs to the kind of physical frame without faculties namely the perception category
Herein when the ten elements having form are being taught the form category can be demonstrated which is the Noble Truth of Suffering 
Also when the six bodies of consciousness with the mind as seventh are being taught there the consciousness category can be demonstrated which is the Noble Truth of Suffering
The idea element is the meetingplace of the different  ideas and that idea can be demonstrated by cause and outcome and fruit  and by function and word whichever applies
whether that idea element is profitable or unprofitable or undeclared or undetermined 
Of the twelve Bases ten bases have form namely the first five pairs and these can be demonstrated as the Noble Truth of Suffering
The idea base is the meetingplace of the different ideas
Herein ideas belonging to those with faculties can be demonstrated among those with faculties and ideas belonging to those without faculties can be demonstrated among those without faculties
And as the idea element so the idea base can be sought out 
for what the idea element is that the idea base is too neither less nor more 
Herein there is Dependent Arising in three ways there is that in four ways and there is that in two ways
Herein there is Dependent Arising in three ways as cause fruit and outcome 
Then ignorance determinations craving and assuming are the cause  consciousness nameandform the sixfold base contact and feeling are the fruit   being birth and ageinganddeath are the outcome
How in four ways As cause condition ripening and outcome
ignorance and craving determinations and assuming  these are the cause
Consciousness is nameandforms condition
Being is the ripening
How is there Dependent Arising in two ways
Ignorance determinations cravings and assuming are Origin
Consciousness nameandform the sixfold base contact feeling being birth ageingand death are Suffering
But since with cessation of ignorance cessation of determinations etc these as the opposites are the other two Truths
Therefore whatever Dependent Arising can be made a way of entry by that is what it can be demonstrated by
Herein the twelve faculties that is the eyefaculty  down to   the grief faculty are Suffering
it then becomes subject to lust in oneself 
this is Imaking Being thus lustful it seeks an object externally this is mymaking Likewise the female Herein the pleasure faculty and the joy faculty are subordinate  to the masculinity faculty
When the mans ideas of greed have their purport fulfilled they increase the unprofitable 
but if his purport fails to be fulfilled
But if he keeps onlookingequanimity  in being the onlookingequanimity faculty has parallel occurrence with the masculinity faculty 
So there are seven faculties neither more nor less  due to assuming an object for defilement namely feeling of all five kinds and and the femininity faculty and masculinity faculty
Herein the eight faculties namely the faith faculty  down to  the finalknower faculty are the way leading to Cessation of Suffering
Of the twelve  faculties the five faculties  beginning with that of the eye are a footing for lust for sensual desires
Herein whatever faculty a Thread whether verse  or prose can be made a way of entry by that is what it can be demonstrated by
That is how ways of entry can be found in the cases of the Categories Elements Bases Faculties Truths and moods of Dependent Arising  This is the Mode of Conveying Ways of Entry
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing Up
Several verses may express a single instigation
Like what For example the verse  This single verse has yet to be demonstrated
What is the reason There is still expectation of more to come owing to the instigations not having yet been stated
 The wise then recognizing this As diligences rare distinction
In diligence rejoice delighting In the way of Noble Ones 
Also this verses meaning has yet to be demonstrated
What is the reason There is still something remaining unstated there too namely the verse 
 So when these verses  are collated then the meaning can be demonstrated
So when a single indication is stated in regard to Threads whether verse or proseexpositions not yet heard
any inquiry is an examination with the following task  This Thread has been stated  is its synonym  demonstrated yet or not
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Terms of Expression
It is unity and diversity
Herein the description in terms of operator  and the description in terms of operation  are respectively the unity and the diversity
For example what is a description ie a  making understood   according to the single synonym as a unity is according to diversity expressible as follows It understands  thus it is understanding  and that understanding is in the sense of dominance
the understanding faculty  
and in the sense of nonlapse   the understanding power
When made to exist accordingly  the mindfulness cultivating a triple province which is recollection of the three Jewels namely Recollection of the Enlightened One Recollection of the True Idea and Recollection of the Community is a diversity but it is a unity as a state of undistorted recollection
Briefly what are the four Paths as unity and diversity It is with nonconfounding of the basic idea namely path that they are a unity just as water when combined with heat is hot water  and when combined with cold it is  cold water   biting water and frozen water  this is the unity and the diversity
Again there is the type of idea that is a bringing together  of different ideas combined together as for instance form  which consists of the four obstructibles is a unity as form
That is how all the four elements are a unity as form  but are a diversity as the element of earth and the elements of wate are a diversity as the element of earth and the elements of water fire and air 
 Earth element   by its specific characteristic of hardness  is a unity but it is a diversity as the physical basis namely the body
where the  parts are mixed up for whatever the specific characteristic that is all a unity as earth element
That is how all four elements as forms are a unity
Again there is the type of idea that through its diversity gets another name
as for instance Contemplation of the Body as the Nine Perceptions namely perception of a corpse as discoloured perception of it as bloated   this is  perception of ugliness  and so that which by perception of ugliness is a unity is a diversity  in virtue of its object  That same  perception in one contemplating disappointment in feelings is when expressed in such terms the concentration faculty And that same perception as perception of notself  in ideas is as keepinginbeing the energy faculty and it is contemplation of ideas as ideas and in one abandoning perception of self in cognizance it is the understanding faculty and it is contemplation of cognizance as cognizance  So any  access to knowledge whatever is in all cases as understanding understanding of a particular province  this is the diversity Likewise lust for sensual desires lust for being and lust for views are the diversity in the case of craving which as such is a unity
So any knowledge inquiry or examination concerning unity and diversity
Herein what is the mode of Conveying Requisites
Cleansing and corruption too Are both with cause and with condition  The search for both of these is called The Mode Conveying Requisites
So the cause for ideaswithacause must be sought out and the condition for those with a condition must be sought out
Herein what is the difference between the cause and the condition 
The sameessence is the cause and the otheressence is the condition 
The generator is the cause while the receiver is the condition
The resident is the cause while the visitor is the condition
The unshared is the cause while the shared is the condition
The cause is one only while the condition has distant consecutivity 
Herein the condition is twofold as  conditioninimmediate proximity and conditioninremoterelation 
The cause is also twofold as causeinimmediateproximity and causeinremote relation
Herein what is the conditioninremoterelation
if there is cessation of ignorance in the beginning  there is also cessation of nameandform
Herein why immediate succession  Because the conditioninremoterelation is procured  through  the conditioninimmediateproximity This is as to condition
Herein what is causeinremoterelation
for when something generates something next to it it is its cause too With cessation of ignorance cessation of determinations   with cessation of determinations cessation of consciousness
And  that condition  is dependently arisen As ignorance is a condition what is its condition That is unreasoned attention
And ignorance is a condition for what For determinations So it ie ignorance is a condition and is dependently arisen  What is its cause Ignorance itself
for it is in this way that  no past beginning is evident  
Herein ignorance as underlyingtendency is the cause of ignorance as manifest obsession the prior is the cause for the subsequent That second kind of ignorance is also a condition for determinations for four reasons namely by conditionalitythroughconascence by conditionalitythroughimmediateproximity by conditionality throughdrenching  and by conditionalitythroughstanding point
Herein as to determinations  they are those which having become established in the triple relationship of condition  and having obtained a plane of existence being mainly  arisen with ignorance proceed to maturity growth and abundance  Understanding is lost through four reasons
What four
 Underlyingtendency manifest obsession fetter and assuming
Herein from  the underlyingtendency is born  the manifest obsession When obsessed one is fettered When fettered one assumes With assuming as condition being
So these determinations being triply arisen and arrived at a plane of being and mainly  not stopped  by the Path it is said that   That is how there is also  a condition  for determinations in the sense of being arisen with a cause  But the condition so far treated disregarding any demonstrated profitable or unprofitable aspect must have the profitable and unprofitable aspects inserted and the ideas ripening from the condition so far treated without any statableunstatable  aspect must have the statable and the unstatable aspects inserted Except for that which exceeds the range of being  the whole Thread can be encompassed
not excluding the ten Powers of a Perfect One and the four Intrepidities  which are kinds of merit  Now when ignorance is a condition by immediateproximityconditionality for determinations and when there is the cognizance called arisen immediately proximate to that cognizance wherewith the ignorance was coarisen  then the previous cognizance is a condition by causeconditionality  for the subsequent cognizance Hence ignorance being in virtue of that previous cognizance the cause of arising  of the subsequent no knowledge arises with the latter because it has no opportunity made for it
Since its element of diligence is drenched by ignorance  hence the perversions  arise taking it that there is beauty in the ugly that there is pleasure in the painful etc  Herein the determinations that arise are the choice in one affected by lust by hate and by delusion  r respectively through obsession by lust through obsession by hate or through obsession by delusion The Perversion of View is demonstrable in the demonstration of the four grounds for perversion In as much as one with perverted cognizance cognizes this is the Perversion of Cognizance In as much as perverted perception apprehends this is the Perversion of Perception
And in as much as the perverted view insists this is the Perversion of View 
Then the eight Wrongnesses increase and in the unreasoned attention the three Unprofitable Roots make wrong knowledge and wrong deliverance arise
And being mainly  unpenetrated they are determinations that bring renewal of being
So that is how ignorance is a condition for determinations by conditionalitythroughconascence and by conditionality throughimmediateproximity 
How is ignorance a condition for determinations in the mood of drenching 
How is ignorance a condition for determinations in the sense of standingpoint 
That is how ignorance is a condition for determinations in the sense of standingpoint
Again being is generated in relinking  by the ripening of action  that was accompanied by lust It is when that is firmly  insisted upon through lack of knowledge of action  and its ripening that determinations are called  In this way too there are determinations with ignorance as condition
Again among the five kinds of persons namely those who  are Initiate  persons those who have entered upon the nonpercipient attainment those seeking to be  and inside the egg   those who  are moistureborn or any others  not yet come to be   these   so what do their determinations have for their condition
They still have previously  made determinations  and assuming  unabolished  in their cognizance  as long as  the unripened ripening is uneradicated  through the condition for its ripening being unsevered they still have a destination
In this way too there are determinations with ignorance as condition 
Again those persons  may have neither that assuming nor those determinations yet their seven underlying tendencies are still uneradicated and unsevered and  
In this way too there are determinations with ignorance as condition
Again those persons  whatever kind of action leads to settingup it is all determinatively acted through ignorance and stuck to by craving and also it is owing to lack of knowledge that they do not know the disappointment therein
That same action is  that same craving is the moisture for the seeds growth
and that same ignorance is the standpoint 
In this way too there can be said to be determinations with ignorance as condition
So ignorance is a condition for determinations in these moods
Herein ignorances cause is prior ignorance  and unreasoned attention is its condition
Where  there is noninterruption  this is continuity  there  the fruit is generation 
Just as when a cloak or a sheet is in the presses  and they are screwed down  by two people or by one strong man it would not however get dry in the presses
For those  who attain that rely on it are in touch with it and through craving for it they do not come to abandonment of craving
Herein that noneradication 
That in turn becomes an obsession as the inability of such impeded cognizance to penetrate how things are That is the taint of ignorance which becomes consciousnessasseed 
What is a seed is a cause if not severed When unsevered it causes relinking
When relinking it does not come to eradication
The noneradication binds cognizance down  One whose cognizance is bound down does not understand how things are  So this consciousness as seed   has the meaning of being affected by taints the meaning of cause the meaning of noninterruption the meaning of nonstopping  the meaning of fruit the meaning of relinking the meaning of renewal of being the meaning of noneradication  the meaning of underlying tendency the meaning of manifest obsession the meaning of nonpenetration
At this point the field of ignorance has been demonstrated
This is called the Mode of Conveying Requisites
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Coordination
Regarding what has been condensed The proper synonym  and manner Of detail should be known as varied  
Herein the demonstration of the name condenses the demonstration of the example is the synonym and the actual example is the detail
But the detail has to be stated  Like what  For example in the passage  This is a condensation
Herein what is the coordination
And what should be  abandoned  Will and lust  for form should be abandoned  down to 
As to ignorance that can be described by simile
Again for example  And what is the support Craving and view
Herein the view is ignorance and the craving is determinations
Herein to say with view as condition craving is the same as saying with ignorance as condition determinations
Herein what is supported is consciousness and that implies with determinations as condition consciousness  down to  ageingand death  When this  has been briefly stated thus the remainder of the passage follows  namely
  which is thus the abandoning of the view and the craving Herein with cessation of ignorance as view consciousness no longer as it did before  lets go  this or that idea provocative of lust  in order to seize  another idea as in the Monkey Simile  but rather since it has no will and lust for even the least ideas provocative of lust  how is there to be any dislodgement  In the outstanding creatures the Arahants cognizance has done with insistence  and consciousness being without a standingpoint ceases for want of nutriment With cessation of consciousness cessation of nameandform  down to  cessation of ageinganddeath
This is a Coordination
Herein consciousnesss dislodgement comes about through lust When there is no dislodgement then the former approach to defilement along with its chattels which was threefold has its fires tranquillized
Hence he said 
Herein the coordination is this   One whose body is tranquil feels pleasure When he is pleased his cognizance is concentrated 
down to  there is the knowing and seeing  I am liberated   
The deliverance being due to the exhaustion of taints he no more  reappears
With his reappearances having no actual coming or going  there is  no here or beyond or in between 
This is only what is coordinated in the middle part of this Thread and it is only its construing in Dependent Arising and in Deliverance  but this does not analyse in detail the meaning of what was stated in brief
Also  the ideas in  the type of Thread dealing with Corruption must be coordinated only  with the type dealing with Corruption not with any other
Likewise in the case of that dealing with Morality and that dealing with Penetration  This is the Mode of Conveying a Coordination
These are the sixteen Modes of Conveying
in the valiant MahaKaccayana the RoseApple Wood dwellers PitakaDisclosure is accomplished
there in the beginning is the Mode of Conveying a Teaching
What is taught
 and a verseparaphrases  Investigation  this demonstrates The Mode Conveying Investigation
what is the meaning of that
 Questions  these four terms
 how many questions are 
The streams restraint I tell whereby They can be sealed is understanding  
He answered those four terms with two terms 
with the second question he asks about cleansing
with the third question he asks about the extinction element without trace left 
and with the fourth question he asks further  about the extinction element with trace left  In addition to that third question he asked further 
Good sir if asked you have the skill To tell me their  behaviour 
He asks these four terms
and answers first what was asked afterwards
verse  
while any craving and view whatever with what is external for their ground are the  outer tangle 
and the  nine doors are the nine positions of conceit  for the suffering born of conceit is the position for conceit  in the three triads that follow in the Vibhanga text
Herein the Blessed One does not  paraphrase in the verse with as many terms as he presents in the prose
A bhikkhu such as this will be One on a mission fit to go 
That which is demonstrated of the sixteen Modes of Conveying as Teaching and as Investigation is the demonstration
Looking for right and wrong construing demonstrates The Mode Conveying a Construing
As for example  and the path to that purification is this
  which proseexposition  can be cited
for understanding generates  the virtue that leads to penetration 
The victor teaches an idea And also what has that idea As Footing 
so with all ideas  This is the Mode Conveying Footings
The five strands of sensual desires are a footing for lust for sensual desires
for it is said that In whomsoever lust for sensual desires arises has arisen or will arise the footing for that lust for sensual desires is in those five external bases that have form beginning with visible forms and not apart from them 
That is why the five strands of sensual desire are the footing for lust for sensual desires
that whereby  that idea arises with an object
 the ThreadMeaning As a ConsecutiveSequence  This Mode Conveys a Fourfold Array
by means of the femininegender designation the masculinegender designation and the neutergender designation All according to the Thread demonstrated as 
this should not be inflected thus
The path proclaimed by the Seer which is the state of safety From suffering that has shaken off dirt and taints 
It is that those who are afflicted  by pain will instigate energy  for the exhaustion of suffering
 skill in language as phrasing
 skill in sequence by consecutivity 
And converts to the opposites Is that Conveying a Conversion
For the relinquishment of profitable ideas
For using unprofitable ideas
For using objects of defilement
Herein the formbody is a footing for the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being
for he has exhausted taints when he knows and sees in the four instances namely Suffering Origin Cessation and Path
That is how unprofitable ideas should be sought out
That is how white ideas come to be sought out too
by arrival through profitable ideas
Knower of Threads is he that knows   A single idea in the Thread 
for it does not thereby become  another  even when called reliance 
Because whatever the language of any inhabitants of any country  however it goes it is by means of that that the Omniscient One teaches  and so the synonym for that has to be sought
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Descriptions
By  he describes a description in terms of eradication
there  consciousness finds   whereby he describes a description in terms of giving being
the remaining ideas being subordinate to it
Ways of entry can be found in six ideas
In the Categories the Elements the Bases the Faculties the Truths and the two moods of Dependent Arising
Herein as to the Elements  there are the eighteen elements
and as the form category while the mind base can be demonstrated as the consciousness category which is also the Noble Truth of Suffering
and they can be made ways of entry indirectly 
and nameandform when it arises is a condition for the sixfold base and so contact and feeling these are the condition
Birth and ageinganddeath are the outcome
Likewise the twentytwo faculties
The masculinity faculty and the femininity faculty  are a footing for craving
For as soon as the male has to do with women 
then the pain faculty occurs in him and the grief faculty
and also hate as a root of unprofit increases
and nondelusion as a root of profit increases
the mind faculty is a footing for lust for being
the five faculties  beginning with forms are a footing for lust for form
and the femininity faculty and the masculinity faculty are a footing for the description  in terms of creatures
Herein the meaning of one of such verses so stated cannot be demonstrated so long as the remaining ones are still unstated
What is the reason
That meaning has not yet been stated  it being not yet stated it cannot yet be demonstrated 
What has not yet been stated is this 
and such inquiry is called the Mode of Conveying a Clearing Up
Right view as such is a unity while it is a diversity as the investigationofideas enlightenment factor both as the investigating of ideas and as acquaintance with supernormal power due to directing cognizance thereto 
but a diversity as the element of earth and the elements of water fire and air
but as headhairs bodyhair nails teeth cuticlehide  it is a diversity
but as sounds odours flavours and tangibles they are a diversity
constitutes the Mode of Conveying Terms of Expression
but though it is the sameessences cause that is the otheressences condition nevertheless when the causality  is regarded as a condition for any otheressence at all it is not called  cause  it is called condition
The inonself is the cause while the external is the condition
for the condition is the causes aid when the procuringcause  is procurable
Ignorance is nameandforms conditioninremoterelation while consciousness is its condition through conditionalityinimmediateproximity 
Ignorance  is consciousnesss  cause by causalityinremoterelation while determinations  are its cause by causalityinimmediateproximity 
This is how the cause too is twofold
How is ignorance a condition by conditionalitythrough conascence for determinations
It is so for any cognizance obsessed  by lust Herein owing to the obsession by lust it destroys all understandings province
In this way and no other do unprofitable determinations come successively to maturity and abundance
That ignorance drenches extends through those determinations 
just as when a waterlily or a lotus is growing in water and being drenched and extended through  with cool water it reaches maturity growth and abundance
so too is ignorance a condition for determinations in the sense of drenching
Those determinations reach maturity growth and abundance in dependence on ignorance
just as a waterlily or a lotus reaches maturity growth and abundance in dependence on earth by its having earth for its standingpoint
so too these determinations reach maturity growth and abundance in dependence on ignorance by their having ignorance for their standingpoint
with consciousness as condition nameandform  
the relinking is renewal of being  obsession in the sense of noneradication is underlying tendency
so too although attainment by concentration has the Acme of Being  for its ultimate still it does not conduce to the eradication of the formless
since the moist water element still lurking  there cannot be dried out
without  the heatelements coming  if it were put again in the open outside the presses it would mostly keep moist with the seeping of the remaining moisture for it cannot come to be completely dried out  without the fireelements coming 
is the underlying tendency to ignorance and that is an impediment for cognizance
This Mode Conveys Coordination
for consciousness   can be given in detail 
this is the end of suffering  which is the element of extinction without trace left
This is called the Mode of Conveying a Coordination
The fifth chapter
how far the Blessed One penetrates with wisdom and sees with wisdom
for Tathagatas do not speak untruth
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Bhagga country at Sumsumaragira in the Bhesakala Grove the Deer Park
Now on that occasion a palace named Kokanada had recently been built for Prince Bodhi and it had not yet been inhabited by any recluse or brahmin or any human being at all
Then say this Venerable sir let the Blessed One together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrows meal from Prince Bodhi
Yes sir Sanjikaputta replied and he went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
And he says this Let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrows meal from Prince Bodhi
The Blessed One consented in silence
Then knowing that the Blessed One had consented Sanjikaputta rose from his seat went to Prince Bodhi and told him what had happened adding
Then when the night had ended Prince Bodhi had good food of various kinds prepared in his own residence and he had the Kokanada Palace spread with white cloth down to the last step of the staircase Then he addressed the brahmin student Sanjikaputta thus Come my dear Sanjikaputta go to the Blessed One and announce that it is time thus It is time venerable sir the meal is ready
Yes sir Sanjikaputta replied and he went to the Blessed One and announced that it was time thus It is time Master Gotama the meal is ready
Then it being morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went to Prince Bodhis residence
Now on that occasion Prince Bodhi was standing in the outer porch waiting for the Blessed One
When he saw the Blessed One coming in the distance
But the Blessed One stopped at the lowest step of the staircase
Prince Bodhi said to him Venerable sir let the Blessed One step on the cloth let the Sublime One step on the cloth that it may lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time
When this was said the Blessed One was silent
The Blessed One looked at the venerable Ananda
The venerable Ananda said to Prince Bodhi Prince let the cloth be removed The Blessed One will not step on a strip of cloth
So Prince Bodhi had the cloth removed and he had seats prepared in the upper apartments of the Kokanada Palace
The Blessed One and the Sangha of bhikkhus ascended the Kokanada Palace and sat down on the seats that had been prepared
Then with his own hands Prince Bodhi served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with the various kinds of good food
When the Blessed One had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl Prince Bodhi took a low seat sat down at one side
Prince before my enlightenment while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta I too thought thus Pleasure is not to be gained through pleasure pleasure is to be gained through pain
Later prince while still young a blackhaired young man endowed with the blessing of youth in the prime of life 
Now three similes occurred to me spontaneously never heard before
I considered This Dhamma that I have attained is profound
Then the bhikkhus of the group of five not long after being thus taught and instructed by me by realising for themselves with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
When this was said Prince Bodhi said to the Blessed One Venerable sir when a bhikkhu finds the Tathagata to discipline him how long is it until by realising for himself with direct knowledge he here and now enters upon and abides in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
As to that prince I shall ask you a question in return
Answer it as you choose
What do you think prince Are you skilled in the art of wielding a goad while riding an elephant
Yes venerable sir I am
What do you think prince Suppose a man came here thinking Prince Bodhi knows the art of wielding a goad while riding an elephant I shall train in that art under him
If he had no faith he could not achieve what can be achieved by one who has faith
What do you think prince Could that man train under you in the art of wielding a goad while riding an elephant
Venerable sir even if he had one of those deficiencies he could not train under me so what of the five
What do you think prince Suppose a man came here thinking Prince Bodhi knows the art of wielding a goad while riding an elephant I shall train in that art under him
If he had faith he could achieve what can be achieved by one who has faith
What do you think prince Could that man train under you in the art of wielding a goad while riding an elephant
Venerable sir even if he had one of those qualities he could train under me so what of the five
So too prince there are these five factors of striving
What five
Here a bhikkhu has faith he places his faith in the Tathagatas enlightenment thus That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed Then he is free from illness and affliction possessing a good digestion that is neither too cool nor too warm but medium arid able to bear the strain of striving Then he is honest and sincere and shows himself as he actually is to the Teacher and his companions in the holy life Then he is energetic in abandoning unwholesome states and in undertaking wholesome states steadfast launching his effort with firmness and persevering in cultivating wholesome states Then he is wise he possesses wisdom regarding rise and disappearance that is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering
These are the five factors of striving
Prince when a bhikkhu who possesses these five factors of striving finds a Tathagata to discipline him he might dwell seven years until by realising for himself with direct knowledge he here and now enters upon and abides in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
Let alone seven years prince
When a bhikkhu who possesses these five factors of striving finds a Tathagata to discipline him he might dwell six yearsfive yearsfour yearsthree yearstwo yearsone year
Let alone one day and night prince
When a bhikkhu who possesses these five factors of striving finds a Tathagata to discipline him then being instructed in the evening he might arrive at distinction in the morning being instructed in the morning he might arrive at distinction in the evening
When this was said Prince Bodhi said to the Blessed One Oh the Buddha Oh the Dhamma Oh how well proclaimed is the Dhamma
For one instructed in the evening might arrive at distinction in the morning and one instructed in the morning might arrive at distinctibn in the evening
When this was said the brahmin student Sanjikaputta said to Prince Bodhi Master Bodhi says Oh the Buddha Oh the Dhamma Oh how well proclaimed is the Dhamma  But he does not say I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
Do not say that my dear Sanjikaputta do not say that
I heard and learned this from my mothers lips
Then my mother who was pregnant went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him she sat down at one side
Let the Blessed One remember the child as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
There was also an occasion when the Blessed One was living here in the country of the Bhaggas at Sumsumaragira in the Bhesakala Grove the Deer Park
Then my nurse carrying me on her hip went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him
Let the Blessed One remember him as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
Now my dear Sanjikaputta for the third time I go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
Let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
Then Prince Bodhi addressed the brahmin student Sanjikaputta thus Come my dear Sanjikaputta go to the Blessed One and pay homage in my name with your head at his feet and ask whether he is free from illness and affliction and is healthy strong and abiding in comfort saying Venerable sir Prince Bodhi pays homage with his head at the Blessed Ones feet and he asks whether the Blessed One is free from illnessand abiding in comfort
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
and said Master Gotama Prince Bodhi pays homage with his head at Master Gotamas feet and asks whether he is free from illnessand abiding in comfort
The recluse Gotama has consented
he went out to meet him and paid homage to him and then allowing the Blessed One to precede him he proceeded to the Kokanada Palace
A second timeA third time Prince Bodhi said to him Venerable sir let the Blessed One step on the cloth
let the Sublime One step on the cloth that it may lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time
the Tathagata has regard for future generations
and said to the Blessed One Venerable sir we have thought thus Pleasure is not to be gained through pleasure pleasure is to be gained through pain
The Dispensation of the Enlightened Ones the Blessed Ones comes into comprehension under three headings namely Categories Elements and Bases 
Herein the Categories are five namely the Form Category  down to  the Consciousness Category 
The ten  Bases having form namely eyecumforms  down to  bodycumtangibles are the form category
Herein the six bodies of feeling are the feeling category These are eyecontactborn feeling  down to  mindcontactborn feeling This is the feeling category
Perception of forms  down to  perception of ideas which are the six bodies of perception these are the perception category
Herein the six bodies of choice are the determinations category Choice of forms  down to  choice of ideas These are the six bodies of choice These are the determinations category
Herein the six bodies of consciousness are the consciousness category Eye consciousness  down to  mind consciousness These are the consciousness category
What is the diagnosis of them
Impermanent void  painful notself This is the diagnosis of them
Herein what is the meaning of  category 
The meaning of mass is the meaning of category the meaning of aggregate is the meaning of category the meaning of class is the meaning of category
That also which among categories  is the comprehensive meaning such as material mass  woodland mass  mass of fire    trunk of timber   mass of water  wind mass  is the meaning of category
Herein the eighteen Elements are  the eye element form element eyeconsciousness element   etc  the mind element idea element mindconsciousness element
These are the eighteen elements
What is the diagnosis of them Impermanent void painful notself This is the diagnosis of them
Herein what is the meaning of  element  
It may be said that the meaning of component is the meaning of element
 Component  The eyes clarity  is the eye element 
and so with the five elements Again the meaning of cutting off lust is the meaning of element 
so with the five Again as it is said the meaning of simple nature  is the meaning of element
Herein what are the twelve Bases
They are the six in oneself and the six external 
These are the twelve bases
What is the diagnosis of them
Impermanent void painful notself This is the diagnosis of them
Furthermore the diagnosis is twofold namely diagnosis as knowledge and diagnosis as abandoning
Herein diagnosis as knowledge is this  Impermanent void painful notself this is diagnosis as knowledge
But diagnosis as abandoning is the abandoning of will and lust  this is diagnosis as abandoning
Herein what is the meaning of base 
Again it has been said  that the meaning of provisionofawayof access is the meaning of base 
There are four noble Truths  Suffering Origin Cessation and Path
Suffering as a compound is any behaving not  according to the True Idea and like mentality Origin as a compound is ignorance and craving  Cessation as a compound is science and deliverance  the Path as a compound is quiet and insight
Herein what are the thirtyseven ideas siding with enlightenment
They are the four Foundations of Mindfulness  down to  the Noble EightFactored Path
That is how these ideas siding with enlightenment are thirtyseven which ideas being those that conduce to extinction in the case of Fully SelfEnlightened Ones Hermit Enlightened Ones and Enlightened Ones disciples  whether past future or presently arisen constitute the Path  Four Foundations of Mindfulness
What four
Here a bkikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body    Also the fourfold  the fourfold  the five beginning with faith and the five beginning with faith   Herein what is the meaning of faculty 
The meaning of ruler is the meaning of faculty the meaning of dominance is the meaning of faculty the meaning of clarity is the meaning of faculty the meaning of function unshared with any other is the meaning of faculty  The meaning of unshakability  is the meaning of power the meaning of firm is the meaning of power the meaning of upholding  is the meaning of power the meaning of stiffening is the meaning of power
Herein what are the seven Enlightenment Factors
They are the Mindfulness Enlightenment Factor  down to  the OnlookingEquanimity Enlightenment Factor 
Herein what is the EightFactored Path
It is Right View  Down to  Right Concentration 
Herein the EightFactored Path has three categories namely the Virtue Category the Concentration Category and the Understanding Category 
Herein the right speech right action and right livelihood are the Virtue Category 
Likewise these three categories are the three Trainings 
So with the three moods there are the ten terms  etc 
Herein when a devotee is steadied in the Virtue Category he he does not assume unprofitable hate he eradicates the underlying tendency to hate he extracts the barb of hate he diagnoses painful feeling and he surmounts the element of sensual desire
When he is steadied in the Concentration Category he does not assume unprofitable greed he eradicates the underlying tendency to lust he extracts the barb of greed he diagnoses pleasant feeling and he surmounts the element of form
When he is steadied in the Understanding Category he does not assume unprofitable delusion he eradicates the underlying tendency to ignorance he extracts the barbs of delusion and view he diagnoses neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling and he surmounts the formless element
So with these three Categories he does not assume the three unprofitable roots he extracts the four barbs he diagnoses the three kinds of feeling and he surmounts the triple element
Herein what is ignorance
It is of the four Noble Truths  which can be quoted in detail as  is done in the case of the steps of the staircase
Herein what is consciousness
The six bodies of consciousness  Feeling perception choice contact and attention are name
Herein what is form
The four great entities and any description of form assuming the four great entities
So this name already mentioned and this form are together called nameandform 
Herein the sixfold base The six bases in oneself namely the eye as a base in oneself  down to  the mind as a base in oneself 
Contact The six bodies of contact namely eye contact  down to  mind contact 
The six bodies of feeling are feeling 
The six bodies of craving are craving 
Assuming The four kinds of asstiming namely sensualdesire assuming virtueandduty assuming view assuming and selftheory assuming are assuming  
Being The three kinds of being namely sensualdesire being being with form formless being 
Herein what is birth
Any first arising of categories first arising of elements first arising of bases any birth coming to birth finding a footing generating manifesting of categories this is birth 
Herein what is ageing
Any brokenness of teeth grey ness of hair wrinkledness of skin  totteringness discolouration of the four great entities doubledupness  ageing waning outwane wane of lifespan waning away dissolving of faculties overripening of essentials of existence   this is ageing
Herein what is birth
In the various orders of creatures any creatures decease deceasing death completion of time corpse bloatedness dissolution of body severance of lifefaculty this is death 
So this ageing already mentioned and this death are together called ageinganddeath
Herein ignorance as murk and gloom has the characteristic of not understanding how things are  it is the footing for determinations
Detrminations have the characteristic of determinative acts and their manifestation is implanting amassing and renewal of being 
Consciousness has the characteristic of causing the physical body to give intimation  it is the footing for nameandform
Nameandform has the characteristic of plurality of dependence  it is the footing for the sixfold base
The sixfold base has the characteristic of causing the separate defining  of the faculties beginning with the eye  it is the footing for contact
Contact has the characteristic of causing occurrence of the three namely pair of bases and appropriate consciousness it is the footing for feeling
Feeling has the characteristic of the coexisting of pleasure etc  it is the footing for craving
Craving has the characteristic of cleaving to  it is the footing for assuming
Assuming has the characteristic of destroying  by consumption of what is taken up  it is the footing for being
Being has the characteristic of flinging into one or other among the different types of destination it is the footing for birth
Birth has the characteristic of causing manifest being of the categories  it is the footing for ageing
Ageing has the characteristic of overripening of essentials of existence  it is the footing for death 
Death has the characteristic of exhausting the lifespan and causing lifes surcease  it is the footing for pain
Pain has the characteristic of oppressing the body it is the footing for grief
Grief has the characteristic of oppressing cognizance  it is the footing for sorrow
Sorrow  has the characteristic of sorrowing  it is the footing for lamentation
Lamentation  has the characteristic of speechutterance  it is the footing for despair
Despairs are any kinds of hopelessness 
There are nine terms wherein all the unprofitable comes to be comprised  and meets together
What nine terms
The two root defilements the three unprofitable roots and the four perversions 
Herein the two rootdefilements are ignorance and cravingforbeing  The three unprofitable roots are greed hate and delusion
 the four perversions perversion of perception perversion of cognizance and c perversion of view of the impermanent that it is permanent the perversion of perception perversion of cognizance and perversion of view of the painful that it is pleasant the a perversion of perception perversion of cognizance and perversion of view of the notself that it is self and the perversion of perception perversion of cognizance and perversion of view of the ugly that it is beautiful
Herein  what is called ignorance is unknowing of how things are in the four noble Truths  this is ignorance
What is called cravingjorbeing is lust lustfulness wish infatuation aspiration relish cleaving not giving up with regard to the types of being this is craving for being 
Herein what is greed as a root of unprofit
What is called greed is any greed greediness wish infatuation aspiration relish cleaving not giving up with regard to others lands others materials others places others belongings others chattels  this is greed as a root of unprofit
What is it the root of
It is the root of greedborn unprofitable bodily and verbal and mental action and in the same way also for the cognizance and cognizanceconcomitant ideas associated therewith
Herein what is hate as a root of unprofit
It is annoyance with creatures impatience irritation ill will hatred desire for harm  resistance of the heart  this is hate as a root of unprofit
What is it the root of
It is the root of hateborn unprofitable bodily and verbal and mental action and for the cognizance and cognizanceconcomitant ideas associated therewith
Herein what is delusion as a root of unprofit
It is the non actualizing of the four noble Truths nonapprehendingbyenteringupon nonpenetration of them and it is delusion deluding confusion confusing ignorance gloom dark obstruction hindrance covering up concealing nonarrivalatverification   regarding profitable ideas  this is delusion as a root of unprofit
What is it the root of
It is the root of delusionborn unprofit able bodily and verbal and mental action and for the cognizance and cognizanceconcomitant ideas associated therewith
Herein  the perversion has to be known the object of perversion has to be known
Herein there are one perversion three that are perverted and four objects of perversion 
permanence in the impermanent pleasure in the painful self in the notself beauty in the ugly 
What are the four objects of perversion
The body feelings cognizance and ideas  these are the four objects of perversion 
What are the three perverted
 Perception cognizance and view
These three are perverted 
Herein when an agreeable object has either come within the horizon of the faculties beginning with that of the eye or fails to do so  any seizing of it as a sign  is the perversion of perception
Herein when one whose cognizance is distorted finds intimation  in an object this is the perversion of cognizance
Herein when one whose cognizance is distorted has in regard to form that is ugly any liking preference way of regarding  formulating pondering of views  adjudgment that it is beautiful etc this is the perversion of view 
Herein these perversions become twelve as the three  in each of the four objects
namely three in a body three in a feeling three in a cognizance  and three in an idea  so there are four perversions of perception four perversions of cognizance and four perversions of view And when applied to the six bases  the four perversions become six dodecads as follows  twelve perversions as above with respect to forms in the case of one possessing eye perception   down to  twelve perversions with respect to ideas in the case of one possessing mindperception
But as to difference of object  since creatures are ungauged and incalculable the perversions are ungauged and incalculable  by way of the inferior superior and average
Herein the five categories are the four grounds for selfhood
That is how the five categories are the four grounds for selfhood
Herein it is with respect to the body which is ugly that there is the perversion that it is beautiful 
Herein ignorance which is murk and gloom has the characteristic of nonpenetration  its  footing is the perversions
Craving has the characteristic of cleaving to its  footing is a dear likeable form
Greed has the characteristic of converting  to ones own bias  its footing is takingwhatisnotgiven
Hate has the characteristic of quarrelling here its footing is killingbreathing things
Delusion has the characteristic of mistheorizing about an object its footing is wrong theory
Perception of permanence has the characteristic of apprehending nondestruction of determined ideas  its footing is determinations
Perception of pleasure has the characteristic of approaching contact affected by taints  its footing is mymaking
Perception of self has the characteristic of approaching wrong theory  about ideas its footing is Imaking
Perception of beauty has the characteristic of apprehending colour  its footing is lack of faculty restraint
By these nine terms being indicated all the unprofitable side is demonstrated And that can be known by one who has learnt much not by one who has learnt little by one with understanding not by one without understanding by one devoted not by one undevoted
There are nine profitable terms wherein all the profitable side comes to be comprised  and meets together 
What nine terms
Herein what is quiet
Cognizances steadiness shaping stability steadying steadying on establishment concentration concentrating nondistraction nonremorse peace of mind unification of cognizance  this is quiet
Herein what is insight
Any investigation into how things are reinvestigation inquiry reinquiry prehension apprehension reprehension consolidating by the mind estimating scrutiny knowledge or it is any science discovery wit understanding illumination light radiance luminosity sword javelin investigationofideas enlightenmentfactor right view as pathfactor concerning categories or elements or bases or nameandforms or dependentarising factors or dependently arisen ideas or kinds of suffering or kinds of origin or cessation or path or ideas profitable and unprofitable or blameable and blameless or black and white or cultivatable and uncultivatable  this is why it is called insight
Or it is called insight since it occurs in the various ways of seeing  impermanence pain and notself
For this twofold seeing  is called insight into ideas  by its means one sees twofold namely the beautiful and ugly the black and white the cultivatable and uncultivatable action and ripening bondage and liberation settingup and dispersal occurrence and nonoccurrence corruption and cleansing  that is why it is called insight
Or alternatively in is a prefix sight being the meaning  that is why it is called insight  This is insight
Herein creatures have two ailments namely ignorance and cravingforbeing  Two medicines have been stated by the Blessed One for the counteraction  of these two ailments namely quiet and insight
Those who make use of these two medicines verify two kinds of nonailment namely the heartdeliverance due to fading of lust and the understandingdeliverance due to fading of ignorance
Herein quiet is the medicine for the ailment of craving whose nonailing is the heartdeliverance due to fading of lust
while insight is the medicine for the ailment of ignorance whose nonailing is the understandingdeliverance due to fading of ignorance
For the Blessed One said as follows  
Herein one who keeps quiet in being diagnoses form When he diagnoses form he abandons craving When he abandons craving he verifies the heartdeliverance due to fading of lust One who keeps insight in being diagnoses name When he diagnoses name he abandons ignorance
When a bhikkhu has diagnosed the two ideas namely name and form then likewise he has abandoned the two ideas namely ignorance and cravingforbeing
Two ideas have been kept in being namely quiet and insight while two ideas have been verified namely science and deliverance
At this point the bhikkhu is one who has done his task
This is the extinction element with trace left
With the termination of his livespan with the surcease of his lifefaculty this suffering ceases and no other suffering arises
Herein the cessation the pacification of these categories elements and bases and the non relinking the nonmanifestation of other categories elements and bases is the extinction element without trace left 
Herein what is nongreed as a root of profit
It is nongreed about any element nongreediness nongreedifiedness unwishing unaspiration unwanting uncleaving 
this is non greed as a root of profit
What is it the root of
It is the root of nongreedborn profitable bodily and verbal and mental action and of cognizance and cognizanceconcomitant ideas associated therewith
Or alternatively since the Noble Eightfactored Path is called profitable this nongreed is the root of three path factors
Of which three Of right intention right effort and right concentration It is the root of these That is why it is called a root of profit
Herein what is nonhate as a root of profit
Any unannoyance nonresistance nonillwilling nonillwill nonhate lovingkindness kindlyloving desire for good desire for welfare confidence of heart with respect to creatures or determinations  is nonhate as a root of profit
What is it the root of
It is the root of nonhateborn profitable bodily and verbal and mental action and for cognizance and cognizanceconcomitant ideas associated therewith
Or alternatively it is the root of three path factors
Of which three
Of right speech right action and right livelihood It is the root of these three path factors That is why it is called a root of profit
Herein what is nondelusion as a profitable root
Any knowing and seeing with respect to the four Noble Truths how they come to be any actualizing apprehending by entering upon  penetration nondelusion nonconfusing nonconfusion science displaying light nonobstruction of initiates profitable ideas  this is nondelusion as a root of profit
What is it the root of
It is the root of nondelusionborn profitable bodily and verbal and mental action and for cognizance and cognizanceconcomitant ideas associated therewith
Or alternatively it is the root of two path factors
Of which two
Of right view and right mindfulness It is the root of these two path factors That is why it is called a root of profit
That is how the eightfactored Path can be construed with the three roots
Herein what is perception of impermanence
Any perception perceiving defining taking it that  this is perception of impermanence
What is its outcome
When perception of impermanence is kept in being made much of then with respect to the eight Worldly Ideas cognizance does not keep inking up does not Jink does not shape itself thereto but rather onJooking equanimity or else repulsiveness is what it shapes itself to This is the outcome
Herein what is perception of pain
Any perception perceiving defining apprehending that All determinations are painfitl  this is perception of pain
What is its outcome
When perception of pain is kept in being made much of then with respect to sloth negligence and hypocrisy cognizance does not keep linking up does not link does not shape itself thereto but rather onlookingequanimity or else repulsiveness is what it shapes itself to This is the outcome
Herein what is perception of notself
Any perception perceiving defining apprehending that  this is perception of notself
What is its outcome When perception of notself is kept in being made much of then with respect to Imaking  cognizance does not keep linking up does not link does not shape itself thereto but rather onJookingequanimity or else repulsiveness is what it shapes itself to This is the outcome
Herein what is perception of ugliness
Any perception perceiving defining apprehending that  this is perception of ugliness
What is its outcome
When perception of ugliness is kept in being made much of then with respect to the sign of beauty cognizance does not keep linking up does not link does not shape itself thereto but rather onlookingequanimity or else repulsiveness is what it shapes itself to This is the outcome
Herein the diagnosis of the five categories is taught by the Blessed One and herein any  perception of ugliness is diagnostic of the form category perception of pain is diagnostic of the feeling category perception of notself is diagnostic of the perception category and of the determinations category and perception of impermanence is diagnostic of the consciousness category
Herein one eradicates craving by quiet one eradicates ignorance by insight One eradicates greed by nongreed  one eradicates hate by nonliate one eradicates delusion by nondelusion One eradicates perception of permanence by perception of impermanence one eradicates perception of pleasure by perception of pain one eradicates perception of self by perception of notself and one eradicates perception of beauty by perception of ugliness
Quiet has the characteristic of preventing distraction of cognizance its footing is the Meditations
Insight has the characteristic of penetrating how all ideas come to be   its footing is all the knowable
Nongreed has the characteristic of removing wishes its footing is abstention from takingwhatisnotgiven
Nondelusion has the characteristic of not wrongly theorizing  about an object its footing is right theory
Perception of impermanence has the characteristic of grasping determined ideas destruction  its footing is riseandsubsidence
Perception of pain has the characteristic of perceiving contact affected by taints  its footing is feeling
Perception of notself has the characteristic of not approaching wrong theory about all ideas  its footing is perception of ideas
Perception of ugliness has the characteristic of apprehending the discoloured the festering and the bloated corpsestages   its footing is dispassion
When these nine terms are disclosed all the profitable is disclosed And that can be known by one who has learnt much not by one who bas learnt little by one with understanding not by one without understanding by one devoted not by one undevoted
Herein perception of impermanence does not become established in one who believing in perception of permanence does not review continuity in the consecutive occurrence of cognizanceI Perception of pain does not become established in one who believing in the gratification offered by pleasure in the five strands of sensual desire does not review the discomfort of the postures Perception of notself does not become established in one who believing in self in the categories or elements or bases does not review the resolution into the different elements and many elements Perception of ugliness does not become established in one for whom delighting in colour and shape and believing in beauty in the body it remains concealed
Faith has the characteristic of nonremorse its manifestation is placing faith 
its footing is the four factors of StreamEntry
as stated by the Blessed One 
The energy faculty has the characteristic of not dissipating vigour  its manifestation is the instigation of energy  
the footing for its being there  is the four right endeavours
as stated by the Blessed One 
Mindfulness has the characteristic of remembering its manifestation is nonforgetting 
the footing for its being there  is the four foundations of mindfulness
as stated by the Blessed One 
Concentration has the characteristic of unification its manifestation is nondistraction its footing is the four meditations
as stated by the Blessed One 
as stated by the Blessed One 
Four Blessings  living in befitting places as a blessing waiting on true men as a blessing right disposition in selfguidance as a blessing and having in the past made merit as a blessing 
Herein living in befitting places has the characteristic of dependence on Noble Ones  it is the footing for waiting on true men
Waiting on True Men has the characteristic of seeing  Noble Ones  it is the footing for right disposition in selfguidance
Right disposition in selfguidance has the characteristic of right practice it is the footing for the kinds of merit
Merit has the characteristic of amassing profitable ideas  it is the footing for all the kinds of excellence
The eleven Ideas Rooted in Virtue are these   
Herein virtue has the characteristic of abstention  it is the footing for nonremorse
Nonremorse has the characteristic of noselfblame it is the footing for gladness
Gladness has the characteristic of gladdeling  it is the footing for happiness
Happiness has the characteristic of mental elation it is the footing for tranquillity
Tranquillity has the characteristic of wieldiness it is the footing for pleasure
Pleasure has the characteristic of nonaffliction   it is the footing for concentration
Concentration has the characteristic of nondistraction it is the footing for knowing and seeing how things are 
Knowing and seeing how things are  has the characteristic of undistorted judgment  it is the footing for dispassion Dispassion has the characteristic of nonreliance it is the footing for fading of lust
Fading of lust has the characteristic of noncorruption it is the footing for deliverance
Deliverance has the characteristic of seclusion from unprofitable ideas it is the footing for knowing and seeing of deliverance
There are four noble planes and four fruits of the monks state
Herein when someone  understands how things are  this is the plane of seeing
And it is the fruit of StreamEntry Having understood how things are he  finds dispassion   this is the footing for attenuation of lust for sensual desire  and of the kinds of ill will
and for the fruit of Once Return When his subtle  sensual lust and ill will fade this is the heartdeliverance due to fading of lust
and it is the fruit of NonReturn When with the fading of ignorance he is liberated this is g the plane of Him Who has Done 
and it is Arahantship   Fruits of the monks state  what is the wordmeaning The noble eightfactored path is the monks state These things mentioned above being its fruits are called  fruits of the monks state
Why are they called fruits of the divine state also
The divine state is the noble eightfactored path These being its fruits are called fruits of the divine state
Herein how is he a StreamEnterer
With the actualizing of Truth three fetters are abandoned for a noble hearer  namely embodimentview uncertainty and misapprehensionofvirtueandduty  
Herein what is the embodimentview 
  In regard to these five categories either he is a self apprehender or a selfspropertyapprehender thus  in one of them taking it as the power wielder  mover   helper lyeralongsidelimbforlimb  
When treating it thus any liking preference way of regarding  way of arguing a case liking for pondering views   or seeing   on his part is called  embodimentview 
Herein in this embodimentview five of the twenty kinds belong with annihilationism
Which  five
 down to that is the first of each of the five sets of four positions These five belong with annihilationism The remaining fifteen that is the remaining three in each of the five sets belong with eternalism 
So with the abandoning of the embodimentview the sixtytwo  types of view are abandoned 
The abandoning  belongs neither to annihilationism nor to eternalism
So with the abandoning of annihilationism and eternalism the noble hearer has no type of view at all except  right view dissociated from worlds 
But how does the embodimentview not come to be
 and the whole white side can be quoted down to etc  When he sees thus he has no embodimentview
How does uncertainty not come to be 
Here a noble hearer does not  doubt is not uncertain is confident that the Enlightened One  and all the rest of the passage
He does not  doubt is not uncertain  about the True Idea 
with all the passage down to  Exhaustion of cramng fading ceasing extinction   he possesses this second undoubtable  idea
He does not  doubt  about the Community  down to    he possesses this third undoubtable  idea
He does not doubt is not uncertain believes is confident that  
He does not doubt is not uncertain  that craving is the origin of suffering
He does not doubt is not uncertain  that there is cessation of suffering with cessation of craving
He does not doubt is not uncertain believes is confident that the noble eightfactored path is the way leading to cessation of suffering
In so far as concerns the Enlightened One or the True Idea or the Community or Suffering or Origin or Cessation or the Path  any doubting vagueness uncertainty ambivalence   vacillation oscillation  indefiniteness inconclusiveness ununilateralness ununilaterality all that he has 
Herein Misapprehensionofvirtueandduty is of two kinds  that with regard to virtue and that with regard to one purified
Herein as to misapprehensionofvirtueandduty with respect to virtue when someone misapprehends thus  and 
then any  liking preference belief way of regarding way of arguing a case liking for pondering views or seeing on the part of one such as that this is misapprehensionofvirtueandduty
When someone has recourse to an uncleansing and unliberating idea as cleansing and liberating thus and so on 
and  then any liking preference belief  way of regarding way of arguing a case pondering of views or seeing on the part of one such as that is misapprehensionofvirtueandduty with respect to one purified
Now the noble hearer has abandoned both these kinds of misapprehension  down to   He is virtuous possessing the kinds of virtue desired of noble ones that are untorn  down to conducive to peace 
With the abandoning of these three fetters a well taught and all the rest 
With the actualizing of truth   what is the word meaning
There are four kinds of actualizing  actualizing by diagnosing actualizing by abandoning actualizing by verifying and actualizing by keeping in being
Herein a noble hearer actualizes Suffering by means of the actualizing by diagnosing he actualizes Origin by means of the actualizing by abandoning he actualizes Cessation by means of the actualizing by verifying and he actualizes the Path by means of the actualizing by keepingin being
For what reason
is there the actualizing of Suffering by diagnosis the actualizing of Origin by abandoning the actualizing of Cessation by verification and the actualizing of the Path by keepinginbeing 
Because of quiet and insight  How does he actualize
Having anchored cognizance on the object he sees the five categories as suffering
Herein any anchoring  is quiet
When he sees the five categories as suffering then his reliance on the five categories his attachment approaching  cleaving wish infatuation disposition aspiration concerning them are abandoned
Herein the five categories are suffering 
Thus these four Truths have their actualization at one time at one moment in one cognizance neither before nor after 
That is why the Blessed One said  With the actualizing of Truth three fetters are abandoned for a noble hearer 
Herein when quiet and insight occur coupled together he performs four functions at one time at one moment in one cognizance  he actualizes suffering by means of the actualizing by diagnosing  down to  he actualizes the Path by means of the actualizing by keepinginbeing
What is the reason
Because the actualizing of suffering is done by diagnosis  down to  the actualizing of the Path by keepinginbeing
Because it can be regarded  as follows  Just as a boat going on the water performs four functions it causes one to reach the further shore it leaves the hither shore it carries a cargo and it cleaves the streamso too when quiet and insight occur coupled together he performs four functions at one time at one moment in one cognizance  he actualizes suffering by means of the actualizing by diagnosing  down to  he actualizes the Path by means of the actualizing by keepinginbeing
Or just as the sun rising performs four functions at one time neither before nor after  it dispels darkness makes light manifest shows form and terminates coldso too when quiet and insight occur coupled together  etc   Or just as a lamp burning performs four functions at one time neither before nor after  it dispels darkness makes light manifest shows form and uses up fuel so too when quiet and insight occur coupled together  etc 
 this is the plane of seeing and it is the fruit of StreamEntry
Being steadied in the fruit of StreamEntry when he further keeps quiet and insight in being and when they occur coupled together then with the abandoning of the greater part of lust for sensual desires and of ill will the noble hearer
  This is the plane of attenuation
and it is the fruit of Once Return  Being steadied in the fruit of OnceReturn when he further keeps quiet and insight in being he abandons without remainder both lust for sensual desires and ill will together with the underlying tendencies to both and when both lust for sensual desires and ill will are abandoned without remainder then the five hitherside fetters are abandoned namely embodimentview misapprehensionof virtueandduty uncertainty willforsensualdesires and illwill  This is the plane of the LustFree and it is the fruit of NonReturn
Being steadied in the fruit of NonReturn when he further keeps quiet and insight in being he abandons the five furtherside fetters namely lustforform lustforbeing conceit agitation and ignorance
With the abandoning of these five furtherside fetters the noble hearer  This is the plane of Him Who Has Done
and it is Arahantship   This is the element of extinction with trace left
But with the exhaustion of his lifespan with the surcease of his lifefaculty this suffering too ceases and no other suffering arises
The cessation pacification of this suffering and the nonmanifestation of any other is the element of extinction without trace left 
These are the two elements of extinction 
So the Truths have been stated 
Actualizing of the Truths has been stated  Definition of Defilement has been stated  Abandoning has been stated  the Planes have been stated  the Fruits have been stated  and the Elements of Extinction have been stated 
So when these have been stated all the ideas siding with Enlightenment are stated
The task to be done is here
Herein what are the nine successive attainments
They are the four Meditations the four Formless Attainments and Cessation Attainment
 can be quoted in detail
Herein what are the four Formless Attainments
  down to Cessation Attainment can be quoted in detail
These are the nine successive attainments
Herein what is the First Meditation
It is that dissociated from five factors and associated with five factors 
What five factors is it dissociated from
From the five Hindrances
Herein what are the five Hindrances
They are   which can be given in detail
 Herein what is will for sensual desires
It is willandlust love attachment cleaving wish infatuation aspiration non givingup underlyingtendency manifestobsession with regard to the five strands of sensual desire  this is the hindrance of will for sensual desires
 Herein what is the hindrance of ill will
It is annoyance with creatures and with determinations  etc  as demonstrated  under hate  This is the hindrance of ill will
 Herein what is drowsiness
It is dulling of cognizance heaviness of cognizance unwieldiness of cognizance shirking of cognizance sleepiness nodding blinking winking this is drowsiness
Herein what is lethargy
 It is any bodily lethargicness dillness heaviness of body untranquillity of body
So  this lethargy and the drowsiness mentioned before are together called the hindrance of lethargyanddrowsiness 
 Herein what is agitation
Any disquiet of cognizance is agitation
Herein what is worry
Any mental erasing guilt guiltiness hearterasing remorse this is worry
This worry and the agitation mentioned above are together called the hindrance of agitationandworry 
 Herein what is the hindrance of uncertainty 
Any doubt uncertainty about the Enlightened One about the True Idea about the Community  etc  this is uncertainty
Furthermore there are five kinds of uncertainty namely entirely  obstructive partly obstructive obstructive to attainment of quiet obstructive to the Path and obstructive to heaven these are the five  kinds of uncertainty
Here however what is intended  is uncertainty obstructive to attainment of quiet
Herein as to  hindrances  what is the wordmeaning What do they hinder from
They hinder from all the profitable side
How  do they hinder
Willforsensualdesires hinders from perception of ugliness ill will hinders from lovingkindness lethargy hinders from tranquillity drowsiness hinders from instigation of energy agitation hinders from quiet worry hinders from non remorse and uncertainty hinders from understanding as that of dependent arising
Another way
Willforsensualdesires hinders from nongreed as a root of profit ill will hinders from nonhate lethargyand drowsiness hinders from concentration agitationandworry hinders from the foundations of mindfulness and uncertainty hinders from nondelusion as a root of profit
Another way 
Three abidings namely the heavenly abiding the divine abiding and the noble abiding 
The heavenly abiding is the four meditations The divine abiding is the four measureless states and the noble abiding is the thirtyseven ideas that side with enlightenment 
Herein willforsensual desires and agitationandworry hinder from the heavenly abiding ill will hinders from the divine abiding and lethargyanddrowsiness and uncertainty hinder from the noble abiding
Another way
Willforsensualdesires ill will and agitation andworry hinder from quiet and lethargyanddrowsiness and uncertainty hinder from insight That is why these are called hindrances
The first meditation is dissociated from these five factors
What five factors is the first meditation associated with
With thinking and exploring with happiness with pleasure and with unification of cognizance 
With  the arousing obtaining possessing and verifying of these five factors the first meditation is said to be obtained
having aroused perfected these five factors he abides that is why it is said that with the heavenly abiding
Herein the second meditation possesses four factors with happiness and pleasure with unification of cognizance  and with confidence in oneself Having aroused perfected these four factors he abides that is why it is said that 
Herein the third meditation possesses five factors with mindfulness awareness pleasure unification of cognizance  and onlookingequanimity Having aroused perfected these five factors he abides that is why it is said that 
Herein the fourth meditation possesses four factors with onlookingequanimity purity of mindfulness neither painfulnorpleasant feeling and unification of cognizance  The fourth meditation possesses these four factors
So with  the arousing obtaining possessing and verifying of these four factors the fourth meditation is said to be obtained Having aroused perfected these four factors he abides that is why it is said that 
Having aroused perfected these four meditations he abides that is why it is said that 
The meaning of pressure is the meaning of impermanent the meaning of fleeting the meaning of making reach an end the meaning of seclusion from permanence is the meaning of impermanent This is the meaning of impermanent
Herein what is the meaning of painful
The meaning of repressing is the meaning of painful the meaning of oppressing the meaning of senseofurgency the meaning of sickness This is the meaning of painful
Herein what is the meaning of void
The meaning of unsullied is the meaning of void the meaning of nonconstraint   the meaning of nontorment the meaning of standstill This is the meaning of void
Herein what is the meaning of notself
The meaning of unamenability to lordshiprule is the meaning of notself the meaning of unsusceptibility to the wielding of power the meaning of unsusceptibility to be done with as one wants the meaning of being secluded  from identification This is the meaning of notself
The Pitaka chapter called Compendium of the Threads Meaning in the Actual Presence is completed
for the eye element is cut off 
for it can be said that just as this man is by nature choleric phlegmatic volatile or of complex nature  so the ten beginning with the eye element and also in all the faculties  etc   the meaning of dissimilar is the meaning of element
the eye base  down to  the mind base are those in oneself the form base  down to  the idea base are the external
It may be said that the meaning of aspect  is the meaning of base
like the handsome aspect and ugly aspect  for just as such and such oxen stand out with those two aspects
so with these the oxen of cognizance and cognizanceconcomitants stand out with the defilement of action and inseparably from the idea of suffering
for just as the wayofaccess to a king is through the provisionsforways ofaccess  so the meaning of provisionofawayofaccess is the meaning of base
the right mindfulness right effort and right concentration are the Concentration Category 
and the right intention  and right view  are the Understanding Category
they are the footing for consciousness
and what is pervertable has to be known
What is the one perversion It is that distortion into the opposite by which the perverted  perception etc seizes
The form category is the bodyasagroundforselfhood
the feeling category is feelingasagroundforselfhood
the perception category and determinations category are ideasasagroundforselfhood
and the consciousness category is cognizanceasagroundfor selfhood
so too with respect to feelings  cognizance  ideas that there comes to be the perversion that they are self
Herein it is for the purpose of the four perversions eradication that the Blessed One teaches and describes the four foundations of mindfulness  when someone abides contemplating the body as a body he eradicates his perversion that there is beauty in the ugly So it can be stated too with respect to feelings cognizance and ideas
Quiet and insight  nongreed nonhate and nondelusion  perception of impermanence perception of pain perception of notself and perception of ugliness
Nonhate has the characteristic of nonillwill  its footing is abstention from killingbreathingthings
Understanding has the characteristic of actofunderstanding   its manifestation is judging how a meaning is its footing is the four noble Truths
with respect to one purified
and any fathoming  is insight
any reliance thereon attachment approaching cleaving wish infatuation disposition or aspiration is Origin  the abandoning of that is Cessation  the quiet and insight are the Path
Herein what are the four Meditations
Herein what is the meaning of impermanent
Meditation  is fading of lust
The four meditations can be cited in detail 
They are of two kinds dissociated from enlightenment factors and associated with enlightenment factors
Herein those dissociated from enlightenment factors belong to those outside the Enlightened Ones dispensation while those associated with enlightenment factors belong to persons ennobled by obtainment of the Eight Factored Path
Herein there are these  six personal roots namely lust and the rest By presenting them as in one of lusting temperament of hating temperament of deluded temperament of lustinghating temperament of lustingdeluded temperament of hatingdeluded temperament and of lusthateand delusiontendingtobequieted temperament there are thus these seven types of persons who have the five hindrances  to their entry upon meditation
The opposite according to capacity to resist them counteracts the three roots of unprofit  as follows by means of the profitable root nongreed it counteracts covetousness and agitation and driftingabout which are due to the unprofitable root greed  worry and uncertainty are on the side of delusion and it counteracts that by means of nondelusion 
Herein for the fulfilling of nongreed he thinks renunciation thinking
Herein for the fulfilling of nonhate he thinks nonillwill thinking
Herein for the fulfilling of nondelusion he thinks noncrueltythinking
Herein for the fulfilling of nongreed he is 
Herein for the fulfilling of nonhate and for the fulfilling of nondelusion he is  And so 
 Thinking   there are three kinds of thinking namely renunciationthinking nonillwillthinking and noncrueltythinking 
Herein  thinking  is the first instance  while  exploring  is the exploration of what is got thus
Just as when a man sees a man coming in the distance he does not yet know whether it is a woman or a man but when he has got the perception that it is a woman or that it is a man or that it is one of such colour  or that it is one of such shape  then when he is thinking this he further scrutinizes as follows How then is he virtuous or unvirtuous rich or poor  such is exploring
In thinking he fixes  in exploring  he wanders about his fixed object and turns it over
And just as a winged bird  first accumulates speed and afterwards no more accumulates speed when gliding so too thinking is like the accumulation of speed and like the outstretchedness of the gliding birds wings is exploring
Such thinking is the opposite of perception of sensual desires  such exploring is the opposite of perception of ill will and of perception of cruelty
The action  of such kinds of thinking is nonattention to the unprofitable The action of such kinds of exploring is the restraining of the  forerunners 
Thinking is like a textreciter  who does his recital silently exploring is like his simply contemplating it
Thinking is like nondiagnosis 
Thinking is the Discrimination of Language and the Discrimination of Perspicuity  exploring is the Discrimination of Ideas and the Discrimination of Meanings 
Thinking is cognizances skill in health exploring is cognizances skill in directiveguidance
Thinking is about this being profitable this unprofitable about this to be kept in being this to be abandoned this to be verified   exploring is like the abandoning the keeping in being the verifying
The twofold bodily and mental pain does not arise in one steadied in these types of thinking and explaring and the twofold pleasure bodily and mental does arise
The mental pleasure thus sprung  from thinking is happiness  while the bodily pkasure is bodily  feeling 
The unification here is concentration 
That is how the first meditation has abandoned five factors and possesses five factors 
With constant cultivation of this same thinking and exploring his mentality becomes inclined thereto
Then the thinking and exploring seem  gross to him
His heart which in the first meditation had explorings object
The two ideas namely thinking and exploring need no longer be recollected
It is through that singleness that the happiness comes to fulfilment
The happiness is the mental joy faculty  while the pleasure is the bodily pleasure faculty
So that second meditation possesses four factors 
 has abandoned  what is comprised by wetness
But joycognizance still arises  there and when he investigates that he attends with only  conascent onlookingequanimity 
And the unification of cognizance is concentration So that third meditation possesses five  factors 
hate and lethargy anddrowsiness are on the side of hate and it counteracts that by means of nonhate
which keeps preserving the thinkings  and keeps preserving the explorings
exploring is like diagnosis
and the renunciationborn  pleasure ofhappiness also is gross
and so concentrationborn happiness and delight are born instead
becomes confident in itself with the pacification of these namely thinking and exploring
and what now can be served  is the presently arisen
singleness due to their quieting which singleness is unification
the unification of cognizance is concentration
 
and as he still feels with the body the pleasure induced by the happiness he abides aware
by means of which mindfulness  and awareness the onlookingequanimity comes to fulfilment
so 
Herein the onlooking equanimity was as yet unclarified  owing to the presence of the four faculties namely the pain faculty grief faculty pleasure faculty and joy faculty
With the cessation of these there is onlookingequanimity and awareness Herein it was owing to the pleasure faculty and the joy faculty that there was unmindfulness and with their cessation he becomes possessed of mindfulness  and it is owing to the pain faculty and the grief faculty that there was unawareness  and with their cessation he becomes aware So with the clarification  due to onlookingequanimity which is accompanied by neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling he becomes mindful and aware and there is unification of cognizance  This is called the fourth meditation
Herein the person of lusting temperament has the pleasure faculty and the joy faculty The person of hating temperament has the pain faculty and the grief faculty The person of deluded temperament has unmindfulness and unawareness
Herein the lustingtemperament persons approval ceases in the third meditation and in the fourth The hatingtemperament persons resistance ceases in the first meditation and in the second The deludedtemperament persons unawareness ceases in the first meditation and in the second
while his uninindfulness ceases in the third meditation and in the fourth That is how these three types of persons four meditations arrive at their cleansing
Herein the person of lustinghating temperament has unmindfulness and unawareness  and approval and resistance hence his meditation is of the kind dealing with diminution 
Herein the person of lustingdeluded temperament has the trio with approval   and he is one who sees gratification  hence his meditation is of the kind dealing with diminution
Herein the person of hatingdeluded temperament has the trio with resistance  and he is one who sees disappointment  hence his meditation is of the kind dealing with diminution
Herein It is the person of lustinghateanddelusion tendingtobequieted temperament     who has the kind of meditation that deals with distinction  That is how  these four meditations can be demonstrated among these seven types of persons 
Also  as regards the four kinds of concentration in the four bases for success the first meditation is through concentration due to will the second meditation is through concentration due to energy the third meditation is through concentration due to cognizance and the fourth meditation is through concentration due to inquiry
Again the first meditation is through the Dispositionless the second meditation is through the Void the third meditation is through the Signless and the fourth meditation is through Mindfulness of Breathing
Again the first meditation is through the pacification of sensualdesire thinking and illwill  the second meditation is through the pacification of thinking and exploring the third meditation is through the pacification of the pleasure faculty and the grief faculty and the fourth meditation is through the pacification of the bodily determinations namely inbreath and outbreath 
Again the first meditation is through the Expression of Generosity the second meditation is through the Expression of Truth the third meditation is through the Expression of Understanding and the fourth meditation is through the Expression of Peace
These four meditations are now demonstrated by a brief demonstration  It is here that the concentration faculty comes to fulfilment
the other four faculties there being subordinate to it Herein he who reaches exhaustion of taints by depending on the first meditation has gone by the painful I Way with sluggish acquaintance with the grief faculty in opposition
He who reaches exhaustion of taints by depending on the second meditation has gone by the painful  Way with swift acquaintance with the pain faculty in opposition
He who reaches exhaustion by depending on the third meditation has gone by the pleasant Way with sluggish acquaintance with the joy faculty in opposition
He who reaches exhaustion of taints by depending on the fourth meditation has gone by the pleasant Vay with swift acquaintance with the pleasure faculty in opposition
Miscellaneous Demonstration
 The accessories are these  With these accessories the condition for its coming about is this  The stipulate for its coming about is this  The keeping of the stipulate in being is this 
 With that keeping of it in being the disappointment is this 
 The falling away through this disappointment is this  
 Whose falling away Falling away of a meditator who resorts to that meditation 
through that distinction the gratification is this Whose gratification is it The  thoroughbred meditators   This  thoroughbred  meditator has steadied that meditation in skill in health  When that steadied meditation comes to nonlapse  it is the meditation power  When steadied in the meditation power the perfection  is this  When the meditation has reached perfection its factors are these    Now he who has undisturbed intention  keeps the meditation factors in being in the first meditation 
and precisely because he is one who recollects that fact  happiness too  is a meditation factor in the first meditation and also because when he possesses the factors his ideas are drenched  by that happiness 
In the second meditation  too happiness is a meditation factor but rather is it so as the essential idea here owing to the very pleasantness of the meditationfactor ideas that accompany meditation occurring in this second way Confidence in oneself is a meditationfactor in the second meditation owing to clarification of the mind and it is owing to its being drenched  by that clarification
that the happiness is also a meditationfactor in the second meditation for it is happiness concentrated  by the confidence in oneself that is a meditationfactor in the second meditation Singleness of heart  is also a meditationfactor in the second meditation  The state of contact accompanied by onlookingequanimity is a meditationfactor in the third meditation and pleasure is a factor of it too 
Singleness of heart  is also a meditation factor in the third  meditation Onlookingequanimity and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling are also  meditationfactors in the fourth meditation but the onlookingequanimity is that belonging to the plane of directivemanagement
Purityofmindfulness is a meditation factor in the fourth meditation but purityofmindfulness itself alone is a meditationfactor in more than one plane unassociated with happiness Singleness of heart is also a meditationfactor in the fourth meditation 
 Herein what is the MeditationPlane 
In the first meditation with thinking and with exploring the meditationplane is that which goes with seclusion
In the third meditation the meditationplane is that which has no happiness  since it has abandoned  excitement due to pleasure
In the fourth meditation the meditationplane is that unaccompanied  by pleasure or pain and accompanied by directivemanagement
In the second meditation the meditationplane is that accompanied by those Bases for Transcendance  which are found among those percipient of form in themselves namely the first two such Bases
In the third meditation the plane of meditation is that accompanied by the Liberations among those having the eight  Liberations
The plane of the fourth meditation is rightly that which has bodilydeterminations unaccompanied by inbreath and outbreath 
  Herein what is the meditationdistinction
It is that when quite secluded from sensual desires secluded from evil unprofitable ideas there is surmounting of the sensual desire element which surmounting is accompanied by cognizance and cognizanceconcomitants this is a meditationdistinction
That perception and attention  take place without thinking and without exploring and are accompanied by happiness owing to their being accompanied by mindfulness with happiness
That also in the plane without thinking and without exploring perception and attention  that go with mindfulness accompanied by onlookingequanimity take place
That perception and attention  accompanied by purity of mindfulness take place and that having entered upon that plane he abides in it this is a meditationdistinction
That perception and attention  accompanied by the Base ConsistingofNonOwning take place on the plane of that accompanied by the BaseConsistingofInfinitenessofConsciousness and that having entered upon that plane he abides in it this is a meditationdistinction
 MeditationAccessories The state of purporting removal of sensualdesire thinking is the accessory consisting in renunciation thinking
The state of purporting removal of illwill thinking is the accessory consisting in nonillwill thinking
The state of purporting removal of cruelty thinking is the accessory consisting in noncruelty thinking
The state of abiding without action  as doorguardedness in the five faculties beginning with the eye is the accessory consisting in fewnessofwishes and it is purified livelihood as accessory of the four attainments
The state of right practice is the accessory consisting in the path
The state of meditations having been generated  is the accessory consisting in the fruit
 The Meditations Coming About  Meditations  that have come to be originated in any instance whatever  with the profitable as cause These come about when they have reached renunciation
They come about when there is the concentration due to cessation of objectivesupport of thinking and exploring 
They come about with the absence of happiness
They come about with the abandoning of the pleasure faculty and joy faculty and with the absence of affection
they come about with nonfever
This is the meditations coming about
 Herein what is the stipulate 
Close relationship with the good is a stipulate for meditation
Doorguardedness in the faculties beginning with the eye is a stipulate for meditation
Discontent  with mere profitable ideas is a stipulate for meditation
Hearing the true object of faith is a stipulate for meditation
The measuregauge  of one who has a sense of urgency with regard to an urgent instance
 Herein what is the keeping in being
Cultivation of lovingkindness is the keeping of nonillwill thinking in being
Cultivation of compassion  is the keeping of noncruelty thinking in being
Keeping gladness in being is the state of one who acts with happiness pleasure and awareness
There is keeping onlooking equanimity in being as productivity  and there is keeping onlookingequanimity in being as unproductivity   which are respectively onlookingequanimity and looking on at There is keeping perception of ugliness  in being which is the painful way with sluggish acquaintance such acquaintance being that tied to existence belonging to those tied to existence   That keeping in being in the six ways  is kept in being made much of established made the basis made the vehicle  consolidated  and thoroughly well instigated 
Likewise    in the first meditation the grief faculty  ceases
and in the second meditation the pain faculty ceases 
 The Meditations are four and their respective Factors are these The particular mass  of these factors is with any factor of that mass  the Meditation Plane What  is its distinction  It is the distinction of this meditation 
 When he reviews that meditation as to superiority the distinction being this 
In the second meditation without thinking and without exploring the meditationplane is that which goes with the happiness born of confidence in oneself
Again the first meditation the meditationplane is that accompanied by the Measureless States  and has creatures for its object
this is a meditationdistinction
and that in virtue of the essential idea of this meditation mindfulness is established
and that having entered upon that plane he abides in it this is a meditationdistinction
They come about with nonburning
Having a good friend is a stipulate for meditation
this is a stipulate for meditation
 For one who keeps it in being thus the disappointment is as follows
In the case of the first meditation this idea possesses determinations this idea is still unpurified   and  has taints
this idea has this habit and has a nearopposite this idea has sensual desire to shadow and haunt it and it is the grossest of all the attainments It has thinking and exploring
which still disturb cognizance and the body still gets tired there and when the body gets tired cognizance is harrassed 
and the body is unamenable to directive management for the five worldly kinds of supernormal acquaintance These are the disappointments in the first meditation
In the case of the second meditation the disappointments are these  this idea is accompanied by the extension  of happiness  while cognizance is no longer accessible to disturbance  by thinking and exploring 
yet this idea still has a danger that has access  to it for this idea has grief for its enemy
and this idea is at the mercy  of the happiness belonging to the associated ideas there and accordingly it has difficulty  in avoiding the plane of anxiety about the nonoccurrence of the ceased happiness and this idea in regard to the four kinds of painfulness is interpenetrated by them namely by the painfulness in fear  by the painfulness in impediment  by the painfulness in acquaintance  and by the painfulness in lust These are the disappointments in the second meditation
Herein what is the disappointment in the third meditation
Owing to its state of being accompanied by pleasuredueto onlookingequanimity  this idea is subordinate  to the onlooking equanimity pleasure belonging to the perceptions  possessing the liking there
 hence the pleasure there is constantly perceived as accessible to pain and so on account of the disturbance of cognizance it goes with  pleasure and pain
What is the disappointment in the fourth meditation
Up to the NonOwning Attainment these ideas have further coattainments and on that plane various types of views arise in foolish ordinary men who like them 
And the meditations are interpenetrated  by gross and subtle perceptions of form Always a sentimental lovingkindness  etc is shared  with each fraction and subfraction of meditation and all the four accessories are difficult And these meditations come about through something else  each coming about in dependence on another below it
and when come about here these ideas are still uncompleted
and with the sign not properly taken up  these ideas fall away
And since these ideas are cessative   they do not arouse emergent qualities  The meditations belonging to these ideas have factors of successive cessation and the signs  may not be conformable with the meditationsign perception
and that perception comes about as something not previously obtained and only in virtue of the right type of meditator
 With these disappointments the falling away from the meditation is this
In one who has some residual perception while in the fourth Formless State by his not deliberating upon the cessation attainment   perception and attention  accompanying the Base Consisting of Nonowning which is the third Formless State take place in him and so he falls away from the cessationattainment 
In one who being percipient of imperturbability   has entered upon the Nonpercipient Base  perception and attention  accompanying the BaseConsistingofNonOwning  take place in him and since he does not understand that plane he falls away from it
In one who has entered upon the third Formless State namely the BaseConsistingofNonOwning perception and attention  accompanying the BaseConsistingofInfinitenessofConsciousness take place in him and since he does not understand that plane he falls away from it
In one who has entered upon the second Formless State namely the BaseConsistingofInfinitenessofConsciousness perception and attention accompanied by perception of form  
 For whom does it fall away In  colt meditation   the meditator meditates as a colt  he meditates misapprehending he meditates interrupting he meditates destroying   he meditates accumulating action  he meditates without consolidating anything  he meditates overrunning 
he meditates slighting he meditates without tranquillizing  the bodily determination he meditates without knowing the escape from obsession he meditates while still overcome by hindrances  It is when the meditator gives attention to his having attained meditation that there is the gratification of the meditation And the abandoning of the obsession by lust for sensual desires  is the gratification of meditation While they owe their origin  to ideas whose cause is lust for sensual desires the meditations have in the first instance factors cessative  of those ideas and beyond the first of the pleasure by means of which the happiness is abandoned and so it is the abandoning of defilements due to sensual desire and to action  that is the gratification  Again the gratification of meditation is as follows that while still in the lifeinaworld oppressed as it is by the major kinds of habit there may yet come about an opportunity for nonconstraint this is the abandoning offered by meditation 
nevertheless this benefit of meditation here in the lifeinaworld which consists in obstructing and disobstructing does not have the benefit of abandoning the roundabout of births for creatures who are involved in the roundabout that evolves without ultimate goal  This is the gratification of meditation  Gratification for whom  For the  thoroughbred meditator  
for a meditator who has meditated as a  thorough bred  meditates without misapprehending what he has meditated as a thoroughbred and the clauses for the colt meditator   can be set up in parallel fashion in the opposite sense
 Herein what is skill in meditation
Now this also  in one as just described and who does not apprehend  any sign in the object externally  is the DirectiveManagement Power for supernormal acquaintance The signs of unification of cognizance  are well apprehended by the Quiet Power and it is in meditation made to occur by the quiet due to the Path and its Fruit that there is no more foundering  Concentrations purity  that is due to onlookingequanimity which is that in one who apprehends well the consecutivity of the signs  is the Mindfulness Power Insight  with respect to ideas made to occur thereby is the Understanding Power  
 Herein what is meditationperfection
Lovingkindness brought to thorough perfection      Now as to the verse    By the Mode of Conveying a Teaching two truths are demonstrated here in This Thread namely Suffering and Origin   By the Mode of Conveying an investigation that those who see  nothing blameworthy in ideas provocative of fetters will cross the flood no such instance is found 
and on account of its still going with pleasure and pain cognizance is still unamenable to directive management 
for the verification of the five worldly supernormal acquaintances and all these ideas in regard to the first three meditationattainments are interpenetrated  by the four painfulnesses namely by the painfulness in fear  by the painfulness in impediment by the painfilness in acquaintance and by the painfulness in lust These are the disappointments in the third meditation
in detail down to  in the first meditation perception of sensual desire  can be cited
Skill in attaining is skill in meditation skill in distinction of meditations is skill in meditation skill in succession of meditations is skill in meditation skill in emerging from attainment is skill in meditation skill in the meditations individual essences is skill in meditation skill in the meditations disappointments is skill in meditation skill in escape in the case of the meditations is skill in meditation  Through the Meditation Power  skill in means is obtained Through the Meditation Power the nonfallingaway that is the essential idea of a power in the Deliberating Power  is obtained and also the higher meditation dealing with distinction that is due to playing  with the meditation already generated  is obtained
that they will not cross such an instance is found  There is this Construing and Investigation  What is this the Footing for  Clung to desires is the five strands of sensual desires  that is the footing for craving for sensual desires
 Seeing nothing blameworthy in fetters is the footing fo ignorance Assuredly those clung with fetterclinging  never cross the vast abounding flood  is the footing for assuming
 Clung to desires  sensual desires are twofold namely sensual desire as thing and sensual desire as defilement   Herein sensual desire as defilement is craving for sensual desires as things when craving for sensual desires is stated craving for form and craving for being are stated  under the Mode of Conveying Characteristics   Seeing nothing blameworthy in Fetters  
Any will and lust herein for the fetter what is the footing for that
Now when pleasant feeling is admitted the three kinds of feeling are admitted
When the feeling category is admitted all the five categories are admitted
When sensual desires as things forms sounds odours flavours tangibles are admitted all the six external bases are admitted
When the inoneself and external bases are admitted all the existent is admitted  This is called the Mode of Conveying Characteristics  Herein he  who becomes free from lust for a gross defilement resided in does not thereby become necessarily free from lust for all the defilements subtler than that 
Herein the external fetter is  mine  while the fetter in oneself is  I 
Herein what is the Blessed Ones Purport
 Clung to desires Those who cling  the things to which they cling those who do not cling and that whereby they do not  cling  this mood is fourfold
Herein what are the three footings for the perversions 
is met with as the footing for the action of a doer of what is inferior and superior
Then when persevering with the protection guarding and preservation of those important persons even while assuming  ill will towards that other he still sees to the safety of the important persons
In their safety being seen to when he assumes  ill will towards him who might misbehave towards them
he performs action born of hate
which is a hindrance due to an improper faculty  Then any  perception  herein of their freedom from fear as an offering is action  of a doer of what  is superior but  any  ill will regarding the misbehaviour  towards them is action of a doer of what  is inferior Greed and hate are terms for hindrances These are the four assumings When anyonewhether woman or manhas assuming in virtue of these four assumings their five categories are Suffering while that same assuming is Origin This Suffering and this Origin are also the Mode of Conveying a Teaching
Herein those who do not  cling  to sensual desires do not  cling owing to contemplation of disappointment
So desirousness to renounce with respect to this element of sensual desire  is called will for renunciation 
any determinative act  that does not upset any  whether frail or firm  is will for nonillwill
and which does not  show cruelty is will for non cruelty
Herein will for renunciation is nongreed will for non illwill is nonhate and will for noncruelty is nondelusion
These three roots of profit when produced in the eight Rightnesses  conduce to cessation of those same four assumings
Or if one should again do action whether black or white they conduce to the diminution of its ripening 
this is the neitherblack norwhite kind of action that conduces to exhaustion of action 
Herein cessation of the three roots of unprofit is Cessation
 Clung to desires   those who are Initiates cling only in one  mood
while those who are ordinary men cling in two moods Therefore  this question must be called one declarable after analysis 
Although the StreamEnterer still clings it is in using not in insisting  for he  exerts himself for dispersal not for amassing
The Initiate still uses sensual desires with defilement 
but the ordinary man uses sensual desires in order to mould defilement
That is why  the question namely One who clings  to sensual desires will not  cross the fourfold flood  is one that is declarable after analysis This is Analysis
Reversal Those who are not  clung to sensual desires and not bound by fetters will cross over the vast abounding flood
This is the opposite of this Thread
Synonyms one who is clinging to sensual desires and the strand of sensual desires there a synonym therefore is this  term  creature who clings 
Herein synonyms for sensual desires are as follows mire dirt  barb boil calamity  menace  or any other synonyms
also for this  term creature who clings the synonyms are
namely  creature who clings  much abiding in or any other  
Ways of Entry  with this verse the way of entry is  dependent arising suffering and origin
the defilements the determinations and the fetters  in the case of the Categories the determinations category is the way of entry in the case of the Bases the unprofitable ideas are the idea base in the case of the faculties the pleasure faculty and joy faculty This is the way of entry by faculties
Clearing Up
Terms of Expression some of these ideas are described by a unity and some by a diversity
In the case of those who cling to the five strands of sensual desires the obsessions and perversions are described in terms of a diversity
 Cross the vast abounding flood ignorance is described in terms of a unity
Requisites what is the cause what the condition for that
The strands of sensual desire  are  a condition by objectconditionality
This is the cause this is the condition
Coordnation the opinion  that those who have clung to sensual desires have a good destination are fair of form  this is will and lust for the sensedesire element That is determinations consisting of demerit
What have they for their condition
They have ignorance of their condition
What are they a condition for
So with ignorance as condition determinations 
with determinations as condition consciousness  down to  ageing and death  that is how there is an origin to this whole great  category of suffering One Thread is gone
The Thread dealing with the five Hindrances can be quoted 
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Teaching
 Covetousness and ill will and agitation are craving
 Lethargy and drowsiness and worry and uncertainty are wrong view
But although unwieldiness of the body is drowsiness yet it is not a defilement by its individual essence Accordingly stickiness of cognizance  and unwieldiness of body  are an imperfection by what they side with not a defilement by their own individual essence
Herein the kind of lethargy belonging to cognizance obeying  perception of self is weariness while worry is stickiness of cognizance  So these are the five hindrances Four hindrances are defilements by their individual essence but lethargyanddrowsiness is an imperfection by its siding with the hindrances
Just as the four taints are taints through their being taints by their own individual essences as such not through cognizances taintedness
nevertheless while these are the four taints that are through their own individual essences
as such there are also taints that are taints only through the taintedness of what they side with 
But then it was said  Whatever any  taints are associated with or dissociated from in the ThreadofArgument concerned it is by that alone that they can be called tainted or untainted
It is pleasant feeling and the two faculties namely the pleasure faculty and the joy faculty
It is that those who desire to cross the flood will abide contemplating disappointment in ideas provocative of fetters  this is the Blessed Ones purport here
The three unprofitable roots are the footing for the perversion of cognizance for the perversion of view and for the perversion of perception  
The three unprofitable roots are the footing for the action of a doer  of what is inferior and superior
and for the four kinds of assuming For instance the unprofitable root hate
as when someone gives freedom from fear to a mother or a father or  some important bhikkhu
and someone else might misbehave towards them by body or by speech
So three kinds of will are directed to renunciation will for renunciation will for nonillwill and will for noncruelty
and the way thereto  is the Path so these are two Truths  these are the four Truths  This is the Mode of Conveying a Conversion
clung  bound  infatuated seized cleaved to implicated in sensual desire not released  much abiding in
or any other synonyms This is Synonyms
Sensual desires  are described by a description in terms of indulging in sensual desires and by a description in terms of the province of defilement  The synonyms are varied
and these sensual desires  described by a description in terms of indulging in sensual desires and by a description in terms of province of defilement are also described by a description in terms of seed  described by a description in terms of the fetter of determinations The assuming is described by a description in terms of cause The person is described by a description in terms of the ordinary man
the Threads meaning is demonstrable as having this much instigation
of which ideas  any  external sensual desires are described by a diversity
and unreasoned attention is a condition by the conditionality of dependence 
ignorance is a condition by immediateproximity conditionality
the underlying tendency to lust is a condition by causeconditionality
They are a condition for consciousness
Herein what is the Investigation
 Covetousness is craving for sensual desires craving for form and craving for being
or anything that comes under cleavingto And the nine Grounds for Annoyance can be cited thus namely how tainted lovingkindnesscontemplators of someone coveted think about someone He is working
has workwill work for his harm  and arouse  ill will therefor
 Such defilement of this contemplator of ill will in the form of fever  bodily weariness or unwieldiness is drowsiness
 Disquiet due  thereto is agitation
 Any judgment  similar to that is uncertainty
Herein ignorance and craving there is this And obsession
 ill will is the footing for obsession for ill will
Obsession by lust for sensual desires is the footing for the fetter of approval
Obsession by ill will is the footing for the fetter of resistance
Obsession by lethargyanddrowsiness is the footing for the fetter of conceit
Obsession by ignorance and obsession by uncertainty are the footing for the fetter of views
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Characteristics
When obsession by lustforsensualdesires is stated all obsessions are stated
When any one of the fetters is stated all fetters are stated
This is the Mode of Conveying Characteristics
Herein what is the Fourfold Array
These five Hindrances are the opposites of the Meditations  they are the Origin of Suffering
Any fruit thereof is Suffering
Herein renunciationthinking is the opposite of willforsensualdesires nonillwill thinking is the opposite of ill will noncrueltythinking is the opposite of the three remaining hindrances
These are the three kinds of right thinking
Renunciationthinking belongs with the Concentration Category
These are the three Categories
The Noble EightFactored Path occurs with abandoning of the Hindrances
Any abandoning of hindrances is Cessation
These are the four Truths
This is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold Array
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Conversion
The five Hindrances are ten
What one lusts for in oneself is a hindrance
what one lusts for externally is a hindrance   and so down to  uncertainty These are ten hindrances
There is defilement concerning what is in oneself and what is external  that is two kinds of fetter namely fetter in oneself and fetter externally
Herein  I  is that in oneself while  mine  is the external
The embodiment view is that in oneself while the sixtyone types of view are the external
Any will and lust  regarding what is in oneself is not without lust not without will for form  
Any cleaving to the six external bases and to the kinds of being is craving for the external
These are two Truths namely the fetters and the ideas provocative of fetters
Herein any contemplation of dispassion in regard to ideas provocative of fetters is the Path
This is the Mode of Conveying a Conversion
Herein what is the Mode of Coveying an Analysis
The fetter of conceit  deals with views   this is not unilaterally always so For one does not abandon conceit by depending on abandoning views 
and although the conceit that belongs to the furtherside fetters may be on the side of views
nevertheless the abandoning of only the hitherside fetters does not bring about its abandoning
since the Imaking is still left intact 
Again when it occurs to someone thus  while this is covetousness it is not the first hindrance
Again an Arahant has the drowsiness of bodily defilement that finds a footing in him but that is not the third hindrance so when it is said lethargyanddrowsiness is a hindrance to one
This is the Mode of Conveying an Analysis
Reversal the five hindrances come to abandonment by means of the fivefactored Meditation 
this is their opposite It cannot be assessed in any other way than this that Soandsos hindrances  are abandoned The ultimate aim is inoneself   This is the Reversal
Herein what are the Synonyms
Willforsensualdesires willandlust love attachment are synonyms
Hindrance covering up imperfection obsession are synonyms
Descriptions covetousness  is described  by a description in terms of function ill will is described  by a description in terms of distraction  lethargyanddrowsiness is described  by a description in terms of noneradication
In this way too these five hindrances  in this Thread are described  by a description in terms of presentation
Herein what is the Way of Entry
These five hindrances are ignorance and craving Herein hindrances have ignorance for their root
for any craving is determinations and they have ignorance for therr condition These two ideas are included in the determinations category among the five categories in the idea base among the bases the idea element among the elements while in the case of the faculties the footing for these ideas is that  of the pleasure faculty and the joy faculty and the femininity faculty and the masculinity faculty
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing Up
This Thread is presented according to its instigation that meaning is stated by these five terms
This is the Mode of Conveying Terms of Expression
Herein what is the Requisite
Willforsensualdesires has for its condition unreasoned attention and a beautiful object and for its cause a sign of beauty
Ill will has for its condition unreasoned attention and the grounds for annoyance and for its cause the underlying tendency to resistance
Lethargyand drowsiness has for its condition paralysis and for its cause the motionlessness due to weariness in occurrence
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Coordination
It is in regard to only these external ideas that a Thread comes under the description Thread dealing with corruption  
This is the Mode of Conveying a Coordination
The type of Thread dealing with Corruption has been demonstrated
while a cognizancecontemplators  resistance or demurring is lethargyanddrowsiness
while the state of wondering what to do  is worry
obstruction hindrance covering up imperfection there is this   Will for sensual desires is thefooting for obsession by lust for sensual desires
 lethargyanddrowsiness is the footing for obsession by lethargy anddrowsiness
 agitationandworry is the footing for obsession by ignorance
 uncertainty is the footing for obsession by uncertainty
nonillwillthinking belongs with the Virtue Category
noncrueltythinking belongs with the Understanding Category
and so down to   for consciousness
and any abandoning of fetters is Cessation
Fetter  this is not unilaterally always so
that is not unilaterally so always
Herein will for stinsual desires and ill will and uncertainty are not described by a unity and  sensual desires is not described by a unity on the contrary it is described by a diversity
Agitationandworry has for its condition a lustprovoking delightful and gratifying  faculty and knowledge that is not yet fulfilled and for its cause perception of sensual desires and the underlying tendency to wrong view
Uncertainty has for its condition the underlying tendency to conceit whose object is the nine ways of behaviour of conceit and for its cause the underlying tendency to uncertainty
These five ideas arise with cause and with condition
These five hindrances are also the four taints and also craving and also the barbs and also the assumings
Monks when Prince Vipassi was bom they showed him to King Bandhuma and said Your Majesty a son has been bom to you Deign Sire to look at him
The king looked at the prince and then said to the Brahmins skilled in signs You gentlemen are skilled in signs examine the prince
The Brahmins examined the prince and said to King Bandhuma Sire rejoice for a mighty son has been born to you It is a gain for you Sire it is a great profit for you Sire that such a son has been bom into your family
Sire this prince is endowed with the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man To such only two courses are open
If he lives the household life he will become a ruler a wheelturning righteous monarch of the law conqueror of the four quarters who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasures
These are
He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes of heroic stature conquerors of the hostile army
He dwells having conquered this seagirt land without stick or sword by the law
But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness then he will become an Arahant a fullyen lightened Buddha one who draws back the veil from the world
And what Sire are these thirtytwo marks
On the soles of his feet are wheels with a thousand spokes
He has projecting heels
He has long fingers and toes
He has soft and tender hands and feet
His hands and feet are netlike
He has high raised ankles
His legs are like an antelopes
Standing and without bending he can touch and mb his knees with either hand
His male organs are enclosed in a sheath
His complexion is bright the colour of gold
His skin is delicate and so smooth that no dust adheres to it
His bodyhairs are separate one to each pore
They grow upwards bluishblack like collyrium growing in rings to the right
His body is divinely straight
He has the seven convex surfaces
The front part of his body is like a lions
There is no hollow between his shoulders
He is proportioned like a banyantree his height is as the span of his arms
He has a perfect sense of taste
He has jaws like a lions
He has forty teeth
His teeth are even
His canine teeth are very bright
His tongue is very long
He has a Brahmalike voice like that of the karavtkabird
His eyes are deep blue
He has eyelashes like a cows
The hair between his eyebrows is white and soft like cottondown
His head is like a royal turban
 Sire this prince is endowed with the thirtytwo marks of a Great Man To such only two courses are open
If he lives the household life he will become a ruler a wheelturning righteous monarch of the law
the Wheel Treasure the Elephant Treasure the Horse Treasure the Jewel Treasure the Woman Treasure the Householder Treasure and as seventh the Counsellor Treasure
His bust is evenly rounded
There are no spaces between his teeth
But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness then he will become an Arahant a fullyenlightened Buddha one who draws back the veil from the world
He has feet with level tread
Then King Bandhuma having clothed those Brahmins in fresh clothes satisfied all their wishes
And King Bandhuma appointed nurses for Prince Vipassi
Some suckled him some bathed him some carried him some dandled him
A white umbrella was held over him night and day that he might not be harmed by cold or heat or grass or dust
And Prince Vipassi was much beloved of the people
Just as everybody loves a blue yellow or white lotus so they all loved Prince Vipassi
Thus he was borne from lap to lap
And Prince Vipassi had a sweet voice a beautiful voice charming and delightful
Just as in the Himalaya mountains the karavtkabird has a voice sweeter more beautiful charming and delightful than all other birds so too was Prince Vipassls voice the finest of all
And owing to the results of past kamma the divine eye was present to Prince Vipassi with which he could see for a league day and night alike
And Prince Vipassi was unblinkingly watchful like the ThirtyThree Gods
And because it was said that he was unblinkingly watchful the prince came to be called Vipassi
When King Bandhuma was trying a case he took Prince Vipassi on his knee and instructed him in the case
Then putting him down from his knee his father would carefully explain the issues to him
And for this reason he was all the more called Vipassi
Then King Bandhuma caused three palaces to be built for Prince Vipassi one for the rainy season one for the cold season and one for the hot season to cater for all the fivefold sensepleasures
There Prince Vipassi stayed in the rainyseason palace for the four months of the rainy season with no male attendants surrounded by female musicians and he never left that palace
End of first recitationsection 
 Then monks after many years many hundreds and thousands of years had passed Prince Vipassi said to his charioteer Harness some fine carriages charioteeft We will go to the pleasurepark to inspect it
The charioteer did so then reported to the prince Your Royal Highness the fine carriages are harnessed it is time to do as you wish
And Prince Vipassi mounted a carriage and drove in procession to the pleasurepark
 And as he was being driven to the pleasurepark Prince Vipassi saw an aged man bent like a roofbeam broken leaning on a stick tottering sick his youth all vanished
At the sight he said to the charioteer Charioteer what is the matter with this man
His hair is not like other mens his body is not like other mens
Prince that is what is called an old man
But why is he called an old man 
He is called old Prince
But am I liable to become old and not exempt from old age
Both you and I Prince are liable to become old and are not exempt from old age
Well then charioteer that will do for today with the pleasurepark
Return now to the palace
Very good Prince said the charioteer and brought Prince Vipassi back to the palace
Arrived there Prince Vipassi was overcome with grief and dejection crying Shame on this thing birth since to him who is bom old age must manifest itself 
because he has not long to live
 Then King Bandhuma sent for the charioteer and said Well did not the prince enjoy himself at the pleasurepark
Wasnt he happy there
Your Majesty the prince did not enjoy himself he was not happy there
What did he see on the way there
So the charioteer told the King all that had happened
 Then King Bandhuma thought
 After many hundreds of thousands of years Prince Vipassi ordered his charioteer to drive to the pleasurepark 
 And as he was being driven to the pleasurepark Prince Vipassi saw a sick man suffering very ill fallen in his own urine and excrement and some people were picking him up and others putting him to bed
At the sight he said to the charioteer What is the matter with this man
His eyes are not like other mens his head is not like other mens
Prince that is what is called a sick man
But why is he called a sick man 
Prince he is so called because he can hardly recover from his illness
But am I liable to become sick and not exempt from sickness
Both you and I Prince are liable to become sick and not exempt from sickness
Well then charioteer return now to the palace
Arrived there Prince Vipassi was overcome with grief and dejection crying Shame on this thing birth since he who is bom must experience sickness 
 Then King Bandhuma sent for the charioteer who told him what had happened
 So the King provided for Prince Vipassi to have even more enjoyment of the fivefold sensepleasures in order that he should rule the kingdom and not go forth from the household life into homelessness
Thus the prince continued to live indulging in and addicted to the fivefold sensepleasures
Prince Vipassi must not renounce the throne he must not go forth from the household life into homelessness  the words of the Brahmins learned in signs must not come true
 The king provided Prince Vipassi with even more sense pleasures in order that he should rule the kingdom and not go forth from the household life into homelessness
And as he was being driven to the pleasurepark Prince Vipassi saw a large crowd collecting clad in many colours and carrying a bier
At the sight he said to the charioteer Why are those people doing that
Prince that is what they call a dead man
Drive me over to where the dead man is
Very good Prince said the charioteer and did so
And Prince Vipassi gazed at the corpse of the dead man Then he said to the charioteer Why is he called a dead man
Prince he is called a dead man
But am I subject to dying not exempt from dying
Both you and I Prince are subpfet to dying not exempt from it
Well then charioteer that will do for today with the pleasurepark
Return now to the palace
Then King Bandhuma sent for the charioteer
 After many hundreds of thousands of years Prince Vipassi ordered his charioteer to drive to the pleasurepark
because now his parents and other relatives will not see him again nor he them
Arrived there Prince Vipassi was overcome with grief and dejection crying Shame on this thing birth since to him who is bom death must manifest itself
who told him what had happened
The king provided Prince Vipassi with even more sensepleasures
After many hundreds of thousands of years Prince Vipassi ordered his charioteer to drive to the pleasurepark
And as he was being driven to the pleasurepark Prince Vipassi saw a shavenheaded man one who had gone forth wearing a yellow robe
And he said to the charioteer What is the matter with that man
His head is not like other mens and his clothes are not like other mens
Prince he is called one who has gone forth
Why is he called one who has gone forth 
Prince by one who has gone forth we mean one who truly follows Dhamma who truly lives in serenity does good actions performs meritorious deeds is harmless and truly has compassion for living beings
Charioteer he is well called one who has gone forth
Very good Prince said the charioteer and did so
And Prince Vipassi questioned the man who had gone forth
 Prince as one who has gone forth I truly follow Dhamma
Drive the carriage over to where he is
You are well called one who has gone forth
and have compassion for living beings
Then Prince Vipassi said to the charioteer You take the carriage and drive back to the palace
But I shall stay here and shave off my hair and beard put on yellow robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness
Very good Prince said the charioteer and returned to the palace
And Prince Vipassi shaving off his hair and beard and putting on yellow robes went forth from the household life into homelessness
And a great crowd from the royal capital city Bandhumati eightyfour thousand peopleheard that Prince Vipassi had gone forth into homelessness
And they thought This is certainly no common teaching and discipline no common goingforth for which Prince Vipassi has shaved off hair and beard donned yellow robes and gone forth into homelessness
If the Prince has done so why should not we
 And so monks a great crowd of eightyfour thousand having shaved off their hair and beards and donned yellow robes followed the Bodhisatta Vipassi into homelessness
And with this following the Bodhisatta went on his rounds through villages towns and royal cities
Then the Bodhisatta Vipassi having retired to a secluded spot had this thought It is not proper for me to live with a crowd like this I must live alone withdrawn from this crowd
So after a while he left the crowd and dwelt alone The eightyfour thousand went one way the Bodhisatta another
Then when the Bodhisatta had entered his dwelling alone in a secluded spot he thought This world alas is in a sorry state there is birth and decay there is death and falling into other states and being reborn And no one knows any way of escape from this suffering this ageing and death When will deliverance be found from this suffering this ageing and death 
And then monks the Bodhisatta thought With what being present does ageinganddeath occur What conditions ageinganddeath
And then monks as a result of the wisdom born of profound consideration the realisation dawned on him Birth being present ageinganddeath occurs birth conditions ageinganddeath 
Then he thought What conditions birth
And the realisation dawned on him Becoming conditions birth
 Clinging conditions becoming
And then the Bodhisatta Vipassi thought With what being present does consciousness occur What conditions consciousness
And then as a result of the wisdom bom of profound consideration the realisation dawned on him Mindand body conditions consciousness
Then monks the Bodhisatta Vipassi thought This consciousness turns back at mindandbody it does not go any further
To this extent there is birth and decay there is death and falling into other states and being reborn namely Mindandbody conditions consciousness and consciousness conditions mindandbody mindandbodyconditions thesix sensebases the six sensebasescondition contact contact conditions feeling feeling conditions craving craving conditions clinging clinging conditions becoming becoming conditions birth birth conditions ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and distress
And thus this wljole mass of suffering takes its origin
And at the thought Origin origin there arose in the Bodhisatta Vipassi with insight into things never realised before knowledge wisdom awareness and light
Then he thought What now being absent does ageinganddeath not occur With the cessation of what comes the cessation of ageinganddeath
And then as a result of the wisdom born of profound consideration the realisation dawned on him Birth being absent ageinganddeath does not occur
With the cessation of birth comes the cessation of ageinganddeath With the cessation of what comes the cessation of birth
 With the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth
Then the Bodhisatta Vipassi thought I have found the insight way to enlightenment namely By the cessation of mindandbody consciousness ceases by the cessation of consciousness mindandbody ceases by the cessation of mindandbody the six sensebases cease by the cessation of the six sensebases contact ceases by the cessation of contact feeling ceases by the cessation of feeling craving ceases by the cessation of craving clinging ceases by the cessation of clinging becoming ceases by the cessation of becoming birth ceases by the cessation of birth ageing and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and distress cease
And thus this whole mass of suffering ceases
And at the thought Cessation cessation there arose in the Bodhisatta Vipassi with insight into things never realised before knowledge vision awareness and light
Then monks at another time the Bodhisatta Vipassi dwelt contemplating the rise and fall of the five aggregates of clinging Such is the body such its arising such its passing away such is feeling such is perception such are the mental formations such is consciousness such its arising such its passing away And as he remained contemplating the rise and fall of the five aggregates of clinging before long his mind was freed from the corruptions without remainder
And I sat down there thinking This will serve for striving
as happens in one who abides diligent ardent and resolute
What conditions becoming
 Craving conditions clinging
 Feeling conditions craving
 Contact conditions feeling
 The six sensebases condition contact
 Mindandbody conditions the six sense bases
 Consciousness conditions mindandbody
 With the cessation of mindandbody comes the cessation of consciousness
With the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of mindandbody
 With the cessation of clinging comes the cessation of becoming
 With the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging
 With the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving
 With the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling
 With the cessation of the six sensebases comes the cessation of contact
 With the cessation of mindandbody comes the cessation of the six sensebases
 Then monks the Blessed Lord the Arahant the fully enlightened Buddha Vipassi thought Suppose now I were to teach Dhamma
And then he thought I have attained to this Dhamma which is profound hard to see hard to grasp peaceful excellent beyond reasoning subtle to be apprehended by the wise
But this generation delights in clinging rejoices in it and revels in it
But for those who so delight rejoice and revel in clinging this matter is hard to see namely the conditioned nature of things or dependent origination
Equally hard to see would be the calming of all the mental formations the abandonment of all the substrates of rebirththe waning of craving dispassion cessation and Nibbana
And if I were to teach Dhamma to others and they did not understand me that would be a weariness and a trouble to me
 And to the Lord Buddha Vipassi there occurred spontaneously this verse never previously heard
This that Ive attained why should I proclaim
Those full of lust and hate can never grasp it
Leading upstream this Dhamma subtle deep
Hard to see no passionblinded folk can see it
As the Lord Buddha Vipassi pondered thus his mind was inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the Dhamma
And monks the Lord Buddha Vipassis reasoning became mentally known to a certain Great Brahma And he thought Alas the world is perishing it will be destroyed because the mind of Vipassi the Blessed Lord the Arahant the fully enlightened Buddha is inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the Dhamma 
 So this Great Brahma as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his flexed arm or flex it again disappeared from the Brahma world and reappeared before the Lord Buddha Vipassi
Arranging his upper robe over one shoulder and kneeling on his right knee he saluted the Lord Buddha Vipassi with joined hands and said Lord may the Blessed Lord teach Dhamma may the WellFarer teach Dhamma There are beings with little dust on their eyes who are perishing through not hearing Dhamma they will become knowers of Dhamma 
 Then the Lord Buddha Vipassi explained why he inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the Dhamma
And just as in a pool of blue red or white lotuses some are bom in the water grow in the water and not leaving the water thrive in the water
 Then knowing his thought the Great Brahma addressed the Lord Buddha Vipassi in these verses
As on a mountainpeak a watcher sees the folk below
So Man of Wisdom seeing all look down from Dhammas heights
Free from woe look on those
Arise hero victor in battle leader of the caravan
Teach  Lord the Dhamma
and they will understand
And the Lord Buddha Vipassi replied to the Great Brahma in verse
Open to them are the doors of the Deathless
Let those that hear now put forth faith
For fear of trouble I did not preach at first
The excellent Dhamma for men Brahma 
Then that Great Brahma thinking I have been the cause of the Lord Buddha Vipassls preaching Dhamma made obeisance to the Lord Buddha and passing by to his right vanished there and then
some are born in the water and reach the surface
while some are born in the water and having reached the surface grow out of the water and are not polluted by it
in the same way monks the Lord Buddha Vipassi surveying the world with his Buddhaeye saw some beings with little dust on their eyes
And the Great Brahma appealed a second and a third time to the Lord Buddha Vipassi to teach
Then the Lord Buddha Vipassi recognising Brahmas appeal and moved by compassion for beings surveyed the world with his Buddhaeye
And he saw beings with little dust on their eyes and with much dust with faculties sharp and dull of good and bad disposition easy and hard to teach and few of them living in fear of transgression and of the next world
who are sunk in grief oppressed with birth and age
traverse the world
 Then the Lord Buddha Vipassi thought To whom should I first teach this Dhamma Who would understand it quickly
Then he thought There are Khanda the Kings son and Tissa the chaplains son living in the capital city of Bandhumati They are wise learned experienced and for a long time have had little dust on their eyes
If now I teach Dhamma first to Khanda and Tissa they will understand it quickly
And so the Lord Buddha Vipassi as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again vanished there and then from the root of that tree of enlightenment and reappeared in the royal capital of Bandhumati in the deerpark of Khema
 And the Lord Buddha Vipassi said to the parkkeeper Keeper go to Bandhumati and say to Prince Khanda and the chaplains son Tissa My lords Vipassi the Blessed Lord the Arahant the fullyenlightened Buddha has come to Bandhumati and is staying in the deerpark of Khema He wishes to see you
Very good Lord saidthe parkkeeper and went and delivered the message
Then Khanda and Tissa having harnessed some fine carriages drove out of Bandhumati
They took the carriages as far as they would go then alighted and continued on foot till they came to the Lord Buddha Vipassi
When they reached him they made obeisance to him and sat down to one side
And the Lord Buddha Vipassi delivered to them a graduated discourse on generosity on morality and on heaven showing the danger degradation and corruption of sensedesires and the profit of renunciation
And when the Lord Buddha Vipassi knew that the minds of Khanda and Tissa were ready pliable free from the hindrances joyful and calm then he preached the Buddhas special sermon in brief on suffering its origin its cessation and the path
And just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly so in Prince Khanda and Tissa the chaplains son as they sat there there arose the pure and spotless DhammaEye and they knew Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation
And they having seen attained experienced and penetrated the Dhamma having passed beyond doubt having gained perfect confidence in the Teachers doctrine without relying on others said Excellent Lord excellent
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there
Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways
We go for refuge to the Lord and to the Dhamma
May we receive the goingforth at the Lords hands may we receive ordination 
And so Prince Khanda and Tissa the chaplains son received the goingforth at the hands of the Lord Buddha Vipassi and they received ordination
Then the Lord Buddha Vipassi instructed them wifh a discourse on Dhamma inspired them fired them and delighted them showing the danger degradation and corruption of conditioned things and the profit of Nibbana
And through their being inspired fired and delighted with this discourse it was not long before their minds were freed from the corruptions without remainder
making for the deerpark of Khema
And a great crowd of eightyfour thousand people from Bandhumati heard that the Lord Buddha Vipassi was staying in the deerpark of Khema and that Khanda and Tissa had shaved off their hair and beards donned yellow robes and gone forth from the household life into homelessness
And they thought This is certainly no common teaching and discipline for which Prince Khanda and Tissa the chaplains son have gone forth into homelessrtess
If they can do this in the presence of the Lord Buddha Vipassi why should not we
And so this great crowd of eightyfour thousand left Bandhumati for the deerpark of Khema where the Lord Buddha Vipassi was When they came to him they made obeisance to him and sat down to one side
And the Lord Buddha Vipassi delivered to them a graduated discourse
And those eightyfour thousand received the going forth at the hands of the Lord Buddha Vipassi and they received ordination
And the Lord Buddha Vipassi instructed them with a discourse on Dhamma
The verse  
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Teaching
What is the meaning in the case of this Thread It teaches the consciousness category under the definition by categories the mindconsciousness element under the definition by elements the mind base under the definition by bases and the mind faculty under the definition by faculties
What  ideas are heralds
Briefly six ideas are heralds  the roots of profit and the roots of unprofit But  here  the unprofitable roots  are not implied  in this Thread only the profitable roots are taught
Herein how  are ideas heralded by mind
The mind is their herald as a king is an armys herald  so too is mind ideas herald
Herein mindheralding occurs in three ways  as will for renunciation as will for nonillwill and as will for noncruelty
As will for renunciation the mindheralding is that of nongreed
Herein mind heralds them  these ideas are made emergent  by mind or they are created by mind
And mind being the head of these ideas mind alone is the senior head of these ideas mind alone effects the domination of these ideas thus  mind heads them  
there ideas go thus they are mindmade
and there is the sevenfold bodily and verbal good conduct These are the ten profitable courses of action
Herein If someone with a placid mind is mental action
is wont to speak is verbal action
With these in this Thread the ten profitable courses of action being ultimate  are settled   the virtue and duty are creditable
The type of Thread dealing with morality consists in prosperity   not in the outlet from the world provided by the Path
This is the teaching
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying an Investigation
Ideas are heralded by mind the profitable roots and the eightfactored Rightness
Construing the ripening of the ten profitable courses o action is to be felt as pleasure they being heralded by nonillwill
As does his shadow keep him company  this ripening goes along with him There is this construing
Footings mind is the footing for the eighteen kinds of mental approach
Ideas are heralded by mind  these ideas are the footing for all the profitable side
 If someone with a placid mind  the placidity of cognizance is the footing for the faith faculty
Is wont to speak is the footing for right speech
Characteristics ideas heralded thus by consciousness are also heralded by feeling  and these are also heralded by perception and also heralded by determinations
And whatever ideas are conascent with the feeling etc all are heralds for these ideas heralded by consciousness and the rest
Then bliss sure follows after him  joy follows after him too as a most pleasant shadow so does that bliss follow after him
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Foufold Array
Heralded by mind  this is not the singular number
Because these are all the six bodies of consciousness  What is the Blessed Ones purport in this Thread
Those who seek bliss make the mind placid  This is the Blessed Ones purport in this Thread
The meaning has already been demonstrated 
The three  profitable roots are the cause of the eight Rightnesses this is the eightfactored Path
The  ten instances  are the teachings causes  the teachings conditions  and the demonstration 
Herein mind is Suffering That together with nameandform is conditioned by consciousness so while the unprofitable root is being abandoned factor by factor the plane of the unabandoned is Sufferings Origin
The abandoning of these factors  is Cessation
These are the four Truths
This is the Mode of Conveying a Conversion
Analysis
But that is not unilaterally always so of a monk or of a divine
with wrong view  for when his cognizance is placid in his own aim  and when he is wont to speak or act with that kind of placid cognizance then bliss does not surely follow after him as does His shadow keep him company but only suffering follows after him
and that  So this is declarable after analysis
that the bodily action and verbal action if done with a placid mind is to be felt as pleasure on ripening  when rightly done it is to be felt as pleasure but when wrongly done it is to be felt as pain This is the analysis
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Reversal
 Ideas are heralded by mind   that when  suffering is his companion these two Threads being as they are statedthis is the opposition
Synonyms that is to say mind cognizance consciousness mind faculty mindconsciousness element
Descriptions Ideas are heralded by mind  This mind is described by a description in terms of function
Ideas  this is described by a description in terms of the profitable courses of action
Mind heads them this is described by a description in termsofwhatisdistinguished
Mindmade  this is described by a description in terms of the conascent Cognizance   this is described by a description in terms of renunciation
 If someone with a placid mind  this is described by a description in terns of faith
 If someone with a placid mind   this is described by a description in terms of undisturbed intention in the second meditation
 If someone with a placid mind   this is described by a description in terms of the opposite of the faithless
 Is wont to speak   this is described by a description in terms of right speech
 Or act   this is described by a description in terms of right action
 Then bliss Sure follows after him   this is the concentrating of meditation
In the case of the faculties the way of entry here is the mind faculty 
Ideas are heralded by mind lovingkindness and gladness are the ways of entry in the case of the Divine Abidings and in the case of the Meditations the second meditation and the third
In the case of the Categories it is included in the determinations category
These ideas which are dependently arisen with contact as condition have contact to be felt as pleasant In the case of the eighteen mental approaches pleasant feeling is the approach with joy In the case of the thirtysix positions for creatures  the six kinds of joy based on renunciation
This is the Mode of Conveying Ways of Entry
Herein what is the mode of Conveying a Clearing Up
The meaning instigated by which this Thread was stated
This is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing Up
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Terms of Expression
as placidity due to eradication by the Path and placidity due to suppression by the Meditations As deterrence  of obsession by ill will
the placidity is due to the root namely nonhate  or also the placidity is the root itself
owing to its deterrence of what accompanies ill will
 Then bliss sure follows after him   bliss is bodily and mental Dissociation from the loathed and association with the loved and pleasure of renunciation and pleasure of ordinary men and the happiness enlightenment factor are mental pleasure 
and when one whose body is tranquil feels pleasure  that is bodily pleasure
And that is the footing for the mental  pleasure as stated by the description That pleasure of profitable ideas is not misapprehended
Follows  absorption is shown  and this absorption concentration does not follow one who is given over to ill will
This Thread can be expressed by two moods
Requisite together with five hundred bhikkhus the Blessed One entered the city of Rajagaha
There a poor man served the Blessed One Placidity arose in him with a profitable root and connected  with previous devotion
To others he announced  he spoke this pronouncement   It is gain for them whose dwelling the Blessed One enters and if that happens to us we too shall gain placidity in the Blessed One
Then extending his hands palms together towards where the Blessed One was  Honour to the Blessed One Honour to the Blessed One l  he said with no ill will in mind and he stood at one side
Thereupon the Blessed One uttered this Thread   Ideas are heralded by mind  
namely the whole Thread  That he the poor man spoke to others in this way  is verbal action
Herein in that he displays and speaks praise to others
In that his heart has lovingkindness towards the Blessed One therein is manifest in him the profitable root nonhate
In that he extends his hands palms together and deters conceit therein is manifest in him the profitable root nondelusion
In that he obtains especial understanding this is his abandoning of the perversion of view 
There being any suppression owed to  defilements the perversions are then a condition through object conditionality and the profitable roots are a condition through cosupport conditionality  and that reasoned attention is the cause  so with this  cause and this condition this  cognizance is arisen
Herein this  cognizance that has occurred with the Teacher  as its object is the Recollection of the Enlightened One 
Herein mindfulness and awareness are the cause and they are the condition 
With the bodily determination  the active determining of the action is either the cause and not the condition or  it is both  the cause  as the amassing of the action to be felt as pleasant and the condition for the action
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Coordination
 If someone with a placid mind    here only one who is mindful is placid Furthermore it is with cleansing of cognizance that creatures are liberated hence  herein also the kinds of choice being cognizanceheralded by placid cognizance are liberated  from resistance this is placidity of the kinds of choice The  placidity whereby his  that is the placidity whereby his perception  is  undistorted This placidity which is fivefold  is here placidity as suppression  the placidity as tranquillization of the body too  is dependent on cognizance but the cognizance was placid previously as well
also placidity of the rest of the five
For it is not owing to the existence of a self that the actions ripening follows
It is that the means to that ripening goes along with the action and  when with that action as condition  joy arises that is also the nonremorse  that follows after
This is the Coordination
The Thread of Mahanama the Sakyan can be cited in detail namely how he asked
 
For what reason
Others have said  that faith has the characteristic of making purification of qualities reach the goal  and still others that faith has the characteristic of accepting statements
Another way If for himself someone trusts thus I know nothing and Herein by agreement I am no knower 
Another way there is the contemplation of disappointment in the sixtyone types of views as impermanent painful notself
This is called faith
Another way some ordinary being likes noninsistence  upon the twentybased  embodimentview
though this noninsistence is not yet the kind of understanding that belongs to finding a footing in rightness   for on the contrary it is only owing to right view of howthings are that by means of all the five faculties even though blunt the defilements coefficient with wrong view  come to be
 It is on that same plane that the Initiates virtue is called the support of Noble Ones
and it is on that same plane that even blunt understanding is called the understanding faculty
the more so too since there may be  the faithlessness that belongs to a distorted view and owing to that the essentials of existence are undertaken and completed 
but herein the Expression of Generosity is not merely relinquishment of such evident evils as the decision I shall indulge in sensual desires the while the faith faculty is still placed there in those essentials of existence The Expression of Understanding is due to the Understanding faculty while the Expression of Peace is due to virtue
Now it is when these ideas namely faith virtue generosity and understanding imbue cognizance  that
and then the virtue is diligence
the generosity is action with understanding
and the understanding is the understanding faculty And herein the faith faculty
the understanding is that of the Truths and any mindfulness there is conducive to all good
That Initiate has an auspicious destination he has auspicious prospect 
Even when he dies  with mindfulness forgotten  it is not through that state of forgotten mindfulness  that those faculties or that profitable root have their ripening
Teaching herein there are the four ideas namely faith virtue generosity and understanding
The faith and the understanding are mental good conduct
So when cognizance is admitted the five categories are admitted
The good conduct in virtue of these four ideas is the Noble Truth of Suffering and the footing for the Path
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying an Investigation
This faith and this virtue and the rest
why does he do that
It is through faith that he recollects the Blessed One even were he to meet with a mad elephant saying  Master Hound  and all the rest of the passage  It is through virtue that he does not transgress  any instance either by body or speech and so is one free from remorse It is through generosity  that his understandingness is established
When his virtue is untorn  then even when forgetfulness is arisen  no cognizance that is unprofitable or accompanied by wrong view arises in him This is the Mode of Conveying an Investigation
One who asserts the True Idea will have an auspicious destination  there is this construing
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Footings
The faith is his undisturbed intention and that is the footing for the second Meditation
There are the three kinds of confidence due to undergoing and the virtue is that desired of Noble Ones which together are the four factors of StreamEntry  that is the footing for the Virtue Category of the Noble Path
The understanding is the footing for the Understanding Category
And these ideas and this cognizance are the footing for the concentration become singleness
Faith is the footing for the faith faculty
Generosity is the footing for the concentration faculty
Understanding is the footing for the understanding faculty
Faith and understanding are the footing for insight
Virtue and generosity are the footing for quiet
Faith and understanding are the footing for the understandingdeliverance due to fading of ignorance
Virtue and generosity are the footing for the heartdeliverance due to fading of lust
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Characteristics
When consciousness is stated as imbued by faith etc all the five categories are stated
When faith is mentioned all the seven kinds of riches are mentioned namely faith as riches  and so on When the virtue category is stated the concentration category and understanding category are stated too
That when this cognizance has been long imbued it will not  have parallel occurrence therewith at the last moment  of life no such instance is found
Herein perception too has parallel occurrence therewith
namely perception of forms and choice contact  and attention occupied with forms and likewise in the case of each body of consciousness in regard to the rest of the six bases This is the Mode of Conveying Characteristics
Herein what is the Fourfold Array
What is the Blessed Ones purport in this Thread
And other creatures even if they do not encounter a Perfect One face to face  will by hearing  the True Idea complete their term free from remorse
as will for nonillwill the mindheralding is that of nonhate
as will for noncruelty the mindheralding is that of nondelusion
And they are mindmade  I where mind goes
Just as the wind goes swiftly and any other swift goer is called windsped  a winggoer so too these ideas being produced by mind where the mind goes  there these ideas go thus they are mindmade
They are procured by will in three ways the threefold thinking is undisturbed
and or act is bodily action
these are what is stated
and  or act for right action and for right effort
What is the reason
 Ideas are heralded by mind Mind heads them and they are mindmade
If someone with a placid mind Is wont to speak or act
then bliss Sure follows after him as does His shadow keep him company 
in the case of Dependent Arising it is consciousness
in the case of the elements the idea element in the case of the Bases the idea base
and in the case of the faculties the pleasure faculty and joy faculty that are profitable are the ways of entry
is the meaning that concludes it  the Thread is instigated by that meaning 
Ideas are heralded by mind is a description in terms of synonyms not a description in terms of a unity
 Ideas  is a unity  not a description in terms of synonyms
If someone with a placid mind this unity namely placidity is as a diversity twofold namely nonsuppression  of nonillwill in oneself and as trust externally
This placidity in oneself is twofold
on generosity on morality and on heaven showing the danger degradation and corruption of sensedesires and the profit of renunciation
he who is placid minded through the cause and he who has what is to be felt as pleasure  through the ripening
And just as a clean cloth receives the dye perfectly so in those eightyfour thousand as they sat there there arose the pure and spotless Dhammaeye and they knew Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation
Then the first eightyfour thousand who had gone forth heard The Lord Buddha Vipassi has come to Bandhumati and is staying in the Khema deerpark teaching Dhamma
 And all happened as before
that he extended his hands palms together is bodily action
that he was placid in mind is mental action
And it was not long before their minds were freed from the corruptions without remainder
and with all his utterance namely For them whose dwelling enters the Blessed One 
therein is manifest in him the profitable root nongreed
in that he has suchlike restraint this is his abandoning of the perversion of perception 
in that he has placidity of mind this is his abandoning of the perversion of cognizance  thus there is the unprofitable perversions abandoning by suppression  The condition for all this
is the three profitable roots The intention in the undisturbed cognizance is what is called his reasoned attention
and in that he gives attention to the Blessed Ones qualities this is the Recollection of the True Idea in him
feeling and perception  are the cause and thinking and exploring are the condition
This coordination is thus
Then bliss sure follows after him what is the Blessed One describing
and the Blessed Ones reply 
undisturbedness of intention is faith
 Faith is confidence of the heart
Demonstration of the Threads Meaning  What does he show by faith virtue generosity and understanding 
Because of the characteristic of being undisturbed 
for faith has the characteristic of being undisturbed
this is faith
and that belongs to the worlds
and thereby it is well seen  just as a man with good eyesight  sees water in a deep well without his being able to reach it with the body
so too he has a view of the noble ideas  by means of liking for pondering upon them  without his having yet verified them for himself
abandoned by means of the path of seeing which is why this faith
is called fulfilled only on the plane of the heading of StreamEntry factors
 On that same plane the nonseeking  of categories by desiring rebirth is generosity
and it is by that nonseeking that faith can be demonstrated through the Expression of Generosity
herein one 
is that in the three kinds of Confidence due to Undergoing 
the generosity is that in the four Meditations
This is the demonstration of the Threads Meaning
the virtue is bodily and verbal good conduct
while the generosity is a cognizanceconcomitant namely good conduct as nongreed
That his cognizance has for long been imbued with faith virtue generosity and understanding is through concentration the footing for the first Meditation
and also the ideas born therefrom have parallel occurrence therewith
It is that those who want an auspicious destination  and an auspicious prospect will give attention to faith virtue generosity and understanding  this is the purport
And at that time in the royal capital of Bandhumati there was a vast gathering of six million eight hundred thousand monks
And when the Lord Buddha Vipassi had withdrawn into seclusion he thought There is now this great gathering of monks here in the capital Suppose I were to give them permission Wander abroad monks for the good of the many for the happiness of the many out of compassion for the world for the welfare and happiness of devas and humans Do not go two together monks but teach the Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending both in the letter and in the spirit and display the holy life fully complete and perfect
There are beings with little dust on their eyes who are perishing through not hearing Dhamma they will become knowers of Dhamma
But at the end of six years precisely you are to come together to the royal capital of Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary code
Then a certain Great Brahma having divined the Lord Buddha Vipassis thought as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his flexed arm or flex it again
Arranging his robe over one shoulder and saluting the Lord with joined palms he said Just so  Lord just so  Well Farer
Let the Lord give permission to this great gathering to wander abroad for the good of the many  out of compassion for the world
There are beings with little dust on their eyes who are perishing through not hearing Dhamma they will become knowers of Dhamma
And we too will do the same as the monks at the end of six years we will come together to the royal capital of Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary code
Having spoken thus that Brahma made obeisance to the Lord Buddha and passing by to his right vanished there and then
 So the Lord Buddha Vipassi emerging from the seclusion of his restperiod told the monks what had occurred occurred
I allow you monks to wander abroad for the good of the many for the welfare and happiness of devas and humans Do not go two together monks but teach the Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending both in the letter and in the spirit and display the holy life fully complete and perfect
There are beings with little dust on their eyes who are perishing through not hearing Dhamma they will become knowers of Dhamma
But at the end of six years precisely you are to come together to the royal capital of Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary code
And the majority of those monks left that very day to wander about the country
And at that time there were eightyfour thousand religious residences in Jambudlpa
And at the end of one year the devas would proclaim Gentlemen one year has passed five remain
At the end of five years you are to return to Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary code and similarly at the end of two three four five years
 And those monks some by their own psychic powers and some by that of the devas all in one day came to Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary code
And then the Lord Buddha Vipassi gave to the assembled monks the following precepts
Patient forbearance is the highest sacrifice
Supreme is Nibbana so say the Buddhas
Hes not one gone forth who hurts others
No ascetic he who harms another
Not to do any evil but cultivate the good
To purify ones mind this the Buddhas teach
Not insulting not harming restraint according to rule
Moderation in food seclusion of dwelling
Devotion to high thinking this the Buddhas teach
vanished from the Brahma world and appeared before the Lord Buddha Vipassi
And when six years had passed the devas announced Gentlemen six years have passed it is now time to go to the royal capital of Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary code
Once monks I was staying at Ukkattha in the Subhaga grove at the foot of  great saltree
And as I dwelt there in seclusion it occurred to me There is no abode of beings easily accessible that has not been visited by me for so long as that of the devas of the Pure Abodes
Suppose I were to visit them now
And then as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his flexed arm or flex it again I vanished from Ukkattha and appeared among the Aviha devas
And many thousands of them came to me saluted me and stood to one side
Then they said Sir it is ninetyone aeons since the Lord Buddha Vipassi appeared in the world
The Lord Buddha Vipassi was bom of Khattiya race and arose in a Khattiya family
The Lord Buddha Vipassis renunciation was like this his goingforth like this his striving like this his full enlightenment like this his turning of the wheel like this
And we sir who lived the holy life under the Lord Buddha Vipassi having freed ourselves from sensedesires have arisen here  In the same way many thousands of devas came 
They said Sir in this fortunate aeon now the Lord Buddha has arisen in the world
He was bom of Khattiya race
He gained his full enlightenment under an assatthatree
Such was the Lords renunciation such his going forth such his striving such his full enlightenment such his turning of the wheel
And we sir who have lived the holy life under the Lord having freed ourselves from sensedesires have arisen here
 Then I went with the Aviha devas to see the Atappa devas and with these to see the Sudassa devas and with these to see the SudassI devas and with all of these to see the Akanittha devas
he was of the Kondanna clan
in his time the lifespan was eighty thousand years
he gained his full enlightenment under a trumpetflower tree
he had the pair of noble disciples Khanda and Tissa
he had three assemblies of disciples
one of six million eight hundred thousand
one of a hundred thousand
and one of eighty thousand monks
all of whom were Arahants
his chief personal attendant was the monk Asoka
his father was King Bandhuma
his mother was Queen Bandhumati
and his fathers royal capital was Bandhumati
he is of the Gotama clan
in his time the lifespan is short limited and quick to pass it is seldom that anybody lives to be a hundred
he has a pair of noble disciples Sariputta and Moggallana
he has one assembly of disciples one thousand two hundred and fifty monks
who are all Arahants
his chief personal attendant is Ananda
his father is King Suddhodana 
his mother was Queen Maya
and his royal capital is Kapilavatthu
And so it is monks that by his penetration of the fundamentals of Dhamma the Tathagata remembers the past Buddhas who have attained final Nibbana cutting through multiplicity blazing a trail have exhausted the round have passed by all suffering he recalls their births their names their dan their lifespan their twindisciples their assemblies of disciples These Blessed Lords were born thus
And there many thousands of devas came saluted me and stood to one side
saying Sir it is ninetyone aeons since the Lord Buddha Vipassi appeared in the world as verses 
were called thus thus was their clan thus was their morality their Dhamma their wisdom their dwelling thus was their liberation
Thus the Lord spoke
and the monks delighted rejoiced at his words
and the six of us lived on what those two bhikkhus brought back from their almsround
if he had much illness he could not achieve what can be achieved by one who is free from illness
if he was fraudulent and deceitful he could not achieve what can be achieved by one who is honest and sincere
if he was lazy he could not achieve what can be achieved by one who is energetic
if he was not wise he could not achieve what can be achieved by one who is wise
if he was free from illness he could achieve what can be achieved by one who is free from illness
if he was honest and sincere he could achieve what can be achieved by one who is honest and sincere
if he was energetic he could achieve what can be achieved by one who is energetic
if he was wise he could achieve what can be achieved by one who is wise
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Conversion
Among these four ideas faith and understanding slay faithlessness and ignorance
while virtue and generosity and craving  slay hate
Thus two roots are still to be  abandoned in him
And the suffering on the plane of the unabandoned which he is stopping now is the tworooted fivecategories
Thus two Truths namely Origin and Suffering The quiet and insight
This is the Mode of Conveying a Conversion
Herein what is the Analysis
As to this  cognizance imbued with faith etc if it can not be said unilaterally also of an ordinary man that his destination  on rebirth will be auspicious that is because his action either turns out  to be that with only ripening here and now in this existence 
or else it is that some past unprofitable action of his was ready manifested for ripening and that these now become the conditions for that ripening like those instances in the Mahakammavibhanga Sutta  Hence this demonstration that one who walks in the True Idea has an auspicious destination  is one to be declared only after analysis
Herein what is the Reversal
Faithlessness unvirtuousness avarice and stupidity are abandoned by their opposites This is the Reversal
Herein what are the Synonyms
The cognizance that has long been so imbued is cognizance mind consciousness  etc The faith is the faith faculty faith power As to virtue good conduct refraining constraint taming untornness are synonyms for it
Generosity is relinquishment nongreed loosinghold Expression of Generosity
Understanding is understandingness understandingluminosity understanding faculty understanding power
Herein what are the Descriptions
The faith is described by a description in terms of confidence
The virtue is described by a description in terms of good conduct
The generosity is described by a description in terms of making merit
The understanding is described by a description in terms of inquiry
These three ideas namely faith virtue and generosity come to purification in one possessed of understanding
Herein what are the Ways of Entry
The four ideas are included in the determinations category in the case of the categories  etc in the case of the elements  in the case of the bases
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Terms of Expression
This cognizance described by a diversity is not imbued with unprofitable cognizances  Imbued   any cognizances again so imbued and also what is so described by assumption of the others  also all these four ideas are described by a unity
Herein what are the Requisites
For cognizance the faculties of the eye etc are a condition by dominanceconditionality and attention
For faith worldly understanding is a condition by causeconditionality
For virtue living in befitting places is a condition
and right disposition in selfguidance is the cause
For generosity nongreed is the cause
For understanding  anothers utterance and reasoned attention in oneself are the cause and the condition
Herein what is the Coordination
The cognizance has for long been imbued and also the concomitants of cognizance
Here all ideas being thus imbued the destination  will be auspicious and auspicious the reappearance in a future existence
So those human uses of possessions are all an auspicious destination too This is the Coordination
For example the verse 
The Threads Meaning Herein what is  Above
Beyond this is what will be future   this is  above 
Herein conjecturors about a retrospective finiteness by means of the past have the eternalistview while some conjecturors about prospective finiteness have the annihilationistview These said conjecturors have these two views namely the annihilationistview and the eternalistview
and they favour perception in the way stated  as follows    and likewise three each with feeling perception determinations and consciousness
As to the annihilationistview the remaining five terms  belong to annihilationism
That is how in the case of the five categories fifteen tenns of the twentybased embodimentview belong to retrospective finiteness
Herein one who sees  thus namely  I am this  when he sees form as self he has the annihilationisttheory but when he sees thus namely  he has the eternalisttheory The annihilationistview treats in terms of selfidentification with the particular category and the eternalistview treats in terms of retrospective finiteness
When he does not see  I am this 
his taints of wrong view come to abandonment 
When by this door by this instrumentality by this means namely  Above below in every way without lust And seeing not at all that I am this   it is thus demonstrated in the several instances  in retrospective finiteness and prospective finiteness in the three temporal periods then this is the Plane of Seeing and the Fruit of Stream Entry and so this noble means occurs for nonrenewal of being  through the Roundabouts becoming nonextant thus there being any noble means at all in the guise of one of the four paths for nonrenewal of being  it is the five faculties beginning with faith whether blunt medium or outstanding that occur  for all  nonrenewal of being
I is the flood of views the flood of sensual desire the flood of being the flood of ignorance according to limitation
Herein as to the four Truths by the Mode of Conveying a Teaching with the five faculties beginning with faith and with the fruit of Stream Entry there are respectively two Truths namely the Path and Cessation
And with embodiment  and its origin there are two Truths namely Suffering and its Origin This is the Mode of Conveying a Teaching
Herein what is the Investigation
When he does not see I am this he abandons the three fetters to be abandoned by Seeing
Persons are of three types namely one type gains knowledge by a condensed statement one gains knowledge by an expanded statement and one is guidable 
The type that gains knowledge by a condensed statement has keen faculties the type that gains knowledge by an expanded statement has blunter faculties than that and the guidable type has still blunter faculties  than that
Herein the type that gains knowledge by a condensed statement after his coming to the plane of seeing with keenness in his faculties reaches the fruit of StreamEntry and becomes a SingleSeed 
The type that gains knowledge by an expanded statement after his coming to the plane of seeing with blunter faculties reaches the fruit of StreamEntry and becomes a ClantoClan
Herein the guidable type after his coming to the plane of seeing reaches the fruit of StreamEntry and becomes a Seven timesatMost
this is the third kind of StreamEnterer
There is this construing Whether he verifies the blunt or medium or outstanding plane  with blunt or medium or outstanding faculties he abandons all the types of views wth the abandoning of the embodimentview
Herein the embodiment view is the footing for all wrong view
Embodiment is the footing for nameandform
Nameandform is the footing for the embodimentview
The five faculties having form beginning with the eye are the footing for lust for form
The sixfold base is the footing for Imaking
Herein what are the Characteristics
When two kinds  of view are abandoned herein the sixtyone  types of view come to abandonment
When he sees in the plane born of that view its specific conditionality  by seeing how the view comes to be 
This is the Mode of Conveying Characteristics
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold Array
It is that any creatures who will not  delight in lustprovoking things will make efforts  for the abandoning of views
This is the Blessed Ones purport here
This is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold Array
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Conversion
They eradicate covetousness and ill will  altogether with the means of keepinginbeing fby the NonReturn Path faith being a power then in virtue of the Initiates deliverance When they come to belong to the further side faith is then a power in virtue of the Arahants Right View because exerted by the energy faculty  and based on memory by the mindfulness faculty  and it reaches  the goal
Herein the faculties are the Path and the abandoning of defilement
is Cessation What is no more inseparable from the idea of future arising is Suffering
This is the Mode of Conveying a Conversion
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying an Analysis
Herein one acquires outstandingness in the plane born of that embodimentview in five moods by virtue duty much learning concentration and pleasure in renunciation
Herein one who perceives something as reached when it is not reached overestimates
And it was on account of this very need arisen  that the Blessed One delivered this Thread
Herein when he is one who perceives something as reached when it is not reached his concentration is materialistic it is that cultivated by trivial men and it is ordinary men that are called  trivial men
And this  materialistic concentration belongs to the worlds  and is ignoble  through its not having come to the Noble Path that is why such concentration is ignoble and of the kind cultivated by trivial men
But he who understands and sees  in the noble mood how this is abandons overestimation  He  is guided  by the noble concentration cultivated by untrivial men and unmaterialistic Herein it is noble persons that are called  untrivial men 
and the concentration cultivated by them is what is called concentration cultivated by untrivial men
Therefore this  is declarable after analysis namely the passage   Seeing not at all  that  I am this  
Herein what is the Reversal
It is owing to this plane of seeing that defilements are abandorable  for they  are abandonable here Both any  not demonstrated in this Thread by the Blessed One and any  demonstrated by the Blessed One here can be demonstrated  here
Herein what are the Synonyms
Any embodiment view of selfview
Defilements abandonable
are abandoned  also when undemonstrated by the Blessed One  They are for instance the eternalistview and the annihilationview
The annihilationistview is the nonexistenceofgivingetcview
These are synonyms
Craving is described by a description in terms of fetters
Herein what are the Ways of Entry
Embodiment is Suffering what is abandonable by seeing
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing Up
The instigation instigated whereby the Blessed One uttered this Thread has been completed
Nameandform has cause and condition consciousness is the cause as seed
What has to be stopped is the renewal of being  in a further existence  and the  individualessence as cause  and the otheressence as condition  
For any  such right view anothers utterance and reasoned attention are the condition and any understanding that is aroused is the cause since from the right view right intention has its being and so right view is the requisite
Herein what is the Coordination
He who  sees not at all that I am this sees it as painful as an ailment  etc with the eleven  terms
 The virtues Blessed One what is their aim what is their reward
 The virtues Ananda have nonremorse for their aim  down to  deliverance   
Herein aim  is twofold mans aim  and words aim 
Herein what is the mans aim 
That there is no subsequent regret this is the  nonremorse  this is the mans aim 
As for instance when someone fosters this aim cultivates it he might say   Whatever it is I am dependent on that is the aim for which I instigate this task 
Herein what is the words aim 
 The kinds of virtue whether bodily or verbal good conduct have nonremorse for their aim 
Herein it is only the radiance of virtue and duty 
as good conduct due to the state of action well done nothing else that is the nonremorse here
And so down to deliverance  there are the two aims  the mans aim and the words aim in the case of each term in the text And as in this Thread so in all Threads there are the two aims 
And the ultimate aim  the supreme aim 
is this namely what can be verified for oneself  on ones own depending on what is verifiable  as extinction this is called ones own aim effected
This again is a synonym That one understands 
by this synonym the concluded aim referred to  this is the words aim 
Herein of whatever aim the hearer wants
the actual obtaining is the mans aim 
is the words  aim  Herein nonremorse is the aim and the reward of the kinds of virtue
And the reward is this namely that one does not go to a bad destination
according as it is said by the Blessed One   This is the aim 
that a man associated with power  on the plane of mastery  has been instigated by virtue And so down to deliverance  Likewise the Three Categories  
herein both the non remorse demonstrated by means of underlying tendency and that virtue are the Virtue Category
And in virtue of the concentration faculty the gladness happiness and tranquillity are the Concentration Category
And that one concentrated  understands how this is this is the Understanding Category
These are the three Categories Virtue Concentration and Understanding  Likewise  in the case of the Faculties when he fulfils virtue the energy faculty is the reason whereby he fulfils virtue and makes efforts for the nonarising of the unarisen unprofitable for the abandoning of the arisen unprofitable for the arising of the unarisen profitable and for the increase of the arisen profitable thus the Energy Faculty is demonstrated
And herein the concentration category is the Concentration Faculty
and the understanding category is the Understanding Faculty That can also be seen in the case of the four Right Endeavours
likewise for when someone makes eftorts for the nonarising of unarisen unprofit this is the first Right Endeavour
These are the four Right Endeavours  Also it can be seen in the case of the four Meditations
likewise  First Meditation With the virtue category there comes the renunciation element as the beginning ie renunciation of sensual desire and the three kinds of thinking namely renunciation thinking nonillwillthinking and noncrueltythinking
and the nondistraction there is concentration
This is the fivefactored first meditation 
Second Meditation What is the mental tranquillity Any obstruction  with the thinking and exploring which is defilement and fever has ceased in the first meditation
and any such  tranquillization of defilement in the first meditation and any  tranquillization of thinking and exploring in the second meditation this is tranquillization of both these ideas
Herein any  pleasure and pleasing of the body and of cognizance this is the tranquillity of one who has happiness and pleasure
So the confidence in oneself and the singleness of cognizance and the happiness and the pleasure are the four factored second meditation 
Third Meditation  As to  tranquil feels pleasure  after dispensing  with that outstanding bodily pleasure only mental pleasure remains this being fading  of happiness 
with the fading of happiness he obtains onlookingequanimity 
and also unification of cognizance This is the fivefactored third meditation 
Fourth Meditation As to pleased his cognizance is concentrated   this is unification Now  this  unification of the kind dealing with meditation is there also in the first meditation but owing to its being accompanied  there  by pleasant  feeling it does not  come altogether to fulfilment
there as in the fourth meditation Accordingly onlookingequanimity purified mindfulness neitherpainfulnor pleasant feeling and unification these are the fourth meditation 
And just as the Concentration Faculty can be shown thus in the four Meditations so too the Understanding Faculty can be shown in the four Truths
For as to concentrated understands how it is   this act ofunderstanding is fourfold namely understanding as ugly as impermanent as painful and as notself and then its object is the Noble Truth of Suffering Then as to finds dispassion and his lust fades this is the Path When  liberated  the abandoning accordingly of the taint of sensual desire the taint of being the taint of view and the taint of ignorance on reaching Arahantship is the Noble Truth of Cessation The Origin of taints is on the plane of unabandoned defilement
This is how the Understanding Faculty can be seen as the four Noble Truths
Likewise with the  Paths and Fruits  as to He who is concentrated understands how it is  this is the plane of seeing
And then when he understands how the fruit of StreamEntry is he finds dispassion and this is then the attenuation 
of lust for sensual desires and of ill will frrnished by the Path of OnceReturn And when he finds dispassion and his lust fades for the Fruit of OnceReturn this is the first plane of keeping meditation in being as the heartdeliverance due to fading of lust and it is the Fruit of NonReturn
What is called  deliverance  is the understandingdeliverance and it is Arahantship
Now these are the kinds of nonremorse and the Energy Faculty and the four right endeavours are also the kinds of nonremorse  And what follows down to  the concentration which is the four meditations in this way is the Concentration Faculty As to  he who is concentrated understands how it is 
this is the four foundations of mindfulness  Consequent upon the fulfilment of virtue due to its being connected with generosity they provide an undisturbed state of mind  for signs penetrative of the Truths This is the Mindfulness Faculty namely the four foundations of mindfulness
Again the faculty that owing to this teaching of the True Idea is in the three instances without inclusion  of wrong views and has the virtue that is only the Initiates owing to the abandonment of only a portion  of what is given up by the Arahant is the Faith Faculty
And these are the four factors of StreamEntry The fruits
as the concentration faculties  that are accompanied by what is deferred till higher  in the subsequent attainments  can be demonstrated in all Threads 
 Knowledge in one who remembers that the obtaining of meditation is got only through energy is understanding consisting in what is heard 
The concentration possessing illumination of the successive signs in their due order  owing to nonlapse in procedure is understanding consisting in cogitation And since one who is thus  concentrated understands how it is this is understanding consisting in keepinginbeing
This is a demonstration of the Thread
This Thread is one dealing with penetration It requites a discoverer it can be discovered
it is by means of the factors with which it is endowed that it will be discovered  its factors will discover  hence Enlightenment Factors 
Accordingly in so far as at the beginning of this Thread it is said   how does he fulfil the kinds of virtue
Energy for the nonarising of the unarisen unprofitable for the abandoning of the arisen unprofitable for the arousing of the unarisen profitable and for the increase of the arisen profitable is a factor  for that virtues being brought to enlightenment 
It is owing to this energy that there are the two ideas stated at the beginning of this Thread namely nonremorse and gladness and again any  happiness with the nonremorse as condition and with the gladness as condition is the Happiness Enlightenment Factor
and the abandoning of the roots 
these are two Truths namely Cessation and the Path
The cognizance is described by a description in terms of seed
The imbuing is described  by a description in terms of morality
The cognizance is the consciousness category in the case of the categories the mind consciousness element in the case of the elements the mind base in the case of the bases
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing Up
This which was the Blessed Ones utterance when questioned by Mahanama the Sakyan all in the question has been concluded with the answer
Auspicious destination   even for an enjoyer of sensual desires the form element the formless element and the human state are all  described by a unity  as  an auspicious destination  This is the Description
is a condition by causeconditionality
and reasoned attention is a condition
and nonremorse is the causecondition 
 Below is what is bygone past The above and the below are called the extent 
Herein as to this eternalistview the following fifteen of the twenty terms of the embodimentview belong to eternalism
and they  see that  taking it that  and similarly with the other four categories Such is the fourfold Embodimentview as annihilationism and eternalism
with the eternalistview and five clauses belong to prospective finiteness with the annihilationistview

What is the Blessed Ones Purport in this Thread
The five faculties beginning with faith when blunt are five hitherside  faculties
And seeing not at all that  I am this     this is not unilaterally always so for when someone  does this merely by outstanding intellectual effort in the plane of the worlds he certainly has not abandoned the embodimentview by the noble instrumentality 
his effort being merely that which is called outstandingness  in the plane born of that embodiment view 
 
this is the plane
the latter being the finitistview and the infinitistview the eternalistview
and the eternalistview is the noneedforactionview
Herein what are the Descriptions
the Path is described by a description in terms of obtaining
the faculties are described by a description in terms of obtaining
is its Origin is which is the Path
Such faculties as are demonstrated can be similarly made ways of entry and likewise in the cases of the categories elements and bases
Herein what are the Requisites
through it ignorance and determinations are the condition
This is the mans aim 
while the intimation of the aim of whatever idea the Blessed One teaches
and that for the abandoning of the arisen is the second and so on
accompanied by exploring
Then the happiness  that is born  in one happyminded  through gladness is happiness   and the bodily pleasure induced through the tranquillization of the body  is pleasure
and also any singleness  of cognizance and confidence ii oneself due to that singleness this is the fourth meditation factor in the second meditation
and he feels pleasure
and he obtains mindfulness and awareness
Let alone one year prince
thus this is the Energy Enlightenment Factor
he might dwell seven months
six monthsfive monthsfour monthsthree monthstwo monthsone monthhalf a month
Let alone half a month prince
As to happy his body becomes tranquillized 
this is the Tranquillity Enlightenment Factor
The bodily pleasure induced thereby since pleased his cognizance is concentrated is the Concentration Enlightenment Factor
As to concentrated understands how it is  this is the InvestigationofIdeas Enlightenment Factor
That owing to the virtue the employment of a sign  that is in conformity with the arising  of the five enlightenment factors so far mentioned is accompanied by their nonfloating away when partaking of steadiness  and partaking of distinction and does not come to lapse  this is the Mindfulness Enlightenment Factor
As to the clause he  understands how it is  he works overenergetically 
this being censured as the plane of idleness he becomes by means of these factors enlightened about how the course of the eye understanding coupled with quiet is onlookingequanimity  
This is the ThreadDemonstration

Herein what is the Investigation
In the case of each clause from No virtuous man has to choose how shall I have no remorse   down to deliverance  he framed  the reply to the question what is the aim of    thus each asking having two terms and each answer two terms the two terms by means of which there are the two instances of getting acquainted  are the very two terms by which the answer is given What is he asking about About a penetrative bodily plane for action  for it is accordingly that the standingpoint arouses the ideas that belong to the Adept
Herein what is the Construing
One who is virtuous has no remorse  How He is without wilfulness  and has fading of lust There is this construing
Herein what are the Footings
Energy is the footing for the energy faculty
Energy is the footing for nonhate
The energy faculty is the footing for three pathfactors for right effort right action and right livelihood 
Herein what are the Characteristics
When the virtue category is stated all the categories are stated  Whose cognizance is kept in being like this How shall suffering come to him     because virtue is itself like a rock  Just as a rock cannot be made to shudder  by any kind of opposition at all so too such cognizance does not shudder with any defilement at all  this is nondelusion
When one idea siding with enlightenment is stated all the ideas that arrive at enlightenment are stated
Herein what is the mode of Conveying a Fourfold Array
What is the Blessed Ones Purport in this Thread
It is that those with will for nonremorse are fulfillers of virtue those with will for gladness are fulfillers of nonremorse  and so on This is the Blessed Ones purport here This is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold Array
Herein what is the Conversion
This Thread is one dealing with penetration
Penetration is Cessation
This is the Conversion
 The virtuous man has no remorse  is a statement declarable after analysis For  
so although that is so nevertheless even when such good conduct misapprehended is well done still he has no gladness due to nonremorse  down to deliverance So the statement The virtuous man has no remorse is one declarable after analysis This is the Mode of Conveying an Analysis
Herein what is the Reversal
By means of these seven excellences in the stipulate  when abandoning abandon the eleven failures  in the stipulate This is the Reversal
Herein what are the Synonyms
These are synonyms for the following noble ideas namely the Powers Enlightenment Factors Liberations Concentrations and Excellences
Herein what are the Descriptions
The virtuous man has no remorse  is described under the Virtue Category by a description in terms of renunciation and by a description in terms of relinquishment Thus there are ten factors each described by two factors
Herein what are the Ways of Entry
This as a Thread dealing with penetration provides a way of entry in the five faculties   just as  was demonstrated above   with faculties etc so too they can be demonstrated in categories elements and bases
 Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing Up
When  The virtuous man has no remorse  is said the instigation  is not yet cleared up and when he who has no remorse is glad is said the instigation is not yet cleared up but when the eleven terms have been taught then the instigation is cleared up This is the Clearing Up
Herein what are the Terms of Expression
It is described in terms of diversity of virtue Thus the ten remaining terms  are all the reward of the virtue category  Requisites  And for these   is the condition and the cause For the concentration category the pleasure is the cause and the  tranquillity  the condition on which account there being also conascence with meditation in that jnstance  they are meditation factors  Another way  For concentration contemplation of disappointment in sensual desires is the condition and the state of seeing reward in renunciation is the cause
Herein what is the Coordination
The energy faculty is the virtue category
The virtue consists in the four ideas that are basic for the meditations 
any practice of ideas in accordance with the True Idea being restraint by PatimokkhaRule
The verse    The Threads Meaning As to the simile  as a rock  just as a rock neither shudders with the wind nor wavers with heat or with cold
as do many choiceless inanimate things while they wither with heat shrivel with cold and fltter with the wind not so a rock
 Is free from lust for lustprovoking things Untroubled too by trouble    cognizance thus free from lust for lust provoking things through fadingoflust  is untroubled by trouble
What is the reason
Reversal as to  How shall suffering come to him   there is no mental pleasure in the case of the extinction element without trace leftbut there is in the case of that with trace left
The pleasure that one who has entered upon the attainment of cessation of perception and feeling has does not belong to the actual occasion This distinction is the Reversal here
Herein what are the Synonyms
 Whose cognizance is thus kept in being   kept in being well kept in being established made the basis well instigated 
 Cognizance   mind consciousness mind faculty mindconsciousness element
Herein what are the Descriptions
Suffering is described by a description in terms of what is annihilated
Herein what are the Ways of Entry
When cognizance is demonstrated the five categories are demonstrated this is the way of entry in the case of the categories When the mind consciousness element is demonstrated the eighteen elements are demonstrated this is the way of entry in the case of the elements
When the mind base is demonstrated all the bases are demonstrated
Herein the mind base as consciousness is the footing for name andform
Herein what is the Clearing up The instigation is already cleared up
Herein what are the Terms of Expression
The keeping of the sixth  faculty in being is described  by a unity through being based on the sixth  the body is described by a unity
Herein what is the Requisite
The prior cause for the arising of cognizance is attention and a leaning thereto since it is owing to not keeping ideas partaking of distinction in being that cognizance goes on continuously in the unconcentrated plane The cause of concentration is pleasure and its condition is nonremorse  This  is the Requisite
Herein what is the Coordination
Whose cognizance is thus kept in being  the ideas to be coordinated with that are as follows 
the body the virtue the understanding and the cognizance kept in being They being each uninflected undefiected unsuperfiuous undeficient their attainability unclungto this is the right concentration that belongs to the Adept Monks State not to that of the Initiate So all the Adepts ten Arahantideas have been demonstrated
The type of Thread dealing with the Adept
  In this Thread  there are two terms  this venerable one disclaims and two terms he claims  they are abandonment of craving in keeping cognizance in being and abandonment of views in keeping the body in being The first simile he gives is thus  
Earth is neither distressed nor disgusted with the impure and the pure nor does it gain happiness and gladness therefrom  so too I  abide with an abundant  measureless  heart without risk and ill will 
Demonstration of the Thread What is it that the venerableone claims He claims abandoning of the bodilypleasure faculty through keeping the body in being ie contemplation of the body as a body and he claims abandoning of the mental joy faculty through keeying cognizance in being ie contemplation of cognizance as cognizance
Bodily pleasant feeling is underlain  by the underlying tendency to lust and that kind of pleasure faculty he rejects
And while the contemplation of the body as a pleasant abiding here and now
with the body the ground  for defilement and with cognizance cognizances dependence ie the body With cognizance well kept in being he claims to abide in the seven attainments
he might dwell seven days and nights
six days and nightsfive days and nights four days and nightsthree days and nightstwo days and nightsone day and night
this being taken as the plane of agitation he drives it overslackly  
hence taking it that it is on this account that the onlookingequanimity is a factor of that enlightenment it is called the OnlookingEquanimity Enlightenment Factor
There was an occasion when the Blessed One was living at Kosambi in Ghositas Park
concentration is the footing tor the concentration faculty
understanding is the footing for the understanding faculty
concentration is the footing for nongreed
and said to him Venerable sir the prince or princess in my womb whichever it may be goes to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
understanding is the footing for nondelusion
the concentration faculty is the footing for three pathfactors for right intention right speech and right concentration 
the understanding faculty is the footing for two pathfactors for right mindfulness and right view
she stood at one side and said to him Venerable sir this Prince Bodhi goes to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
When virtue  is stated since virtue is the cause and condition for all the remaining ten ideas in this Thread all those ideas are stated too
Herein what is the Analysis
that whereby he finds dispassion is the Path
that which ceases is Suffering and that which is abandoned by the path leading to penetration is Origin
That it is  free from lust for lustprovoking things  is nongreed 
That it is untroubled too by any trouble is nonhate
Herein the profitable root nondelusion is understanding the nongreed is simply nongreed and the nonhate is simply nonhate
One steadied in the Initiates plane by these three profitable roots arouses the Adepts path
He arouses ideas that surmount the Initiates plane and these are the ten ideas belonging to Arahantship namely the Adepts right view  down to  his right concentration right deliverance and knowing and seeing of the taste  of deliverance 
Herein with the eightfactored path the fourfold keepingin being is also obtained
namely keeping virtue in being keeping the body in being keeping cognizance in being and keeping understanding in being 
Herein the body is kept in being by right action and right livelihood
virtue is kept in being by right speech and right effort
cognizance is kept in being by right intention and right concentration
and understanding is kept in being by right view and right mindfulness
With this fourfold keepinginbeing two ideas come to fulfilment through keeping in being namely cognizance  and understanding
Through the keepinginbeing the cognizance becomes Quiet and through the keepinginbeing the understanding becomes Insight
Herein cognizance is made unadulterated  by imperfections with the abandoning of ignorance that is owed to understanding
The keeping of cognizance in being is itself brought to complete fulfilment by the keeping of the Arahants understanding in being
When his cognizance is well  kept in being like this How shall suffering come to him  
Furthermore that venerable one  believed in the element of nonillwill and also he had entered upon a higher attainment when the spirit  gave him the blow so no pain was felt in his physical frame when attacked  by the spirit This is the Threadmeaning
Herein what is the Teaching
In this Thread the ten ideas of Arahantship belonging to the Adept are taught and keeping of measureless  concentration in being
Herein what is the Investigation
The state of being like a rock  whatever ideas are included in what can be felt as pleasure and pain  have all been left behind for those who contemplate only the unformed The requisite for what is felt as a body not being made to occur he does not feel pain
Herein what is the Construing  Whose cognizance is thus kept in being How shall suffering come to him 
There are three kinds of keepinginbeing in which cognizance does not suffer pain
namely in keeping cognizance  in being which is the Meditations in keeping Cessation in being which is the Paths and in keeping straightresulting concentration in being which is the Paths Fruits
So Whose cognizance is thus kept in being this is the footing for the fruit of the concentration
Herein what are the Characteristics
 Whose cognizance is thus kept in being  is the four  kinds of what is kept in being demonstrated above  namely understanding virtue body and cognizance Virtue is well kept in being and because he is bodily and mentally  steady  he does not  shudder   and so also feeling and perception and determinations
How shall suffering come to him  also no pleasure follows after him and no neitherpainnorpleasure comes
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold Array
What is the Blessed Ones Purport here
It is that those who are beyond suffering abide in such attainments as these
This is the Blessed Ones purport here
And it is that those with no confidence will become confident and when they are confident  they will have happiness and gladness This is the Blessed Ones purport here
Conversion there is no plane of conversion here
Analysis  As to Whose cognizance is thus kept in being How shall suffering come to him the demonstration is twofold as demonstration of the cause of suffering and as demonstration of the opposite
What is the cause of suffering
No grief  about what is hateprovoking  makes it hate  not hating it will not be troubled  hence it is untroubled by trouble It is that from which suffering comes And as to the demonstration of the opposite it is demonstrated thus   How will suffering come to one such as this 
Again at the same time however they have said  thus At that moment at that period in both cases it is not felt in that with trace left  nor in that without trace left
Cognizance is described by a description in terms of pacification of mind determinations
Concentration is described  by a description in terms of the Adept
with nameandform as condition the sixfold base 
so in the case of dependent arising
this is the way of entry
but not the whole feeling category Any mental pleasant feeling that arises there does so with the obtaining of the concentration attainment as condition
Herein under the four Great Entities  he mentions the abandoning of approval  and resistance in regard to the form category 
he rejects the joy that is the mental pleasure but not all feeling born of mindcontact
and the sensual desires as well as the form and that too in the Adepts plane
it is through power and through activity  that there is abandoning of all kinds of attention  With the similes of the GreasePot  and the Man Fond of Ornaments there is shown his reviewing of this body given its being by a mother and a father   With the body and with contemplation of the body and with cognizance and with contemplation of cognizance he remembers two ideas
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the venerable Maha Kaccana was living at Madhura in the Gunda Grove
Now a good report of Master Kaccana has been spread to this effect He is wise discerning sagacious learned articulate and perspicacious he is aged and he is an arahant
It is good to see such arahants
Then King Avantiputta of Madhura had a number of state carriages made ready and mounting a state carriage he drove out from Madhura with the full pomp of royalty in order to see the venerable Maha Kaccana
He went thus as far as the road was passable for carriages and then he got down from his carriage and went forward on foot to the venerable Maha Kaccana
He exchanged greetings with him and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
What does Master Kaccana say about that
It is just a saying in the world great king that Brahmins are the highest casteheirs of Brahma
And there is a way whereby it can be understood how that statement of the brahmins is just a saying in the world
What do you think great king If a noble prospers in wealth grain silver or gold will there be nobles who rise before him and retire after him who are eager to serve him who seek to please him and speak sweetly to him and will there also be brahmins merchants and workers who do likewise
There will be Master Kaccana
What do you think great king If a brahmin prospers in wealth grain silver or gold will there be brahmins who rise before him and retire after him who are eager to serve him who seek to please him and speak sweetly to him and will there also be merchants workers and nobles who do likewise
There will be Master Kaccana
What do you think great king If a merchant prospers in wealth grain silver or gold will there be merchants who rise before him and retire after him who are eager to serve him who seek to please him and speak sweetly to him and will there also be workers nobles and brahmins who do likewise
There will be Master Kaccana
What do you think great king If a worker prospers in wealth grain silver or gold will there be workers who rise before him and retire after him who are eager to serve him who seek to please him and speak sweetly to him and will there also be nobles brahmins and merchants who do likewise
There will be Master Kaccana
What do you think great king If that is so then are these four castes all the same or are they not
Surely if that is so Master Kaccana then these four castes are all the same
That is a way great king whereby it can be understood how that statement of the brahmins is just a saying in the world
What do you think great king Suppose a noble were to kill living beings take what is not given misconduct himself in sensual pleasures speak falsely speak maliciously speak harshly gossip be covetous have a mind of ill will and hold wrong view On the dissolution of the body after death would he be likely to reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell or not
If a noble were such Master Kaccana he would be likely to reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell
That is how it appears to me in this case and thus I have heard from the arahants
What do you think great king Suppose a brahmina merchant a worker were to kill living beingsand hold wrong view On the dissolution of the body after death would he be likely to reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell or not
If a brahmina merchanta worker were such Master Kaccana he would be likely to reappear in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell
That is how it appears to me in this case and thus I have heard from the arahants
What do you think great king If that is so then are these four castes all the same or are they not
Surely if that is so Master Kaccana then these four castes are all the same
That is also a way great king whereby it can be understood how that statement of the brahmins is just a saying in the world
What do you think great king Suppose a noble were to abstain from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech from malicious speech from harsh speech and from gossip and were to be uncovetous to have a mind without ill will and to hold right view On the dissolution of the body after death would he be likely to reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world or not
If a noble were such Master Kaccana he would be likely to reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world
That is how it appears to me in this case and thus I have heard from the arahants
What do you think great king Suppose a brahmina merchant a worker were to abstain from killing living beings and to hold right view On the dissolution of the body after death would he be likely to reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world or not
If a brahmina merchanta worker were such Master Kaccana he would be likely to reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world
That is how it appears to me in this case and thus I have heard from the arahants
What do you think great king If that is so then are these four castes all the same or are they not
Surely if that is so Master Kaccana then these four castes are all the same
That is also a way great king whereby it can be understood how that statement of the brahmins is just a saying in the world
What do you think great king Suppose a noble were to break into houses plunder wealth commit burglary ambush highways or seduce anothers wife and if your men arrested him and produced him saying Sire this is the culprit
We would have him executed Master Kaccana or we would have him fined or we would have him exiled or we would do with him as he deserved
Why is that
Because he has lost his former status of a noble and is simply reckoned as a robber
What do you think great king Suppose a brahmina merchanta worker were to break into housesor seduce anothers wife and if your men arrested him and produced him saying Sire this is the culprit
We would have him executed Master Kaccana or we would have him fined or we would have him exiled of we would do with him as he deserved
Why is that
Because he has lost his former status of a brahmina merchanta worker and is simply reckoned as a robber
What do you think great king If that is so then are these four Castes all the same or are they not
Surely if that is so Master Kaccana then these four castes are all the same
That is also a way great king whereby it can be understood how that statement of the brahmins is just a saying in the world
What do you think great king Suppose a noble having shaved off his hair and beard put on the yellow robe and gone forth from the home life into homelessness were to abstain from killing living beings from taking what is not given and from false speech Refraining from eating at night he would eat only in one part of the day and would be celibate virtuous of good character
How would you treat him
We would pay homage to him Master Kaccana or we would rise up for him or invite him to be seated or we would invite him to accept robes almsfood resting place and medicinal requisites or we would arrange for him lawful guarding defence and protection
Why is that
Because he has lost his former status of a noble and is simply reckoned as a recluse
What do you think great king Suppose a brahmina merchant a worker having shaved off his hair and beardand would be celibate virtuous of good character
How would you treat him
We would pay homage to him Master Kaccana or rise up for him or invite him to be seated or we would invite him to accept robes almsfood resting place and medicinal requisites or we would arrange for him lawful guarding defence and protection

Surely if that is so Master Kaccana then these four castes are all the same
That is also a way great king whereby it can be understood how that statement of the brahmins is just a saying in the world
When this was said King Avantiputta of Madhura said to the venerable Maha Kaccana Magnificent Master Kaccana Magnificent Master Kaccana
Master Kaccana has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who is lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms
From today let Master Kaccana remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
Do not go to me for refuge great king
Go for refuge to that same Blessed One to whom I have gone for refuge
Where is he living now that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened Master Kaccana
That Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened has attained to final Nibbana great king
If we heard that that Blessed One was within ten leagues we would go ten leagues in order to see that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
If we heard that that Blessed One was within twenty leaguesthirty leaguesforty leaguesfifty leagues
a hundred leagues we would go a hundred leagues in order to see that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
From today let Master Kaccana remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
King Avantiputta of Madhura heard The recluse Kaccana is living at Madhura in the Gunda Grove
And  in the simile of the Householder  just as were a householders son to have a clotheschest full of variously dyed clothes then whatever pair of clothes he wanted in the morning he would put on  in the morning and similarly at noon and in the evening so too because this venerable ones cognizance is well kept in being whatever kind of abiding he wants to abide in in the morning such he abides in in the morning and similarly at noon and in the evening
With this  simile there is stated by that same venerable one the following fivefold  unsurpassed Keeping of Faculties in Being   
  With cognizance kept in being that venerable one claims this eightfold keeping in being namely the keeping of the body in being in the similes of the four Great Entities and the keeping of cognizance in being in the similes of the bull the savage the man and the greasepot  doing so in virtue of these kinds of keeping in being With the former kind of keeping in being he implies fulfilment of quiet
and with the latter four he implies the fulfilment of understanding
The body is by nature repulsive  Perception of the bloated corpsestage in the body etc in brief the nine corpsestage perceptions  these are repulsive ideas And this venerable one undisgusted with the repulsive abides devoted to the pursuit of keeping in being Mindfulness Occupied with the Body  for his cognizance has no repulsion through his having abandoned disgust
 How does he abide percipient of the repulsive in unrepulsive ideas
To all the world the body is unrepulsive This venerable one abides with perception of it as ugly
That is how he abides percipient of the repulsive in unrepulsive ideas
 How does he abide percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive ideas It is repulsive  to all the world  that  shaven and with bowl in hand there wanders for alms among the clans this venerable one with goldencoloured  unrepulsive  body Therein  he is percipient of the unrepulsive with cognizance accompanied by dispassion That is how he abides percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive ideas
 How does he abide percipient of the repulsive  in unrepulsiveandrepulsive ideas
In the case of ideas such as the female form that are unrepulsive  to one percipient of beauty therein and in the case of ideas such as the discoloured and festering corpsestages that are repulsive to one disgusted by them therein this veneable one abides percipient of the repulsive
 How does he avoid both the repulsive and unrepulsive and abide in onlookingequarumity mindful and aware   In the case of ideas such as the female form that are unrepulsive to one percipient of beauty therein
That is how he avoids both and abides in onlooking equanimity mindful and aware
Another way
 All foolish ordinary men have perception of the unrepulsive in lifeinaworld in the triple element  of existence
Herein the venerable Sariputta abides percipient of the repulsive
That is how he abides percipient of the repulsive in unrepulsive ideas
 How does he abide percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsive ideas
With regard to that world one who has reached the plane of Him Who Has Done  and has verified the fruits of concentration abides percipient of the unrepulsive
What is the reason
Because there is no longer any reason why he should arouse perception of the repulsive  for the purpose of abandoning any world since that has been completed by him
 How does he abide percipient of the repulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive  ideas
That is how he abides percipient of the repulsive in repulsiveand unrepulsive  ideas
 How does he abide percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive ideas
Whatever there is from another of verbal modes  illspoken  and unwelcome  that speech is repulsive  to the ordinary hearer  but as to the speaker with regard to such  speech such a person has perception of the unrepulsive
With regard to that kind of speech the venerable Sariputta having verified it by direct acquaintanceship abides percipient of the unrepulsive That is how he abides percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive ideas
 How does he avoid both the repulsive and the unrepulsive  and abide in onlookingequanimity mindful and aware
Herein the venerable Sariputta considers thus Ideas consisting in misconduct have unwishedfor ripening 
Then again  he abides percipient of the repulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive ideas
Craving is a repulsive idea What is the reason
It is because creatures are clung by two ideas  they are clung to physical nutriment by craving for taste and they are clung to contact by perception of pleasure
Herein the venerable Sariputta abides percipient of the repulsive in physical nutriment and he abides percipient of pain in contact 
That is how he abides percipient of the repulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive ideas
 How does he abide percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsive ideas 
Herein the venerable Sariputta has perception of unrepulsiveness  and perception of nonillwill having seen for himself  with understanding That is how he abides percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsive ideas
 How does he abide percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsiveandunrepulsive ideas
There are those who  are percipient of the repulsive in extinction and are percipient of the unrepulsive in fame and renown
 How does he avoid both the repulsive and the unrepulsive  and abide in onlookingequanimity
  This is the fivefold unsurpassed Keeping of the Faculties in Being 
This is the ThreadDemonstration
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a teaching
Herein what is the Investigation
When people abide contemplating the body their cognizance does not abide with approval  and resistance and when someone does not  delight in approval and resistance his cognizance will become even  so this is the power of keeping in being This is the Mode of Conveying an Investigation
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Construing
Owing to keeping the body in being and owing to keeping cognizance in being he will not slight companions in the divine life  at all
There is this construing This is the Mode of Conveying a Construing
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Footings
Herein what are the Characteristics
What does as even as earth mean
This is the Characteristic
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold Array
This is the purport
Herein what is the Conversion
There is no plane of conversion
Herein what is the Analysis
What is the reason
Those who have their virtue tom etc rent etc do not obtain cognizance as even as earth
but all mindfulness occupied with the body ends in  extinction and the fruit of the Path in the Initiates keepingin being This is the Analysis
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Reversal
Those who will abide contemplating the body for them too may arise taints and fever of distress with the body as condition  This is the Mode of Conveying a Reversal
Herein what are the Ways of Entry
In the case of creatures  the five categories are made ways of entry and the twentytwo  faculties likewise
The mind faculty is the mind element and mind base  the concentration faculty is the idea element and the idea base
This is the Mode of Conveying Ways of Entry
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing Up
The four that should be kept in being by the mind have all been kept in being That which can be reached  by the mind in abandoning has all been reached  and since the instigation was for the purpose of that  that purpose has been cleared up
This is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing Up
Herein what are the Terms of Expression
for the five faculties with form beginning with the eye are the formbody
These are the Terms of Expression
Requisite skill in attainment and skill in steadiness  are the cause
Pleasure is the cause and nonaffliction the condition
This is the Requisite
Herein what is the Coordination
As earth remains indifferent whether what is pure is thrown on it or whether what is impure is thrown on it so the body remains indifferent to both agreeable contacts and disagreeable contacts  and so cognizance remains indifferent to resistancecontact  or to pleasant feeling
This Thread is analysed with its similes  by an analysis for a person who gains knowledge from what is condensed
Herein there is no opportunity for a coordination
Herein what is the type of Thread dealing with corruption and dealing with morality
How one does not grow  does not increase in profitable ideas this disappointment the Blessed One teaches with the words But then What is open it soddens not   so one should open out so as to be safe from that disappointment  It is in virtue of three ideas that there is no rainsoddening   in virtue of perception of ugliness one is not rainsoddened  by lust
in virtue of lovingkindness one is not rainsoddened  by hate
In this way whatever idea is the opposite of that unprofit in such ideas one will reach fullfilment
Another way
It is the ideas where emergence from transgression is not possible by oneself  that are taught by the phrase
Rain soddens what is covered up though they have that means  whereby they can be emerged from Again in the second part of the verse it is taught how also to keep in being to purify the cognizance of one who tends leans and inclines to seclusion from defilement so that he enters upon maturity growth and abundance in profitable ideas Like a blue or a white or a red lotus in water when  the moon comes in the bright half then  through the day or through the night only its increase is to be expected not its diminution in suchwise is this kind of cognizance not rainsoddened
Another here also An uncheating unfraudulent undeceitful straight man reveals himself as he is
Herein it is when someone conceals unprofitable ideas that overrun his cognizance
that rain soddens what is covered up  But when one who is an unfraudulent uncheating undeceitful straight man reveals himself as he is
his cognizance is not rainsoddened  by unprofitable ideas This is the Threads meaning
Herein what is the Teaching
according as was said by the Blessed One 
Herein what is the Investigation
Whose cognizance is thus rainsoddened that would be an ordinary mans   but one who has the straightresulting concentration  would open it up  for the purpose of emergence therefrom again  This is the Investigation
Herein what is the Construing
Cognizance that is not being rainsoddened  thus emerges  from the defilement
and being emerged it becomes established in profitable ideas There is this construing
Footings Rain soddens what is covered up  the covered up is the footing for the kinds of nonrestraint  But what is open it soddens not  the uncoveredup is the footing for the kinds of restraint
 So open out what is covered up That rain may never sodden you  is the footing for confession
Characteristics Rain soddens what is covered up   whatever ideas have a single characteristic with the coveredup cognizance are all rainsoddened
But what is open it soddens not  whatever ideas have a single characteristic with the uncovered are all not rainsoddened This is the Mode of Conveying Characteristics
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold Array
What is the Blessed Ones Purport in this Thread
Those who have confessed  unprofitable ideas in their cognizance will make amends according to the True Idea This is the Blessed Ones purport herein
This is the Fourfold Array
Conversion What is covered up is of two kinds  it is that in the case of the negligent  ie ordinary men and of those incapable  of concealment  through their having
the straight resulting concentration  ie Initiates 
Herein when there is lack of faith  conceit increases taints And through lack of faith one comes to negligence Through negligence one despises and comes to pride
And this is said by the Blessed One  Now these are the four assumings and the four assumings are the five categories of assuming 
These are the truths of Suffering and Origin
That is why one should open what is covered up  of the  cause by which the taints increase
with the abandoning the taints are abandoned
Herein lack of faith is abandoned through diligence and pride  through the abandoning of agitationand worry In him two ideas namely quiet and insight come  to fulfilment this is the Path
The exhaustion of those taints is Cessation
These are the four Truths This is the Conversion
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying an Analysis
 Rain soddens what is covered up is not unilaterally always so
What is the reason
Although his  ie the Initiates cognizance may be affected by hindrances through these evil acts
yet that can be demonstrated as not a condition for rainsoddening in his case This is the Mode of Conveying an Analysis
Herein the Reversal
This is the Mode of Conveying a Reversal
Herein what are the Synonyms
The  covered up  is the shut in shut off sealed off closed off covered over buried away   But what is open it soddens not   he who has abandoned these ideas has removed them  not endured them made an end of them This is the Mode of Conveying Synonyms
Herein what are the Descriptions
Rain soddens what is covered up  is described in terms of what deals with corruption  But what is open it soddens not is any function connected with the True Idea described by a description in terns of the way  So open out what is covered up  is described by a description in terms of instruction  That rain may never sodden you   is described by a description in terms of source  This is the Mode of Conveying Descriptions
 Rain soddens what is covered up   There are three defilements namely lust hate and delusion In the case of the categories these are the deterninations category  etc  these are as demonstrated earlier in the cases of the categories elements and bases This is the Mode of Conveying Ways of Entry
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing Up
The instigation with which this Thread was uttered has been completed
Terms of Expression  Rain soddens what is covered up is described by a unity
What is the reason
Herein what are the Requisites
These are the two causes  and unreasoned attention and relinquishment  of profitable ideas these are the two conditions
 How does he  abide percipient of the unrepulsive in repulsive ideas
and in the case of ideas such as the discoloured and festering corpsestages that are repulsive to one disgusted by them avoiding both these he abides seeing them thus 
All Initiates are percipient of herewhere   in the triple element in all the world
In the case of lifeinaworld in the triple element there is that constancy of repulsion which  NonReturners without lust for the plane of the sensualdesire world  have towards that world and constancy of unrepulsion they have towards the formelement and formless element
and as to that the venerable Sariputta abides percipient of the repulsive
When someone does not see ideas consisting in misconduct as such those are unrepulsive  to him
ideas consisting in good conduct lead to amassing
but after taking good conduct to lead to dispersal  and by taking misconduct to have unwishedfor ripening avoiding both these he abides in onlookingequanimity
Exhaustion of craving is the unsurpassed extinction therein  foolish ordinary men have perception of repulsiveness and perception of being killed
The venerable Sariputta who understands  with right understanding of how the gratification the disappointment and the escape come to be herein abides   percipient of the unrepulsive
mindful and aware According as he sees it approval is an unrepulsive idea   and according as he sees it   resistance is a repulsive idea  herein the venerable Sariputta owing to his abandoning of approval and resistance   avoiding both the repulsive and the unrepulsive   abides in onlookingequanimity mindful and aware
What is taught  in this Thread
Herein it can be stated that a pleasant abiding here and now is taught likewise liberated cognizance and reviewing and the idea of the higher understanding  is taught
Cognizances being as even as earth  is the footing for the contemplation of impermanence
Keeping the body in being  is the footing for the first Foundation of Mindfulness
In that he abides with cognizance as even as earth he abides also  contemplating himself as even as earth
Like those unassociated with shuddering  owing to resemblance to a rock so too this venerable one is as even as earth owing to ashamedness of this body
What is the venerable ones Purport in this proseexposition
It is that all Arahants who wish for the keeping of the Faculties in Being will arouse earth evenness
That he who abides contemplating the body will obtain cognizance as even as earth is unilaterally always so
This concentration is described by a unity The six bodies are described by a unity
the six bodies of feeling are the feelingbody
the six bodies of perception are the perceptionbody
the six bodies of choice are the choicebody
and the six bodies of consciousness are the consciousnessbody
and all these are the ideabody as it is called
and skill in resort and skill in health are the condition 
skill in emerging  is the cause and the health the condition
in virtue of insight one is not rainsoddened  by delusion
and any unprofitable idea which is the opposite of that idea by that one will not be rainsoddened
Here the ten unprofitable courses of action are taught in rainsoddening  and the ten profitable courses of action in nonrainsoddening  For one is not purified by unprofitable ideas
Someone may have stopped as in the Initiates case
according as is said by the Blessed One 
Although the Initiate can still do evil By body or by speech or by the mind
Yet he can never hide it and this fact Is of one who has seen the State of Peace 
 Rain soddens what is covered up   when someone has any such  ideas all that are not opened up  are rainsoddened  But what is open it soddens not   rain does not sodden what is uncovered
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Ways of Entry
Since this diversity namely that rain soddens and for him it rainsoddens and thus it rainsoddens is described by characteristics that are qualities  shared in common the description is in terns of a unity
There are two causes and two conditions  for its being rainsoddened  concern with what is unprofitable and delight in having oneself well  spoken of
Herein what is the Coordination
 Rain soddens what is covered up he sees indecision in whether not to accept that not to confess the coveredup is of no concern Now with the unprofitable root delusion thus unevident owing to wondering  and with craving these defects  increase So interpreting it thus these are determinations consisting in determinativeacts
With determinations as condition consciousness   down to  ageinganddeath This is the coordination
And  again while with the teaching thus in the form of Arising his unprofitable ideas attain maturity growth and abundance nevertheless with Cessation of his determinations  This is the Coordination
 Four types of persons the dark with a dark supreme value     The Threads Meaning Herein what is  dark 
 Dark  is gloom as stated by the Blessed One  so too as to unknowing there is dark as gloom there one has no faith about evil with its action and its ripening  
So it is any thuscharacterized unknowing dark ignorance delusion whereby creatures  do not understand  how it is So it is called dark
And that is dark for the three eyes namely for the fleshly eye for the heavenly eye and for the eye of understanding for these three eyes Here dark is demonstrated as unknowing
Herein what is unknowing It is unseeing
in the eight  instances namely unknowing about the four Noble Truths unknowing about past finiteness unknowing about future finiteness unknowing about pastandfuture finiwness unknowing about specific conditionality in the forms of unknowing about cause and unknowing about condition
just as he is called  deluded  so this 
  Herein what is the  dark with a bright supreme value 
  He comports himself in that kind of understanding When he comports himself thus he has that for his supreme value
This type of person is called  dark with a bright supreme value  
Herein how does that type of person have a  bright supreme value
Herein the light of knowledge that is inseparable from the idea of one willing to hear  about an idea that is a guideline of the opposite kind to that same dark  is what is called  bright  This  is the type of person that is  dark with a bright supreme value    Herein it may be stated as follows  This  type of person who is  dark with a bright supreme value  if he obtains a good friend such as will keep him from unprofit and encourage him in only keeping what is profitable in being
 These ideas are profitable these ideas are unprofitable 
these ideas should be entered upon and abode in these ideas should not be entered upon and abode in 
these ideas should be given attention these ideas should not be given attention
He is willing to hear those ideas he gives ear prepares his cognizance for knowledge and he likes pondering  those ideas Being possessed of understandingconsistinginwhat is heard he  comports himself with that  kind of understanding When he comports himself thus  he comes to have that as the ultimate to have that for supreme value 
This is called the dark person with a bright supreme value 
 Herein what is the  bright person with a dark supreme value 
The light of knowledge that is inseparable from the idea of one willing to hear  about an idea that is a guideline of the opposite kind to that same dark  is what is called  bright 
In regard to understanding he is called wise  he understands thus  
But here he cultivates evil friends obeys the power of evil friends he increases unprofitable ideas and abandons profitable ideas
Owing to this negligence giving no attention to perception of conditions he cultivates unmindfulness and unawareness
He increases the dark which is the opposite of that same light
This is called the type of person that is bright with a dark supreme value
 Herein what is the bright person with a bright supreme value 
Herein it may be stated as follows  This  type of person with a good friend for his support is one who is an able  seeker after what is profitable Approaching good friends he asks he questions  thus  
How is there a tether ie bond of responsibility for action How is there liberation
How is there an origin to embodiment How is there a cessation to embodiment
 and it being taught how it appears established here when he practises rightly accordingly he understands thus 
These ideas are profitable these ideas are unprofitable  
and so on down to  how there is an origin to embodiment  how there is a cessation to embodiment to be given in detail
He rightly practises  those ideas and thus he increases vision   knowledge science light
That type of person comes to have that as the ultimate that as supreme value This is called the  bright person with a bright supreme value 
 Herein what is the dark person with a dark supreme value 
He is one who illustrates the unprofitable idea
who owing to keeping that in being shows reappearance in inferior destinations He comes to have that as the ultimate that as supreme value
This is called the  dark person with a dark supreme value 
 Herein the  dark person with a bright supreme value 
By the dark he shows the ripening of unprofitable action
Herein since he shows reappearance in the superior destinations having that as the ultimate he is therefore said to have a  bright supreme value 
 Herein the bright person with a dark supreme value
Yet  by association with bad friends by waiting on bad friends hy obeying the power of bad friends he increases the unprofitable idea Owing to the keeping of that in being he shows reappearance in inferior destinations
he comes to have that as the ultimate hence he is called bright with a dark supreme value 
 Herein the  bright person with a bright supreme value  Owing to brightenedness he shows reappearance in superior destinations he comes to have that as the ultimate
hence they say that he is  bright with a bright supreme value 
By the dark he shows the eight wrongnesses
By the  bright with a dark supreme value  he shows the ten unprofitable courses of action 
This is the ThreadMeaning
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Teaching
Herein it may be stated that in this Thread profitable and unprofitable ideas are taught
This is the Mode of Conveying a Teaching
 Herein what is the Mode of Conveying an investigation
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Footings
By the bright type of person he shows the footing for reviewing
By the dark with a bright supreme value  he shows the footing for diligence By the dark he shows the footing for ignorance and for wrong view
By the  bright with a dark supreme value  he shows the footing for negligence and wrong view
These are the Footings
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Characteristics
With the dark with a dark supreme value when cognizance is demonstrated as  dark  all defiling ideas are demonstrated
With the bright  with a bright supreme value when science is demonstrated all ideas siding with enlightenment are demonstrated
By the  bright with a dark supreme value  negligence is demonstrated
By the  dark with a bright supreme value  diligence is demonstrated
This is the Mode of Conveying Characteristics
What is the Blessed Ones Purport in this Thread
It is this even  those creatures that belong to lowborn clans on hearing this will undertake and carry out profitable ideas
This is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold Array
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Conversion
The craving given existence  by ignorance is the Origin of Suffering
The  dark with a dark supreme value  is Suffering
These are two Truths namely Suffering and Origin Whatever Threadidea the  bright  is described by that idea is the footing for the understanding faculty
By means of such nondelusion the three profitable roots come to fulfilment which is the footing for heaven
 Dark with a dark supreme value is not unilaterally always so
What is the reason
There is the dark kind and yet its existence is in a state with future reappearance  as the bright type of person owing to profitable action to be felt in some future period 
and there is the bright kind and yet its existence is in a state with future rearising as the dark type of person owing to unprofitable action to be felt in some future period   Reversal In the case of the  dark  types the opposite is the  bright types 
Herein what are the Synonyms
He who is  dark  is thus practising for his own aflliction through lack of faith is a fool unskilled in profit unexpert uncontemplating of disappointment
He who is  bright  is practising for his own welfare is wise skilled in profit expert and a contemplator of disappointment
These are the Synonyms
Herein what are the Descriptions
This  dark person is described by a description in terms of ripening  he is described by a description in terms of the state of being gripped in the unprofitable
The  bright  type is described by a description in terms of reappearance due to profitable ideas  and by a description in terms of ripening of profitable ideas
Ways of Entry With ignorance as condition determinations  down to  ageinganddeath and ignorance is the footing by demonstration With the arising of science  down to  cessation of ageinganddeath   this is the way of entry by dependent arising And these two ideas are included in the determinations category
The idea element and the idea base are the footing by demonstration in the case of the elements etc
Herein what is the Clearing Up
It is the instigation of this Thread as taught
Terms of Expression When the Blessed One spoke of the dark type for instance he does not teach a single type of person
but rather in so far as creatures have destiriation he demonstrates as  dark  in the plural those who have reappeared there through an action consisting in misconduct
 Bright  is reappearance due to profitable actions in the case of all creatures and all that is what he refers  to as  bright  With this unity  as condition this is a description in terms of reasoned attention of the four persons as principal entitytypes
Herein what are the Requisites
For unprofit having evil friends is the condition  and unreasoned attention the cause 
Herein what is the Coordination
Here someone is born again  in a lowborn clan Being born again  in a lowborn clan he has reappeared among inferior unprofitable  forms sounds odours flavours and tangibles and all human use of possessions
The  bright  type has reappeared among superior profitable kinds and all human use of possessions
Herein what is the type of Thread dealing with corruption and dealing with penetration
An example is the verse 
For what reason is that bond not  strong
For four reasons One can get free from it by ones own lordly position or by riches or else through another by petitioning or by legal procedure
But as to the bond consisting in lusting for jewels and gems And concern for a wife and for children as well   they are a mental bond for one
from which one cannot get free by ones own lordly position or by riches or else through another by petitioning or by legal procedure
divine or human to whom one could say Get me free  from the bond with this   By means of the underlying tendency to lust this bond binds one to the six external bases 
He who is bound here in the world of this life is guided  to the next world bound
He can never get free except by way of the Noble Path For it is through finding this bond 
and the state of dying and the state of reappearing to be fearful that he comes to abandon will and lust
By abandoning will and lust he surmounts
Herein the abandoning of determinations that are due to bondage is elsewhere stated thus   With chattels a Stilled One remains unbesmirched 
since in regard to chattels consisting in children and wives he   and one such as this shows the abandoning of that same craving
with the abandoning of the cravings root  He does so   for it is owing to negligence that sensual desire occurs He who delights in the renunciation due to their abandoning is one who abides diligent
And it is with his abandoning of hope  from these that he hopes neither for this world nor for a next world
He does not wish for anything endearing and gratifying that has this world for its support
nor does he wish for anything endearing and gratifying that has another world for its support Hence it is said that 
His abandoning is the  severance    Now the  Stilled One thus demonstrated in the Chapter of Octets 
is the  steadfast one here   and the nonhoping  demonstrated in the Chapter of Octets is the unconcern  here 
So since  all these sensual desires have been taught in the first verse alone with craving for the chattel as an objective sensual desire
So in the case of all verses and prose expositions  The Thread has been demonstrated
Herein what is the Teaching
With what purport is this Thread taught
Those creatures that are of lusting temperament will abandon sensual desires this is the Blessed Ones purport
He who had the ten grounded  defilements has outstripped  them rejected them put them away
How  are these  sensual desires as defilement tenfold As hitherside and furtherside fetters and as the tengrounded bases eyecumforms  bodycumtangibles  This is the Investigation
Herein what is the Construing
Those who lust are bound  by the strong bond This is the construing
Herein what are the Footings
That someone lusts after jewels and gems is the footing for mymaking
Concern is the footing for lust for past things
 But that too they sever  is the footing for keeping in being
Herein what are the Characteristics
One whose cognizance lusts after jewels and gems is attached in regard to Imaking attached in regard to mymaking and also he who lusts after children and wives
This is the Mode of Conveying Characteristics
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold Array
What is the Blessed Ones Purport here 
It is that those who have the will for extinction will abandon craving for children and wives
This is the Blessed Ones purport
   Herein what is the Conversion
Craving for children and wives is Origin
As to categories assumed these are simply  the formchattels in external forms  this is Suffering The severance of craving  is Cessation
That whereby it is severed  is the Path
Analysis There is no plane of analysis  Reversal The opposite has already been demonstrated in the two parts of the verse
Herein what are the Synonyms
The synonyms have already been demonstrated
 Herein what are the Ways of Entry
Where  there is craving there determinations  are made the way of entry With that as condition consciousness   down to  ageinganddeath
What is not found  is ignorance with the arising of science cessation of ignorance   down to  ageinganddeath
Herein what is the Clearing Up
The verses instigation has already been cleared up
Herein what are the Terms of Expression
The steadfast will never call that a strong bond is described by a unity not by a diversity
There are four kinds of lust namely lust for sensual desires lust for form lust for being and lust for views which are described by a unity
Herein what are the Requisites
When people have  lust for jewels and gems  the cause of that is perception of beauty and apprehending of the sign of beauty through personal features  is its condition
Perception of ugliness is the cause whereby they are severed and removal of apprehension of signs is the condition
Herein what is the Coordination
Those lusting after jewels and gems  are confused and affected by hate  as well But that too they sever and wander in freedom  that is abandoned  because of its having being diagnosed and because of its having being avoided  This is the Coordination
When someone is possessed  of this unknowing the outcome is this  that he does not know  This should be cultivated  for filling out see    this should not be given attention 
It is by that kind of dark that he is demonstrated as  dark  
Now the dark by which that type of person is called
 dark  is the dark by which when uneradicated when unsevered he comes to have that for the ultimate has that for his supreme value which is why this type of person is called  dark with a dark supreme value  
  The True Idea is the only supreme value  to be given attention  Hearing it he gives ear prepares his cognizance for knowledge
And he likes pondering those ideas
He sees with understandingconsistinginwhatisheard
and teach him the true object of faith thus 
these ideas are blameworthy these ideas are blameless 
these ideas are to be cultivated these ideas are not to be cultivated 
these ideas are to be kept in being these ideas are not to be kept in being  
these ideas should be entered upon and abode in these ideas should not be entered upon and abode in
these ideas should be given attention these ideas should not be given attention
and when the mindfulness faculty  ripens with perception according as this this is perceived to be so then he understands thus  
These ideas are profitable these ideas are unprofitable 
these ideas are blameworthy these ideas are blameless 
these ideas are to be cultivated these ideas are not to be cultivated 
these ideas are to be kept in being these ideas are not to be kept in being 
What is he called
These ideas are profitable these ideas are unprofitable 
these ideas are blameworthy these ideas are blameless 
these ideas are to be cultivated these ideas are not to be cultivated 
these ideas are to be kept in being these ideas are not to be kept in being 
these ideas should be entered upon and abode in these ideas should not be entered upon and abode in 
these ideas should be given attention these ideas should not be given attention
overcome by dark he has a dark supreme value has dark as the ultimate
How is there occurrence How is there arising
What is profitable What is unprofitable
What is blameworthy What is blameless
What is to be cultivated What is not to be cultivated
What is to be kept in being What is not to be kept in being
What should be entered upon and abode in What should not be entered upon and abode in
What should be given attention What should not be given attention
How is there corruption How is there cleansing
yet he  may have a good friend through whom he abandons unprofitable ideas and increases profitable ideas
shows the ripening of profitable action
 By  the dark person he shows the ripening of unprofitable kinds of action 
by the  bright   one he shows the ripening of profitable action
by the  bright  he shows the eight rightnesses
by the  bright with a bright supreme value   he shows superiority 
by the  dark with a bright supreme value  he shows the idea not to be mortified 
by the  dark  with a dark supreme value  he shows the idea to be mortified
What is taught in this Thread
and the ripening of profitable and unprofitable ideas is taught
and the occasion for the difference in the destinations  of inferior and superior creatures is taught
He who exists coessentially with the ripening of unprofitable action
is steadied therein through having assumed unprofitable ideas  such investigation is construable
He who exists coessentially with the ripening of profitable action
is steadied therein through having assumed unprofitable ideas such investigation is construable
This is the Investigation and the Construing
while by the  dark  type of person he shows the footing for non contemplation of disappointment in dark
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Fourfold Array
and those creatures that belong to highborn clans on hearing this teaching of the True Idea will so much the more undertake and carry out profitable ideas
Herein what is the Analysis
for profit having good friends is the condition  and reasoned attention the cause
and there is no agent
craving for forms binds one to forms  down to   craving for ideas to ideas
is born bound dies bound
and goes from this world to the next bound
both this world and the other world that is its double
hence the Blessed One teaches in the verse that follows 
The demonstration of this  verse has been twofold  as demonstration by collation fwith another verse and demonstration by occasion  Just as this verse as an answer to the question asked in the Sarpyutta is the type of Thread dealing with corruption and dealing with penetration so too the answer to the question asked in that verse in the Chapter of Octets is the type of Thread dealing with corruption and dealing with penetration
Herein what is the Investigation
who lusts after fields and lands
 These are the four Truths 
  indetail  in the three paragraphs  As to  what is chosen  this is a condition  for bodily and verbal action
What is the reason
It is because what is chosen is choice and that is called mindaction That choice as action is the mental kind and that and the bodily and verbal kinds are the three kinds of action demonstrated
Now though the bodily action and the verbal action that one instigates may in themselves be profitable when one misapprehends them this is what is called  misapprehension of virtue and duty
Asserting  is the threefold determinations namely those consisting in merit those consisting in demerit and those consisting in imperturbability  With those as condition consciousness thus these are an object whereby consciousness has a steadyingpoint  
Any perception of beauty perception of permanence perception of pleasure and perception of self
is what is chosen
That consciousness passing on  by means of form is steadied with form as its object with form as its standingpoint  comes to growth increase and abundance through its being infected with relishing  this is  asserting   When thus steadied in the steadyingpoints for consciousness the first generating of consciousness is an assuming by way of an object  that is what is called  chosen 
Then any attachment cleaving to on the part of the formless steadied thereon is what is called asserted   Concern for agreeable forms that are agreeable and pleasing is what is chosen 
For  among the wishedfor  and agreeable is the BodyTie of covetousness and among those provocative  of resistance it is the BodyTie of ill will  and so all four BodyTies  This is cognizances first instance in the five strands of sensual desires When someone is a contemplator of gratification therein in those sensual desires then owing to that choice of his  many evil unprofitable ideas have parallel occurrence  with his cognizance
For when a person is bound by lust through sensual desire as defilement  he can be done with as Mara desires  This is the asserting in the case of the Flood of Sensual Desires
and so with all four Floods
In so far as he abides associated with these sensual desires with them kept in being  cleaved to them this is choice
In so far likewise as when someone is not without lust has a propensity for loving when any change and alteration arise for him then with the sorrow and lamentation pain grief and despair consequent thereon in him that consciousness of his has parallel occurrence with pain  as the thoughtarising that what is remembered is inseparable from the idea of its subsidence grips his cognizance  this is called  asserting
He  chooses  and  asserts  for each single  steadyingpoint for consciousness and that steadyingpoint is twofold namely steadyingpointasobject and steadyingpointasnutriment
Herein the steadyingpointasobject is a condition for nameandform
and for the steadyingpointasnutriment  and for any steadyingpoint for that generated renewal of being and for any steadyingpoint as renewal of being Hence  it is said that in the Thread That becomes the object
whereby consciousness has a steadyingpoint   With that consciousness as condition nameand form   down to  ageinganddeath  Again he does not  choose and does not assert  in order that that steadyingpoint may not give renewal of being in a future physical basis  this opposite is demonstrated as follows in the Thread
   the demonstration here being the second
What he had formerly chosen   and had asserted  is still uneradicated and with that as condition there is still this steadyingpoint for consciousness
Or else his underlying tendencies reveal themselves and with that as condition renewal of being is generated for him
Or else  he does not bother to assert any preference for houses with a refined livingstandard  Since he does not bother to assert it he is thus reborn in houses of low standard 
That guides him to assert preference Any such determinations chosen and asserted are objects both the choice and the assertion for the purpose of generating a physical basis being an object for consciousness  As  by choice and by assertion  aspiring creatures  that already are choose  and assert
not so those that yet seek to be   who neither choose nor assert
What are the creatures that already are
They are those actually born and the eggborn  already broken out of the egg and the moistureborn all so long as they have not yet reached dissolution of the body  it is these that  already are 
What are those that yet seek to be They are those traversing the roundabout while still in the womb or in the egg  it is these latter that  neither choose nor assert  
Those that already are  are  frail  while those  that yet seek to be  are  firm  
It is the frail that choose  and assert 
Another way
Another way
there are subtle breathing things  in the soil and in water that do not come within the eyes horizon   and they neither choose nor assert yet they pursue the roundabout owing to underlying tendency
Another way
all outsider mendicants  are over estimators  They neither choose nor assert  and yet they pursue the roundabout owing to underlying tendency  If one no more chooses and no more asserts and no more lets tendencies underlie
then there is no  object whereby consciousness might have a steadying point 
With the words He no more chooses he shows eradication of obsession
With  he no more chooses  he shows abandoning of gross defilements
With  he no more chooses he shows the plane of seeing   with he no more asserts  he shows the OnceReturner and the NonReturner and with he no more lets tendencies underlie  the arahant With  he no more chooses  he shows abandoning by means of the Virtue Categorys opposition with he no more asserts  he shows abandoning by means of the Concentration Categorys opposition and with  he no more lets tendencies underlie he shows abandoning by means of the Understanding Categorys opposition With  he no more chooses  he shows abandoning of determinations consisting in demerit with  he no more asserts   he shows abandoning of determinations consisting in merit and with  he no more lets tendencies underlie  he shows abandoning of determinations consisting in imperturbability He no more chooses is the Ishallcometoknowfinallythe asyetnotfinallyknown faculty he no more asserts   is the finalknowledge faculty and  he no more lets tendencies underlie  is the finalknower faculty
 He no more chooses  is a blunt  Keeping of Faculties in Being  he no more asserts  is a medium Keeping of Faculties in Being and  he no more lets tendencies underlie  is an outstanding Keeping of Faculties in Being
This is the Threadmeaning
Herein what is the Teaching
Here the four Truths are taught in the Thread
  What is chosen and what is asserted   There is still that object Whereby cognizance finds  a standingpoint such investigation  is construable
  He does not choose and does not assert    there is still that object in the underlying tendency whereby consciousness has  a standingpoint  such investigation  is construable He no more chooses and no more asserts   
with the abandoning of underlying tendencies he does not seek  any steadyingpoint  for consciousness such investigation is construable
This is the Investigation and the Construing
Herein what are the Footings
The previous obsession of choice is the footing for the subsequent obsession of choice
The asserting  is the footing for assuming
The underlying tendency is the footing for obsession
The keeping in being of destruction of will and lust for these is the footing for the abandoning of lust for being
Herein what are the Characteristics
What is chosen  is what is felt   what is asserted is what is taken up cognized the consciousness of that also the object also the condition
Herein what is the Fourfold Array
Here in the Thread what is the Blessed Ones Purport
It is that those who do not wish for renewal of being will not choose and will not assert  This is the purport
Conversion The choosing the asserting and the underlying tendency on the one hand and the abandoning of the steadyingpoints for consciousness  on the other are two Truths respectively Origin and Path
Analysis There is no plane of Analysis
Reversal however is the Thread with the opposition contained in its three paragraphs
Herein what are the Synonyms
The Choice is mind choice of forms down to  mindchoice of ideas 
 Underlying tendency is the seven underlying tendencies 
Descriptions  Choice I is described by a description in terms of obsession
Steadyingpoint for consciousness  is described by a description in terms of causeofrearising
The severance  of the choice and assertion and underlying tendency is described by a description in terms of the outguiding of will and lust
With the first  two paragraphs  of the three in this Thread dependent origination and specific conditionality are described respectively by the last one stopping
Ways of Entry With the first two paragraphs there are Suffering and Origin With the last one the Path and Cessation
Clearing Up The Threads instigation is cleared up  already
Terms of Expression As expression  what is chosen  is all described by a unity
As assuming  what is asserted   is described by a unity
Consciousness  is described by a unity
Requisites A beautiful  object and unreasoned attention given to it are a condition by causeconditionality for the choice
Herein what is the Coordination
This Thread deals with what is perceived  Herein he choosescan be demonstrated as cognizing
Then owing to its having a steadyingpoint with consciousness as condition nameandform  down to  ageinganddeath This is the coordination
As to there is no object whereby consciousness might have a steadyingpoint  it can be demonstrated thus  With cessation of consciousness cessation of nameandform  down to  cessation of ageinganddeath
The words  
deal with corruption The words It is by depending on the essentials of existence that this suffering has actual being  down to   His craving for being comes to be abandoned And he no more expectantly relishes nonbeing  deal with penetration The words That bhikkhu being quenched through not assuming no more his being comes to be renewed
down to  one such as this outstrips all kinds of being deal with the Adept
Herein  born to anguish   the anguish is that it is born to lust born to hate and born to delusion
and thus with the words  the world is born to anguish  he shows how these creatures stand
The  contact  is threefold namely to be felt as pleasure to be felt as pain and to be felt as neitherpainnor pleasure
Herein contact to be felt as pleasure brings the anguish of lust that to be felt as pain brings the anguish of hate and that to be felt as neitherpainnorpleasure brings the anguish of delusion
And according as the Blessed One said to Hatthaka Alavaka  in the Anguttara  
It is sickness that it calls self   he who is anguished by these kinds of anguish obtains the threefold perversion namely perversion of perception perversion of cognizance and perversion of view
Herein perversion of perception is that there is beauty in the ugly
perversion of cognizance is that there is pleasure in the painful and
Similarly the perversion of cognizance and those of perception and view these are the threefold logical  thinking thinking based on the affective state of cognizance is a perversion thinking based on perception is a perversion and thinking based on view is a perversion too
Herein the plane for the perversions province of predominance is ignorance  for according as ignorance  perceives it according as it cognizes according as it perceives and cognizes
Thus the words it is sickness that it calls self are a conversion to the opposite
Maintaining its being otherwise than it conceives  while being it aspires to future being hence it is said here that it  clings to being 
 Expectantly relishes only being but what it relishes brings fear    by this he demonstrates  the five categories 
Up to this point corruption
Now this divine life is lived in order to abandon being  
while  it is by depending on  the essentials of existence that this suffering has actual being  since that pain will be kept in being for anyone who relishes being he stated the abandoning of that pain thus 
Of that the first perversion is sensualdesire assumption the second is viewassumption while the third is virtueandduty assumption and selftheory assumption Their exhaustion is pains having no more actual being and with this he states the cessation of pain that has the essentials of existence for its source
So when a man thus sees with right understanding how this is his    he has no craving for being
By  He no more expectantly relishes nonbeing  he alludes to the plane of seeing By  That is the utter exhaustion   extinction  he explains two deliverances  fading of lust and fading of ignorance
By That bhikkhu  no more his   he alludes to the extinction element without trace left
This is the demonstration of the Threads meaning
 Herein what is the Investigation
When someone has a fever  then while he is feverish he has no seeing  how it is and finds no dispassion This is the Investigation and the Construing
Footings  lustborn  fever is the footing for the pleasure faculty and for the joy  faculty
hateborn fever is the footing for the pain  faculty and for the grief faculty
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Characteristics
Subject to painful contact implies also subject to feeling and subject to perception and subject to determinations For however it conceives it   whether by the sign of beauty or by the sign of pleasure or by the sign of permanence or by the sign of self it conceives that there is beauty in the ugly and all the rest  When lustborn fever  is stated all the four fevers are stated
namely the lustborn the hateborn the delusionborn and the viewborn  It is sickness that it calls self 
it calls all the fifty terms  impermanent painful and so on  self
Herein what is the Fourfold Array
What is the Blessed Ones Purport in the Thread here
Those who do not  remain  with fever do not expectantly relish being  
This is the Purport
and yet their renewal of being is generated by underlying tendency
while the firm neither choose  nor assert and yet they still pursue the roundabout owing to underlying tendency
there are the Noble Persons who are Initiates Herein they neither choose nor assert yet they appear again owing to underlying tendency 
and with he no more lets tendencies underlie he shows eradication of underlying tendencies
and with  he no more lets tendencies underlie  he shows abandoning of subtle defilements
Asserting  is described  by a description in terms of assuming
Underlying tendency is described by a description in terms of cause
For consciousness the idea that is its steadyingpoint is a condition by objectconditionality
while attention is a condition for it by causeconditionality
Herein what is the type of Thread dealing with corruption dealing with penetration and dealing with the Adept
perversion of view is that there is permanence in the impermanent and that there is self in the notself
and according as liking  chooses these four as the three perversions whereby creatures call  self the fourfold ground for selfhood that is in fact a sickness and a boil
for however it conceives it Tis ever otherwise than that  it conceives that there is beauty which is not so and likewise pleasure permanence and self
for sorrow lamentation and pain with that fear as condition will be kept in being  for him
The outguiding of will and lust is the abandoning of the three kinds of being
With the exhaustion  of all kinds of assumption suffering has no actual being   what he calls  assumption  as demonstrated here is the four perversions
delusionborn fever is the footing for the onlookingequanimity faculty and for the grief faculty
those who do not expectantly relish being  will attain extinction
Herein what is the Conversion
With the section dealing with corruption he demonstrates Suffering and Origin
With that dealing with penetration the Path and Cessation 
Herein what is the Analysis
 Born to anguish  born to sickness  it is sickness that it ca  self  that is not uniaterally always so  for there may be one who is born to anguish through inattention yet he does not call the sickness self
It is with the reversal of plane  for the purpose of showing the proposition and its opposite
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Synonyms
It is sickness that it calls self  it is a barb that it calls self 
Herein what are the Descriptions
Born to anguish is the footing for grief 
 It is sickness that it calls self  he describes the perversions  by a description in terms of defilement
Herein what are the Ways of Entry
 Born to anguish  is the three unprofitable roots They being determinations are included in the determinations category in the case of the elements the idea element  in the case of the bases the idea base 
in the case of the faculties the femininity faculty and masculinity faculty

Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Terms of Expression
Fever   Those worlds described fust by a description in tenns of a unity as clinging to being are the worlds described in the middle by a description in terms of a diversity doing without the clinging
Herein what are the Requisites
Born to anguish  unreasoned attention is the cause and the perversions are the condition
Herein self is insisted upon by way of two kinds of ideas  namely cognizance and cognizanceconcomitant ideas for one who is misapprehending both  distortedly
Another way perception of notself eradicates perception of self  conceived by means of cognizanceconcomitant ideas
Another way 
there is perception of impermanence by means of cognizanceconcomitant ideas but no perception of notself  thus 
 down to  
Herein such seeing  is perception of self
What is the cause what the condition
for that t Imaking is the cause mymaking is the condition
Herein what is the Coordination
By  this world is born to anguish  the unprofitable consciousness he alludes to is the condition for nameandform  down to  ageinganddeath This is the coordination
So when he sees with right understanding how it is his   is the abandoning of the unprofitable
Herein there is cessation of ignorance  with cessation of ignorance  down to  cessation of ageinganddeath This is the coordination
 one who goes with the stream one who goes against the stream one who has steadied himself and one who has crossed over gone to the further shore and stands on firm ground as one divine  
Herein he who goes with the stream  cultivates sensual desires
and does evil actions  In so far as he cultivates sensual desires
this is the unprofitable root greed And it is since he is swept along by sensual desires which are the streams of craving that he is called one who  goes with the stream 
Any person who because of his going with that stream with that as condition with that as cause does unprofitable action by body and speech is called one who  does evil action 
He has three streams  embodimentview uncertainty and misapprehension of virtue and duty
In virtue of these three streams he reappears in the triple element of existence in the sensualdesire element in the form element in the formless element
In the opposite sense  he who Does not  
does not misapprehend virtue and duty
Since he instead cultivates these ideas of renunciation
accordingly  it is the Arahant who has gone to the further shore of that stream One gone to the further shore who stands on firm ground  has the extinction element with trace left
With  one who goes with the stream  he states the non abandoning of the fetters to be abandoned by seeing
With  one who goes against the stream  he states the abandoning in the fruit of StreamEntry the defilements coefficient with wrong view  With  one who has steadied himself he states the abandoning of the five hitherside fetters
Herein with one who goes with the stream he states one who is confused  about the path
with  one who goes against the stream  and with  one who has steadied himself he states one who is wise  owing to the path
With  one who goes with the stream  he states the way leading to the origin of embodiment
with one who goes against the stream  and with  one who has steadied himself  he states the way leading to cessation of embodiment
This is the Threadmeaning
Herein what is the Teaching
In this Thread the four Noble Truths are taught
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying an Investigation
He who cultivates sensual desires would do evil he who does not  cultivate sensual desires would not do evil and it is he who has crossed beyond both these planes who has  gone to the further shore   any such inquiry is the Investigation
Construing Any inquiry into whether this construes in the Threads or does not construe is the Construing
Footings With one who goes with the stream there is the footing for the seven  fetters
For the doing  of what is unprofitable the footing is the roots of the unprofitable
With one who  goes against the stream  there is the footing for seeing how things are
With one who has  steadied himself there is the footing for invincibility
Gone to the further shore  there is the footing for the plane of Him Who Has Done
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying Characteristics
He who  goes with the stream  owing to craving
also goes owing to all defilements
He who has  steadied hlmself  is also steadied bodily and also steadied verbally and mentally

Herein what is the Fourfold Array
What is the Blessed Ones Purport here in the Thread
It is that those who will not delight in the way leading to going with the stream will make efforts for that going against the stream  down to  in the plane of Him Who Has Done
Conversion The four Truths are taught in the Thread here
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying an Analysis
That  he who cultivates sensual desires and he who does evil actions
is one who goes with the stream is not unilaterally always so for also a StreamEnteeer may cultivate sensual desires
but although the Initiate thus also may do such evil actions as demonstrated in the Thread  yet he is not one  going with the stream  So This is declarable only after analysis
 And he does not cultivate sensual desires and he does no evil action and he is one who goes against the stream  is not unilaterally always so All those outside the Dispensation who are lustfree  with regard to sensual desires do not cultivate sensual desires and they do no evil yet they go with the stream they do not  go against the stream This is the analysis
Herein what is the Mode of Conveying a Reversal
It is the opposition demonstrated
Synonyms In the case of sensual desires they are sensual desires as things and sensual desires as defilement  and they are forms sounds odours flavours and touches and they are chattels consisting of children wives bondsmen and workmen
Those  going with the stream  are described by a description in terms of defilements taking place
Initiate persons are described by a description in terms of penetration
Ways of Entry The one who  goes with the stream  is Suffering
His ideas are Sufferings Origin
Any form is the form category so too the rest of the five categories and dependent arising These defilements included in the determinations category are described in the idea base the idea element and the faculties
Clearing Up The instigation whereby this Thread is taught is cleared up
Terms of Expression By  one going against the stream all StreamEnterers are demonstrated by a unity But there are those who  go against the stream  of the underlying tendency to lust who are Initiates too  the foremost  is the person who has steadied himself and they under him
as the LustFree NonReturner  are described by a unity
He who has gone to the further shore  is all Arahants all Hermit Enlightened Ones and all Fully Enlightened Ones described by a unity
Requisites For him who goes with the stream bad friends  are the condition obsession by sensual desire is the cause
One who goes against the stream   for him c there are two causes and two conditions for the arising of  down to  right view   For him who has steadied himself  the obtained path is the cause and the instigation is the condition bodily and a portion of the cognizanceconcomitant

With exhaustion of lust hate delusion He attains complete extinction is the two deliverances namely heart deliverance due to fading of lust and understandingdeliverance due to fading of ignorance
This is the ThreadDemonstration
Herein what is the Teaching
What is taught in this Thread
Two good destinations namely gods and human beings and also the five strands of sensual desire

Herein what is the Clearing Up
with the abandoning of the embodimentview he sees how there is disappointment in sensual desires
and since with that as condition he stands as one divine as it were  an Arahant
and with  one gone to the further shore  it is those hearers  who are Adepts and also Fully Enlightened Ones  that are stated

 line  Herein what is the type of Thread dealing with morality and dealing with penetration 
The verse  
For one who gives   the ground for making merit consisting in giving is stated
No risk is stored for one restrained  the ground for making merit consisting in virtue is stated
 One who is skilled abandons evil   he states the abandoning of greed and delusion and ill will
With exhaustion of lust hate delusion He attains complete extinction   he states the outguiding of will and lust for greed for delusion and for ill will
The verse   Merit will grow for one who gives  is the profitable root nongreed

The Fourfold Array
What is the Blessed Ones Purport here
It is that those who aspire to great properties will give gifts for the abandoning of danger that those with the will for nonrisk will abandon the five risks that those who have the will for the profitable keep the eightfactored path in being for the abandoning of the eight wrongness
and that those who desire to attain extinction will abandon lust hate and delusion This is the Blessed Ones purport
Conversion Avarice in one who does not give and risk for one inrestrained and nonabandoning of evil are Origin through demonstration by opposites
With nongreed and nonhate and nondelusion as profitable these are the three profitable roots
Their condition is the eight rightnesses This is the Path
Their exhaustion  of lust hate and delusion is Cessation
Construing One who is steadied in giving fulfils in both ways 
and  With exhaustion of lust hate delusion He attains complete extinction  is the footing for the Expression of Peace
also for one who gives no risk is stored up  One who is skilled abandons evil with exhaustion of lust hate delusion he attains complete extinction  also with the exhaustion of form also with the exhaustion of feeling  With exhaustion fading cessation of form by means of which form someone describing a Perfect One  would describe a wrong view  and so with the rest of the five categories
Analysis  Merit will grow for him who gives  is not unilaterally always so For him who gives out of fear of punishment by kings for him who gives to the virtuous using what is not allowable no merit grows and he gives such a gift without profit And with gifts of rods for punishing and gifts of weapons it is demerit not merit that grows
 No risk is stored for one restrained  is not unilaterally always so What is the reason When someone sees his state here and now thus  etc  he does not by such restraint as that unmake risk
On the contrary it is one who undertakes thus  One who kills breathing things has evil ripening here and now and in some future existence and so with all the ten kinds of unprofitable action that he refrains with that as cause 
It is by this kind of restraint that nonrisk is stored up
Reversal  Merit will grow for him who gives   merit will not grow for one who does not give
the kind of merit that is that consists in giving  No risk is stored for one restrained   for one unrestrained risk is made
One who is skilled abandons evil  one who is unskilled does not abandon it
 With exhaustion of lust hate delusion he   line 
No risk is stored for one restrained is described by a description in terms ofdestruction with the support of nonhate  One who is skilled abandons evil  is described by a description in terms of destruction with the support of nondelusion
Ways of Entry In the case of the five faculties beginning with faith Merit will grow for him who gives No risk is stored for one restrained is the virtue category  by means of restraint
made a way of entry In the case of the six faculties beginning with the eye restraint is the concentration category That One who is skilled abandons evil is the understanding categoryWith exhaustion of lust hate delusion he attains complete extinction  this is the deliverance category
In the case of the elements the idea element  in the case of the bases the mind base
Clearing Up The instigation with which this Thread is taught is cleared up in the Thread itself
Terms of Expression Giving is described in terms of a unity
But  For him who gives  is not described by a description in terms of a unity
it is described by a description in terms of the blamelessness of the liking 
 With exhaustion of lust hate delusion he attains complete extinction  is described in terms of fighting courage
Requisites For giving gladness is the condition and nongreed the cause
For one restrained reasoned attention is the cause and giving up the condition
One who is skilled abandons evil   seeing how things are is the condition and obtainment of knowledge the cause
Coordination The verse Merit will grow for him who gives   for him also virtue grows
and also restraint grows
No risk is stored for one restrained 
also no other defilements are stored up 
 With exhaustion of lust hate delusion he attains complete extinction  with the exhaustion of lust and hate there is also the exhaustion of the underlying tendency to lust and also of those to hate and to delusion  He attains complete extinction is the extinction element with trace left and the extinction element without trace left
This is the Coordination
 With exhaustion of lust hate delusion he attains complete extinction   anothers utterance and reasoned attention in oneself and the path are the cause and the condition
The eight kinds of giving beginning with generosity giving up giving of the True Idea giving of material things   can be cited in detail  this is a diversity
Descriptions Merit grows for him who gives is described by a description in terms of destruction with the support of nongreed
and also for him who concentrates his cognizance  also merit grows through performance of services
Synonyms Merit grows for him who gives  merit also grows for him who shares

 line   this Thread can be quoted in detail
When he devotes himself and  strives and makes efforts  he here and now  when ill the time of death when a god he reaches Hermit Enlightenment  
 Entered the ear   this is done by hearing the true object of faith 
and his cognizance is not yet thirsty for the insight into ideas that consists in the higher understanding  or for complete breakingout  And this Thread is taught of the five kinds of persons there are the Followers by Faith with blunt faculties and with keen faculties and the followers by Ideas with blunt faculties and with keen facuities 
but  since a person of deluded temperament cannot devote himself strive or make efforts the deliverance according as it comes to be  according to the concentration it has  shows its fruit at that moment at that instant in that period
and even if the devotee falls away or another corrupts  him  that deliverance  is still not without its pleasant ripening for him
either here and now or on reappearance or in some future period
Herein if the kind of person who is a Follower by Ideas with keen faculties has such ideas entered by the ear then when he devotes himself he reaches distinction here and now
The Follower by Faith with keen faculties reaches it on the occasion of the time of death
but the Follower by Ideas with blunt faculties reaches it when he is ill
and he with blunt faculties reaches it when he is a god 
but when he does not reach it as a god then with that same lust for the True Idea with that relish for the True Idea he eventually reaches  Hermit Enlightenment
 He who devotes himself strives makes efforts in regard to the ideas that have entered the ear perceives successive  distinction and perceiving he reaches it here and now
 If he gives attention thereto when ill he reaches it when he devotes himself thereto
 If he has the sense of urgency at the time of his death he reaches it when he devotes himself thereto
 But if he has no sense of urgency in any of these instances then  
he recognizes thus 
Then as a god he reaches it
Or else through abiding in negligence due to cleaving to the five strands of heavenly sensual desires he eventually by means of that profitable root reaches Hermit Enlightenment
What owing to anothers utterance is consolidated by word of mouth   is understanding consisting in what is heard
Those ideas when looked over by the mind are understanding consisting in cogitation
In that they are  well penetrated by right view  is understanding consisting in keeping in being
When ideas that have entered the ear are consolidated by word of mouth then  when someone attains extinction here and now that person is an Arahant 
 He who reaches Hermit Enlightenment through that profitable root is the type of person whose actual being has for its accessories his previous devotion
Ideas that have entered the ear is the first Base for Deliverance   consolidated by word of mouth  is the second and third Base for Deliverance  looked over by the mind  is the fourth Base for Deliverance and  well penetrated by right view is the fifth Base for Deliverance
 Ideas that have entered the ear consolidated by word of mouth   having heard through his ear successive ideas he fulfils the virtue category  Looked over by the mind   he fulfils the concentration category Well penetrated by right view he fulfils the understanding category
but he who reaches it on reappearance as a god and attains extinction there is a NonReturner
Ideas that have entered the ear    which can be quoted in detail 
this is the first Exploit of Faith  Looked over by the mind    can be quoted in detail  
this is the second Exploit of Faith Well penetrated by right view    
this is the third Exploit of Faith
By  ideas that have entered the ear  the Master shows an Initiate
By  looked over by the mind  the Master shows an Arahant
By Well penetrated by right view the Master shows a Perfect One accomplished and fully enlightened
By  Ideas that have entered the ear   he shows the escape in the case of sensual desires

Investigation According as he is giving attention to is investigating what is heard he obtains understanding consisting in what is heard
According as he gives attention to  the ideas as heard then he obtains understanding consisting in cogitation
According as he gives attention to ideas here and now then he obtains understanding consisting in keeping in being
This is the Investigation
It is through what is heard that he obtains understanding consisting in what is heard
it is through cogitation that he obtains understanding consisting in cogitation it is through right view that he obtains understanding consisting in keeping in being

Herein those creatures who are fettered by craving have much cleaving and weak insight
Herein creatures of craving temperament have insisted upon perception of creatures and do not see rise and subsidence
they see self in the five categories Some see self as possessed of form or form in self or self in form 
that is how they see each of the five categories
by means of the other categories  But when creatures with pronounced views thereof are exercizing insight they see the categories directly as self 
they see form as self thus
So the first instances  of each of the five categories  belong with the annihilation view thus 
and with the three last terms in the case of each  single category the instance belongs to eternalism thus 
When those of craving temperament go forth into homelessness outside this Dispensation they abide devoted to the pursuit of sensual pleasures
And those of view temperament with that outcome ie likewise gone forth abide devoted to the pursuit of selftorment
It is owing to that same pleasure in views that outsiders range is only that much
Herein when creatures of view temperament find a way of entry into the Noble Ones True Idea and Outguiding Discipline they become Followers by Ideas 
Herein when creatures of view temperament hold the view that there is wrong in sensual desires so long as the underlying tendencies with regard to sensual desires are not eradicated  they abide devoted to pursuit of selftorment
There is no meaning in sensual desires and they who already did not seek sensual desires thus easily relinquish sensual desires
Hence pleasant way is said
But creatures of craving temperament cleave to sensual desires To them the Master teaches
or some bhikkhu as follows There is no meaning in sensual desires  and they since those are dear to them relinquish with pain
Hence  painful way  is said
So all these creatures combine together under the two Ways under the Painful and the Pleasant
Herein creatures of view temperament are of two kinds  with blunt faculties and with keen faculties
Herein creatures of view temperament with keen faculties renounce with pleasure and actualize swiftly hence pleasant way with swift acquaintanceship  is said
And herein since creatures of view temperament with blunt faculties actualize more sluggishly as compared with the firstmentioned kind with keen faculties they renounce with pleasure and actualize sluggishly
Herein creatures of craving temperament are of two kinds  with keen faculties and with blunt faculties
Herein creatures of craving temperament with keen faculties renounce with pain and actualize swiftly
hence painful way with swift acquaintanceship is said
These are the four Ways  with no fifth and no sixth
Whoever they  are that have attained extinction or will attain extinction it is by these four Ways not by any other  This Way having been demonstrated  in defilement by a tetrad thus
can be demonstrated in the Noble Ideas by a tetradpath This is called the PlayofLions GuideLine
Herein there are  Four Nutriments 
Four Perversions   Assumings   Bonds   Ties   Taints   Floods   Barbs   SteadyingPoints for Consciousness   Goings on Bad Ways 
In this way the collation of the Thread
is made under the four Nutriments
Herein  physical nutriment and contact as nutriment are abandonable by one of craving temperament
 The first nutriment is the first perversion the second nutriment the second perversion the third nutriment the third perversion the fourth nutriment the fourth perversion
These are the four perversions with no fifth and no sixth
 Herein one steadied in the first perversion assumes sensual desires  this is sensualdesire assuming
One steadied in the second perversion assumes future being  this is virtueandduty assuming
One steadied in the third perversion assumes a view   this is view assuming
One steadied in the fourth perversion assumes the categories as self this is selftheory assuming
 Herein one steadied in sensualdesire assuming ties with covetousness   this is the bodytie of covetousness
One steadied in virtueandduty assuming ties ill will this is the bodytie of ill will
One steadied in view assuming ties misapprehension this is the bodytie of misapprehension
One steadied in selftheory assuming ties when diversifying  this is the bodytie of insistence that this is truth
 While he is tying  the defilements that assail him
Herein the taint of sensual desire is due to the bodytie of covetousness the taint of being is due to the bodytie of ill will the taint of views is due to the bodytie of misapprehension and the taint of ignorance is due to the bodytie of insistence that this is truth
 These  four taints when they come to abundance are floods that is why they are called floods
Herein the taint of sensual desire is the flood of sensual desire the taint of being is the flood of being the taint of ignorance is the flood of ignorance and the taint of views is the flood of views
 These four floods when they have entered the inclination  and are accompanied by underlying tendency
Herein the flood of sensual desire is the barb of lust the flood of being is the barb of hate the flood of ignorance is the barb of delusion  and the flood of views is the barb of views
These are the four steadyingpoints for consciousness
Herein when infected  by the barb of lust consciousness passing on is steadied on form 
when infected by the barb of hate passing on  on feeling  when infected by the barb of delusion  passing on  on perception  when infected by the barb of views consciousness passing on is steadied on determinations
 By means of the four steadyingpoints for consciousness they go the fourfold bad way through will through hate through fear and through delusion
It is owing to lust that one goes the bad way through will owing to hate that one goes the bad way through hate owing to delusion that one goes the bad way through delusion and owing to view that one goes the bad way through fear
So this action and these defilements are the cause of the roundabout
Herein these are the four directions
 Physical nutriment the perversion that there is beauty in the ugly sensualdesire assuming the bond  of sensual desires the bodytie of covetousness the taint of sensual desires the flood of sensual desires the barb of lust forn as steadyingpoint for consciousness passing on the going a bad way through will 
 Contact as nutriment the perversion that there is pleasure in the painful virtueandduty assuming the bond of being the bodytie of ill will the taint of being the flood of being the barb of hate feeling as steadyingpoint for consciousness passing on the going a bad way through hate  this is the second Direction
this is the third Direction
So the plotting of the first Direction by the first term of each of these ten Threads
is called the Plotting of Directions
Surveying on the unprofitable side by means of the four Perversions after associating the defilement is the plane of the Plotting of Directions on the unprofitable side  As to the first terms of these  ten Threads  what is the meaning of these ideas
The meaning is one only the phrasing is different
This is the first collation
All defilements in the four teros in each tetrad can be inserted under this  abbreviation
Next the profitable side  four Ways   four Meditations   four Foundations of Mindfulness   four Abidingsheavenly divine noble imperturbable   four Right Endeavours   four Wonderful and Marvellous Ideas   four Expressions    four kinds of Concentrationconcentration due to will concentration due to energy concentration due to cognizance concentration due to inquiry 
four Ideas Dealing with Pleasure no other than enlightenment factors no other than ardour no other than faculty restraint no other than relinquishment of all   four Measureless States 
 Herein the painful way with sluggish acquaintanceship kept in being and made much of fulfills the first meditation The first meditation fulfilled fulfils the first foundation of mindfulness The first foundation of mindfulness fulfilled fulfils the first abiding The first abiding fulfilled fulfils the first right endeavour The first right endeavour fulfilled fulfils the first wonderful and marvellous idea The first wonderful and marvellous idea fulfilled fulfills the first expression The first expression fulfilled fulfils concentration due to will Concentration due to will fulfilled fulfils faculty restraint Faculty restraint fulfilled fulfills lovingkindness
So with the other three terms in each tetrad down to  Relinquishment fulfilled fulfils the fourth measureless State
 Herein the first way and first meditation and first foundation of mindfulness and first abiding and first right endeavour and first wonderful and marvellous idea and the expression of truth and concentration due to will and faculty restraint and the measureless state of lovingkindness
 The painful way with swift acquaintanceship and the second meditation and second foundation of mindfulness and second abiding and second right endeavour and second wonderful and marvellous idea and the expression of generosity and concentration due to cognizance and ardour and the measureless state of compassion  these are the second Direction
 The pleasant way with sluggish acquaintanceship and the third meditation and third foundation of mindfulness and third abiding and third right endeavour and third wonderful and marvellous idea and the expression of understanding and concentration due to energy and enlightenment factors and the measureless state of gladness 
 The pleasant way with quick acquaintanceship and the fourth meditation and fourth foundation of mindfulness and fourth abiding and fourth right endeavour and fourth wonderful and marvellous idea and the expression of peace and concentration due to inquiry and relinquishment of all and the measureless state of onlookingequanimity 
It is this plotting of these four directions
Herein the pairing off  is this
Four Nutriments  and four Ways four Perversions and four Foundations of Mindfulness four Assumings and four meditations four Bonds and Abidings Ties and Right Endeavours Taints and WonderfulandMarvellous Ideas Floods and Expressions Barbs and Concentrations Steadyingpoints for Consciousness and Ideas Dealing with Pleasure four Goings on Bad Ways and four Measureless States This is the construing of the profitable and unprofitable by opposites This is called the PlottingofDirections  GuideLine
Its end is the four Fruits of the Monks State  And the idea demonstrated  as the first Direction in the profitable demonstration  has for its end the fruit of StreamEntry the second the fruit of OnceReturn the third  the fruit of NonReturn and the fourth the fruit of Arahantship
Herein what is the Trefoil GuideLine
Those who find outlet by the painful way with sluggish acquaintance and with swift acquaintance are two types of persons  and those who find outlet by the pleasant way with sluggish acquaintance and with swift acquaintance are two types of persons
Of these four types of persons the type of person who finds outlet  by the pleasant way with sluggish acquaintance and the type of person who finds outlet by the painful way with swift acquaintance
Herein he who finds outlet by the pleasant way with swift acquaintance is one who gains knowledge by what is condensed 
The next type of person shared in common with the third is one who gains knowledge by what is expanded
The type of person who finds outlet by the painful way with sluggish acquaintance is one who is guidable
So these having been four are three  Herein insight preceded by quiet is for one who gains knowledge by what is condensed Quiet preceded by insight is for one who is guidable Quiet and insight coupled together are for one who gains knowledge by what is expanded
The blunt type of teaching is for one who gains knowledge by what is condensed The keen type of teaching is for one who is guidable The keentoblunt type of teaching is for one who gains knowledge by what is expanded
The training in the higher understanding is for one who gains knowledge by what is condensed The training in the higher cognizance is for one who is guidable The training in the higher virtue is for one who gains knowledge by what is expanded
That is how these types of persons have an outlet by the four ways
Herein the corruption is this  three Unprofitable Roots   three kinds of Object  i  three kinds of Contact   three kinds of Feeling   three kinds of Mental Approach   three Corruptions   three kinds of Thinking   three Fevers   three Characteristics of the Determined   three Painfulnesses 
Three unprofitable roots the unprofitable root greed the unprofitable root hate the unprofitable root delusion
Three kinds of contact  contact to be felt as pleasant contact to be felt as painful contact to be felt as neitherpainfulnorpleasant
Three kinds of feeling  pleasant feeling painful feeling neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
Three kinds of mental approach approach with joy approach with grief approach with onlookingequanimity
Three corruptions  lust hate delusion
Three kinds of thinking sensualdesire thinking illwill thinking cruelty thinking
Three fevers the lustborn the hateborn the delusionborn
Three characteristics of the determined  arising steadiness subsidence
Three kinds of painfulness  painfulness as pain painfulness in change painfulness in determinations
Herein what does the unprofitable root greed mould itself from
The threefold object is the agreeable the disagreeable and that provocative of onlookingequanimity
The unprofitable root greed moulds itself therefrom by means of the agreeable object
So with an agreeable object there is contact to be felt as pleasant Depending on contact to be felt as pleasant pleasant feeling arises Depending on pleasant feeling the approach with joy arises Dependent on the approach with joy lust arises Depending on lust sensualdesire thinking arises Dependent on sensualdesire thinking lustborn fever arises Depending on lustborn fever the determined characteristic arising arises Depending on the determined characteristic arising painfulness in change arises
What does the unprofitable root hate mould itself from
The unprofitable root hate moulds itself therefrom by means of the disagreeable object
So with a disagreeable object there is contact to be felt as painful Depending on contact to be felt as painful painful feeling arises Depending on painful feeling the approach with grief arises Depending on the approach with grief hate arises Depending on hate illwill thinking arises Depending on illwill thinking hateborn fever arises Depending on hateborn fever the determined characteristic alteration of the steadied  arises Depending on the determined characteristic alteration of the steadied painfulness as pain arises
What does the unprofitable root delusion mould itself from
So with an object provocative of onlookingequanimity there is contact to be felt as neitherpainfulnorpleasant Depending on contact to be felt as neitherpainfulnorpleasant neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling arises Depending on neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling the approach with onlookingequanimity arises Depending on the approach with onlookingequanimity delusion arises Depending on delusion cruelty thinking arises Depending on cruelty thinking delusionborn fever arises Depending on delusionborn fever the determined characteristic subsidence arises Depending on the determined characteristic subsidence painfulness in determinations arises This is the demonstration of the three kinds of corruptions This is called the Trefoil GuideLine on the unprofitable  side
So three unprofitable roots with no fourth with no fifth three objects three kinds of contact three kinds of feeling  down to  painfulness in determinations  Whatever is on the unprofitable side all combines in the three unprofitable roots 
Herein what is the profitable side
Three Profitable Roots   three kinds of Understanding understanding consisting in what is heard understanding consisting in cogitation understanding consisting in keeping in being 
three kinds of Concentration  with thinking and exploring  etc   three Trainings  training in higher virtue  etc 
three Signs  sign of quiet sign of exertion sign of onlooking equanimity 
three kinds of Thinking  renunciation thinking  etc 
three Faculties the Ishallcometoknowfinallytheasyetnotfinallyknown faculty  in detail 
three Approaches  approach with renunciation approach with nonillwill approach with noncruelty  
three Categories the virtue category the concentration category the understanding category 
Herein the profitable root nongreed fulfils understanding consisting in what is heard Understanding consisting in what is heard fulfilled fulfils concentration with thinking and exploring Concentration with thinking and exploring fulfilled fiilfils training in higher cognizance Training in higher cognizance fulfilled ftilfils the sign of quiet The sign of quiet fiilfilled ftilfils renunciation thinking Renunciation thinking fiilfilled iiilfils the Ishallcometoknowfinallytheasyetnotfinallyknown faculty The Ishallcometoknowfinallytheasyetnotfinallyknown faculty fulfilled fulfils the approach with renunciation The approach with renunciation fulfilled abandons the search for sensual desires The abandoning of the search for sensual desires fulfils the concentration category
The profitable root nonhate fiilfils understanding consisting in cogitation Understanding consisting in cogitation fulfilled fulfils concentration without thinking and with only exploring
Concentration without thinking and with only exploring fulfilled fulfils training in higher virtue Training in higher virtue fulfilled fulfils the sign of onlookingequanimity The sign of onlookingequanimity fulfilled fulfils nonillwill thinking Nonill will thinking fulfilled fulfills the finalknowledge faculty The finalKnowledge faculty fulfilled fulfills the approach with nonillwill The approach with nonillwill fulfilled abandons the search for being The abandoning of the search for being fulfills the virtue category
The profitable root nondelusion fulfills understanding consisting in keeping in being Understanding consisting in keeping in being fulfilled fulfills concentration without thinking and exploring Concentration without thinking and exploring fulfilled fulfils training in higher understanding Training in higher understanding fulfilled fulfils the sign of exertion The sign of exertion fulfilled fulfills the finalknower faculty The finalknower faculty fulfilled fulfills the approach with noncruelty The approach with noncruelty fulfilled fulfills the search for a divine life The search for a divine life fulfilled fulfills the understanding category
So these are the three ideas on the profitable side and all profitable ideas are demonstrated by the three triaddemonstrations Their end is the three Gateways to Liberation 
Herein with the first the Dispositionless with the second the Void with the third the Signless
This is called the second  GuideLine the Trefoil
Herein there are three types of person one who gains knowledge from what is condensed one who gains knowledge from what is expanded and one who is guidable 
Of these three types of person those types of person who find outlet  by the pleasant way with swift acquaintance and the pleasant way with sluggish acquaintance are two types of person
and there are two types of person who find outlet  by the painful way with swift acquaintance and by the painful way with sluggish acquaintance These who are four in virtue of that distinction according to the four ways are two namely as one of view temperament and one of craving temperament 
Of these two types of persons this is the corruption  Ignorance and Craving   Consciencelessness and Shamelessness   Unmindfulness and Unawareness   Hindrances and Fetters   Cleaving  and Insistence   Imaking and Mymaking   Faithlessness and Unamenability to Correction    Idleness and Unreasoned Attention   Uncertainty and Covetousness   Not Hearing the True Idea and NonAttainment 
Herein ignorance and consciencelessness and tnmindfulness and hindrances and cleaving and Imaking and faithlessness and idleness and uncertainty and not hearing the True Idea  this is one Direction
Craving and shamelessness and unawareness and fetters and insistence and mymaking and unamenability to correction and unreasoned attention and covetousness and nonattainment  these are the second Direction
Of the ten dyads the ten first terms
So the unprofitable ideas state of being a source  of suffering is Origin
Whatever  idea nameandform resides in is Suffering So this Origin and this Suffering are the two Truths of Suifering and Origin which is the first demonstration of the Conversion of Relishing
Herein what is the profitable side
Quiet and Insight   Science and Good Conduct   Mindfulness and Awareness   Conscience and Shame   Abandoning of Imaking and Abandoning of Mymaking   Right Effort and Reasoned Attention   Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration   Understanding and Dispassion   Attainment and Hearing the True Idea   Joy and Practice in accordance with the True Idea 
Herein quiet and science and mindfulness and conscience and abandoning of Imaking and right effort and right mindfulness and understanding and attainment and joy  these ideas are one Direction
Insight and good conduct and awareness and shame and abandoning of mymaking and reasoned attention and right concentration and dispassion and hearing the True Idea and practice in accordance with the True Idea  these are the second Direction
So on the profitable side and the unprofitable side the Conversion of Relishing GuideLine has four Directions
Now of these the ten first unprofitable of the unprofitable side that come to abandonment by means of the profitable come to be abandoned by means of the ten first  terms on the profitable side
With their abandoning the heartdeliverance due to fading of lust is the end And the ten second unprofitable terms of the unprofitable side that come to abandoning come to be abandoned by means of the ten second  terms on the profitable side
With their abandoning the understandingdeliverance due to fading of ignorance is the end
Of these three GuideLines the first GuideLine is called the Play of Lions
It has eight terms four of which are profitable and four unprofitable these eight terms are eight of the RootTerms The second GuideLine as a meaning GuideLine too is the Trefoil
That guides by means of six ideas since it guides by means of three profitable roots and three unprofitable roots So these six terms and the firstmentioned RootTerms are fourteen of the eighteen RootTerms 
Herein the last GuideLine is the Conversion of Relishing That guides by means of four ideas
by ignorance and craving and by quiet and insight These four ideas complete the eighteen RootTerms demonstrated under the three GuideLines
Herein all the unprofitable  converges under the nine unprofitable  terms
And of these nine RootTerms four are in the PlayofLions GuideLine three in the Trefoil and two in the Conversion of Relishing That is how they are on the unprofitable  side
Herein as to the nine profitable RootTerms all the profitable is construable thereunder
Herein in the PlayofLions GuideLine there are four terns in the Trefoil three and in the Conversion of Relishing two These are the nine profitable RootTerms
Herein there are four terms in the ConversionofRelishing GuideLine and the eighteen RootTerms converge there
How Quiet and NonGreed and NonHate and Perception of Ugliness and Perception of Pain  these five terms on the profitable side belong with Quiet
And Insight and NonDelusion and Perception of Impermanence and Perception of NotSelf these four terms belong with Insight
These are the nine profitable construed under two of the terms Herein of the nine unprofitable RootTerms on the unprofitable side Craving and Greed and Hate and Perception of Beauty and Perception of Pleasure  these five terms belong with Craving
And Ignorance and Delusion and Perception of Permanence and Perception of Self  these four terms belong with Ignorance
These are the nine unprofitable terms fully abbreviated
So these three GuideLines are included in the one GuideLine
That is how the eighteen RootTerms can be demonstrated in the Conversionof Relishing GuideLine
How are the eighteen RootTerms construable under the Trefoil GuideLine
Of the nine profitable terms Insight and NonDelusion and Perception of Impermanence and Perception of NotSelf these four terms are NonDelusion and Quiet and NonGreed and Perception of Ugliness and Perception of Pain  these four terms are NonGreed and NonHate That is how these nine terms can be construed under the three profitable roots
Herein of the nine unprofitable terms Craving and Greed and Perception of Beauty and Perception of Pleasure  these four tems are Greed as unprofitable Root  and Ignorance and Delusion and Perception of Permanence and Perception of Self  these are Hate And so these nine terms are construed under the three unprofitable roots
That is how the eighteen RootTerms can be demonstrated by the Trefoil GuideLine by construing them under the profitable and unprofitable  roots
How are the eighteen RootTerms construable under the PlayofLions GuideLine
Craving and Perception of Beauty these are the first Perversion
Greed and Perception of Pleasure  these are the second Perversion
Ignorance and Perception of Permanence  these are the third Perversion
Delusion and Perception of Self  this is the fourth Perversion
So these nine  unprofitable terms are construed under the four terms
NonGreed and Perception of Pain  these are the second Foundation of Mindfulness
Insight and Perception of Impermanence  these are the third Foundation of Mindfulness
NonDelusion and Perception of NotSelf these are the fourth Foundation of Mindfulness
These eighteen RootTerms have been included under the PlayofLions GuideLine
The plane and the resort  of these three GuideLines is included in each  GuideLine
When the profitable ideas or unprofitable ideas of one GuideLine are known the opposite  can be sought out accordingly Having sought out the opposites that GuideLine can be demonstrated When that GuideLine is demonstrated 
then according as one GuideLine is demonstrated so can all the three GuideLines each including the others be demonstrated
since the eighteen RootTerms are all included under each single GuideLine when that idea is cognized all ideas are cognized
Of these three GuideLines the PlayofLions GuideLine has the four Fruits of the Monks State for its end 
The Trefoil GuideLine has the three Gateways to Liberation for its end 
The Conversion of Relishing GuideLine has the Heart Deliverance due to Fading of Lust and the UnderstandingDeliverance due to Fading of Ignorance for its end
The first Direction has the HeartDeliverance due to Fading of Lust and the second Direction  has the UnderstandingDeliverance due to Fading of Ignorance
These are three GuideLines The Plotting of these three GuideLines eighteen RootTerms is called the PlottingofDirections GuideLine
By plotting  one knows that this idea belongs with this idea such right bringing together 
These are the five GuideLines
Here is a mnemonic verse 
Mindfulness Foundations And Quiet and Insight and the Roots Of Profit 
All Profit by nine terms construed And all Unprofit too by nine 
Guiding the profit by the roots Of profit unprofit by its roots 
which by the Faculties  guide and also By perversions the Defilements
The GuideLine that plots out ideas Of profit here unprofit there
After thus plotting with the Plotting Of Directions what then selects 
The Moulding of the GuideLines
the meaning contained in the two profitable ideas  in the Conversion of Relishing may be taken as analysing the plane of existence that is being analysed  in the triads And then all that meaning is demonstrated by three phrasing terms namely the three profitable roots
of meaning too  is stated by the four terms There is no plane to demonstrate by the twentyeight parts  since it is already demonstrated by the four terms as the four profitable perceptions which cover it
So the measure is the nonconfounding of what is demonstrated
Just as all kinds of concentration can be sought and found in the three kinds of concentrationin that with thinking and exploring that without thinking and with only exploring and that without thinking and without exploringsince this is their measure there being no fourth kind of concentration
while those creatures with prominent views have much insight and weak cleaving
What is form is self
what I am is form 
and he who  sees forms destruction  is an annihilationist
but when creatures of craving temperament find a way of entry into the Noble Ones True Idea and Outguiding Discipline they become Followers by Faith
To them the Master or some hearer of his teaches as follows
without cleaving to them through mental pain
hence pleasant way with sluggish acquaintanceship is said
And herein since creatures of craving temperament with blunt faculties actualize more sluggishly compared with the firstmentioned kind with keen faculties they renounce with pain and actualize sluggishly
hence painful way with sluggish acquaintanceship is said
while mindchoice as nutriment and consciousness as nutriment are abandonable by one of view temperament
and the measure is the four nutriments
are called remorse
and the remorse is underlying tendencies
are called barbs and they strike the heart and remain there
 Consciousness gripped by the four barbs is steadied on the four ideas  on form on feeling on perception or on determinations
this is the first Direction
 Mindchoice as nutriment the perversion that there is self in the notself view assuming the bond of views the bodytie of misapprehension the taint of views the flood of views the barb of views perception as steadyingpoint for consciousness passing on the going a bad way through fear 
 Consciousness as nutriment the perversion that there is permanence in the impermanent selftheory assuming the bond of ignorance the bodytie of insistence that this is truth  the taint of ignorance the flood of ignorance the barb of delusion determinations as steadyingpoint for consciousness passing on the going a bad way through delusion this is the fourth Direction
Likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
these are the first Direction
these are the third Direction
these are the fourth Direction
that is called the GuideLine of Plotting of Directions
are two types of persons
The unprofitable root delusion moulds itself therefrom by means of the object provocative of onlookingequanimity
three Searches  search for sensual desires search for being search for a divine life 
impart a single meaning and they are the first Direction on the black side The ten second terms of all the dyads are the second Direction
Herein of the nine profitable RootTerms Quiet and Perception of Ugliness these are the first Foundation of Mindfulness
the first Direction has the first Fruit the second Direction the second Fruit the third Direction the third Fruit and the fourth Direction the fourth Fruit
the first Direction has the Dispositionless the second Direction the Void and the third Direction the Signless
on the profitable side and on the unprofitable side is the Hook GuideLine
Craving Ignorance And Greed Hate and Delusion too
And with as well Perversions four Do constitute Defilements plane  The nine terms
all this profit here Does constitute the Faculties plane  The nine terms
With nine RootTerms for each of these Both sides thus total eighteen teros 
The GuideLine Craving and Ignorance guiding By Quiet and Insight
and construing Appropriately in the Truths Is the Conversion of Relishing
As they are really not unreally That GuideLine they call the Trefoil
Does Faiths True Objects  The wise in GuideLines  have called that Lions Play
As stated in the prose expounded  They call the Plotting of Directions
All profit ideas and unprofit And guides them right is called the Hook

and likewise the three kinds of understandingthat consisting in what is heard that consisting in cogitation and that consisting in keeping in beingsince they together are demonstrated  in all kinds of understanding understanding having no fourth kind that does not consist in what is heard or cogitation or keeping in being so too what is called the measure is the nonconfounding of these ideas
The Blessed One said this
Yes venerable sir those bhikkhus replied
Listen to that and attend closely I will speak
command what punishment for him you wish
how would you treat him
command what punishment for him you wish
how would you treat him
or how does it appear to you in this case
there is no difference between them at all that I see
or how does it appear to you in this case
there is no difference between them at all that I see
I go to Master Kaccana for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
But since that Blessed One has attained to final Nibbana we go to that Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
It seems that large numbers of people in India used to gather together here and there at city gates and in debating halls and pay gold money to have the various outsidesectarians tales such as the Rape of Sita and the rest told each tale to be finished at the end of four months
In the course of this a talk about good omens started in this way  What is a good omen Is what is seen a good omen Is what is heard a good omen Is what is sensed a good omen Who is there that knows what a good omen is
So Then a man who held the seen to be the good omen said  I know the good omen The seen is the good omen in the world For the visible form reputed as the best omen is seen
For example here someone having risen early sees a talking bird or a bilva sapling or a pregnant woman or children decked out in finery or full offering dishes or a fresh red mullet or a thoroughbred or a chariot with thoroughbreds or a bull or a cow or a brown ox or else he sees some other such visible form reputed to be the best omen This is what is called the good omen as the seen 
Some accepted his statementand some did not
Those who did not disputed with him
Then a man who held the heard to be the good omen said  Sirs the eye sees both what is clean and what is unclean likewise what is fair and what is ugly agreeable and disagreeable
If the seen were the good omen it would all be the good omen
here someone having risen early hears the name Vaddha or  Vaddhamna or Punna or Phussa or Sumana  or  Siri  or  Sirivaddha  pronounced or elsethe words  today is a good star conjunction  or a good period or  a good day  or  a good omen  or else he hears some such sound reputed to be the best omen This is what is called the good omen as the heard 
Some accepted his statement too and some did not
Those who did not disputed with him
Then a man who held the sensed to be the good omen said  Sirs the ear hears what is good and what is bad agreeable and disagreeable
If the heard were the good omen it would all be the good omen
For example here someone having risen early smells such a flower scent as lotus scent or chews a fine toothstick or he touches earth or touches green crops or fresh cowdung or a tortoise or a basket of sesamum or a flower or a fruit or does plastering with fine clay or clothes himself in fine cloth or wears a fine turban
Some accepted his statement too and some did not
Herein he who held the seen to be the good omen could not get the man who held the heard to be the good omen to perceive as he did  nor could anyone of them get the other two to perceive as he did
With that those who accepted the statement of him who held the seen to be the good omen went away saying  Only the seen is the good omen 
while those who accepted the statement of him who held the heard to be the good omen and that of him who held the sensed to be the good omen went away saying respectively  Only the heard is the good omen   Only the sensed is the good omen 
So this talk of good omens became the fashion throughout all India
And throughout all India men in factions speculated about good omens  What is a good omen
Guardian deities of human beings heard the talk and likewise took to speculating about good omens
Then there were earth deities who were friends of these When they heard about it from them these earth deities also took to speculating about good omens Then there were space deities who were friends of these    and deities of the Realm of the Four Kings    and so on in this way up as far as    Then there were Akanittha Deities who were friends of the Sudassi Deities in the world of High Divinity When they heard about it from them these Akanittha Deities took to speculating in factions about good omens
In this way speculation about good omens spread throughout ten thousand worldsystems
and after it had spread notwithstanding that it kept on being defined  The good omen is this the good omen is this twelve years went by and still there was no agreed definition
Except for noble disciples of the Blessed One all men and gods and High Divinities became divided into three factions according to the seen the heard and the sensed
no single one of whom had come to a conclusion  Only this is the good omen  that tallied with what actually is the fact and so it was that the  Goodomen Tumult arose in the world
Now there are five kinds of tumult an aeon tumult a Wheelturner tumult an Enlightenedone tumult a goodomen tumult and a stillness tumult
Herein sensualsphere deities with their heads bared and theirhair dishevelled with piteous faces mopping their tears with their hands clothed in dyed cloth and wearing their dress in great disorder travel up and down the haunts of men making the announcement At the end of a hundred thousand years there will be the emergence of an aeon This world will be destroyed Even the ocean will dry up This Great Earth and Sineru King of Mountains will be consumed and annihilated The destruction ofthe earth will extend as far as the World of High Divinity Maintain lovingkindness in being good sirs maintain compassion gladness maintain onlookingequanimity in being good sirs care for your mothers care for your fathers honour the elders of your clans be wakeful do not be negligent
This is called an aeon tumult
Sensualsphere deities too travel up and down the haunts of men making the announcement At the end of a hundred years a Wheelturning King will arise in the world
This is called a Wheelturner tumult
Pureabode deities put on divine ornaments make divine turbans on their heads and full of happiness and joy they travel up and down the haunts of men making the announcement  At the end of a thousand years an Enlightened One will arise in the world
This is called an Enlightenedone tumult
Pureabode deities too knowing gods and mens minds travel up and down the haunts of men making the announcement At the end of twelve years the Fully Enlightened One will explain the Good Omens
This is called a GoodOmen Tumult
Pureabode deities too travel up and down the haunts of men making the announcement  At the end of seven years a certain bhikkhu will meet with the Blessed One and question him about the practice of Stillness
This is called the stillness tumult
Among these five kinds of tumult it was the goodomen tumult that arose in the world among gods and men who had become divided into three factions over the seen good omen and the rest
Then after repeated investigation amongst gods and men without finding what the good omen was at last at the end of twelve years the deities belonging to the Body of the Thirtythree met and foregathered and they took counsel together thus  Good sirs just as the owner of a house for the inmates of the house as the owner of a village for the villagers as the king for all men so too this Sakka Ruler of Gods is for us our head and chief that is to say by dint of merit by lordship and understanding he is master ofthe two worlds of gods of the Four Kings and of the Thirtythree So surely we ought to ask Sakka Ruler of Gods about this matter
Accordingly they went to Sakkas presence and after paying homage to Sakka Ruler of Gods who with his figure resplendent with raiment and regalia befitting the occasion and surrounded by abevy of two and a half myriads of nymphs was seated on the Red Marble Throne at the root of the Pricchattaka Tree they stood atone side and they told him  Good sir please to know that a question about good omens has now arisen Some say that the seen is the good omen some say that it is the heard and some say that it is the sensed We and others too have come to no conclusion It would be good if you would pronounce a verdict
Now though the Gods King has native understanding still he asked  Where did this talk of good omens first originate
They replied  Sire we heard it from the gods of the Four Kings Realm 
Then those of the Four Kings Realm said From the space deities and the spacedeities said  From the earth deities and the earth deities said From human beings guardian deities and the human beings guardian deities said  It originated in the human world
Then the Ruler of Gods asked Where is the Fully Enlightened One living
They replied In the human world sire 
Has anyone asked that Blessed One No one sire
How then good sirs would you forget the fire and kindle a glowworm to light you that you overlook that Blessed One teacher of good omens without remainderand conceive that I should be asked Come good sirs let us ask that Blessed One then we shall surely obtain a splendid answer Then he commanded a gods son  Do you ask that Blessed One
So that gods son decorated himself with ornaments to suit the occasion and then flaring like a lightning flash and surrounded by a group of gods he went to the great monastery of Jetas Wood and after paying homage to the Blessed One he stood at one side Then putting the question about the good omen he uttered the verse  Gods and men there are full many    
Therefore the seen is not the good omen On the contrary the heard is the good omen
For the sound reputed as the best omen is heard
For example
Therefore the heard is not the good omen On the contrary the sensed is the good omen
For the odour flavour and tangible reputed as the best omen is sensed
or else he smells some such odour tastes some such flavour touches some such tangible reputed to be the best omen This is called the good omen as the sensed 
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Mithila in the Makhadeva Mango Grove
It occurred to the venerable Ananda What is the reason what is the cause for the Blessed Ones smile
Tathagatas do not smile for no reason
So he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder and extending his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One he asked him Venerable sir what is the reason what is the cause for the Blessed Ones smile
Tathagatas do not smile for no reason
Once Ananda in this same Mithila there was a king named Makhadeva He was a righteous king who ruled by the Dhamma a great king who was established in the Dhamma He conducted himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders among towndwellers and countryfolk and he observed the Uposatha days on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight
 Yes sire he replied
And after many years many hundred years many thousand years the barber saw grey hairs growing on King Makhadevas head
 Then good barber pull out those grey hairs carefully with tweezers and put them in my palm
 Yes sire he replied and he pulled out those grey hairs carefully with tweezers and put them in the kings palm
Then King Makhadeva gave the best township to his barber and calling the prince his eldest son he said Dear prince the divine messengers have appeared grey hairs are seen growing on my head I have enjoyed human sensual pleasures now it is time to seek divine sensual pleasures
Come dear prince take over the kingship
I shall shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness
And now dear prince when you too see grey hairs growing on your head then after giving the best township to your barber and after carefully instructing the prince your eldest son in kingship shave off your hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness
Continue this good practice instituted by me and do not be the last man
Dear prince when there are two men living he under whom there occurs a breach of this good practice  he is the last man among them
Therefore dear prince I say to you Continue this good practice instituted by me and do not be the last man
Then after giving the best township to his barber and after carefully instructing the prince his eldest son in kingship in the Makhadeva Mango Grove he shaved off his hair and beard put on the yellow robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness
He abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abided pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with lovingkindness abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill will
He abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassionwith a mind imbued with appreciative joywith a mind imbued with equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abided pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with equanimity abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill will
For eightyfour thousand years King Makhadeva played childish games for eightyfour thousand years he acted as viceregent for eightyfour thousand years he governed the kingdom for eightyfour thousand years he led the holy life in this Makhadeva Mango Grove after shaving off his hair and beard putting on the yellow robe and going forth from the home life into homelessness
By developing the four divine abodes on the dissolution of the body after death he passed on to the Brahmaworld
Now at the end of many years many hundred years many thousand years King Makhadevas son addressed his barber thus
The descendants of King Makhadevas son to the number of eightyfour thousand kings in succession after shaving off their hair and beard and putting on the yellow robe went forth from the home life into homelessness in this Makhadeva Mango Grove
with compassionwith appreciative joywith equanimitywithout ill will
For eightyfour thousand years they played childish games for eightyfour thousand years they acted as vice regents for eightyfour thousand years they governed the kingdom for eightyfour thousand years they led the holy life in this Makhadeva Mango Grove after shaving off their hair and beard putting on the yellow robe and going forth from the home life into homelessness
By developing the four divine abodes on the dissolution of the body after death they passed on to the Brahmaworld
Nimi was the last of those kings He was a righteous king who ruled by the Dhamma a great king who was established in the Dhamma He conducted himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders among towndwellers and country folk and he observed the Uposatha days on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight
Once Ananda when the gods of the Thirtythree had met together and were seated in the Sudhamma Assembly this discussion arose among them It is a gain sirs for the people of Videha it is a great gain for the people of Videha that their King Nimi is a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma a great king who is established in the Dhamma He conducts himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders among town dwellers and countryfolk and he observes the Uposatha days on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight
Then Sakka ruler of gods addressed the gods of the Thirty three Good sirs do you want to see King Nimi
 Good sir we want to see King Nimi
Now on that occasion it being the Uposatha day of the fifteenth King Nimi had washed his head and ascended to the upper palace chamber where he was seated for the Uposatha observance
Then just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm Sakka ruler of gods vanished among the gods of the Thirtythree and appeared in the presence of King Nimi
He said It is a gain for you great king it is a great gain for you great king
When the gods of the Thirtythree had met together and were seated in the Sudhamma Assembly this discussion arose among them It is a gain sirs for the people of Videhaeighth of the fortnight
Great king the gods want to see you
I shall send a chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds for you great king Great king mount the divine chariot without misgiving
King Nimi consented in silence
Then just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm Sakka ruler of gods vanished in the presence of King Nimi and appeared among the gods of the Thirtythree
Then Sakka ruler of gods addressed the charioteer Matali thus Come good Matali prepare a chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds and go to King Nimi and say Great king this chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds has been sent for you by Sakka ruler of gods Great king mount the divine chariot without misgiving
May your words be held sacred the charioteer Matali replied And having prepared a chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds he went to King Nimi and said Great king this chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds has been sent for you by Sakka ruler of gods Great king mount the divine chariot without misgiving
But great king by which route shall I drive you by that on which doers of evil experience the results of evil actions or by that on which doers of good experience the results of good actions
 Drive me by both routes Matali
Matali brought King Nimi to the Sudhamma Assembly
Sakka ruler of gods saw King Nimi coming in the distance
Welcome great king
The gods of the Thirtythree great king seated in the Sudhamma Assembly have expressed themselves thus It is a gain sirs for the people of Videhaeighth of the fortnight
Great king the gods of the Thirtythree want to see you
Great king enjoy divine might among the gods
Enough good sir Let the charioteer drive me back to Mithila
There I will conduct myself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders among towndwellers and country folk there I will observe the Uposatha days on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight
Then Sakka ruler of gods told the charioteer Matali Come good Matali prepare the chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds and drive King Nimi back to Mithila
May your word be held sacred the charioteer Matali replied And having prepared the chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds he drove King Nimi back to Mithila
And there indeed King Nimi conducted himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders among towndwellers and countryfolk and there he observed the Uposatha days on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight
Then at the end of many years many hundred years many thousand years King Nimi addressed his barber thus 
Now King Nimi had a son named Kalarajanaka
He did not go forth from the home life into homelessness
He broke that good practice
He was the last man among them
Now Ananda it may be that you think thus Certainly someone else was King Makhadeva on that occasion
But it should not be regarded thus
I was King Makhadeva on that occasion I instituted that good practice and later generations continued that good practice instituted by me
But that kind of good practice does not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana but only to reappearance in the Brahmaworld
But there is this kind of good practice that has been instituted by me now which leads to complete disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana
And what is that good practice
It is this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
This is the good practice instituted by me now which leads to complete disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana
Ananda I say to you continue this good practice instituted by me and do not be the last man
Ananda when there are two men living he under whom there occurs a breach of this good practice  he is the last man among them
Therefore Ananda I say to you continue this good practice instituted by me and do not be the last man
That is what the Blessed One said
The venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Then in a certain place the Blessed One smiled
There are full many is a demonstrative of an indefinite number hence what is meant is several hundreds several thousands
They sport  thus they are gods  the meaning isthey play with the five strands of sensual desires or they glitter with their own splendour
Moreover as to the word deva it is threefold as convention rebirth and purification
according as it is said
 God   there are three kinds of gods namely gods by convention gods by rebirth and gods by purification
Kings queens and princes are called  gods by convention 
the gods of the Four Kings Realm or the gods higher than that are called Gods by rebirth 
and the Arahants are called gods by purification  
Among these it is the gods by rebirth that are intended here
Men  they are the offspring of Manu  thus they are men 
though the Ancients say  They are men because of prominence of mind 
They are of four kinds as belonging to the four great continents of Jambudipa in the South Aparagoyna in the West Uttarakuru in the North and Pubbavideha in the East Here those of Jambudipa are intended
Creatures fall in with weal by means of these  thus they are good omens  the meaning is that they reach success and increment
Speculating on acintayumcintesum  Which they hope will bring them  which they want aspire to long for
Safety is a safe state  what is meant is  Hoping to assure the existence  here and now and in lives to come of all such ideas as are creditable  admirable and good
 Tell then  teach clarify announce reveal expound explain
The good omen  the reason for success reason for prosperity reason for all excellence
Supreme distinguished lofty which brings welfare and pleasure to all the world
Out of desire to hear about the Goodomen Question deities belonging to ten thousand worldsystems had met together in this worldsystem and had each created for himself a selfhood so subtle that ten twenty thirty forty fifty sixty seventy even eighty could stand together on an area no bigger than the pointof a single hairs tip and so they stood round the Blessed One who was sitting on the Enlightened Ones throne prepared for him outshining in his splendour and lustre all the gods the Mras and the High Divinities so since this gods son saw this and since he knew with his mind even the thoughts in the minds of all the human beings in the whole of Jambudipas land who had been unable to come on that occasion then in order to draw out from all be it gods or men the dart of uncertainty he uttered these words
Gods and men there are full many Speculating on good omens
Which they hope will bring them safety wanting each his own safety Tell then the supreme good omen
being questioned by me with the consent of these gods and for the sake of aiding men tell us out of pity Blessed One what omen is supreme for all of us by its bringing pure welfare and pleasure
Herein not consorting is not frequenting not reverencing
With the foolish  they are strong they breathe  thus they are fools  the intention is that they live with mere inbreath and outbreath instead of with the life of understanding 
With that sort of foolish men
Rather with the wise  they pick their way  thus they are wise  the intention is that they go with the gait of knowledge of benefits here and now and in the life to come
With that sort of wise men
Consorting frequenting reverencing them companionship intimacywith them Honouring  worshipping respecting revering paying homage
The honourable  those worthy of honour
This is a supreme good omen  he said This is a supreme good omen  referring collectively to all that he had just mentioned namely the nonconsorting with fools the consorting with the wise and the honouring of the honourable
what is meant is  Since you have asked  What is the supreme good omen  take it that in the first place this is a supreme good omen
This is the wordcommentary to this stanza
The commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows The Blessed One spoke this stanza after hearing these words of the gods sons thus
Herein there are four kinds of talk talk asked for talk unasked for talk with sequence of meaning and talk without sequence of meaning
Herein in such passages as O Gotama of abundant understanding How act disciples to be good I ask  and such passages as Good sir how did you come to cross the flood  what is spoken by him thus questioned is  talk asked for  
In such passages as  That which others count as pleasure Noble Ones will count as pain what is spoken by one without first being questioned and inspired by ones own inclination is  talk unasked for 
Because of the words Bhikkhus I teach the True Idea with sources  all Enlightened Ones talk is  talk with sequence of meaning 
In this Dispensation there is no  talk without sequence of meaning 
So out of these four kinds of talk this is  talk asked for  becauseit was spoken by the Blessed One when asked by this gods son
And in the case of talk asked for just as when a clever man who isskilled in what is the path and skilled in what is not the path is asked the path then after first telling what should be avoided heafterwards tells what should be taken saying There is a roadfork in that place there leave the left and take the right  so too with respect to what should and what should not be consortedwith what should be consorted with can be told after telling what should not be consorted with
And the Blessed One is like the man skilled in the path
according as it is said
  The man skilledin the path this Tissa is a designation for a Perfect One accomplished and fully enlightened  
for he is  Skilled in this world skilled in the other world skilled in what is the sphere of mortality skilled in what is not the sphere of mortality skilled in what is Mras sphere skilled in what is not Mras sphere 
That is why telling first what should not be consorted with he said Not consorting with the foolish Rather with wise men consorting 
since to start with fools should not be consorted with should not be reverenced like the path to be abandoned and next the wise should be consorted with should be reverenced like the road to be taken
If it is asked  But why were the nonconsorting with foolsand the consorting with the wise mentioned first by the Blessed One when speaking about the good omen
It may be stated as follows It was through consorting with fools that gods and men took up the view of good omens that assumed the good omen to be the seen etc  and that is no good omen That is why the Blessed One spoke first of nonconsorting with fools and consorting with the wise thus condemning association with those who are not good friends which is injurious to good in both this world and the next and commending association with good friends which ensures good in both worlds
Herein the foolish are any creatures who follow out the unprofitable courses of action beginning with killing breathing things and they can be recognized in three aspects
according as it is said in the Suttas Bhikkhus there are three characteristics of the fool 
Furthermore the six dissident teachers beginning with Prana Kassapa  then Devadatta andhis followers namely Koklika KatamorakaTissa Khanddeviyputta and Samuddadatta  and also Cincamnavik  etc and in bygone times Dighavidas brother and other such creatures as these should be understood as fools
They are like a smouldering ember with their misapprehension they ruin both themselves and those who give effect to their words
And so it is that Dighavidas brother has been lying prone where he fell in the Great Hell ripening out his evil actions for four Buddhaintervals with a selfhood  leagues inextent And so it is that five hundred clans who confessed his view were reborn as his retinue to ripen out their evil actions in the Great Hell
And this is said
Bhikkhus just as a fire that starts in a rush shed or a grass shed burns down even an upper chamber plastered within and without closed off secured by bars with windows shuttered so too whatever fears arise all arise owing to fools not owing to wise men
Whatever perils arise Whatever calamities arise all arise owing to fools not owing to wise men
While the fool brings fear the wise man does not
While the fool brings peril the wise man does not While the fool brings calamitythe wise man does not 
Moreover a fool resembles stale fish and one who consorts with him resembles a leafbag in which stale fish has been wrapped and so becomes fit only for wise mens rejection and disgust
And this is said
 Now when a man ties up with blades Of kusa grass some fetid fish
The blades of grass get fetid too Such is consorting with a fool 
And when the boon was being granted by Sakka Ruler of Gods Akittipandita said
Let me not see or hear a fool Let me not live where lives a fool
Let me not choose to have to do In verbal traffic with a fool
What has a fool then done by you Kassapa teil what is the cause
Why you have preference so great That never fool may cross your sight
He leads halfwittedly to loss And counsels irresponsibly
Prefers misjudgment and if told What is correct shows restiveness
 Nothing he knows of discipline Tis good to have no sight of him  
When the Blessed One had said that nonconsorting with fools is a good omen thus condemning consorting with fools in every aspect he now said that consorting with the wise is a good omen aswell commending consorting with the wise
Herein the wise are any creatures who follow out the ten profitable courses of action beginning with abstention from killing breathing things and they can be recognized in three aspects
Furthermore the Enlightened Ones and Hermit Enlightened Ones the eighty Great Disciples and the other disciples of Perfect Ones such as SunettaMah Govinda Vidhura Sarabhanga Mahosadha SutasomaKing Nimi Prince Ayoghara and Akittipanclita should be understood as wise men
They are as capable of eliminating all fear risk and calamity for those who give effect to their words as are protection in a rebellion a lamp in darkness food and drink and so on ina state of being overcome by pain of hunger and thirst and so on
For innumerable indeed and not to be measured are the gods and men who after coming to the Perfect One have attained exhaustion of taints or become established in the world of High Divinity  or become established in the world of sensualsphere gods or been reborn in the world of the happy destinations as human beings
Eighty thousand clans were reborn in heaven after gaining confidence in the Elder Sariputta and serving him with the four requisiteconditions for the bhikkhus life and likewise all the other great disciples Mah Moggallna Mah Kassapa and so on Some of the teacher Sunettas disciples reappeared in the world of High Divinitysome in the sensualsphere world in the company of the Paranimmitavasavatti Gods  some in the company of the householder clans of the great halls
And this is said
Bhikkhus it is not owing to a wise man that there is fear it is not owing to a wise man that thereis peril it is not owing to a wise man that there is calamity 
Moreover a wise man resembles such scented goods as tagara flowers and one who consorts with him resembles a leaf in which tagara flowers have been wrapped and he becomes fitf or wise mens cultivation and approval
And this is said
Now when in foliage a man Ties up some tagara incense
The leaves will of the scent partake Such is consorting with the wise  
And when the boon was being granted by Sakka Ruler of Gods Akittipanota said
Oh let me see and hear wise men Oh let me live where live wise men
Oh let me choose to have to do In verbal traffic with the wise
 What have the wise then done for you Kassapa teil what is the cause
Why you have preference so great That wise men always cross your sight
 They lead wisewittedly to gain Counsel not irresponsibly
Prefer good judgment and if told What is correct show docileness
 And discipline they understand Tis good to have to do with them  
When the Blessed One had said that consorting with wise men is a good omen thus commending consorting with wise men in every aspect he now said that honouring the honourable is a good omen commending the act of honouring to those who have through nonconsorting with fools and consorting with wise men approachedthe honourable
Herein the Enlightened Ones the Blessed Ones are honourable because they are devoid of all vices and possessed of all virtues
Next after them the Hermit Enlightened Ones and the Noble Disciples for the honouring of them even if itis little conduces for long to welfare and pleasureThe examples here are Sumana the garlandmaker Mallik and so on
Hereinwe shall relate one example One day it seems when it was morning the Blessed One dressedand taking his bowl and outer robe went into Rjagaha for alms
Sumana the garlandmaker was on his way to the king of Magadha with some flowers He saw the Blessed One who inspired confidence invited confidence as gleaming with a Buddhas splendour he was coming to the city gate When he saw him he thought The king might pay me a hundred or a thousand for these flowers but that would only be pleasure of this world On the other handhonour done to the Blessed One is immeasurable its fruit is incalculable and for long brings welfare and pleasure So I shall honour the Blessed One with these flowers And with confident heart hetook a handful of flowers and threw them in the Blessed Ones direction The flowers travelled through the air and remained suspended over the Blessed One in the form of a flower canopy
Seeing this mighty wonder he became still more confident in his heart and again he threw a handful They travelled as before and remained suspended in the form of a flower curtain
In that way he threw eight handfuls They travelled as before and remained suspended in the form of a flower palanquin
the Blessed One being inside the palanquin A huge body of people gathered
Seeing the garlandmaker the Blessed One manifested a smile
The Elder nanda thought Buddhas do not manifest a smile without cause or condition and he asked the reason
The Blessed One said nanda through the might of this honouring this garlandmaker will after traversing the round for a hundred thousand aeons among gods and men at last become a Hermit Enlightened Onecalled Sumanissara 
and at the end of his utterance he pronounced this stanza for the purpose of inculcating the True Idea
Good is the act that when performed Entails no burning of remorse
To reap whose ripening a man Is overjoyed and glad at heart 
And at the end of the stanza eightyfour thousand breathing things attained the True Idea
That is how it should be understood that the honouring of them even if it is little conduces for long to welfare and pleasure
And that was an honouring with only material things so what need besaid of honouring with practice
Consequently when clansmen do honour to the Blessed One by the Going for Refuge the acceptance of the Training Precepts and the giving effect to the Uposatha Factors and by their own special qualities beginning with the Virtue of the Fourfold Purity who can estimate the fruits of their honouring
For they are said to honour a Perfect One with thehighest honour
according as it is said 
nanda the bhikkhu or bhikkhuni or layman follower or laywoman follower who abides inthe way of practice in accordance with the True Idea and has entered upon the proper way behaving in accordance with the True Idea he it is that worships respects and reveres a Perfect One and honours him with the highest honour 
And the bringing of welfare and pleasure by honouring Hermit Enlightened Ones and Enlightened Ones disciples should be understood in the same way
Moreover in the case of laymen it should be understood that elder brothers and sisters are to be honoured by a junior mother and father by a son and husband motherinlaw and fatherinlaw by the daughtersinlaw of a clan
For in their case the honouring is a good omen too because it is their profitable ideas that are called  honouring and because these are a cause of increase in lifespan and the rest
for this is said
 Those who love mothers love fathers love monks love divines and are deferential to seniors of clans proceed in giving effect to this profitable idea Because of their giving effect to profitable ideas they find increase inlifespan and in good appearance  
Defining We show lastly how it is so it was stated in the Schedule  what still needs to be said can be stated as follows There are in fact three good omens mentioned in this stanza namely nonconsorting with fools consorting with the wise and honouring the honourable
Herein nonconsorting with fools should be understood as a good omen because it is a cause for welfare in both worlds by its safeguarding people from the fears that have for their condition consorting with fools Then consorting with the wise and honouring the honourable should be understood as good omens because they area cause for extinction and for the happy destinations in the way stated in the explanation of the greatness of their fruit
But in what follows we shall in each instance define the good omen and explain how it isa good omen without referring to the Schedule
The commentary on the meaning of this stanza Not consorting with the foolish  is ended
according as it is said in the Suttas  Bhikkhus there are these three characteristics of the wise man 
Now although the Blessed One had been begged for little with the single request  Tell then the supreme good omen still like the rare man who is a generous giver notwithstanding that he had already stated three good omens in a single stanza he began again to speak of many good omens with the stanzas beginning Living in befitting places doing so owing to deities desire to hear more than that owing to the existence of yet further good omens and owing to his own desire to enjoin upon the various creatures the good omens best suited to them wherever they might be
Herein in the third stanza to start with befitting means favourable
Places  village town city countryand in fact any locality inhabited by creatures
Living  living there
In the past  before in previous births
Having    made merit  having stored up profitable action
Self is what cognizance is called or else it is the whole selfhood Right direction in    guidance  right directing of that self prompting placing is what is meant
The rest is as already stated
This is the wordcommentary here
The commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows What is called living in befitting places is living where the four kinds of assembly are found where the grounds for making merit beginning with giving exist  and where the Masters Dispensation with its nine factors is in evidence Living there is called a good omen because it is a condition for creatures making merit
An example here is the story of the fisherman who entered the Island of Ceylon  and so on 
Another method the place which is the site of the Blessed Ones enlightenment is called a befitting place and likewise the place where the Wheel of the True Idea was set rolling and the place at the root of the Ganda Mango Tree where the Twin Marvel was shown in the midst of an assembly twelve leagues across disrupting the theories of all outside sectarians the place of the Descent from the Gods or any other place inhabited by the Enlightened One such as Svatthi Rjagaha and so on Living there is called a good omen because it is a condition for creatures obtaining the six Unsurpassables 
Another method  In the eastern direction the town called Kajangala on the far side of that Mahsl beyond that the outland countries to the near side is in the middle
In the southeastern direction the river called SalalavatI beyond that the outland countries to the near side is in the middle
In the southern direction the town called Setakannika beyond that the outland countries to the near side of that is in the middle
In the western direction a Divinecaste village called Thna beyond that the outland countries to the near side is in the middle
In the northern direction a rock called Usiraddhaja beyond that the outland countries to the near side is in the middle  
This Middle Place is three hundred leagues wide and two hundred and fifty broad and nine hundred in circumference
Here the Wheelturning Monarchs who exercise sovereignty and dominance over the four great continents and the two thousand small islands arise And here after fulfilling the Perfections during one incalculable age and a hundred thousand aeons the Great Disciples Sriputta Moggallna and the others arise And here after fulfilling the Perfections for two incalculable ages and a hundred thousand aeons the Hermit Enlightened Ones arise And here after fulfilling the Perfections for four eight or sixteen incalculable ages and a hundred thousand aeons the Fully Enlightened Ones arise
Herein by following the advice of a Wheelturning Monarch and establishing themselves in the five virtues creatures become destined for heaven
Likewise by following the advice of Hermit Enlightened Ones But by following the advice of a Fully Enlightened One or that of his disciple they become destined for heaven and destined for extinction 
That is why living there is called a good omen since it is a condition for these lands of excellence
The fact of having in past births stored up profitable action contingent upon honouring Enlightened Ones Hermit Enlightened Ones and those with taints exhausted is called having in the past made merit  That is a good omen too
Why
Because after seeing an Enlightened One or a Hermit Enlightened One facetoface or after hearing even a fourline stanza in the presence of an Enlightened One or his disciple Arahantship can be reached in the end
And when a human being has had previous practice so that the root of what is profitable is prominent in him  then by means of that same root of what is profitable he arouses insight and so reaches the exhaustion of taints like King Mah Kappina and his chief queen 
That is why it is said that having in the past made merit is a good omen
Right direction in selfguidance is stated thus  Here someone that was unvirtuous establishes himself in virtue that was faithless establishes himself in the excellence of faith that was avaricious establishes himself in the excellence of generosity
This is called  right direction in selfguidance   That also is a good omen
Why
Because it is a cause for attaining the numerous benefits both here and now and inthe life to come that are due to the abandoning of risk
So in this stanza there are also three good omens stated with living in befitting places having in the past made merit and right direction in selfguidance
The commentary on the meaning of this stanza namely Living in befitting places  is ended
This is called a befitting place
and how they are good omens has already been made clear in each instance
Now as to Ample learning  here ample learning means the state of having heard much 
A craft is any handskill
A   disciplining  disciplining of body speech and mind
Welltrained  properly trained
Well spoken  properly spoken
Any  an indefinite demonstrative
Speech  utterance pronouncement
The rest is as already stated
This is the wordcommentary here
The commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows The phrase ample learning is commented on as remembering the Masters Dispensation in the way beginning Remembers what he has heard and consolidates what he has heard  and Here someone has heard much  Threads of Argument  Songs  Expositions      That is called a good omen since it is a cause for abandoning what is unprofitable and achieving what is profitable and since it is a cause for gradually realizing the ultimate meaning 
And this is said by the Blessed One
 Bhikkhus a welltaught noble disciple abandons what is unprofitable and maintains in being what is profitable he abandons what is blamable and maintains in being what is blameless he keeps himself pure 
and it is said further
He investigates the meaning of ideas remembered When he investigates the meaning of ideas remembered he gets a liking for meditation upon ideas With the liking for meditating upon ideas zeal springs up One in whom zeal has sprung up is actively engaged Through being actively engaged he makes judgments When he has made a judgment he makes an endeavourtocontrol When he makes an endeavourtocontrol he realizes with the body the ultimate truth and he sees it by penetration of it with understanding 
Furthermore any ample learning concerned with the house life should be understood as a good omen if blameless since that too leads to welfare and pleasure in both worlds
As far as concerns the word craft  there is craft in house life and craft in homelessness
Herein craft in house life consists in such work as that of a jeweller or goldsmith which is far from what is morally unprofitable since it is devoid of injury of other breathing things and it is a good omen since it conduces to wellbeing in this world
Craft in homelessness consists in work on the monks requisites such as the layingout and sewing of robes etc which is given in detail here and there in the way beginning Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu is clever in any great or little task for his companions in the Divine Life  of which it is said  This is a helpful idea   That too should be understood as a good omen since it brings welfare and pleasure in both worlds alike to oneself and to others
As far as concerns disciplining 
there is firstly disciplining in the house life which is the abstaining from the ten courses of unprofitable action When that is well trained in by not offending through defilement and by defining the special qualities of virtuous conduct it is a good omen since it brings welfare and pleasure in both worlds
Then there is disciplining in the homeless state which is nonoffence under the seven categories of offences it is well trained in in the way already stated Or else disciplining in the homeless state is the Virtue of the Fourfold Purity  When that is well trained in by such a training that one established in it reaches Arahantship it should be understood as a good omen since itis a cause for attaining both mundane and supramundane pleasure
Any speech that is well spoken should be understood as speech devoid of the defects of lying harsh speechmalicious speech and gossip
according as it is said  Bhikkhus when speech possesses four factors it is well spoken  
Or else speech simply without gossip is  well spoken
according as it is said
Now those At Peace say First wellspokenness
Second speak but the True Idea naught else
And third speak only kindly not unkindly
And fourth speak only truth and nothing false  
This should be understood as a good omen since it brings welfare and pleasure in both worlds
Now this wellspokenness is normally included in disciplining nevertheless since it isseparately mentioned in this stanza  disciplining  should be taken to exclude it here
However why all this trouble What is to be understood here as  wellspokenness is the words used in teaching the True Idea to others
for that like  living in befitting places is called a good omen since it is a condition for creatures to attain welfare and pleasure in both worlds and also extinction as well
And this is said too
The speech where with a Buddha tells How safely to attain extinction
And make an end of suffering Of all kinds this is surely first 
So in this stanza there are four good omens stated with ample learning a craft welltrained disciplining and wellspoken speech
The commentary on the stanza  Ample learning is ended
How they are good omens has already been made clear in each instance
Aid is the act of aiding 
Spheres of work are simply work 
The rest is as already stated This is the wordcommentary
The commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows A mother is a parent and so is a father 
Aid is the furnishing of assistance by provision of the four requisiteconditions for life together with washing of feet rubbinganointing and bathing
Herein the mother and father are very helpful to children desiring their welfare and sympathizing with them so that when they see their little children who have been playing outside come in with their bodies covered with dirt they show their affection by cleaning off the dirt stroking their heads and kissing them all over And children can never repay a mother and father for that even were they to carry them about on their heads for a hundred years 
And then since they as educators and providers and instructors about this world stand as it were in the place of the High Divinity and are reckoned as equal to the Former Teachers aid provided for them brings commendation here in this life and heavenly pleasure after death
And this is said by the Blessed One
 Parents may indeed be called Divinities and Former Teachers
They merit childrens sacrifice For sympathizing with their offspring
For that a wise man venerates And worships them he makes provision
With what they need for food and drink With clothing and with bed as well
With care in bathing and anointing With washing of their feet besides
 For such behaviour towards His mother and his father thus
The wise commend him here and when He dies he goes to heavenly bliss  
Another method aid is of five kinds namely sustenance performance of tasks maintenance of the clans traditions etc and that should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for the five kinds of welfare here and now beginning with protection from evil
And this is said by the Blessed One
 Householders son mother and father as the eastern direction can be aided in five instances by a son  I who was given sustenance by them shall sustain them I shall perform their tasks for them I shall maintain the traditions of their clan I shall keep up their inheritance and in addition I shall make continual offerings for them when they have passed on and completed their time 
When mother and fatheras the eastern direction are aided by a son in these five instances they are sympathetic with their son in five instances they protect him from evil they encourage him to do good they have him trained in a craft they have him joined to a suitable wife and when it is the occasion they hand over their inheritance to him 
Furthermore he who aids his mother and father by arousing in them confidence in the three Objects of faithin the Enlightened One the True Idea and the Community by getting them to give effect to virtue or by the Going Forth is the foremost of those who aid their parents
For wife and children  here both sons and daughters born of oneself come to be counted as  children  
 wife  is any one of the twenty kinds of female spouse
Support is the giving of help by cherishing etc
and that should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for the welfare and pleasure here and now consisting in wellordered work and so on
And this is said by the Blessed One  Wife and children can be understood as the western direction  and the wife and children cited here are included by the words  female spouse  in the following passage  Householders son a female spouse as the western direction can be aided in return by a husband in five instances by cherishing by nondespising by nonbetrayal by relinquishing authority and by giving presents of ornaments
When a female spouse as the western direction is aided in return by a husband in these five instances she is sympathetic with her husband in five instances she is wellordered in her work her retainers are properly supported she does not betray her husband she preserves what has been earned and she is clever and industrious in all tasks  
Still another method Support is the act of supporting with gifts kind words and helpful behaviour that are lawful
for example giving pocketmoney on Uposatha days allowing the seeing of festivals on festival days ensuring good omens on omen days and advice and instruction about aims here and now and in life to come
That should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for welfare here and now in the way already stated since it is a cause for welfare in life to come owing to its being in accordance with the True Idea and since it is a cause for veneration by deities
according as Sakka Ruler of Gods has said
 The meritmaking householders The virtuous layfollowers
Who lawfully support their wives I venerate them Mtali 
The spheres of work that are said to bring no conflict are such spheres of work as agriculture  cattlekeeping commerce etc which owing to their promoting punctuality seemly action industriousness excellence of energy in rising early and freedom from malpractices are devoid of any such unprofitableness as dilatoriness unseemly action inaction tardy action and the like
These are called a good omen since when thus exercised either through ones own shrewdness or through that of ones wife and children or ones bonds men and servants they are a cause for the obtaining of increased riches here and now
And this is said by the Blessed One
 One seemly in his acts responsible Who rises early will augment his fortune   and
 Whose habit is to sleep by day And who is seen to rise by night
And constantly gets drunk with wine Is all unfit to keep a house
  Too cold Too hot Too late  they say
And opportunities pass by The tyros who thus shirk the task
But he that heeds no more than straws Both cold and heat
doing mens work Need never fail in happiness   and again
 So when a man saves up his wealth Emulating the honeybee
His riches will accumulate Just as an anthill is built up   and so on
So in this stanza there are just the four good omens stated with aid for a mother aid for a father support for wife and children and spheres of work that bring no conflict But there are five by taking wife and child separately and there are only three if mother and father are taken together
How they are good omens has already been made clear in each instance
The commentary in the meaning of this stanza  Aid for mother and for father is ended
That is why it is called a good omen
Now that aid of his to his mother and father which is aid in return for aid given to him by his mother and father is a good omen since it is the footing for many benefits both here and now and in the life to come
Now as to  Giving by means of this one gives  thus it is a giving  what is meant is that what is with one self is transferred to another
The conduct of the True Idea or conduct not deviating from the True Idea is TrueIdea conduct 
These are known to us  thus they are kin 
Unexceptionable is that which is not to be taken exception to  unblamed uncensured is what is meant
The rest is as already stated This is the wordcommentary
The commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows Giving is a term for the choice preceded by contentment consisting in giving up in someone elses favour one or other of the ten objects of giving beginning with food  or else it is the nongreed associated with that choice
for it is through nongreed that this object is transferred to another Hence it was said above By means of this one gives thus it is a giving
That is called a good omen since it is a cause for achieving the special fruits both here and now and in life to come consisting in dearness to many etc
and here such Suttas as this can be recalled A giver Siha a master of giving is dear to many beloved of many  
Another method Giving is of two kinds namely giving of material things and giving of the True Idea  Herein giving of material things is of the kind already stated
but giving of the True Idea is the teaching out of desire for others welfare of the True Idea proclaimed by the Enlightened One and that brings about the kind of pleasure that is due to the exhaustion of suffering both in this world and the other world Of these two kinds of giving this is the best
according as it is said
The gift of the True Idea conquers all gifts
The taste of the True Idea conquers all tastes
The joy of the True Idea conquers all joys
The termination of craving conquers all pain  
Herein it has only been stated how the giving of material things is a good omen
But the giving of the True Idea is called a good omen because it is the footing for such special qualities as the experiencing of the meaning 
for this is said by the Blessed One
 Bhikkhus in proportion as a bhikkhu teaches in detail the True Idea to others as he has heard and mastered it he accordingly comes to experience the meanings and experience the ideas in that True Idea   and so on
TrueIdea conduct is conduct consisting in the ten profitable courses of action
according as it is said  Householders there are three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the True Idea fair conduct  and so on
That TrueIdea conduct should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for rebirth in the heavenly world
for this is said by the Blessed One  Householders it is by reason of conduct in accordance with the True Idea by reason of fair conduct that creatures here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world  
Kin are those who are connected as far as the seventh generation back on the mothers or the fathers side
Support provided for them according to ones means with sustenance clothing corn etc when they come to one stricken by loss of property or loss through sickness is called a good omen since it is a cause for achieving the distinctions here and now consisting in commendation etc and for those in the life to come consisting in going to heaven and so on
Unexceptionable actions are those such as giving effect to the Uposatha factors doing social services planting gardens and groves making bridges etc
for these are called a good omen since they are a cause for achieving many kinds of welfare and pleasure
Here such Suttas as that which follows can be recalled It is possible Viskh that here some woman or man after observing the Observance Day with eight factors reappears on the dissolution of the body after death in the company of the gods of the Four Kings  
So in this stanza there are four good omens stated with giving TrueIdeal conduct support for kin and unexceptionable actions
The commentary on the meaning of this stanza  Giving is ended
How they are good omens has already been made clear in each instance
Now as to Shrinking abstinence  shrinking is the act of shrinking  Abstinence is the act of abstaining  or else creatures abstain by means of it thus it is abstinence
From evil  from what is unprofitable
Besotting is in the sense of causing intoxication  Besotting drink  mayjapnarhmajjassa pnam  from that besotting drink
Refraining  the act of refraining  Diligence  act of being not negligent 
In True Ideals  in what is profitable
The rest is as already stated This is the word commentary
The commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows Shrinking is only the mental nondelight in one who sees danger in evil
Abstinence is his act of abstaining by body and speech in those two doors of action That abstinence is three fold namely abstinence as custom abstinence as undertaking  and abstinence as severance Herein any clansmans abstinence in virtue of his own birth or clan or race from a thing customarily abstained from thinking  It does not befit me that I should kill a breathing thing take what is not given etc is called  abstinence as custom
When it occurs by undertaking training rules it is abstinence as undertaking subsequent to the occurrence of which a clansman does not indulge in killing breathing things and the rest
That associated with the Noble Path is  abstinence as severance  subsequent to the occurrence of which in a Noble Disciple the five fears and risks have been made to subside for him
Evil is given in detail thus  Householders son killing breathing things is a defilement in action and so are taking what is not given misconduct in sensual desires and false speech   
Killing breathing things and taking What has not been given lying
Going with anothers wife These no wise man will commend  
and is summed up in the following stanza thus  defilement in action called the  fourfold unprofitable From that kind of evil
And such Suttas should be recalled here as this Householders son when a Noble Disciple abstains from killing breathing things     
From besotting drink refraining  this designates abstention from any opportunity for negligence due to wine liquor and besotting drink which has already been described 
This refraining from besotting drink is called a good omen because one who drinks besotting drinks does not know either a meaning or an idea he illtreats his mother and his father and Enlightened Ones and Hermit Enlightened Ones and Perfect Ones disciples here and now he encounters censure in his next rebirth an unhappy destination and in the life after that madness
but when a man refrains from besotting drink he achieves both immunity from those defects and excellence in those special qualities that are their opposites
So that it should be understood is why it is called a good omen
Diligence in profitable ideals  There is carelessness inattentiveness heedlessness hanging back unzealousness uninterestedness nonrepetition nonmaintenanceinbeing nondevelopment nonresolution nonapplication negligence concerning the maintenance of profitable ideas in being
This diligence is called a good omen since it is a cause for achieving the various kinds of what is profitable and since it is a cause for reaching the Deathless
And the Masters message to be recalled here is that in such passages as follows  When a bhikkhu abides diligent ardent and selfcontrolled his     and  The way of deathlessness is diligence 
So in this stanza there are three good omens stated with abstinence from evil refraining from besotting drink and diligence in True Ideals
The commentary on the meaning of the stanza  Shrinkingabstinence  is ended
And all this shrinking and abstinence is called a good omen since it is a cause for the achievement of various kinds of distinction consisting in abandoning fear and risk here and now and in the life to come and so on
any such negligence neglecting neglectedness is called negligence 
it should be understood as the habit of never being without mindfulness of profitable ideas which as to meaning is the converse of the negligence stated as follows 
How they are good omens has already been made clear in each instance
Now as to  Then respect respect is respectfulness 
Humble manner is lowly mien 
Content is contentment 
The state of knowing what has been done is grateful bearing
When it is timely  when it is the moment when it is the occasion
Hearing truth dhammasavanarhdhammassa savanam 
The rest is as already stated This is the wordcommentary
The commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows Respect is the payment of respect  paying respect  respectfulness  accorded to Enlightened Ones Hermit Enlightened Ones Perfect Ones disciples teachers preceptors mothers fathers elder brothers and sisters etc who are the worthy means for the payment of respect
And that respect is called a good omen since it is a cause for going to a happy destination etc
according as it is said
 He pays respect to him to whom respect should be paid he reveres him that should be revered he honours him that should be honoured
By his adopting such actions and putting them into effect he reappears on the dissolution of the body after death in a happy destination in the heavenly world
If on the dissolution of the body    instead of reappearing   in the heavenly world he comes to the human state then he is of a highborn clan wherever he is born  
and according as it is said Bhikkhus there are these seven ideas that prevent decline
what seven
Respectfulness to the teacher     and so on
Humble manner is lowliness of the mind humility in manner The person possessing it has put away conceit put away arrogance and he resembles a footwiping cloth resembles a bull with amputated horns resembles a snake with extracted fangs and is gentle genial and easy to talk with Such is humble manner
This is called a good omen since it is a cause of obtaining the special qualities of fame and so on
And it is said that One humble and unobdurate Is such as will acquire good fame 
Content is contentment with the four requisite conditions whatever they are like  That is of twelve kinds
There are three kinds in the case of the robe namely contentment with what one gets contentment with ones own strength and contentment with what is befitting
and similarly in the cases of alms foodrestingplace and medicine
Here is a commentary on the divisions of it Here a bhikkhu obtains a robe and whether it is a fine one or not
he makes do with only that wishing for no other and he does not use any other even if he gets one this is his  contentment with what one gets  in the case of the robe
On the other hand he may be so afflicted by sickness that if he wears a heavy robe it weighs him down and tires him and then he is quite content to exchange it for a light one with a bhikkhu who is in communion that is not suspended by an act of the Community and to use that one this is his  contentment with ones own strength  in the case of the robe
Another bhikkhu maybe one who gets superior requisiteconditions and if he gets a very costly robe such as a lawn robe then thinking  This befits elders who have been long gone forth or the very learned he gives it to them and for himself collects rags from the top of a rubbish heap or anywhere else makes a patched cloak of them and wears that quite contentedly this is his contentment with what is befitting  in the case of the robe
Here again a bhikkhu obtains alms food and whether it is coarse or superior he uses only that and wishing for no other he does not use any other even if he gets it this is his contentment with what one gets  in the case of the alms food
On the other hand he may be so afflicted by sickness that if he eats coarse alms food he brings on a serious illness or disability and then he is content to give it to a bhikkhu who is in communion and to accept ghee honey milk etc at his hands and so be able to do his work upon the monks True Ideal This is his contentment with ones own strength in the case of the alms food
Another bhikkhu may get superior alms food and thinking This almsfood befits elders who have been long gone forth and other companions in the Divine Life who make do without superior alms food and so he gives it to them and after wandering for almsfood for himself he eats mixed alms food quite contentedly this is his contentment with what is befitting in the case of the alms food
Here again a bhikkhu acquires a restingplace
On the other hand he may be so afflicted by sickness that if he lives in a humble restingplace he is much troubled by biliousness and so on
Another bhikkhu may not accept a fine restingplace even if it is offered to him andthinking A fine restingplace offers grounds for negligence or lethargy and drowsiness descend on anyone who sits there and then thoughts of lust beset a man when he wakes up again after having been overcome by sleep
Here again a bhikkhu obtains common gallnuts or yellow gallnuts as medicine and he makes do with that
On the other hand he may get molasses when he is in need of oil and then he is quite content to give that to a bhikkhu who is in communion and after making up a medicine with the oilreceived at his hands he is then able to do his work upon the monks True Ideal this is his contentment with ones own strength  in the case of the requisite of medicine
Another bhikkhu when cows urine fermented with gallnuts has been put in one vessel and  foursweets  in another may be asked  Venerable sir take which you like  and then if either of the two cures his ailment thinking that urine with gallnuts was commended by Buddhas and so on and that this has been said  The Going Forth into Homelessness is dependent for medicine on fermented urine try and make use of that for the rest of your life  he refuses the medicine consisting of the  foursweets  and makes up a medicine with the urine and gallnuts and with that he is supremely content
Now all this contentment thus divided up is what is called content
It should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for achieving the abandoning of such evil ideas as excessiveness of wishes greatness of wishes and evilness of wishes  since it is a cause for rebirth in the happy destinations since it is an accessory of the Noble Path and since it is a cause of the fourdirection  state
and this is said
 With no resistance in the four directions
He is content with any one at all and so on
Grateful bearing is the state of knowing  by recollection again and again about assistance whether little or much and done by whomsoever it may be
Furthermore grateful bearing can also be understood as recollection of acts of merit which also greatly assist breathing things since they protect them from hells sufferings and so on Consequently  grateful bearing can be understood as the recollection of their assistance
That is called a good omen since it is a cause for acquiring the many sorts of distinctions beginning with commendability by True Men
And it is said  Bhikkhus two kinds of person are hard to find in the world
What two
One who first does a favour and one who is grateful who is recognizant 
Hearing Truth when it is timely  this is the hearing of the True Idea on an occasion when cognizance is accompanied by agitation or is overcome by thoughts of sensual desire ill will or cruelty doing so on such an occasion in order to remove these thoughts
Then some others have said that Hearing Truth when it is timely  is hearing the True Idea every five days
according as it is said But every five days we sit out the whole night together in talk on the True Idea  
Furthermore  Hearing Truth when it is timely  can also be understood as hearing the True Idea at a time at which one approaches good friends in order to be able to hear such of the True Idea as will remove ones own doubts
according as it is said  From time to time he approaches them and he asks and he questions  and so on
That hearing of Truth when it is timely should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for acquiring the many distinctions beginning with the abandoning of hindrances the four benefits and the exhaustion of taints
this being said
 Bhikkhus on an occasion on which a Noble Disciple hears the True Idea giving ear by heeding attending and wholeheartedly reacting then on that occasion there is in him no one of the five hindrances  
and this  Bhikkhus when ideas that have come to the ear  are well penetrated four benefits can be expected 
and this Bhikkhus there are these four ideas which when they are completely maintained in being made to have completely parallel occurrence eventually bring about the exhaustion of taints
What four
Hearing Truth when it is timely      and so on
So in this stanza there are five good omens with respect humble manner content gratitude and hearing Truth when it is timely
The commentary on the meaning of this stanza  Then respect is ended
and is contented with only that one and if he acquires another better one he does not use it this is his  contentment with what one gets  in the case of the restingplace
and then he is quite content to give it to a bhikkhu who is in communion and to live in an airy cool restingplace that the other has acquired and so be able to do his work upon the monks True Ideal this is his contentment with ones own strength  in the case of the restingplace
he rejects it and lives anywhere such as in the open at a treeroot in a leafhut quite contentedly this is his  contentment with what is befitting  in the case of the restingplace
he makes do with only that without wishing for the ghee honey molasses etc obtained by others and not using it even if he gets it this is his contentment with what one gets  in the case of the requisite of medicine
this is his  contentment with what is befitting in the case of the requisite of medicine
How they are good omens has already been made clear in each instance
Now as to Patience patience is the act of being patient 
Meekness when corrected  because of his taking correction aright a speakingto is easy in his case thus he is easilyspokento  the action of one who is easilyspokento is easilyspokenabout  the state of what is easilyspokenabout is easilyspeakableaboutness 
They are monks because of the stilling of defilements 
Seeing  regarding
Discussion of the Truth dhammaskacchdhammassa skacch 
The rest is as already stated
This is the wordcommentary
according as it is said
In olden time there was a monk Of patience he was paragon
 He kept his patience even when The king of Ksi murdered him 
Or else he gives it attention as admirable that it is no worse affliction like the venerable Punna
according as it is said
 Venerable sir if the people of Sonparanta abuse and threaten me then I shall think  These people of Sonparanta are admirable truly admirable in that they did not give me a blow with a fist    and so on
One who possesses this is commended also by the Seers
according as Sarabhanga the Seer said
Who has his anger slain he sorrows nevermore
The Seers do recommend abandoning contempt
Be patient with the words of all that harshly speak
The Men at Peace have said Such patience is supreme 
And he is commended by deities too
according as it is said
It is when one endowed with strength Will show forebearance to the weak
That patience shows supreme they say If weak a man is always patient 
And he is commended by the Enlightened Ones too
according as Sakka Ruler of Gods said
Who free from anger will yet bear  Abuse and even torture too
With patience in force in strong array Him truly do I call divine 
Now this patience should be understood as a good omen since itis a cause for acquiring the special qualities mentioned here and others as well
Meekness when corrected is the state that causes the speaking of the word  good  by someone who is being lawfully spoken to for the purpose of his being corrected whereby he does so without indulging in prevarication or silence or thinking up virtues and vices and places foremost the greatest obedience respect and lowliness of mind
That is called a good omen since it is a cause for the obtaining of advice and instruction in the Divine Life and since it is a cause for abandoning vices and acquiring virtues
Seeing monks is the seeing byapproaching aiding recollecting and hearing of those gone forth whose defilements are stilled who have maintained in being body virtue cognizance and understanding and who possess the supreme control and quiet And all that is called  seeing  by the Teaching in the elementary form That should be understood as a good omen
Why
Because of its great helpfulness
And this has been said  Bhikkhus seeing of those bhikkhus is very helpful I say  and so on
Consequently as soon as a clansman desirous of welfare sees virtuous bhikkhus at his door he should serve them according to his means with what is available for giving if anything is available for giving
if there is none he should pay homage with the fivefold prostration
if that is not possible he should venerate them with hands raised palms together if that is not possible he should look on them with confident heart and loving eyes
Then owing to such merit rooted in seeing he will for many a thousand births have in his eye no disease illhumour swelling or stye and his eyes will sparkle brightly with the five colours like moving crystal panes in a divine mansion built of jewels and for as much as a hundred thousand aeons he enjoys every sort of excellence among gods and men
And it is no wonder that a human being born with understanding should find that his acts of merit consisting in the rightly effected seeing of monks ripen so excellently since even in the case of animals born with only bare faith it is told how excellently their acts of merit ripen
The roundeyed owl who long did dwell Here in the vedisaka tree
happy owl was he indeed To see a Buddha rare to rise betimes
His heart had confidence in me And the Community elect
 Now for a hundred thousand aeons No state of deprivation he shall know
 Him when he falls from heavenly worlds His profitable deeds will guide
And far and wide he will be called The Joyous One whose knowledge has no bounds 
And then discussion of the Truth when it is timely  in the dusk or in the early dawn say two bhikkhus Suttaexperts discuss with each other about Suttas or two Vinayaexperts about the Vinaya or two Abhidhammaexperts about the Abhidhamma or two Jtakapreachers about the Jtaka or two Commentaryexpounders about the Commentary or else they converse from time to time for the purpose of dispelling a state of cognizance that is slack or agitated or beset by uncertainty this is discussion of the truth when it is timely
It is a good omen since it is a cause for such special qualities as particular distinction in the scriptures and so on
So in this stanza there are four good omens stated with patience meekness when corrected seeing monks and discussion of the True Idea when it is timely
The commentary on the meaning of this stanza  Patience  is ended
The commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows Patience is patience as endurance If a bhikkhu possesses it then when people abuse him with the ten instances of abuse or threaten him with torture etc he is as though he neither heard nor saw them and remains as impassive as did Khantivadi 
How they are good omens has already been made clear in each instance
Now as to  Ardour  it burns up evil ideas thus it is ardour 
The Divine Life is either the life that is divine or it is the life of the High Divinities  what is meant is the best life 
Seeing truths that are called Noble ariyasaccna dassanamariyasaccnam dassanam  some say ariyasaccni dassanam  but that is inelegant
It has left the wood  thus it is extinction  the act of realizing is realization  Realization of extinction nibbdnasacchikiriynibbnassa sacchikiriy 
The rest is as already stated This is the wordcommentary
The commentary on the meaning should be understood asf ollows Ardour is either facultyrestraint  since that burns up covetousness and grief etc or else it is energy since that burns up idleness a person possessing it is called ardent 
It is a good omen since it is a cause for the abandoning of covetousness etc and for the obtaining of jhana and so on
The Divine Life is a designation for abstinence from sexual intercourse for the monks True Ideal  for the Dispensation and for the path
For in such passages as  Abandoning what is not the Divine Life he becomes one who leads the Divine Life  it is abstinence from sexual intercourse that is called Divine Life 
In such passages as Friend is a Divine Life lived under the Blessed One 
In such passages as  Evil One I will not finally attain extinction until this Divine Life of mine shall have become prosperous flourishing and widespread among the many  it is the Dispensation 
In such passages as  Bhikkhu this Noble Eightfold Path is a Divine Life
that is to say right view   it is the path 
All this is appropriate here except for the lastmentioned kind since that is included in seeing truths that are called Noble which follows next
It should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for reaching the successively higher distinctions obtained by the successive four paths and four fruitions of StreamEntry and the rest
Seeing truths that are called Noble is the seeing peculiar to the Path in virtue of which they attain to the four Truths mentioned in the Boys Questions  It is a good omen since it is a cause for surmounting the suffering of the round of rebirths
Realization of extinction  here it is the fruition of Arahantship that is intended by extinction 
for that is called  extinction  because of the surmounting of craving termed fastening as the fastening to the five kinds of destination
So while either the reaching of that as the path or the reviewing of it as the paths fruition can actually be called  realization 
nevertheless since the former kind of realizationas the path has already been established by the immediately preceding phrase seeing truths that are called Noble that kind is consequently not intended here in this phrase
So this kind of realization of extinction namely reviewing as the fruition of the path should be understood as a good omen since it is a cause for a pleasant abiding here and now and so on
So in this stanza there are four good omens stated with ardour the Divine Life seeing the Noble Truths and realization of extinction
The commentary on the meaning of this stanza  Ardour is ended
it is the monks True Ideal 
How they are good omens has already been made clear in each instance
Now as to Though by worldly ideas tempted Tempted is contacted stirred reached
Worldly ideas are ideas in the world  such ideas as are never reversed as long as the world continues its occurrence is what is meant
Cognizance is mind  mentality 
His  of a new bhikkhu a middle or an elder bhikkhu
Neer  shall waver  neither moves nor vacillates
Sorrowless  unsorrowing  with the dart of sorrow extracted
Stainless  with stains gone  with stains erased 
In safety  fearless unmenaced
The rest is as already stated This is the wordcommentary
The commentary on the meaning should be understood as follows Though by worldly ideas tempted Neer his cognizance shall waver  when someone is tempted  beset by the eight worldly ideas namely gain and nongain fame and illfame censure and praise pleasure and pain  and his cognizance does not waver is unmoved never vacillates then that cognizance of his should be understood as a good omen since it brings about the nonwavering supramundane state
And whose cognizance is it that does not waver when he is tempted by them
The Arahants in whom taints are exhausted no one elses at all
And this is said
Just as a solid mass of rock Remains unshaken by the wind
So too no forms sounds smells or tastes No tangibles of any sort
Nor yet ideas disliked or liked Avail to move those such as this
 Such cognizance stands quite aloof In contemplating subsidence  
It is only the cognizance in one whose taints are exhausted that is called sorrowless 
That is sorrowless because of the absence of what is stated in the way beginning Sorrow sorrowing sorrowfulness inner sorrow inner sorriness consuming of the heart 
Some say that it is extinction  but that has no sequence of meaning with the line that precedes it
And just as the cognizance of one whose taints are exhausted is sorrowless  so too it is stainless and in safety 
since it is  stainless  with the absence of any stain of lust hate and delusion and it is  in safety  because it is safe from the four bonds  Consequently it should be understood as a good omen since although threefold as demonstrated by the three words beginning with  sorrowless  when thus taken at the moment of its occurrence in whichever mode it happens to occur it is a cause for bringing about undisconcertability and the highest state in the world etc and is a cause for bringing about fitness for gifts  and so on 
So in this stanza there are four good omens stated with unwavering cognizance sorrowless cognizance unstained cognizance and secure cognizance with respect to the eight worldly ideas
The commentary on the meaning of this stanza  Though by worldly ideas tempted Neer his cognizance  is ended
How they are good omens has already been made clear in each instance
After thus stating thirtyeight good omens with the ten stanzas beginning with  Not consorting with the foolish   he now uttered this final stanza Since by working such like omens extolling the good omens already mentioned by himself
Here is a commentary on its meaning Suchlike  such as these  namely  the nonconsorting with fools etc of the kinds already stated by me
Since by working 
katvna is the same as karitv or katv  and is no different in meaning
Men are everywhere unvanquished  what is meant is that not being vanquished by even one among the four enemies classed as the Mras of categories defilements and determinative acts and Mara the gods son and having on the contrary themselves vanquished those four Mras
The letter m here in the compound sabbatthamaparjit should be taken as inserted merely for purposes of liaison
And go everywhere in safety  whether in this world or in the other world whether standing walking etc everywhere they go in safety owing to their remaining unvanquished by the four Mras after they have worked suchlike good omens as these what is meant is that they go in safety go unmenaced unharassed secure and fearless because of the absence of those taints vexations and fevers that would have arisen from their consorting with fools and the rest
And the nasal component should be understood as inserted for metrical reasons
That is their supreme good omen with this line of the stanza the Blessed One concluded his teaching
How
Gods son take it thus Whoever work suchlike omens  then since they go everywhere in safety it is that namely the thirtyeightfold good omen of nonconsorting with fools etcwhich is therefore their namely of those who have worked suchlike omens supreme  best superlative good omen 
Now when this teaching was thus concluded by the Blessed One a hundred thousand myriads of deities reached Arahantship and the number of those who reached the fruitions of Streamentry Oncereturn and Nonreturn was incalculable
Then on the following day the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda thus  nanda last night a certain deity approached me and asked me a question about good omens I told him thirtyeight good omens Learn this discourse on good omens have the Bhikkhus recite it
The Elder learnt it and had the bhikkhus recite it
That has come down by the succession of teachers being such as we have it today So it can be understood that this was how this Divine Life became prosperous flourishing and widespread among the many disseminated and properly explained by gods and men 
Now here is how to construe it all from the beginning the purpose of doing which is to gain exercise and facility of knowledge in these same good omens So then these creatures who desire the pleasures of this world and of the other world and supramundane pleasure as wellwhen after abandoning consorting with foolish people and coming to depend on the wise they honour those who should be honouredwhen they are encouraged by living in a befitting place and by merit previously made to perform what is profitablewhen by right direction in selfguidance they each acquire a selfhood adorned with ample learning a craft and disciplinewhen they speak what is well spoken since it befits the disciplinewhen as long as they have not renounced the lay state they liquidate their old indebtedness to other peopleby aid for mother and father contracting new indebtedness to themselves by support for wife and children and they gain success in riches and corn through spheres of work that bring no conflict and then by taking the heartwood of riches through giving and the heart wood of life through TrueIdeal conduct they work the welfare of their own people by support of kin and the welfare of other people by unexceptionable actions till by avoiding through abstinence from evil the hurting of others and by refraining from besotting drink the hurting of themselves they increase the profitable side by diligence in True Idealsand when having abandoned the lay life owing to increase in what is profitable they are gone forth in to homelessness and after cultivating excellence in the Duties by respect and humble manner towards the Enlightened One disciples of the Enlightened One preceptors teachers and so on and contentedly abandoning cupidity for requisites they establish themselves on the plane of True Men by means of gratitude and then after abandoning slackness of cognizance through hearing the True Idea and transcending all anxieties through patience they find helpers for themselves through meekness under correction and so come owing to seeing monks to see how to proceed with the practice till after removing by discussion of the truth doubt about ideas that should be doubted about they eventually achieve Purification of Virtue by means of ardour in facultyrestraint Purification of Cognizance by means of the kind of Divine Life that consists in the Monks True Ideal and the four Purifications that follow upon those then by means of this practice the Purification of Knowledge and Seeing that is referred to by the words  seeing truths that are called Noble they realize at last the fruition of Arahantship called  extinction after which their cognizance no more wavers owing to the eight worldly ideas than does Mount Sineru owing to wind and rain they are sorrowless unstained and secure
and those who are secure are everywhere unvanquished and go everywhere in safety
That is why the Blessed One said
Since by working suchlike omens Men are everywhere unvanquished
And go everywhere in safety That is their supreme good omen
Now at the end of many years many hundred years many thousand years King Makhadeva addressed his barber thus Good barber when you see any grey hairs growing on my head then tell me
When he saw them he said to the king The divine messengers have appeared sire grey hairs are to be seen growing on your majestys head
And there he had expounded meditation subjects suitable for the eightyfour thousand shades of temperament in the following way that is to say for those of lustful temperament he showed Loathesomeness as a meditation subject of the eleven kinds as with consciousness and without consciousness for those of hating temperament the fourfold meditation subject beginning with Lovingkindness for those of deluded temperament the meditation subject consisting in Mindfulness of Death etc for those of speculativethinking temperament Mindfulness of Breathing the Earth Universal etc for those of faithful temperament the meditation subjects consisting of the Recollections of the Enlightened One etc and for those of intelligent temperament the Definition of the Four Elements
So when a party of five hundred bhikkhus had learnt each a meditation subject in the Blessed Ones presence and were seeking a suitable resting place with a village as alms resort eventually in the outland country they came in sight of a mountain forming part of the Himalaya range While its surface glittered like blue quartz crystal it was embellished with a cool dense shady green forest grove and a stretch of ground strewn with sand resembling a pearlnet or a silver sheet and it was furnished with a clean spring of grateful cool water
Now when the bhikkhus had spent one night there and the dawn was drawing near they attended to the needs of the physical frame and then went for alms into a town not far distant
The town was connected with a thousand clans and constructed as a communityresidence and the people there had faith and confidence Since it is hard in the outlands to get a sight of those gone forth into homelessness they were happy and joyful when they saw the bhikkhus and they fed them and begged them to stay on there for the three months of obligatory residence during the Rains and they had five hundred workrooms built and furnished with all such necessaries as beds chairs pots for drinking and washing water and so on
On the following day the bhikkhus went into another town for alms
and there too the people served them in like manner and begged them to stay on for the Rains
The bhikkhus consented subject to there being no obstacle They reentered the wood where they arranged to keep up energy night and day by having a woodblock struck for the watches and abiding much in reasoned attention they went to the roots of trees and sat down
The tree deities were discouraged by the virtuous bhikkhus courage and they came down from their own mansions and wandered back and forth with their children
Just as when a block of houses is commandeered from villagers by kings or royal ministers and the human inhabitants of the houses who have had to evacuate them and go to live elsewhere watch from a distance wondering  When are they going away  so too the deities came down from their own mansions and wandered back and forth watching from a distance and wondering When are the venerable ones going away
Next they thought thus  Bhikkhus who enter upon the first period of residence for the Rains will certainly stay on for three months but we cannot live with our children away from home for so long Let us show the bhikkhus some object that will scare them away
So in the night when it was the bhikkhus time to give effect to the monks True Ideal they created terrifying forms of spirits and standing in front of each of them they made a dreadful noise
When the bhikkhus saw the forms and heard the noise their hearts quailed they grew pale and jaundiced
and they could no longer unify their cognizance When they were harassed again and again by this fear with their cognizance ununified they forgot their mindfulness As soon as they had forgotten their mindfulness the deities harassed them with bad smells as objects Their brains seemed to smother in the stench with feelings of oppression in their heads However they did not mention their hauntings to each other
Then one day when all had assembled at the time for waiting on the Senior Elder of the Community he asked them Friends when you went into this wood the colour of your skin was quite pure and bright for some days and your faculties were clear but now you are lean and pale and jaundiced What does not suit you here 
Then a bhikkhu said  Venerable sir at night I saw and heard suchandsuch a dreadful object and I smelt suchandsuch a smell and so my mind was not concentrated and all told in the same way what had been happening
The Senior Elder said Friends two kinds of Entry upon Residence for the Rains have been described by the Blessed One  and this resting place does not suit us So let us go to the Blessed One and ask about another resting place that will suit us
The others agreed and so they all put their resting places in order and then they took their bowls and outer robes and without even telling anyone  for they had no attachments among the clans  they set out to wander by stages to Svatthi
They went to the Blessed One
When he saw them he said Bhikkhus a training rule has been made known by me saying that no one is to go wandering during the Rains  Why are you wandering 
They told the Blessed One all that had happened
The Blessed One adverted to the whole of Jambudipa but he saw not even so much as a place for a fourlegged chair that might suit them as a resting place
Then he told them Bhikkhus there is no other resting place that will suit you It is only by living there that you might reach the exhaustion of taints So go and occupy that same resting place But if you want to be free from fear of deities then learn this safeguard
for this will be both a safeguard and a meditation subject for you and he uttered this Sutta
According to some others however he said  So go and occupy that same resting place after saying which the Blessed One added  A forestdwelling bhikkhu should know the protection procedure
that is to say by doing every evening and morning two spells of Lovingkindness two of Safeguards two of Loathesomeness and two of Mindfulness of Death and also by adverting to the Eight Principal Grounds for a Sense of Urgency and the Eight Principal Grounds for a Sense of Urgency are either birth ageing sickness death and the suffering in the four states of deprivation or else they are the four consisting of birth ageing sickness and death and then the suffering in the states of deprivation as the fifth the suffering rooted in the round during the past the suffering rooted in the round during the future and the suffering rooted in the search for nutriment
And they say that when the Blessed One had told those bhikkhus the protection procedure he then uttered this Sutta for the sake of Lovingkindness for the sake of a Safeguard and for the sake of the jhana obtainable through lovingkindness that is to be used as the basis for insight into the Three Characteristics of impermanence suffering and notself
And now since it was also said And then a comment I shall tell there begins the commentary on the meaning of this discourse whose source has just been clarified in this way
By one with skill in good atthakusalenaatthe kusalena  by one clever in good is what is meant
What  either this is a nominative indefinite pronoun agreeing with karaniyam
and this is an accusative definite pronoun agreeing with santam padam or else the words yan tarn are both nominative agreeing with karaniyam and only the words
santam padam are accusative and herein this last is a designation for extinction since that is  peace  by characteristic and it is a  state by its reachability 
To have attained  having come up to 
He can  thus he is able  what is meant is that he is capable has power
Right  yoked to rectitude 
He is thoroughly right thus he is upright 
Speaking to him is easy in his case thus he is meek 
He would be assabhaveyya 
Gentle  yoked to mildness 
Not proud anatimnlna atimnl 
Now here is a commentary on the meaning of the two clauses What should be done by one with skill in good The State of Peace to have attained is this
Herein there is what should be done and there is what should not be done
Herein briefly what should be done is the three Trainings and what should not be done comprises failure in virtue failure in views failure in conduct failure in livelihood and so on
Likewise there is one with skill in good and there is one without skill in good
Herein one without skill in good is one gone forth in the Dispensation who does not devote himself rightly whose virtue is torn  who makes a living by depending on the twentyone kinds of improper search 
namely be depending as a bhikkhu on giving bamboos giving leaves giving flowers giving fruits giving toothsticks giving mouthwashing water giving bathing facilities giving bath powder giving clay flattery beansoupery fondling carrying communications on foot practising medicine acting as a messenger going on errands getting almsfood given in exchange for alms food science of lands science of fields science of astrology science of limbs 
who goes to the sixfold wrong resort
namely  A harlot as resort or a widow oldmaid eunuch bhikkhuni or a tavern
who dwells associated with kings kings ministers other sectarians other sectarians disciples by association not in conformity with the True Idea who cultivates frequents and honours such clans as are faithless without confidence addicted to abuse and calumny and undesirous of good and desirous of harm discomfort and what is not safety from bondage where bhikkhus and bhikkhunis and laymen followers and laywomen followers are concerned  
But one gone forth in this Dispensation who devotes himself rightly and abandoning improper search and desiring to establish himself in the Virtue of Fourfold Purity  fulfils the Restraint by Ptimokkha Rule under the heading of faith FacultyRestraint under the heading of mindfulness Purification of Livelihood under the heading of energy and right Use of the RequisiteConditions for the bhikkhus life under the heading of understanding
And when he purifies Restraint by Ptimokkha Rule by means of purification in the seven categories of offences  purifies FacultyRestraint by means of nonarousing of covetousness and ill will when objects have impinged in the six doors of the five faculties beginning with the eye and that of the mind purifies livelihood by means of avoidance of improper search and by use of what is commended by the wise and praised by the Enlightened Ones and their disciples purifies the use of the four requisiteconditions by means of the reviewing already mentioned and purifies Full Awareness by means of the reviewing in the case of alternation of the postures the purposefulness suitability resort and nondelusion 
And when he knows that virtue is cleaned with knowledge just as dirty cloth is cleaned with beanwater or a lookingglass with ashes or gold with a furnace and he cleans his virtue by washing it in the water of knowledge and that is when he guards his own Virtue Category most diligently
just as ahen bird guards her eggs as a yak guards his tail as a woman with an only child guards her dearly beloved only child or as a oneeyed man guards his only eye  and he reviews it evening and morning till he sees no slightest blame there
And when he becomes established in the virtue that provides nonremorse when he exerts himself in the way of suppression of defilement and in the pursuit of that does the preliminary work on a Universal  and when by doing the preliminary work on a Universal he generates the attainment of jhana
But the acme of skill in good is when having emerged from an attainment he comprehends determinations till he eventually reaches Arahantship
Herein those with skill in good  praised either in so far as they are established in the virtue that provides nonremorse or in so far as they exert themselves in the  way of suppression of defilement or in so far as they attain the paths and fruitions are those with skill in good  in this sense
And those bhikkhus were of such kinds
Hence the Blessed One said What should be done by one with skill in good with reference to those bhikkhus but giving the teaching in terms of a single person
Next when they were wondering  What should be done   he told them The State of Peace to have attained is this 
Now the intention can be taken as follows It is what should be done by one who desires after contriving to have attained it by penetration to abide in this extinctionStateofPeace  which is praised by the Enlightened Ones and their like
And here  what implies only the practice that at the beginning of this line in the stanza it was said  should be done  but then the clause  to have attained the State of Peace is this 
must be understood as one whose meaning requires completing which is why  by one who desires    to abide in  was said above 
Or alternatively the intention can be understood as follows When through hearsay etc to this effect namely  To have attained the State of Peace  he knows with mundane understanding the extinctionState to be one of peace  and when he wants to arrive at it then the what that it is proper as the practice should be done by him is this which should be done by one with skill in good 
Or alternatively it had been said that there is something that  should be done by one with skill in good  and the bhikkhus were wondering  What  and then the Blessed One told them  The State of Peace to have attained is this  
the intention of which can be understood also as follows After contriving to have attained with mundane understanding the State of Peace  what should be done is this   what must be done is what should be done  only that is worth doing  is what is meant
But what is that
What else should be done but the doing that is the means to that State And of course this means is already expressed by the initial clause with its indication of the Three Trainings in the sense of their being worth doing
for we already said as much in the comment on the meaning namely There is what should be done and there is what should not be done
Herein briefly what should be done is the Three Trainings 
Now while some of the bhikkhus understood it some did not since the teaching was extremely brief
Consequently in order to make those who had not yet understood understand he uttered the second halfstanza namely He would be able right upright And meek and gentle and not proud giving in detail what must especially be done by a forestdwelling bhikkhu
What is meant
A forestdwelling bhikkhu who desires to abide in the State of Peace after having contrived to attain it or whoafter contriving to attain it with only mundane understanding is practising the way finally to arrive at it would be able with the possession of the second and fourth factors of endeavour to practise for the penetration of the Truths without regard for body and life Likewise he would be able that is clever unidle capable in the preliminary work for a Universal  in undertaking the duties etc and in repairing his own bowl robes etc and in these and other such major and minor things to be done for companions in the Divine Life
Being able he would also be right with possession of the third factor of endeavour
Being right instead of being content with being right once he would be more thoroughly right  that is upright  by repeatedly promoting nonlaxity aslong as he lives
Or alternatively he is right by means of nonfraudulence and upright by means of nondeceitfulness
Or he is right with abandonment of crookedness of body and speech and upright with abandonment of crookedness of mind
Or he is right by nonpublication of any special qualities of jhana and path that are nonexistent in himself and upright by nonendurance of gain arisen on account of such nonexistent special qualities
Thus he would be right and upright with the purity of ends and means consisting in meditation upon objectsof pure concentration and upon the three General characteristics of impermanence etc which are ensured respectively by the first pair of Trainings namely the Higher Virtue and Higher Cognizance and by the third namely the Higher Understanding
And he would be not only right and upright but also meek as well
for a person who when told This ought not to be done  says  What has been seen by you What has been heard by you Who are you that you speak to me are you a Preceptor Teacher friend companion or obstructs with silence or accepts the admonition but does not act on it is far from arriving at any distinction
but one who when advised says Good venerable sir well said What is blameworthy is hard to see in oneself If you should see me again thus tell me out of compassion May I long have advice from you  and practises according as instructed is not far from arriving at distinction
That is why he would be meek by accepting others advice and acting on it
And he would be gentle just as he would be meek
But while firm in not practising malleableness with laymen when pressed by them to go with messages go on errands etc he would yet be as malleable in the performance of the duties in the whole Divine Life as wellrefined gold is for employment in this and that 
Good is the Way or alternatively anything at all that is beneficial to oneself  since it should be honoured  is  good  and  since it should be honoured  means since it should be approached
 that one is without skill in good
 is one with skill in good
 he is also one with skill in good
 he is also one with skill in good
 he is also one with skill in good
Or alternatively the word gentle means that he would be without grimaces  opencountenanced easy to talk with and as welcoming as a good ford with an easy approach
And he would be not only gentle but also not proud as well he would not be proud towards others on account of such grounds for pride as birth race etc but would abide like the Elder Sriputta evenminded to all alike whether outcaste or prince 
The Blessed One thus told in part what should be done especially by a forestdwelling bhikkhu who desires after contriving to have attained the State of Peace to abide in it or who is practising the way to arrive at that State Being then desirous of saying more than that he uttered the further stanza
Herein he is content with the twelvefold contentment of the kind already stated under And content and grateful bearing   thus he is contented 
Or alternatively he finds contentment  thus he is one content  he is one content with his own  he is one content with what there is  and he is one content equally with all  thus he is content 
Herein what is called his own is that indicated in the ceremony of Full Admission thus  Depending onthe lumps of alms food   and it is whatever among the four requisiteconditions for the bhikkhus life has been accepted by himself He is called  one content with his own  when without showing any alteration of expression either at the time of receiving or at the time of using he makes do with it whether it is good or bad whether it is carefully or carelessly given What is called  what there is is what is factual and has been obtained by himself
He is called one content with what there is  when he is content with that alone without aspiring to more than that and thus abandons excessiveness of wishes
What is called equallywith all is the abandoning of approval and resistance with respect to the desired and the undesired He is called  one content equallywith all  when he is content with that kind of equality regarding all objects
He is supported with ease  thus he is easy to support  he is easily sustained is what is meant
For a bhikkhu is hard to support if when given his bowl full of special rice meat and boiled rice he shows a face of gloomy sullenness or is suspicious saying in the givers presence  What is this you have given  and gives it away to novices or laymen
When people see that they keep far away thinking  A bhikkhu who is hard to support can never be sustained
But he is easy to support when with cheerfulness and confident face he makes do with what he gets no matter whether it is poor or superior little or much
When people see that they are quite trustful and they claim thus  Our venerable is easy to support he is content even with a little We ourselves will sustain him and they do sustain him
It is one such as that who is intended here as easy to support
His busiedness is little  thus he is unbusy  He is not occupied with the many kinds of busiedness such as love of working love of talking love of company and so on Or alternatively in the whole monastery he is devoid of any busieness concerned with buildingwork property of the Community instruction of novices and monasteryattendants etc and insteadhe is engaged only in the busiedness consisting in the monks True Ideal after doing his own haircutting nailcutting and preparing of his own bowl and robes
His way of life is light  thus he is frugal 
he is not like some bhikkhus with their many chattels who when it is time to go away do so after they have loaded many people with head packs waist packs etc of bowls robes rugs oils sugar etc but when it is time to go away having little requisiteequipment he carries only the monks eight requisites namely the bowl three robes razor needle waistband and waterstrainer and taking only these he goes away as does a bird with its own wings  It is one such as this that is intended here by  frugal
He has faculties that are serene  thushe is serene in faculties  his faculties are unagitated by lust for desirable objects or ill will towards undesirable objects is what is meant
Prudent  knowledgeable intelligent possessed of understanding the intention is that he is possessed of understanding about guarding virtue understanding about managing robes and the restand understanding as the actofunderstanding the seven kinds of suitability namely those regarding the abode almsresort speechperson food climate and posture 
He is not impudent  thus he is modest  the meaning is that he is devoid of bodily impudence in its eight instances verbal impudence in its four instances and mental impudence in its many instances 
What is called  bodily impudence in its eight instances is acting unbecomingly by means of the body in the presence of the Community in the presence of a Chapter in the presence of a person in the refectory in the hotbath house at the bathing place on the path for gathering alms and in the entry into houses
that is to say Here someone in the midst of the Community sits lolling with hands clasped round knees or with feet crossed  and so on Likewise in the midst of a chapter
Again in the refectory he does not give a seat to seniors he prevents new bhikkhusthose with less than five years seniority from getting a seat 
Likewise in the hotbathhouse  and he has fires lighted etc without asking seniors about it 
And at the bathing placewithout bothering about what is said namely  Without making the standard  junior and senior  bathing should be done in the order of arrival  he arrives after others and enters the water and jostles seniors and new bhikkhus without waiting his turn
And in the entry into houses he enters before the seniors and plays bodily games with children and so on
that is to say Here someone in the midst of the Community preaches the True Idea unasked   And likewise in the presence of a chapter and of a senior person as stated already And when asked a question by people there he answers them without asking a senior if he may do so And among houses he speaks thus  You soandso what is there Is there any ricegruel or anything to eat or chew What will you give me What shall we eat today Whatshall we drink 
What is called mental impudence in its many instances is unbecoming thinking namely thoughts of sensual desire of ill will and of cruelty etc in such and such instances doing so only with the mind and with no transgression by body or speech
Not fawning upon families  whatever families he approaches he does not fawn upon them either out of craving for the requisiteconditions or owing to association with laymen that is not in conformity with the True Idea what is meant is that he is not one who sorrows with them and relishes with them who is pleased when they are and suffers when they do and who is forward in engaging himself in any business or work that has arisen
And in this stanza the words  he would be   which were stated in the previous stanza thus  he would be    meek   must be construed also with all the terms in this way  he would be contented he would be easy to support    
and  in the midst of a chapter includes a meeting of the four assemblies of bhikkhus bhikkhunis laymen followers and laywomen followers Likewise in the presence of senior persons
And on the path for gathering alms he goes in front of seniors bumping their arms with his arms in order to get the best seat the best water the best alms food
What is called  verbal impudence in its four instances is unbecoming speech utterance in the presence of a Community a chapter and a person and among houses
When the Blessed One had thus announced what more would be done especially by a forestdwelling bhikkhu who desired after contriving to have attained the State of Peace to abide in it orwho was practising the way to arrive at that State he now uttered the following stanza being desirous of announcing also what should not be done
Its meaning is as follows There are some slight things in bodily verbal or mental misconduct that are called  bad and when he is thus doing what should be done he would do no slight thing in that and in not doing it it is not onlythe gross that he would not do but also anything at all  what is meant is that he would not do even as much as a little evenas much as an atom
And next he showed the danger to be seen here in this life for him in the doing of such things by saying that other wise men might deplore 
and here others who are unwise are not the standard
since they do either what is not deplorable or what is deplorable or what is little deplorable or greatly deplorable
but it is only the wise who are the standard
since they after inquiry and investigation speak in dispraise of what deserves dispraise and in praise of what deserves praise
Now the Blessed One stated with these two and a half stanzas the approach to the meditation subject thus And that approach is divided into what should be done and what should not be done especially by a forestdwelling bhikkhu who desires after contriving to have attained the State of Peace to abide in it or who is practising the way to arrive at that Stateand under the heading of forestdweller  are included all those who want to come to abide in that State through taking a meditation subject And so having done that he now began to give an exposition of lovingkindness which begins with the words Sukhino v khemino hontu The purpose of this was to serve those bhikkhus as a safeguard to dispel their fear of deities and as a meditation subject for inducing jhana as the basis for insight
Herein joyful is possessing pleasure
And safe  having safety what is meant is fearless unplagued
Every without remainder
Creatures  breathing things
Heart rejoice  with pleased cognizance
and here it can be understood that they are  joyful with bodily pleasure that their hearts rejoice  with mental pleasure and that they are safe  with both or else with the disappearance of all fears and plagues
But why is it stated like this
In order to show the different modes of maintenance of lovingkindness in being
for lovingkindness can be maintained in being thus Let all creatures be joyful or Let them be safe  or  Let their hearts rejoice  
which is why  other wise men  is said
When the Blessed One had thus shown in brief the maintenance of lovingkindness in being from access up to absorption as the limit he now uttered the following pair of stanzas Ye Jceci He did so in order to show that in detail as well
Or alternatively cognizance that is used to ordinary variety in its object does not become steadied on unity at first but it does become steadied gradually by following out a classification of the object and that is why he uttered this pair of stanzas beginning  Whatever the purpose of which is the steadying of it on its object classified under the dyads and triads beginning with  frail or firm  doing so by following these out
Or alternatively when an object is fully evident to someone his cognizance easily stays on it and so he uttered this pair of stanzas beginning with  Whatever which illustrate the classification of the object by means of the dyads and triads beginning with frail and firm since he was desirous of steadying those bhikkhus cognizance on an object made fully evident to them
And in fact he points out four dyads namely the frailfirm dyad the seenunseen dyad the farnear dyad and the thatarethatyetseektobe dyad and then with the six terms beginning with  long he also points out three triads namely the longmiddlesizedshort triad the bigmiddlesizedsmall triad and the thickmiddlesizedsmall triad since the meaning of the term  middlesized is implicit in all three triads and the meaning of the term  small in two of them
Herein whatever is a term without remainder
Breathing things are themselves beings  thus they are breathing beings 
or alternatively they breathe thus they are breathing things  by which term he includes creatures belonging to the fiveconstituent kind of being  which are bound up with inbreath and outbreath
and then they are  thus they are beings  by which he includes oneconstituent and fourconstituent creatures
There are atthisanti  they are factual
Having thus pointed out comprehensively with the words whatever breathing beings there are all the creatures about to beincluded under the dyads and triads mentioned above he now pointed them all out again by including them in the first dyad namely no matter whether frail or firm with none excepted 
Herein they thirst  thus they are frail  this is a designation for those with craving and for those with fear
They stand  thus they are firm  this is a designation for Arahants who have abandoned craving and fear
There is no one of them that is an exception thus they are with none excepted  all is what is meant
And what is said at the end of the second pair of stanzas should all be construed with the dyads and triads thus  Whatever breathing beings there are no matter whether frail or firm let every creatures heart rejoice
and likewise down as far as the dyad that are or that yet seek to be let every creatures heart rejoice
Now as to the six terms beginning with  long that represent the three triads beginning with longmiddlesizedshort the long are those with a long selfhood such as Ngas  fishes lizards etc
for in the great ocean there are Ngas with a selfhood measuring many hundred fathoms and there are fishes lizards etc with a selfhood measuring many leagues
Big  with a big selfhood such as turtles etc in the water such as elephants Ngas etc on land and such as Dnava Demons etc among nonhuman beings
And it is said Rhuis the foremost of those who possess a selfhood  
for the selfhood of that Eclipse Demon is four thousand eight hundred leagues in height his arms measure twelve hundred leagues the space between his eyebrows is fifty leagues and so are the spaces between his fingers and toes and the palms of his hands are two hundred leagues
The middlesized are the selfhoods of horses oxen buffaloes pigs and so on
The short are creatures that in this or that kind of birth fall short of the normal measurement according to the big and middlesized such as dwarfs and so on
Small  these are creatures that are not the resort of the fleshly eye but are the objective field of the heavenly eye and they are generated in water etc with a subtle selfhood or they are lice and so on
Besides any creatures in any kind of birth that are of lesser measure than the big or middlesized or than the thick or middlesized can be understood as small
The thick are creatures with a rounded selfhood such as fishes tortoises oysters clams and so on
Having thus pointed out creatures without exception with these three triads he now pointed them out again by including them in the three remaining dyads beginning with or those seen or unseen
Herein those seen are any that have already been seen by their coming to the eyes horizon
The unseen are thosethat remain beyond the sea beyond a mountain beyond this worldsystem and so on
With the dyad or whether dwelling far or near he points out creatures dwelling far or not far from onesown selfhood These can be understood as the footless and as bipeds
for creatures dwelling inside ones own body are near while those dwelling outside it are far 
Likewise those dwelling in the houseprecincts are near while those dwelling outside the precincts are far
Again those dwelling in ones own abode village country continent worldsystem are near while those dwelling beyond the abode    the worldsystem are respectively far
That are  that have been born generated
they are reckoned thus They are  they will not be again which is a designation for those with taints exhausted namely Arahants
That yet seek to besambhavesinosambhavamesanti 
this is a designation for Initiates and ordinary men who still seek being in the future because they have not abandoned the fetter of being 
Or alternatively in the case of the four kinds of womb generation  creatures that are eggborn or uterusborn are called those that yet seek to be as long as they have not broken the eggmembrane or the caulmembrane respectively but when they have broken the eggmembrane or the caulmembrane and have come out they are called those that are
However moistureborn creatures and those of spontaneous appearance are called those that yet seek to be in the first moment of their cognizance and they are called those that are from the moment of the second cognizance
or else they are those that yet seek to be as long as they do not reach any posture other than that in which they were born while after that they are called those that are
When the Blessed One with these two and a half stanzas beginning with Joyful had thus shown to those bhikkhus in various aspects the maintenance of lovingkindness in being towards creatures by way of an aspiration for their coming to welfare and pleasure he now said Na faro pararh nikubbetha He did so showing that too by way of an aspiration for their noncoming to harm and suffering
That is the Ancients reading but now they also read param hi instead of param ni which is not creditable
Herein one is an individual 
and another one is another individual 
Let not    undo  let him not betray
Nor slight  nor let him by surmounting show conceit 
Anywhere  anywhere in the open in a village in a field in the midst of relatives or in the midst of a guild and so on
Him  that one

What is meant
Lovingkindness should be maintained in being not only by attention given thus  Joyful and safe etc but it should also be maintained in being as follows Oh that no person at all might undo any other person at all with such undoing as betrayal etc or might slight any other person at all in any place on the grounds for conceit consisting in birth property etc  and that each might not wish another ill with provocation or resistive thought
When he had thus pointed out the maintenance of lovingkindness in being by way as to meaning of aspiration for this noncoming to harm and suffering he now said Mt yath illustrating that same statement with a simile
Its meaning is this As a mother might guard her son  the child of her breast born in herself and that being also her only child  might guard it with her life by laying down her own life in order to ward off the coming of suffering thus would he maintain  would he generate again and again would he augment his lovingkindnessthought to every living being and he would maintain it in being unboundedly by means of the object of cognizance consisting of boundless creatures or by means of remainderless extension in a single being
Herein he fattens and tends  thus he is a friend  the meaning is that by his inclination to welfare he acts as a lubricant and protects from harms coming
The state of a friend is love 
For all  unreservedly for The world  the world of creatures
Thought a state of being that is in the mind 
for that is said because it is associated with cognizance
He would maintain  would increase
It has no measure  thus it is done unboundedly  it is stated thus as an object consisting of measureless numbers of creatures
Above  upwards he refers to formless being by this
Below  downwards he refers to sensualdesire being by this
All around  in the middle he refers to formed being by this
Unchecked  devoid of checks with barriers broken down is what is meant 
It is an enemy that is called a  barrier the meaning is that it should be directed even to him
No malice with  devoid of malice what is meant is devoid of the manifestation even now and then of any choice governed by malice
Or foe  without enemies
for a person who abides in lovingkindness is dear to human beings and dear to nonhuman beings and he has no enemies at all hence that thought is called  with no foe  because of its enemylessness
And these terms namely  enemy  and foe are metaphorical expressions
This is the wordbyword commentary
Now here is a commentary on the meaning intended He would maintain  would augment would bring to growth increase and fullness unboundedly for all the world his thought of love  which has already been mentioned in this way  Thus   would he maintain unboundedly his thought for every living being  
How
Above and below and all around by extending without remainder above up to the Acme of Existence  that is the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception below down to Avici the lowest hell and all around in all the remaining directions
Or else by pervading without remainder the formless states above the sensualdesireelement below and the formelement all around 
And while maintaining this thought in this way he would maintain it in being by ensuring the absence of any check malice or foe so that it may be unchecked no malice with or foe 
Or else when it has reached excellence in maintenanceinbeing and is unchecked since it finds opportunities everywhere has no malice since his own annoyance with others has been removed and has no foe since others annoyance with himself has been removed
he would maintain augment for all the world in the three divisions of above below and all around his thought of love unboundedly
Having thus shown the maintenance of lovingkindness in being he now said Tittham caram nisinno v He did so showing the posturerule for one who abides devoted to maintaining that in being
Its meaning is this When he is thus maintaining that thought of love  in being instead of adopting any such posturerule as that given in such passages as  he sits down having folded his legs crosswise set his body erect  he instead makes the posturerule here the dispelling as one pleases of any discomfort in any particular posture that constantly supervenes with overlong retention of it so that whether he is standing or walking or seated too or lying down the while he is undrowsing  then he would pursue this lovingkindnessjhana mindfulness 
Or alternatively having thus shown augmentation of maintenance of lovingkindness in being in the previous stanza he now said Standing walking in order to show mastery
for one who has reached mastery is desirous of pursuing such lovingkindnessjhana mindfulness by posture the while he is either standing or walking Or alternatively the standing etc are no obstacle to him but rather whether he is standing or whether he is walking for the while that he is desirous of pursuing such lovingkindnessjhana mindfulness thus for so long does he being undrowsing  pursue it  he has no sluggishness
hence he said  Standing or walking seated too Or lying down the while undrowsing
He would pursue this mindfulness
The intention is as follows He would so maintain in being what was stated thus  His thought of love for all the world He would maintain  that were he desirous of pursuing this lovingkindnessjhana mindfulness  by posture he would pursue this mindfulness the while he was engaged in standing etc or else for the while that without bothering whether he was standing etc he might be desirous of pursuing this lovingkindnessjhana mindfulness  for so long he would pursue this mindfulness
Having given an exhortation to that abiding in lovingkindness thus  He would such mindfulness pursue  pointing out in so doing mastery in the maintenance of lovingkindness in being he now said Brahmam etam vihram idhamhu extolling that abiding
The meaning is this There is this abiding in lovingkindness that is set forth in the way beginning with the words  Joyful and safe  and down as far as the words He would pursue this mindfulness
Now it is this  since among the heavenly abidings divine abidings noble abidings and abidings in the postures it is immaculate and is beneficial both to oneself and to others  that is they say here in the Noble Ones True Idea and Discipline a Divine Abiding  It is a foremost abiding they say and consequently he would such mindfulness pursue constantly continuously and uninterruptedly whether standing or walking seated too or lying down the while undrowsing
When the Blessed One had finished his teaching thus he told the bhikkhus Go bhikkhus and live in that same forest grove On the eighth days in each month that are for the hearing of the True Idea have the gong struck and recite this discourse and then have a sermon on the True Idea and be careful to give a blessing  Cultivate this same meditation subject maintain it in being and develop it Then instead of showing you dreadful objects those nonhuman beings will most surely wish you well and seek your good
They agreed and after they had got up from their seats and had paid homage to the Blessed One keeping him on their right they departed to go back to where they had come from and they did as they had been told
Now thinking  The venerable ones wish us well and seek our good  the deities were full of happiness and joy and they themselves swept out the resting places prepared warm water performed backtreatment and foottreatment for them and arranged for their protection
There the bhikkhus maintained lovingkindness in being and making that the basis they established insight into the three general characteristics of Impermanence suffering and notself till all of them reached Arahantship the highest fruit in that same Rains and they were able to hold the Pavran Ceremony in purity
Its meaning is this After emerging from the abiding in lovingkindness jhana which was specified thus  This is Divine Abiding here they say  he discerns the nonmaterialform ideas there in that jhana consisting in thinking and exploring and the rest which he defines as  name  Then following on the defining etc of these jhana factors as  name  he discerns the ideas of material form there which he defines as  form  By means of this delimitation of nameandform he traffics not with views  avoiding that by discerning in the way stated thus A heap of mere determinations No creature can be found herein   till he eventually becomes virtuous with the kind of virtue that is supramundane since he is now perfected in the right view belonging to the Path of Stream Entry which is called seeing  and which is associated with that supramundane virtue After that whatever greed there is in him still remaining unabandoned in the guise of sensual desire as subjective defilement for sensual desires as objects  of that he becomes purged  vineyya vinayitva  that is he becomes cured  by attenuation of certain defilements and by abandoning of certain others without remainder by means of his attaining the Paths of the Once Returner and the Non Returner he will surely come no more to any womb  absolutely never again coming to any womb
he is reborn only in the Pure Abodes where he reaches Arahantship and attains extinction
in the Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning the Commentary on the Minor Books
The explanation of the Lovingkindness Discourse is ended
Herein there follows first a wordcommentarv on the first stanza What should be done by one with skill in good Should be done karaniyamktabbam it is worth doing 
That is how the classification of the source which illustrates why should be understood in detail
And at this point namely which illustrates as well By whom twas spoken when where why
I shall set out to clarify Its Source what was laid down in the Schedule has been given in detail in all aspects
That was the origin of the Goodomen Question
Now here is the comment on the words and on the meaning in the verses
When the Blessed One heard the words of the gods son he uttered the stanza  Not consorting with the foolish    
Now since the omen as we go
But since it was said  Whereafter when the time falls due We comment on the meaning too the comment on the meaning must begin
Now while there are some others who say that  only the first five stanzas were spoken by the Blessed One the rest being spoken by the venerable Ananda at the time of his performing the Protection Ceremony that may be so in fact or it may not
But does that investigation concern us The commentary that we shall make on this Jewel Sutta will actually fit both cases
By developing the four divine abodes on the dissolution of the body after death he passed on to the Brahmaworld
Now the Treasurestore Discourse which begins thus A man lays by a treasure store is placed here next after the WithouttheWalls Discourse
So first I shall the reason state Wherefore they placed this discourse here
Herein the reason for its being placed here should be understood as follows
Although it is not in the order in which it t that this Treasurestore Discourse was delivered by the Blessed One that is to say next after the Withoutthewalls Discourse it is nevertheless placed here because it is supplementary to the Withoutthewalls Discourse which was uttered as the giving of a blessing
Or else it can be understood that it was placed here for the purpose of showing by its means of the the Withoutthewalls Discourse the failure of those devoid of merit
This is the reason for placing it here
And make the NeedArisen clear Before the Comment I relate
The NeedArisen for its utterance was this  At Savatthi it seems there was a certain landowner rich in much money and property
He lived the household life in faith and confidence uncognizant of the stain of avarice
One day he gave an almsgiving to the Community of Bhikkhus headed by the Enlightened One
It so happened that on that occasion the king was in need of money so he sent a man telling him Go and fetch the landowner named soandso
The man went to the landowner and told him Householder the king summons you
The landowner was actually serving the Community of Bhikkhus headed by the Englightened one his mind being graced by the special qualities of faith and so on He replied Go now good man I shall come later Just now I am engaged in laying up a treasure store
Then when the Blessed One had eaten and had shown that he had had enough he uttered these stanzas namely  A man lays by a treasure store  as a blessing in order to show to the landowner how that same excellence in merit is in the ultimate sense a treasure store
This was the need arisen
first the reason stated Wherefore they placed this discourse here
And made the NeedArisen clear the comment I shall now relate 
So having
As regards the first stanza namely A man a treasure store lays by  herein it is stored away  thus it is a treasure store  the meaning is that it is put by protected guarded
That is of four kinds namely a fixture the ambulant a pseudolimb and a follower
Herein the  fixture  is any bullion or gold stored away underground or in attics or any field or land or anything else of the sort that is devoid of any alteration of posture this is a treasure store as a fixture
The  ambulant  consists of bonds  women and bondsmen elephants cattle horses and mares goats and sheep fowls and pigs or anything else of the sort that is associated with alteration of the postures this is a treasure store as the ambulant
The  pseudolimb  is any sphere of work sphere of craft branch of science ample learning  or anything else of the sort acquired by training and bound up with ones own selfhood as if it were a limb this is a treasure store as a pseudolimb
The  follower  is merit consisting in giving consisting in virtue consisting in maintenance of concentration and insight in being consisting in hearing the True Idea and consisting in teaching the True Idea or any other merit of the sort that gives desirable fruit here and there as if it had followed one this is a treasure store as a follower
But in this instance it is the treasure store as a fixture that is intended
Lays by  puts away sets apart guards
A man  a human male
Of course a man and a woman and a eunuch can lay by a treasure store but here though the teaching is given under the heading of a man nevertheless as to meaning the others should be regarded as taken in combination as well here
Deep in a waterlevel pit  what is  deep  is in the sense of its having to be plunged down to it is a  water level pit  owing to its proximity to water 
There is such as is deep but not waterlevel like a hundredfathom hole in a jungle tract and there is such as is waterlevel but not deep like a onespan or twospan hole scooped out in a lowlying marsh and there is such as is both deep and waterlevellike a hole deepened in a jungle tract until it is estimated that water is about to come
It is with reference to the last that  deep in a waterlevel pit  is said
If need arise for aid  it is inseparable from aid  thus it is for aid  what is meant is that it brings aid brings welfare
Need  kiccamkatabbam  what is meant is anything at all that ought to be done 
Arisen is the same as risen  what is meant is that it has appeared as a state of something that has to be done 
It will be there to aid me then  this demonstrates the purpose of the treasure store
If that need for aid arises
for he lays it by for that benefit thus  If need for my doing anything at all that will bring me aid has arisen this treasure store will be able to supply that need of mine
for it should be understood that the benefit for him is simply the supplying of the need when the need has arisen
Having thus in showing the purpose of the treasure store shown the intention of acquisition of benefit he now said in order to show the intention of defence against harm
Its meaning should be understood by construing the two phrases  it will be there  and  for discharge  as appropriate which are stated thus  It will be there to aid me then  and For my discharge  of debts Here is the construction
Not only does a man lay by a treasure store thinking  It will be there to aid me then  but he also lays by a treasure store thinking  It will be there for my discharge from kings were I denounced by enemies and adversaries in some such way as  He is a brigand  or  He is an adulteror  or  He is a taxevader   or it will be there for my discharge from a brigand if I am held to ransom by brigands either by their stealing money through housebreaking or by their threatening my life thus  Give so much money and gold 
And then there will be those to whom I owe debts and they will press me to pay off the debts and it will be there for the discharge of my debt when I am pressed by those creditors
And there are occasions when there is a famine when harvests fail and food is hard to get and it is not easy for one who is not rich to survive and so it will be there for me in such a famine 
Having thus shown with these two stanzas of two lines each that the purpose of laying by a treasure store is twofold as the intention to acquire benefit and the intention to defend against harm he now said in order to round off the statement of that same twofold purpose
Its meaning is this shown as acquisition of benefit and defence against harm respectively with the words  It will be there to aid me then  and  From kings were I denounced
with the purpose of supplying those needs With suchlike aims  what is called a store  namely money and bullion etc in the world of location  will be laid by  put away set apart
For my discharge from kings were I  Denounced or from a brigand else
 If held to ransom or of debts  In famine or in accidents 
and there are accidents due to fire or water or an unwelcome heir and it will be there for me in such accidents when they arise 
 With suchlike aims what in the world  Is called a store will be laid by 
Now since that treasure store thus laid by provides only for those who possess merit and not for anyone else the acquisition of benefits and defence against harm intended he pointed out this meaning by saying
 the meaning of which is as follows  Though that treasure store be it neer so well laid by be it never so thoroughly dug in and put away is what is meant
deep in a waterlevel pit  till it is reckoned to be deep in a waterlevel pit what is meant is be it never so thoroughly done as that
And the word tam should be regarded as a mere particle for filling out the line as in such passages as  Yatha tam appamattassa atapino  
or else tam is said with change of gender from masculine to neuter where so referring back to sabbo should have been said
how thoroughly
 Though be it neer so well laid by  Deep in a waterlevel pit
 Not all of it will yet suffice  To serve him all the time
and when taken thus its meaning is easily discovered
still not all of it will yet suffice To serve him all the time  even all of it will not serve for all of the time that man by whom it was laid by it will not suffice for be capable of answering his aforementioned need is what is meant
but rather only some serves only sometimes or else it does not serve at all
Having thus said  Not all of it will yet suffice To serve him all the time  showing reasons why it will not serve him he now said
Its meaning is this The store gets shifted  may disappear may go away from its place in which it was sell laid by even though it has no choice of its own still with the exhaustion of its owners merit it goes to another place
Or he perhaps forgets the marks  he no longer knows what place he laid the treasure store by in Or then prompted by the exhustion of his merit Naga serpents hale it  that treasure store off remove it to another place
or else spirits fritter it away  take what they like and go off with it
So that treasure store fails to serve him for these reasons beginning with its getting shifted from its place
Having thus told reasons for its failure to serve namely those beginning with its getting shifted from its place which are those recognized in the world he now said showing the one and only reason which is the root of all those aforesaid reasons namely exhaustion of merit
 And when his merit is consumed  The whole will vanish utterly
Its meaning is this And when  on the occasion on which there is the consumption of the kind of merit that produces gain in property then the kind of merit that leads to loss of property finds it opportunity and takes over and then the whole of the treasure store consisting of such riches as money bullion etc that was laid by by the layerby will vanish utterly 
 The store gets shifted from its place  Or he perhaps forgets the marks
 Or Naga Serpents hale it off  Or spirits fritter it away 
Or else the heirs he cannot bear  Abstract it while he does not see 
or else the heirs that he cannot bear dig the treasure store out of the ground and abstract it while he does not see 
and said to him Come great king
Having thus stated the kind of treasure store recognized in the world which although laid by with such and such intention yet fails to serve as intended and is in various ways inseparable from the idea of vanishing away the Blessed One now said showing that excellence of merit as a treasure store in the ultimate sense in order to show which he began this TreasureStore Discourse when giving the landowner his blessing
Herein with gifts should be taken in the way already stated under  Giving TrueIdeal conduct  
virtuousness is bodily and verbal nontransgression
Refraining is the actofrefraining  what is meant is the hindering of cognizances ranging about among a variety of objects This is a designation for concentration
One possessing this kind of refraining is called  one who has supreme refraining  in the passage  Who can refrain by hand and foot And speech who has supreme refraining  
Some others have said that refraining is the actofrefraining and that what is meant is restraint it being then a designation for facultyrestraint 
Constraint is the act ofconstraining  what is meant is the quieting of defilement
This is a designation for understanding since understanding is in some instances called  understanding   as in such passages as sussūsā labhate pañña 
and in some instances it is the  True Idea as in such passages as 
and in some instances it is constraint as in such passages as 
After defining  gifts and the rest in this way the meaning of this stanza can be understood in brief as follows When a woman or a man shall have  with the four things namely with gifts  with virtue  with refraining and with constraint  a treasure store consisting of merit that by being done thoroughly is well laid by either in the single continuity of cognizance of these things beginning with gifts  or in the instances beginning with  shrines  in the next stanza just as a treasure store consisting of such riches as bullion gold pearls or gems is stored away by putting together in one place those things such as the gold and the rest
Shall have with gifts or virtuousness  Or with refraining or constraint 
 But when a woman or a man   A store of merit well laid by 
or else what is intended here by  virtuousness  is all fivefactored and eightfactored virtue  in the case of laymen and virtue as PatimokkhaRule restraint in the case of bhikkhus
Having thus shown treasurestoreness in the ultimate sense by means of excellence of merit with the stanza beginning  But when a woman or a man the Blessed One now said showing the ground wherein that treasure store is well laid by
Herein it should be built up  thus it is a shrine  what is meant is that it should be honoured Or it is a shrine because it has been built up 
That is of three kinds as a shrine by use a shrine by dedication and a relic shrine
Herein the Tree of Enlightenment is a shrine by use an image of the Enlightened One is a shrine by dedication and a monument with a relicchamber containing a relic is a relic shrine
The Community is any one among those kinds defined as the Community headed by the Enlightened One and the rest
A person is anyone whether layman or gone forth from the house life
He has no room on any day on which he arrives thus he is a guest 
The rest is as already stated
After defining  shrines  and the rest in this way the meaning of this stanza can be understood in brief as follows That treasure store which was called  well laid by  is well laid by on these grounds
Why
Because it is capable of giving longlasting desirable fruit
and so those who give even a little at a shrine will for long gain desirable fruit
according as it is said
 I gave only a single flower  But then for eighty myriad aeons
 I knew no woeful destination  
 Now if a man should see full pleasure  In giving up relative pleasure  
And so too should be understood the classification of the fruit of giving on the other grounds beginning with the Community in the way in which it is stated in the Dakkhinavisuddhi Sutta  the Velama Sutta  and so on 
And just as the occurrence of Giving at shrines etc and the richness of its fruit have been shown so in each case as applicable there can be understood the occurrence of Virtue as Keeping and Avoiding  contingent upon whatever it may be and the richness of its fruit the occurrence of Refraining as Recollection of the Enlightened One and the richness of its fruit and the occurrence of Restraint as Insight Attention and Reviewing with that as the basis and the richness of its fruit
 In shrines or the Community  Or in a person or in guests
 Or in a mother in a father  Even in an elder brother
this is a designation for one who should be given hospitality the moment he arrives
Having thus shown the ground divided into shrines etc for a treasure store consisting of merit to be laid by in when it is being laid by with giving etc the Blessed One now said He did so showing what distinguishes that treasure store well laid by on these grounds from the treasure store laid by deep in a water level pit
Herein with the words this treasure store is well laid by he demonstrates the kind of treasure store that is well laid by with gifts etc stated in the preceding lines
Unlosable  it cannot be won from one and taken by others thus it is unlosable Ajjeyyo is also a reading the meaning of that is it ought to be got  is worth getting  ought to be got together   by one who seeks welfare and happiness
With this reading the construction should be made as follows  This treasure store ought to be got  and then after pointing out the connexion by asking Why  the construction should be completed thus  Because it is well laid by and is a follower 
Otherwise what was stated would be that it was what had been already well laid by that ought to be got but what has been well laid by is not still to be got 
It follows  thus it is a follower  the meaning is that when a man goes to the other world it does not abandon him in the provision of its fruit wherever that may be
Among what by abandoning Must be gone to he goes with this   when the time of death has appeared then with this treasure store among all the properties that must begone to  having abandoned them he goes to the other world that it would seem is the meaning
Why
Because properties are not what must be gone to 
Consequently if that were the meaning it would be tantamount to saying  By abandoning properties that are the distinctions of happy destination that must be gone to 
Therefore the meaning here should be understood as follows From among properties that by abandoning a mortal in the way stated as  The store gets shifted from its place   etc are going  he goes with this 
for this does not abandon him owing to its being a follower
Here it may be objected that the passive gerundive namely gamaniyesu has the meaning of the alternative passive gerundive namely gantabbesu and not the meaning of the active present participle gacchantesu 
That need not be taken rigidly
for in the passage  Ariya niyyanika  the meaning is are leading out  and not  must be outled   and here too the meaning is  among those that are going   not  among those that must be gone to  
Or alternatively at the time of death one who wants to give something to someone is not able even to handle properties and so first those properties must be abandoned by him bodily and afterwards they must be gone from by him with cognizance that is free from longing they must be surpassed is what is meant
Therefore the meaning in this case can be regarded as follows  Among properties which he first having abandoned them bodily afterwards must be gone from with cognizance 
In the case of the first meaning the use of the locative is in the sense of withdrawal  thus  Among properties that must be gone by abandoning him he having thus withdrawn therefrom the portion of merit as a treasure store takes this and goes
for this treasure stores substantiveessence of beingtakenandgonewithness is characterized by the properties substantiveessence of mustbegonefrom ness 
This treasure store is well laid by  A follower unlosable
 Among what by abandoning  Must be gone to he goes with this
since it has already been got before the laying by
but that will not do
since such and such properties have to be abandoned  rather such and such distinctions of destination on rebirth are  what must be gone to  
In the case of the second meaning the locative is in the sense of characterizing a substantive by another substantive 
Having thus shown what distinguishes this merittreasure from the treasure store laid by deep in a waterlevel pit the Blessed One further said  He did so urging gods and men to busy themselves with that merit treasure by detailing  the special qualities of the merittreasure shown by him as a trader in rare goods does when he urges buyers to busy themselves with his wares by detailing the special qualities of his own goods
Herein as to no others have a share in it asddharanamanhesam asddharano annesam  the letter m is for liaison purposes as it is in such passages as adukkhamasukhaya vedandya sampayutta  
And robbers cannot steal this treasure  acordharanona corehi dharano  it is not to be taken by robbers is what is meant
It must be stored  thus it is a treasurestore 
Having thus detailed  the special qualities of merit with two halflines he next urged them to activity in it with two more namely  So let the steadfast merit make  and  The store that is their follower
Here is the meaning of them A store that no others own a share of and that robbers cannot steal is what is called merit  
and not only is that store one which no others own a share of and robbers cannot steal but also it is  the store that is a follower  of which it was said in the preceding stanza  This treasure store is well laid by a never failing follower
 No others have a share in it  And robbers cannot steal this store 
So let the steadfast merit make  The store that is their follower 
and that follower too consists of merit therefore the steadfast one the person perfected in discovery  perfected in steadfastness let him make kayirathakareyya merit 
Having thus urged gods and men to activity in the meritstore by detailing its special qualities the Blessed One now said He did so showing in brief what fruit it gives to those who have become active and are pursuing the making of merit
 This is a store can satisfy  Every desire of gods and men
But this giving all that is desired happens only to one who has bound the merit up with an aspiration none happens without any aspiration
Why is that
Because he observes conduct in accordance with the True Idea fair conduct  
Why is that
Because he observes conduct in accordance with the True Idea fair conduct  
and similarly he said
 Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu possesses faith possesses virtue learning generosity understanding It occurs to him  Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the WarriorNobles of the great halls
He exerts that cognizance decides that cognizance maintains that cognizance in being
those determinations and those abidings of his thus maintained in being and developed lead to his reappearance there   and so on
according as it is said
 If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the True Idea fair conduct should wish  Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the WarriorNobles of the great halls  it is possible that on the dissolution of the body after death he might reappear in the company of the Warrior Nobles of the great halls
and likewise   Oh that by realization myself with directknowledge I might here and now enter upon and abide in the heartdeliverance and understandingdeliverance that are taintless with exhaustion of taints  it is possible
That is why he now said He did so showing the aspiration that causes that merits giving what is desired which aspiration is a procedure of wishing in suchandsuch wise with its requisite equipment of exertion of that cognizance deciding it and maintaining it in being
No matter what they aspire to have  All that they get by merits grace
He now uttered the following five stanzas beginning with Beauty of looks beauty of voice He did so showing by specific limitation in each case how that all is obtainable by means of that merit
Herein in the first stanza of these five to begin with beauty of looks  is goodcoloured complexion golden sheen of the skin for that is got by means of this merit store
 Bhikkhus since a Perfect One in a former birth formerly existing as a human being was unangry and little given to despair and since when much was said he never answered back was never irritated never felt ill will never resented and never manifested annoyance irritation hate and surliness and since he was a giver of fine soft rugs and cloaks made of fine linen fine cottonfine wool
with that action performed stored up  on his being come again to the same human state he acquires these two characteristics of a Great Man
Beauty of voice is a divine kind of voice utterance like that of a karavika bird That too is obtainable by this means
according as it is said
 Bhikkhus since a Perfect One in a former birthabandoning harsh speech became one who abstained from harsh speech became a speaker of such words as are innocent pleasing to the ear and lovable as go to the heart are civil desired of many and dear to many
with that action performed stored up  on his being come again to this same human state he acquires these two characteristics of a Great Man
He has a large tongue and he has a divine voice like the call of a karavika bird 
Beauty of figure is well shapedness in the places proper for being evenly filled out and rounded  what is meant is construction  with evenly filled out roundedness of limbs
And that too is obtained by this means
 Bhikkhus since a Perfect One in a former birthformerly existing as a human being sought the good the welfare the comfort the safety from bondage of the many thinking  How shall these have increase in faith in virtue in learning in generosity in understanding in riches and corn in fields and lands in bipeds and quadrupeds in wives and children in bondsmen servants and men in relatives in friends in kinsmen With that action performed stored up on his being come again to this same human state he acquires these three characteristics of a Great Man He has the upper torso of a lion the furrow between his shoulders is filled in and his neck  is evenly rounded  and so on
And Sutta passages can be cited from here and there that establish obtainment of the fulfilment of aspirations by means of this meritstore in cases of others as well as of the Perfect One in this way
but this is in brief for fear of too much detail  We shall now comment on the remaining words
Beauty of  here the whole physical frame can be understood as the  form  as it is in such passages as  When a space is equipped with bones and sinews and flesh and skin there comes to be the term a form  its elegance beauty of form not overtallness notovershortness notoverleanness notoverstout ness notoverdarkness notoverfairness is what is meant
Lordliness is the lordly state ownership in virtue of the state of a WarriorNoble of the great halls etc is what is meant
Retinue is excellence of ones own dependents and retainers in and in the case of those gone forth from the house life it is excellence in the fourfold assembly ādhipaccañca parivāro  ādhipaccaparivāro 
And here it can also be understood that excellence in physical frame is expressed by  beauty of looks etc excellence of property by  lordliness and excellence of dependents and retainers by  retinue 
All that is got by merits grace  what he points out is that when it was stated above thus  No matter what they aspire to have all that is got by merits grace   herein this firstly is a set of six things stated with specific limitation as  beauty of looks etc all of which can be understood to be got by means of that merit
according as it is said
He is the colour of gold and his skin has a golden sheen  
according as it is said
Having thus shown with this stanza the excellence of godly and human kingship that is to be got by merits might he now uttered the stanza And every human excellence  showing the excellence of extinction preceded by the excellence in combined form that was stated variously in the preceding stanzas
Here is a commentary on the words in it Human  it is the offspring of human beings  thus it is human  and manusi is the same as manusika
Excellence is the act of excelling  
Any is an inclusion without remainder in this instance They delight by means of that when it is arisen in themselves or when it is become an aid externally thus it is delight  this is a designation either for pleasure or for what is an external basis for pleasure
Even is an indefinite term in this instance The word and has the meaning of a conjunction conjoining this with the foregoing excellence
Extinction itself is extinctions excellence 
Now here is a commentary on the meaning All the human excellence and the delight in godly worlds mentioned by the phrases beginning with  beauty of looks  and also this extinctions excellence that can be reached by means of the states beginning with that beyond that of One Mature in Faith  that as well are the third set of things stated by specific limitation and all that is got by merits grace
Or alternatively there is what is not mentioned under  beauty of looks  etc namely the human excellence classed as particular distinction in understanding etc which is demonstrated in the way beennning  They are well endowed with mindfulness  there is the living of the Divine Life here  and also the further delight in jhana etc in the godly world and then extinctions excellence of the kind already stated as well and this is the third  all stated by specific limitation that is  got by merits grace 
That is how the commentary on the meaning should be understood here
A godly world devaloko devanam loko 
in that godly world
Having thus shown with this stanza how the excellence of extinction which can be reached by means of the state of One Mature in Faith ie a Stream Enterer etc  is to be got by merits might he now uttered the following stanza A man has excellence in friends He did so showing what is to be acquired through the state of One BothWaysLiberated  as the three True Knowledges and the means thereto
Here is a commentary on the words in it By its means one excells  or one arrives at evidences of special qualities thus it is excellence   the friend himself is the excellence thus there is excellence in friends  that excellence in friends
A man has  depending on
Reason right together with what is the means
Denoting  he does the maintaining  of devotion
One cognizes by its means thus it is trueknowledge   One is delivered by its means or it itself is delivered  thus it is deliverance  he ivins true knowledge and deliverance  vijjavimuttivasibhavo  vijjavimuttisu vasibhavo 
Now here is a commentary on the meaning There is this mastery  through nonsluggishness in such andsuchwise  and this masterywon after he has found excellence in friends by depending on the Master or on some venerable companion in the Divine Life and by taking his advice and instruction has devoted reason right by practising the way as instructed this mastery which is both mastery in the three True Knowledges consisting in Recollection of Past Life the Heavenly Eye that sees the passing and reappearance of creatures according to their actions and the Knowledge of Exhaustion of Taints  Herein what is deliverance
It is the resoluteness of cognizance and it is extinction   and mastery in deliverance classed as the eight attainments  and extinction stated thus is the fourth  all  stated by specific limitation as  got by merits grace
Having thus shown with this stanza the excellence of extinction that is to be got by the might of merit that sides with  mastery in the true knowledge and deliverance just mentioned which is also to be reached by one BothWaysLiberated who possesses the Triple True Knowledge he now uttered the following stanza  Discriminations liberations It was because those BothWaysLiberated who have reached mastery in true knowledge and deliverance and possess the triple true knowledge all get that evidencing of special qualities that consists in the discriminations etc by means of that excellence of merit and because that excellence of merit is also treatable in suchand suchwise as the footing for that evidencing that he therefore uttered this stanza with which this statement of  all  by limitation is completed
And this understanding with its four divisions dealing with ideas meanings language and perspicuity   which are called discriminations  and these eight liberations  which are set out in the way beginning  Possessed of form he sees forms   and the perfection of disciples  which establishes the disciples excellence reachable by the Blessed Ones disciples and both kinds  namely the Hermit Enlightenment  which establishes selfbecomeness  and the plane of enlightenment  which establishes supremacy over all creatures are the fifth  all  stated by specific limitation that is  got by merits grace
Having thus shown with three stanzas what it is that was stated in general in the lines  No matter what they aspire to have All that is got by merits grace   he now concluded the teaching with the following stanza So great are the rewards it gives And he did so commending all this exercise signalized as the treasure store that can satisfy every desire  
Here is a wordcommentary on it So refers back to the previous meaning
It has a great reward  thus it gives great rewards  what is meant is that it conduces to great good  mahiddhika is also a reading
It is an indicative what it indicates is the excellence of the merit stated in the stanzas from  But when a woman or a man Shall have with gifts or virtuousness  down to  So let the steadfast merit make  
Namely is only a particle in the sense of confronting it confronts in this way  which is this  in order to demonstrate what was indicated by it 
Merits excellence punnasampada punnanam sampada 
For that is a term for a reason
Steadfast  those endowed with steadfastness 
Commend  praise
Wise  those perfect in understanding
A store of merit made  the state of having made merit
Now here is a comment on the meaning Having thus commended the reward to be arrived ar by the might of merits excellence which begins with beauty of looks and ends with Both kinds of enlightenment the Blessed One now pointed out that same meaning summarily lauding in the same sense the greatness of the rewards of merits excellence of the kinds stated And in so doing what he meant was  It  namely  the merits excellence pointed out by me in the way beginning But when a woman or a man Shall have with gifts or virtuousness  by its bringing such great rewards gives so great rewards  and for that those like me who are the steadfast creatures preaching of the True Idea indefatigability and special quality of being true to what is commend a store of merit made in its several constituent aspects doing so not owing to partiality and with such phrases as No others have a share in it And robbers cannot steal this store  and  Bhikkhus do not fear the kinds of merit that is a designation for pleasure namely  kinds of merit  
At the end of the teaching the lay follower along with many other people became established in the fruition of Stream Entry When he went into the presence of King Pasenadi of Kosala he told him what had happened The king was exceedingly contented and saying  Good householder good that you lay by a treasure store that cannot be carried off by those like me he congratulated  and greatly complimented him

 By developing the four divine abodes on the dissolution of the body after death he passed on to the Brahmaworld
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus
Then in a certain place beside the main road the Blessed One smiled
It Occurred to the venerable Ananda What is the reason what is the cause for the Blessed Ones smile
Tathagatas do not smile for no reason
So he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder and extending his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One asked him Venerable sir what is the reason what is the cause for the Blessed Ones smile
Tathagatas do not smile for no reason
Once Ananda in this place there was a prosperous and busy market town called Vebhalinga with many inhabitants and crowded with people
Now the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened lived near the market town Vebhalinga
It was here in fact that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened had his monastery
Then the venerable Ananda folded his patchwork cloak in four and spreading it out said to the Blessed One Then venerable sir let the Blessed One be seated
Thus this place will have been used by two Accomplished Ones Fully Enlightened Ones
The Blessed One sat down on the seat
Now the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened lived near the market town Vebhalinga
It was here in fact that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened had his monastery
In Vebhalinga the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened had as a supporter as his chief supporter a potter named Ghatikara
Ghatikara the potter had as a friend as his close friend a brahmin student named Jotipala
I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
The brahmin student Jotipala replied Enough my dear Ghatikara
A second and third time the potter Ghatikara said My dear Jotipala let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened
I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
And a second and a third time the brahmin student Jotipala replied Enough my dear Ghatikara
 Then my dear Jotipala let us take a loofah and bath powder and go to the river to bathe
 Very well Jotipala replied
So the potter Ghatikara and the brahmin student Jotipala took a loofah and bath powder and went to the river to bathe
Then Ghatikara said to Jotipala My dear Jotipala there is the monastery of the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened quite nearby
Let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened
I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
Jotipala replied Enough my dear Ghatikara
A second and a third time Ghatikara said My dear Jotipala there is the monastery of the Blessed One Kassapa
Then the potter Ghatikara seized the brahmin student Jotipala by the belt and said My dear Jotipala there is the monastery of the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened quite nearby
Let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened
I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
Then the brahmin student Jotipala undid his belt and said Enough my dear Ghatikara
Then when the brahmin student Jotipala had washed his head the potter Ghatikara seized him by the hair and said My dear Jotipala there is the monastery of the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened quite nearby
Let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened
I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
Then the brahmin student Jotipala thought It is wonderful it is marvellous
that this potter Ghatikara who is of a different birth should presume to seize me by the hair when we have washed our heads Surely this can be no simple matter And he said to the potter Ghatikara You go as far as this my dear Ghatikara
 I go as far as this my dear Jotipala
 Then my dear Ghatikara let go of me Let us visit him
So Ghatikara the potter and Jotipala the brahmin student went to the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened Ghatikara after paying homage to him sat down at one side
Ghatikara then said to the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened Venerable sir this is the brahmin student Jotipala my friend my close friend
Let the Blessed One teach him the Dhamma
Then the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened instructed urged roused and encouraged Ghatikara the potter and Jotipala the brahmin student with an exposition of the Dhamma
At the conclusion of the exposition having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One Kassapas words they rose from their seats and after paying homage to the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened keeping him on their right they departed
Then Jotipala asked Ghatikara Now that you have heard this Dhamma my dear Ghatikara why dont you go forth from the home life into homelessness
 My diear Jotipala dont you know that I support my blind and aged parents
 Then my dear Ghatikara I shall go forth from the home life into homelessness
So Ghatikara the potter and Jotipala the brahmin student went to the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened After paying homage to him
Let the Blessed One give him the going forth
And the brahmin student Jotipala received the going forth from the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened and he received the full admission
Wandering by stages he eventually arrived at Benares
Now King Kiki of Kasi heard It seems that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened has reached Benares and is living in the Deer Park at Isipatana
So he had a number of state carriages made ready and mounting a state carriage drove out from Bepares with the full pomp of royalty in order to see the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened
He went thus as far as the road was passable for carriages and then he got down from his carriage and went forward on foot to the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened After paying homage to him he sat down at one side
At the conclusion of the exposition King Kiki of Kasi said Venerable sir let the Blessed One together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrows meal from me
And the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened accepted in silence
Then knowing that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened had accepted he rose from his seat and after paying homage to him keeping him on his right he departed
Then when the night had ended King Kiki of Kasi had good food of various kinds prepared in his own dwelling  red rice stored in the sheaf with the dark grains picked out along with many sauces and curries  and he had the time announced to the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened thus It is time venerable sir the meal is ready
Then it being morning the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe he went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the dwelling of King Kiki of Kasi and sat down on the seat made ready
Then with his own hands King Kiki of Kasi served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with the various kinds of good food
When the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl King Kiki of Kasi took a low seat sat down at one side
 Enough king
A second and a third time King Kiki of Kasi said Venerable sir let the Blessed One accept from me a residence for the Rains in Benares that will be helpful for the Sangha
 Enough king
The king thought The Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened does not accept from me a residence for the Rains in Benares and he was very disappointed and sad
Then he said Venerable sir have you a better supporter than I am
 I have great king There is a market town called Vebhalinga
where a potter named Ghatlkara lives He is my supporter my chief supporter
Now you great king thought The Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened does not accept from me a residence for the Rains in Benares and you were very disappointed and sad
The potter Ghatikara has gone for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
He abstains from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech and from wine liquor and intoxicants which are the basis of negligence
He has perfect confidence in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and he possesses the virtues loved by noble ones
He is free from doubt about suffering about the origin of suffering about the cessation of suffering and about the way leading to the cessation of suffering
He eats only in one part of the day he observes celibacy he is virtuous of good character
He has laid aside gems and gold he has given up gold and silver
He does not dig the ground for clay using a pick with his own hand
He supports his blind and aged parents
Having destroyed the five lower fetters he is one who will reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world
On one occasion when I was living at Vebhalinga
 Venerable sir your supporter has gone out but take rice from the cauldron and sauce from the saucepan and eat
I did so and went away
Then the potter Ghatikara went to his parents and asked Who has taken rice from the cauldron and sauce from the saucepan eaten and gone away
 My dear the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened did
Then the potter Ghatikara thought It is a gain for me it is a great gain for me that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened relies on me thus
And rapture and happiness never left him for a halfmonth or his parents for a week
On another occasion when I was living at Vebhalinga
 Venerable sir your supporter has gone out but take some porridge from the vessel and sauce from the saucepan and eat
I did so and went away
Then the potter Ghatikara went to his parents and asked Who has taken porridge from the vessel and sauce from the saucepan eaten and gone away
 My dear the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened did
Then the potter Ghatikara thought It is a gain for me it is a great gain for me that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened relies on me thus
And rapture and happiness never left him for a halfmonth or his parents for a week
On another occasion when I was living at Vebhalinga
Then I addressed the bhikkhus thus Go bhikkhus and find out if there is any grass at the potter Ghatikaras house
 Venerable sir there is no grass at the potter Ghatikaras house there is the grass thatch on his roof
 Go bhikkhus and remove the grass from the potter Ghatlkaras house
They did so
Then the potter Ghatikaras parents asked the bhikkhus Who is removing the grass from the house
 Sister the hut of the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened is leaking
 Take it venerable sirs take it and bless you
Then the potter Ghatikara went to his parents and asked Who has removed the grass from the roof
 The bhikkhus did my dear the hut of the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened is leaking
Then the potter Ghatikara thought It is a gain for me it is a great gain for me that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened relies on me thus
And the rapture and happiness never left him for a halfmonth or his parents for a week
Then that house remained three whole months with the sky for a roof and yet no rain came in
Such is the potter Ghatikara
It is a gain for the potter Ghatikara it is a great gain for him that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened relies on him thus
Then King Kiki of Kasi dispatched to the potter Ghatikara five hundred cartloads of red rice stored in the sheaf and also sauce materials to go with it
Then the kings men went to the potter Ghatikara and told him Venerable sir there are five hundred cartloads of red rice stored in the sheaf and also sauce materials to go with it dispatched to you by King Kikl of Kasi
 The king is very busy and has much to do
I have enough
Let this be for the king himself
Now Ananda you may think thus Certainly someone else was the brahmin student Jotipala on that occasion
But it should not be regarded thus
I was the brahmin student Jotipala oh that occasion
That is what the Blessed One said
The venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
They abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness
it was here in fact that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened resided and advised the Sangha of bhikkhus
that had been made ready and addressed the venerable Ananda thus
Once Ananda in this place there was a prosperous and busy market town called Vebhalinga with many inhabitants and crowded with people
it was here in fact that the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened resided and advised the Sangha of bhikkhus
One day the potter Ghatikara addressed the brahmin student Jotipala thus My dear Jotipala let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened

Bhikkhus there are these five things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma
What five
Here the bhikkhus do not learn the Dhamma discourses mixed prose and verse expositions verses inspired utterances quotations birth stories amazing accounts and questionsandanswers
This is the first thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma
Again the bhikkhus do not teach the Dhamma to others in detail as they have heard it and learned it
This is the second thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma
Again  the bhikkhus do not make others repeat the Dhamma in detail as they have heard it and learned it
This is the third thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the good Dhamma
Again  the bhikkhus do not recite the Dhamma in detail as they have heard it and learned it

Monks there are these four obscurations of the sun and moon obscured by which the sun and moon dont glow dont shine dont dazzle
Which four
Clouds are an obscuration of the sun and moon obscured by which the sun and moon dont glow dont shine dont dazzle
Fog is an obscuration
Smoke and dust is an obscuration
Rāhu the king of the asuras believed to be the cause of an eclipse is an obscuration of the sun and moon obscured by which the sun and moon dont glow dont shine dont dazzle
These are the four obscurations of the sun and moon obscured by which the sun and moon dont glow dont shine dont dazzle
In the same way there are four obscurations of contemplatives  brahmans obscured by which some contemplatives  brahmans dont glow dont shine dont dazzle
Which four
There are some contemplatives  brahmans who drink alcohol and fermented liquor who dont refrain from drinking alcohol and fermented liquor
This is the first obscuration of contemplatives  brahmans obscured by which some contemplatives  brahmans dont glow dont shine dont dazzle
There are some contemplatives  brahmans who engage in sexual intercourse who dont refrain from sexual intercourse
This is the second obscuration of contemplatives  brahmans obscured by which some contemplatives  brahmans dont glow dont shine dont dazzle
There are some contemplatives  brahmans who consent to gold  silver who dont refrain from accepting gold  silver
This is the third obscuration of contemplatives  brahmans obscured by which some contemplatives  brahmans dont glow dont shine dont dazzle
There are some contemplatives  brahmans who maintain life through wrong livelihood who dont refrain from wrong livelihood
This is the fourth obscuration of contemplatives  brahmans obscured by which some contemplatives  brahmans dont glow dont shine dont dazzle
These are the four obscurations obscured by which some contemplatives  brahmans dont glow dont shine dont dazzle
Obscured by passion  aversion some brahmans  contemplatives
people entrenched in ignorance delighting in endearing forms
drink alcohol  fermented liquor engage in sexual intercourse
unwise consent to gold  silver
live by means of wrong livelihood some brahmans  contemplatives
These are said to be obscurations by the Awakened One kinsman of the Sun
Because of these obscurations some brahmans  contemplatives
dont glow dont shine are impure dusty dead
Covered with darkness slaves to craving led on
they swell the terrible charnel ground they grab at further becoming
And a second and a third time the brahmin student Jotipala replied Enough my dear Ghatikara
what is the use of seeing that bald pated recluse
what is the use of seeing that baldpated recluse
for so much do I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
while Jotipala exchanged greetings with him
and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished he too sat down at one side
Then not long after Jotipala the brahmin student had received the full admission a halfmonth after he had received the full admission the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened having stayed at Vebhalinga as long as he chose set out to wander towards Benares
and there he went to live in the Deer Park at Isipatana
and the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened instructed urged roused and encouraged King KikI of Kasi with an exposition of the Dhamma
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana
If form were the self this form would not lend itself to disease It would be possible with regard to form Let my form be thus Let my form not be thus
Form monks is not self
There he addressed the group of five monks
But precisely because form is not self this form lends itself to disease And it is not possible with regard to form Let my form be thus Let my form not be thus
Feeling is not self
Perception is not self
Fabrications are not self
If consciousness were the self this consciousness would not lend itself to disease It would be possible with regard to consciousness Let my consciousness be thus Let my consciousness not be thus
Consciousness is not self
But precisely because consciousness is not self consciousness lends itself to disease And it is not possible with regard to consciousness Let my consciousness be thus Let my consciousness not be thus
What do you think monks Is form constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mine This is my self This is what I am
No lord
 Is feeling constant or inconstant
 Is perception constant or inconstant
 Are fabrications constant or inconstant
Is consciousness constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mine This is my self This is what I am
No lord
Thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near Every form is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be This is not mine This is not my self This is not what I am
Any feeling whatsoever
Any perception whatsoever
Any fabrications whatsoever
Any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near Every consciousness is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be This is not mine This is not my self This is not what I am
Seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is released
With release there is the knowledge Released
He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for this world
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the group of five monks delighted in the Blessed Ones words
And while this explanation was being given the minds of the group of five monks through lack of clingingsustenance were released from effluents
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrel Sanctuary
Now on that occasion the Blessed One was sick afflicted gravely ill
Then the Venerable Mahacunda approached the Blessed One paid homage to him and sat down to one side
The Blessed One then said to the Venerable Mahacunda Recite the factors of enlightenment Cunda

And the Blessed One recovered from that illness
In such a way the Blessed One was cured of his illness
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Rajagaha in the bamboo grove in the squirrels feeding ground
At that time he was afflicted with a disease was suffering therefrom and was gravely ill
Then the Venerable Maha Cunda arising from his solitude at eventide approached the Blessed One saluted him and sat down beside him
To the Venerable Maha Cunda thus seated the Blessed One said O Cunda let the factors of enlightenment occur to your mind

These seven factors of enlightenment bhante are well expounded and cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One They conduce to perfect understanding to full realization and to Nibbana
Most assuredly Cunda they are factors of enlightenment Most assuredly Cunda they are factors of enlightenment
Thus said the Venerable Maha Cunda
and the Master approved of it
Then the Blessed One recovered from his affliction
and thus disappeared his affliction
and said Venerable sir let the Blessed One accept from me a residence for the Rains in Benares that will be helpful for the Sangha
my residence for the Rains has already been provided for
my residence for the Rains has already been provided for
but the potter Ghatikara is not and will not be so
what is left over from embankments or thrown up by rats he brings home in a carrier when he has made a pot he says Let anyone who likes set down some selected rice or selected beans or selected lentils and let him take away whatever he likes

my hut leaked

they sat down at one side and Ghatikara the potter said to the Blessed One Kassapa accomplished and fully enlightened Venerable sir this is the brahmin student Jotipala my friend my close friend
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatti in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Then the wanderer Vekhanassa went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
But Kaccana why do you say This is the perfect splendour this is the perfect splendour
What is that perfect splendour
Master Gotama that splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublime
But Kaccana what is that splendour that is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublime
Master Gotama that splendour is the perfect splendour that is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublime
Kaccana you might continue for a long time in this way
Kaccana there are these five cords of sensual pleasure
Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust Sounds cognizable by the earOdours cognizable by the noseFlavours cognizable by the tongue Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust These are the five cords of sensual pleasure
Now Kaccana the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these five cords of sensual pleasure are called sensual pleasure
Thus sensual pleasure arises through sensual pleasures but beyond sensual pleasure there is a pleasure higher than the sensual and that is declared to be the highest among them
When this was said the wanderer Vekhanassa said It is wonderful Master Gotama it is marvellous
But those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed who have lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached the true goal destroyed the fetters of being and are completely liberated through final knowledge  it is they who would know what sensuality is what sensual pleasure is and what the pleasure higher than the sensual is
When this was said the wanderer Vekhanassa was angry and displeased and he reviled disparaged and censured the Blessed One saying The recluse Gotama will be worsted He then said to the Blessed One So then there are some recluses and brahmins here who without knowing the past and without seeing the future yet claim Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had ta be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
What they say turns out to be ridiculous it turns out to be mere words empty and hollow
If any recluses and brahmins without knowing the past and without seeing the future yet claim Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being they can be confuted in accordance with the Dhamma
Rather let the past be Kaccana and let the future be
Let a wise man come one who is honest and sincere a man of rectitude
I instruct him I teach him the Dhamma in such a way that by practising as instructed he will soon know and see for himself Thus indeed there rightly comes to be liberation from the bond that is from the bond of ignorance
Suppose Kaccana there were a young tender infant lying prone bound by stout bonds at the four limbs with the fifth at the neck and later on as a result of his growth and the maturing of his faculties those bonds loosened then he would know I am free and there would be no more bondage
So too let a wise man comeThus indeed there rightly comes to be liberation from the bond that is from the bond of ignorance
When this was said the wanderer Vekhanassa said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clearfor those with eyesight to see forms I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus From today let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished
he stood at one side and in the Blessed Ones presence he uttered this exclamation This is the perfect splendour this is the perfect splendour
yet you do not indicate what that splendour is
What five
how well that has been expressed by Master Gotama Thus sensual pleasure arises through sensual pleasures but beyond sensual pleasure there is a pleasure higher than the sensual and that is declared to be the highest among them Kaccana for you who are of another view who accept another teaching who approve of another teaching who pursue a different training who follow a different teacher it is hard to know what sensuality is or what sensual pleasure is or what the pleasure higher than the sensual is
and it was not long before their minds were freed from the corruptions without remainder
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Forest together with a large Saṅgha of approximately five hundred monks all of them arahants And most of the devatās from ten worldsystems had gathered in order to see the Blessed One  the Saṅgha of monks
Let us also approach the Blessed One and on arrival let us each speak a verse in his presence
Then the thought occurred to four devatās of the ranks from the Pure Abodes The Blessed One is dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Forest together with a large Saṅgha of about five hundred monks all of them arahants And most of the devatās from ten worldsystems have gathered in order to see the Blessed One  the Saṅgha of monks
Then just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm those devatās disappeared from among the Devas of the Pure Abodes and reappeared before the Blessed One
Having paid homage to him they stood to one side
As they were standing there one devatā recited this verse in the Blessed Ones presence
A great meeting in the woods The deva hosts have assembled
We have come to this Dhamma meeting to see the unvanquished Saṅgha
Then another devatā recited this verse in the Blessed Ones presence
There the monks are concentrated have straightened their own minds
Like a charioteer holding the reins the wise ones guard their faculties
Then another devatā recited this verse in the Blessed Ones presence
Having cut through barrenness cut the crossbar having uprooted Indras pillar unstirred
they wander about pure unstained young nāgas well tamed by the One with Eyes
Then another devatā recited this verse in the Blessed Ones presence
Those who have gone to the Buddha for refuge will not go to the plane of woe
On discarding the human body they will fill the hosts of the devas
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks most of the devatās from ten worldsystems have gathered in order to see the Tathāgata  the Saṅgha of monks
Those who in the past were Worthy Ones Rightly Self awakened at most had their devatāgathering like mine at the present
Those who in the future will be Worthy Ones Rightly Selfawakened will at most have their devatāgathering like mine at the present
I will tell you the names of the deva hosts I will describe to you the names of the deva hosts I will teach you the names of the deva hosts
Listen  pay close attention I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded to the Blessed One
The Blessed One said
I will recite a verse of tribute
Those who live where spirits dwell who live in mountain caves resolute concentrated
many like hidden lions who have overcome horripilation
whitehearted pure serene  undisturbed
Knowing that more than  of them had come to the forest of Kapilavatthu
the Teacher then said to them disciples delighting in his instruction
The deva hosts have approached Detect them monks 
Listening to the Awakened Ones instruction they made an ardent effort
Knowledge appeared to them vision of nonhuman beings
Some saw  some  some 
some had vision of  nonhuman beings
Some gained vision of innumerable devas filling every direction
Realizing all this the OnewithVision felt moved to speak
The Teacher then said to them disciples delighting in his instruction
The deva hosts have approached Detect them monks

Bhikkhus when a bhikkhu who possesses five factors resorts to and uses a lodging that possesses five factors in no long time with the destruction of the taints he might realize for him self with direct knowledge in this very life the taintless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom and having entered upon it dwell in it
And how  bhikkhus does a bhikkhu possess five factors
Here a bhikkhu is endowed with faith He has faith in the enlightenment of the Tathagata thus The Blessed One is an arahant perfectly enlightened accomplished in true knowledge and conduct fortunate knower of the world unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed teacher of devas and humans the Enlightened One the Blessed One He is seldom ill or afflicted possessing an even digestion that is neither too cool nor too hot but moderate and suitable for striving He is honest and open one who reveals him self as he really is to the Teacher and his wise fellow monks He has a roused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities he is strong  firm in exertion  not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities He is wise he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away  which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering
It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses five factors
And how does a lodging possess five factors
 Here  the lodging is neither too far from a place for alms nor too close and it possesses a means for going and returning During the day it is not disturbed by people and at night it is quiet and still There is little contact With flies mosquitoes wind  the burning sun  and serpents One dwelling in that lodging can easily obtain robes almsfood lodging and medicines and provisions for the sick In that lodging elder bhikkhus are dwelling who are learned heirs to the heritage experts on the Dhamma experts on the discipline experts on the outlines He approaches them from time to time and inquiresHow is this Bhante What is the meaning of this Those venerable ones then disclose to him what has not been disclosed clear up what is obscure and dispel his perplexity about numerous perplexing points
It is in this way that a lodging possesses five factors
When a bhikkhu who possesses these five factors resorts to and uses a lodging that possesses these five factors in no long time with the destruction of the taints he might realize for himself with direct knowledge in this very life the taintless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom and having entered upon it dwell in it
Thus have I heard Once the Lord was staying in Rajagaha at the Vultures Peak
And at that time the wanderer Nigrodha was staying at the Udumbarika lodging for wanderers with a large company of some three thousand wanderers
And one morning early the householder Sandhana came to Rajagaha in order to see the Lord
Then he thought It is not the proper time to see the Blessed Lord
Perhaps I should go to the Udumbarika lodging for wanderers and call on Nigrodha
And he did so
And just then Nigrodha was sitting in the midst of a large crowd of wanderers who were all shouting and screaming and making a great clamour and indulging in various kinds of unedifying conversation
Then Nigrodha saw Sandhana approaching from a distance
The householder Sandhana a follower of the ascetic Gotama is approaching
He is one of the number of whiterobed householder followers of the ascetic Gotama in Rajagaha
And these good folk are fond of quiet they are taught to be quiet and speak in praise of quiet
If he sees that this company is quiet he will most likely want to come and visit us
At this the wanderers fell silent
Then Sandhana approached Nigrodha and exchanged courtesies with him
Then he said Reverend sirs the way the wanderers of another faith conduct themselves when they come together is one thing they make a great clamour and indulge in all manner of unedifying conversation
Then Nigrodha replied Well now householder do you know whom the ascetic Gotama talks to Whom does he converse with From whom does he get his lucidity of wisdom
The ascetic Gotamas wisdom is destroyed by the solitary life he is unused to assemblies he is no good at conversation
Just as bison circling around keep to the fringes
so it is with the ascetic Gotama In fact householder if the ascetic Gotama were to come to this assembly we would baffle him with a single question
Now the Lord with his divineearfaculty purified and surpassing human range heard this exchange between Sandhana and Nigrodha
And descending from the Vultures Peak he came to the Peacocks Feeding Ground beside the Sumagadha Tank and walked up and down there in the open air
Then Nigrodha caught sight of him
and he called his company to order saying Gentlemen he quiet be less noisy The ascetic Gotama is walking up and down beside the Sumagadha Tank
He is fond of quiet he speaks in praise of quiet
If he sees that this company is quiet he will most likely want to come and visit us
If he does so we will put this question to him Lord what is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support and the perfection of the holy life
At this the wanderers were silent
Then the Lord approached Nigrodha
At last the Blessed Lord has gone out of his way to come here
Be seated Lord a seat is prepared
The Lord sat down on the prepared seat
and Nigrodha took a low stool and sat down to one side
Then the Lord said to him Nigrodha what was the subject of your conversation just now What talk have I interrupted
Nigrodha replied Lord we saw the Blessed Lord walking up and down at the Peacocks Feeding Ground by the Sumagadha Tank and we thought If the ascetic Gotama were to come here we could ask him this question Lord what is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support and the perfection of the holy life
Nigrodha it is hard for you holding different views being of different inclinations and subject to different influences following a different teacher to understand the doctrine which I teach my disciples
Come on then Nigrodha ask me about your own teaching about your extreme austerity How are the conditions of austerity and selfmortification fulfilled and how are they not fulfilled 
At this the wanderers made a great commotion and noise exclaiming It is wonderful it is marvellous how great are the powers of the ascetic Gotama in holding back with his own theories and in inviting others to discuss theirs 
Silencing them Nigrodha said Lord we teach the higher austerities we regard them as essential we adhere to them
Such being the case what constitutes their fulfilment or nonfulfilment 
Suppose Nigrodha a selfmortifier goes naked uses no polite restraints licks his hands does not come or stand still when requested He does not accept food out of the pot or pan
He wears coarse hemp or mixed material shrouds from corpses rags from the dustheapHe is a pluckerout of hair and beard devoted to this practice he is a coveredthorn man making his bed on them sleeping alone in a garment of wet mud living in the open air accepting whatever seat is offered one who drinks no water and is addicted to the practice or he dwells intent on the practice of going to bathe three times before evening
What do you think Nigrodha is the higher austerity thereby fulfilled or not
Indeed Lord it is fulfilled
But Nigrodha I maintain that this higher austerity can be faulted in various ways
In what way Lord do you maintain that it can be faulted
Take the case Nigrodha of a selfmortifier who practises a certain austerity
As a result he is pleased and satisfied at having attained his end
And this is a fault in that selfmortifier
Or else in so doing he elevates himself and disparages others
And this is a fault in that selfmortifier
Or else he has become intoxicated with conceit infatuated and therefore careless
And this is a fault in that selfmortifier
Again a selfmortifier practises a certain austerity and this brings him gains honours and fame As a result he is pleased and satisfied at having attained his end
And this is a fault in that selfmortifier
Again a selfmortifier practises a certain austerity and he divides his food into two heaps saying This suits me that doesnt suit me
And what does not suit him he eagerly rejects
Again a selfmortifier practises a certain austerity for the sake of gains honours and fame thinking Kings and their ministers will honour me Khattiyas and Brahmins and householders and religious teachers And this is a fault in that selfmortifier
Again a selfmortifier disparages some ascetic or Brahmin saying See how he lives in abundance eating all sorts of things
Whether propagated from roots from stems from joings from cuttings or fifthly from seeds he chews them all up with that thunderbolt of a jaw of his and they call him an ascetic  And this is a fault in that selfmortifier
Or he sees another ascetic or Brahmin being made much of by families being honoured and respected and worshipped
whereas I who am a real ascetic and selfmortifier get no such treatment Thus he is envious and jealous because of those householders And this is a fault in that selfmortifier
Again a selfmortifier sits in a prominent position And this is a fault in that selfmortifier
Or he goes round ostentatiously among the families as if to say See this is my way of renunciation  And this is a fault in that selfmortifier
Or he behaves in an underhand way
On being asked Do you approve of this although he does not approve he says I do
In this way he becomes a conscious liar And this is a fault in that selfmortifier
Again a selfmortifier when the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata presents the Dhamma in a way that should command his assent withholds that assent And this is a fault in that selfmortifier
Or he is angry and badtempered
And this is a fault in that selfmortifier
Or he is mean and spiteful envious and jealous crafty and deceitful obstinate and proud with evil desires and under their sway with wrong views and given to extremist opinions he is tainted with worldliness holding on firmly unwilling to give up
And this is a fault in that selfmortifier
What do you think Nigrodha Are these things faults in the higher austerity or not
Certainly they are Lord
It could happen that a single selfmortifier was possessed of all these faults not to speak of just one or the other
 Now Nigrodha take the case of a certain selfmortifier who practises a certain austerity As a result he is not pleased and satisfied at having attained his end
This being so
Again he does not elevate himself and disparage others 
Thus he does not become a conscious liar In this respect he is purified
Again a selfmortifier when the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata presents the Dhamma in a way that should command his assent gives his assent In this respect he is purified
And he is not angry or badtempered
In this respect he is purified
And he is not mean and spiteful envious and jealous crafty and deceitful obstinate and proud he is without evil desires and not under their sway without wrong views and not given to extremist opinions he is not tainted with worldliness does not hold on firmly and is not unwilling to give up
In this respect he is purified
What do you think Nigrodha Is the higher austerity purified by these things or not
Certainly it is Lord it attains its peak there penetrating to the pith
No Nigrodha it does not attain its peak there penetrating to the pith It has only reached the outer bark 
Nigrodha you may think The ascetic Gotama says this in order to get disciples
But you should not regard it like that
Let him who is your teacher remain your teacher
But you should not regard it like that
Let your rules remain as they are
Or you may think He wants us to abandon our way of life
But you should not regard it like that
Let your way of life remain as it was
Or you may think He wants to establish us in the doing of things that according to our teaching are wrong and are so considered among us
But you should not regard it like that
Let those things you consider wrong continue to be so considered
Or you may think He wants to draw us away from things that according to our teaching are good and are so considered among us
But you should not regard it like that
Let whatever you consider right continue to be so considered
Nigrodha I do not speak for any of these reasons
There are Nigrodha unwholesome things that have not been abandoned tainted conducive to rebirth fearful productive of painful results in the future associated with birth decay and death It is for the abandonment of these things that I teach Dhamma
If you practise accordingly these tainted things will be abandoned and the things that make for purification will develop and grow and you will all attain to and dwell in this very life by your own insight and realisation in the fullness of perfected wisdom
At these words the wanderers sat silent and upset their shoulders drooped they hung their heads and sat there downcast and bewildered so possessed were their minds by Mara
so that not a single one of them thinks Let us now follow the holy life proclaimed by the ascetic Gotama that we may learn it  for what do seven days matter
Then the Lord having uttered his lions roar in the Udumbarika park rose up in the air and alighted on the Vultures Peak
And the householder Sandhana also returned to Rajagaha
At this Nigrodha said to the Lord Transgression overcame me Lord Foolish blind and evil as I was that I spoke thus of the Lord
May the Lord accept my confession of this fault that I may restrain myself in future
Indeed Nigrodha transgression overcame you when through folly blindness and evil you spoke thus of me
But since you recognise the nature of your transgression and make amends as is right we accept your confession
For Nigrodha it is a mark of progress in the discipline of the Noble Ones if anyone recognises the nature of his transgression and makes amends as is right restraining himself for the future
But Nigrodha I tell you this
If he practises what he is taught then within seven years he will attain in this life to that unequalled holy life and goal for the sake of which young men of good family go forth from the household life into homelessness by his own knowledge and realisation and he will abide therein
Let alone seven years 
Let alone half a month 
And when the householder Sandhana realised These wanderers of other views are actually listening and attending to the Lords words and inclining their minds to the higher wisdom
 His wisdom is destroyed by the solitary life he is no good at conversation he is right out of touch
And at these words Nigrodha was silent and upset his shoulders drooped he hung his head and sat there downcast and bewildered
Seeing the state he was in the Lord said Is it true Nigrodha that you said that
Lord it is true that I said that foolishly mistakenly and wickedly
What do you think Nigrodha
Have you ever heard it said by wanderers who were aged venerable the teachers of teachers that those who in the past were Arahants fullyenlightened Buddhas used to talk when they came together by shouting and screaming and making a great clamour and indulging in unedifying conversation
Or did they not say rather that those Blessed Ones sought lodging in the forest in the depths of the jungle free from noise with little sound far from the madding crowd undisturbed by men wellfitted for seclusion just as I do now
Lord I have heard
Nigrodha you are an intelligent man of mature years Did it never occur to you to think The Blessed Lord is enlightened and teaches a doctrine of enlightenment he is selfrestrained and teaches a doctrine of selfrestraint he is calm and teaches a doctrine of calm He has gone beyond and teaches a doctrine of going beyond he has gained Nibbana and teaches a doctrine for the gaining of Nibbana
Well then Lord how does austerity reach its peak penetrating to the pith
It would be good if the Blessed Lord were to cause my austerity to attain its peak to penetrate to the pith
Well Nigrodha take the case of a selfmortifier who observes the fourfold restraint
And then with the purified divine eye he sees beings passing away and arising base and noble well favoured and illfavoured to happy and unhappy destinations as kamma directs them
What do you think Nigrodha Is the higher austerity purified by these things or not
Certainly it is Lord It attains its peak there penetrating to the pith 
So indeed it is Nigrodha that austerity is so purified as to reach its peak and penetrate to the pith
And so Nigrodha when you ask What Lord is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support and the perfection of the holy life
I say that it is by something more farreaching and excellent that I train them through which theyrecognise as their principal support and the perfection of the holy life
At this the wanderers made a great commotion and noise exclaiming We and our teacher are ruined We know of nothing higher or more farreaching than our teaching 
Well then Lord how does austerity attain its peak penetrating to the pith
It would be good if the Blessed Lord were to cause my austerity to attain its peak to penetrate to the pith
Nigrodha take the case of a selfmortifier who observes the fourfold restraint
He recalls various past lives There my name was so andsomy caste was soandso  I experienced suchandsuch pleasant and painful conditions  Having passed from there I arose there
What do you think Nigrodha Is the higher austerity purified by these things or not
Certainly it is Lord It attains its peak there penetrating to the pith
No Nigrodha it only reaches the fibres surrounding the pith 
Well then Lord how does austerity attain its peak penetrating to the pith
It would be good if the Blessed Lord were to cause my austerity to attain its peak to penetrate to the pith
Nigrodha take the case of a selfmortifier who observes the fourfold restraint
And what is this
Here a selfmortifier does not harm a living being does not cause a living being to be harmed does not approve of such harming
In this way a selfmortifier observes the fourfold restraint
And through this restraint through making this his austerity
Then he finds a solitary lodging at the root of a forest tree in a mountain cave or gorge a charnelground a junglethicket or in the open air on a heap of straw
Then having eaten after his return from the almsround he sits down crosslegged holding his body erect having established mindfulness before him
Abandoning illwill and hatred he dwells with a mind freed from them and by compassionate love for the welfare of all living beings his mind is purified of them
Abandoning slothandtorpor by the perception of light mindful and clearly aware his mind is purified of slothandtorpor
Abandoning worryandflurry and with an inwardly calmed heart his mind is purified of worryandflurry
Abandoning doubt he dwells with doubt left behind without uncertainty as to what things are wholesome his mind purified of doubt
Having abandoned these five hindrances and in order to weaken by insight the defilements of mind he dwells letting his mind filled with lovingkindness pervade one quarter
And so he continues to pervade the whole wide world above below across and everywhere with a mind filled with lovingkindness extensive developed measureless free from hatred and illwill
And he dwells letting his mind filled with compassion  with sympathetic joy with equanimity pervade one quarter
What do you think Nigrodha
Is the higher austerity purified by these things or not
Certainly it is Lord It attains its peak there penetrating to the pith
No Nigrodha it does not attain its peak there It has only penetrated to the inner bark 
I mark the span of life O bird how quickly it is sped
And standing fast in virtues ten the next world never dread
Almsgiving justice penitence meek spirit temper mild
Peace mercy patience charity with morals undefiled
Queen Sīlavatī being a wise woman thought What will be the issue of all this At the end of one or two days she said to the king We are anxious to see our daughterinlaw
He readily assented and sent for his daughter
Pabhāvatī magnificently dressed and surrounded by a band of her attendants came and saluted her motherinlaw
On seeing her the queen at once thought This maiden is very lovely and my son is illfavoured
Should she see him she will not stay a single day but will run away I must devise some scheme
Addressing the Madda king she said My daughterinlaw is quite worthy of my son howbeit we have an hereditary observance in our family If she will abide by this custom we will take her to be his bride
What is this observance of yours
In our family a wife is not allowed to see her husband by daylight until she has conceived
If she will act up to this we will take her
The king asked his daughter My dear will you be able to act thus
Yes dear father she replied
Then king Okkāka bestowed much gear on the Madda king and departed with her
And the Madda king despatched his daughter with a vast retinue
Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was ruling in Benares a forester named Sura who dwelt in the kingdom of Kāsi went to the Himalayas to seek for articles of merchandise
There was a certain tree there that sprang up to the height of a man with his arms extended over his head and then divided into three parts
In the midst of its three forks was a hole as big as a wine jar
and when it rained this hole was filled with water Round about it grew two myrobalan  plants and a pepper shrub and the ripe fruits from these when they were cut down fell into the hole
Not far from this tree was some selfsown paddy The parrots would pluck the heads of rice and eat them perched on this tree
And while they were eating the paddy and the husked rice fell there
So the water fermenting through the suns heat assumed a bloodred colour
In the hot season flocks of birds being thirsty drank of it and becoming intoxicated fell down at the foot of the tree and after sleeping awhile flew away chirping merrily
And the same thing happened in the case of wild dogs monkeys and other creatures
The forester on seeing this said If this were poison they would die but after a short sleep they go away as they list it is no poison And he himself drank of it and becoming intoxicated he felt a desire to eat flesh
and then making a fire he killed the partridges and cocks that fell down at the foot of the tree and roasted their flesh on the live coals and gesticulating with one hand and eating flesh with the other he remained one or two days in the same spot
Largeeyed and peerless one etcThis was a story the Master while sojourning at Jetavana told of a female novice
A girl of good family at Sāvatthi they say recognizing the misery of the lay life embraced asceticism and one day went with other Sisters to hear the Law from the Bodhisatta as he sat preaching from a magnificent throne and observing his person to be endued with extreme beauty of form arising from the power of illimitable merit she thought I wonder whether in a former existence those I once ministered to were this mans wives
Then at that very moment the recollection of former existences came back to her In the time of Chaddanta the elephant I was previously existing as this mans wife
And at the remembrance great joy and gladness sprang up in her heart
In her joyous excitement she laughed aloud as she thought Few wives are well disposed to their husbands most of them are ill disposed I wonder if I were well or ill disposed to this man
And calling back her remembrance she perceived that she had harboured a slight grudge in her heart against Chaddanta the mighty lord of elephants who measured one hundred and twenty cubits and had sent Sonuttara a hunter who with a poisoned arrow wounded and killed him
Then her sorrow awoke and her heart grew hot within her and being unable to control her feelings bursting into sobs she wept aloud
On Seeing this the Master broke into a smile and on being asked by the assembly of the Brethren What Sir was the cause of your smiling he said Brethren this young Sister wept on recalling a sin she once committed against me And so saying he told a story of the past
he is in retreat
it is not the proper time to see the meditating monks
they are in retreat
about kings robbers ministers armies dangers war food drink clothes beds garlands perfumes relatives carriages villages towns and cities countries women heroes street and wellgossip talk of the departed desultory chat speculation about land and sea talk of being and nonbeing
and he called his followers to order saying Be quiet gentlemen dont make a noise gentlemen
and then sat down to one side
The Blessed Lords way is different he seeks a lodging in the forest in the depths of the jungle free from noise with little sound far from the madding crowd undisturbed by men well fitted for seclusion
he is right out of touch
we would knock him over like an empty pot
and Nigrodha said Come Blessed Lord welcome Blessed Lord
Or else he elevates himself and disparages others
Or else he becomes intoxicated with conceit infatuated and therefore careless
while what suits him he eats up greedily recklessly and passionately not seeing the peril with no thought for the consequences And this is a fault in that selfmortifier
and he thinks They make much of that richliver they honour him respect him and worship him
or although he does approve he says I do not
in this respect he is purified
he does not take what is not given or cause it to be taken or approve of such taking
he does not tell a lie or cause a lie to be told or approve of such lying
he does not crave for sensepleasures cause others to do so or approve of such craving
he takes an upward course and does not fall back into lower things
Abandoning hankering for the world he dwells with a mind freed from such hankering and his mind is purified of it
then a second
then a third
then a fourth
 extensive developed measureless free from hatred and illwill
free from hatred and illwill
Thus he remembers various past lives their conditions and details
free from hatred and illwill
Thus he remembers various past lives their conditions and details
he said to Nigrodha Reverend Nigrodha you said to me Come now householder do you know whom the ascetic Gotama talks to
So now that the Blessed Lord has come here why dont you baffle him with a single question and knock him over like an empty pot
the way you and your teachers do
it said that those who were Arahants fullyenlightened Buddhas did not indulge in loud talk
but sought lodging in the forestjust as the Blessed Lord does now
Let an intelligent man come to me who is sincere honest and straightforward and I will instruct him I will teach him Dhamma
in six years
five four three two years
seven months
six months five four three two months one month half a month
in seven days he can gain that goal
Or you may think He wants us to abandon our rules
Then the Lord said Every one of these foolish men is possessed by the evil one
Thus have I heard Once the Lord was styaing at Nalanda in Pavarikas mangogrove
And the Venerable Sariputta came to see the Lord saluted him sat down to one side
You have spoken boldly with a bulls voice Sariputta you have roared the lions roar of certainty
How is this Have all the Arahant Buddhas of the past appeared to you and were the minds of all those Lords open to you so as to say These Lords were of such virtue such was their teaching such their wisdom such their way such their liberation
No Lord
And have you perceived all the Arahant Buddhas who will appear in the future
No Lord
Well then Sariputta you know me as the Arahant Buddha and do you know The Lord is of such virtue such his teaching such his wisdom such his way such his liberation
No Lord
So Sariputta you do not have knowledge of the minds of the Buddhas of the past the future or the present
Then Sariputtahave you not spoken boldly with a bulls voice and roared the lions roar of certainty with your declaration 
Lord the minds of the Arahant Buddhas of the past future and present are not open to me
But I know the drift of the Dhamma
Lord it is as if there were a royal frontier city with mighty bastions and a mighty encircling wall in which was a single gate at which was a gatekeeper
And he constantly patrolling and following along a path might not see the joins and clefts in the bastion even such as a cat might creep through
But whatever larger creatures entered or left the city must all go through this very gate
And it seems to me Lord that the drift of the Dhamma is the same
All those Arahant Buddhas of the past attained to supreme enlightenment by abandoning the five hindrances defilements of mind which weaken understanding having firmly established the four foundations of mindfulness in their minds and realised the seven factors of enlightenment as they really are
All the Arahant Buddhas of the future will do likewise
So I came once to the Blessed Lord to listen to Dhamma
And the Blessed Lord taught me Dhamma most excellently and perfectly contrasting the dark with the light
And as he did so I gained insight into that Dhamma and from among the various things I established one in particular which was serene confidence in the Teacher that the Blessed Lord is a fullyenlightened Buddha that the Dhamma is well taught by the Blessed Lord and that the order of monks is welltrained
Also lord the Blessed Lords way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the wholesome factors is unsurpassed

And however much one declares it is so and not otherwise
That is the first way
Or one tells not by a visible sign
Or one tells not by a sound uttered
Or one tells not by any of these means when one has attained a state of mental concentration without thinking and pondering
And however much one declares it is so and not otherwise
That is the fourth way
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the telling of thoughts in four ways
Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lords way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the attainment of vision
Here some ascetic or Brahmin by means of ardour endeavour application vigilance and due attention reaches such a level of concentration that he considers just this body  upwards from the soles of the feet and downwards from the crown of the head enclosed by the skin and full of manifold impurities In this body there are headhairs bodyhairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bonemarrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs mesentery bowels stomach excrement bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears tallow saliva snot synovic fluid urine 
Again having done this and gone further he contemplates the bones covered with skin flesh and blood

In this way he remembers the details of his various past lives
The self and the world are eternal barren steady as a mountainpeak rooted like a pillar
Beings run on transmigrate pass away and rearise yet these persist eternally
Again some ascetic or Brahmin recalls various existences
Again some ascetic or Brahmin recalls various existence
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the doctrine of Eternalism
Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lords way of teaching Dhamma in regard to past lives
Here some ascetic or Brahmin recalls various past existences 
In this way he remembers the details of his various past lives
There are devas whose lifespan is not to be reckoned by counting or computation
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to remembrance of past lives
Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lords way of teaching Dhamma in regard to knowledge of the death and rebirth of beings
Here some ascetic or Brahmin attains to such concentration of mind that he sees with the divine eye purified and surpassing that of humans beings passing away and arising base and noble wellfavoured and illfavoured to happy and unhappy destinations as kamma directs them and he knows These beings on account of misconduct of body speech or thought or disparaging the Noble Ones have wrong view and will suffer the kammic fate of wrong view
At the breakingup of the body after death they are reborn in a lower world a bad destination a state of suffering hell
But these beings on account of good conduct of body speech or thought of praising the Noble Ones have right view and will reap the kammic reward of right view
At the breakingup of the body after death they are reborn in a good destination a heavenly world
Thus with the divine eye purified and surpassing that of humans he sees beings passing away and rearising
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to knowledge of the death and birth of beings
Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lords way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the supernormal powers
These are of two kinds There is the kind that is bound up with the corruptions and with attachment which is called unAriyan
What is the unAriyan supernormal power
Here some ascetic or Brahmin enjoys various supernormal powers
That is the unAriyan supernormal power
And what is the Ariyan supernormal power
Here a monk if he wishes Let me abide with the disgusting not feeling disgust can so abide
That is the Ariyan supernormal power that is free of the corruptions and not bound up with attachment
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the supernormal powers
This the Blessed Lord fully comprehends and beyond it lies nothing further to be comprehended and in such understanding there is no other ascetic or Brahmin who is greater or more enlightened than the Blessed Lord as regards the supernormal powers
Whatever Lord it is possible for a clansman endowed with confidence to achieve by putting forth effort and by persistence by human effort human exertion and human endurance that the Blessed Lord has achieved
For the Blessed Lord gives himself up neither to the pleasures of the senses which are base vulgar for worldlings and not for the Noble and unprofitable nor to selftorment which is painful ignoble and unprofitable
Lord if I were asked Well now friend Sariputta have there ever been in the past any ascetics and Brahmins more exalted in enlightenment than the Blessed Lord  I should say No
If asked Will there be any such in the future  I should say No
If asked Is there any such at present  I should say No
Again if I were asked Have there been any such in the past equal in enlightenment to the Blessed Lord  I should say Yes
If asked Will there be any such in the future  I should say Yes
But if I were asked Are there any such at present equal in enlightenment to the Blessed Lord  I should say No
And if I were then asked Venerable Sariputta why do you accord this highest recognition to one and not the other  I should say I have heard and received it from the Blessed Lords own lips There have been in the past
I have also heard and received it from the Blessed Lords own lips that it is not possible it cannot be that in one and the same worldsystem two Arahant supreme Buddhas should arise simultaneously No such situation can exist
Lord if I were to reply thus to such questions would I be speaking in conformity with the Blessed Lords word and not misrepresenting him by departing from the truth Would I be explaining Dhamma correctly so that no fellowfollower of the Dhamma could contest it or find occasion for censure 
Certainly Sariputta if you answered like this you would not misrepresent me you would be explaining Dhamma correctly and not laying yourself open to censure
At this the Venerable Udayi said to the Lord It is wonderful Lord it is marvellous how content the Blessed Lord is how satisfied and restrained
If the wanderers professing other doctrines were able to discern in themselves even one of such qualities they would proclaim it with a banner
It is wonderful
Well then Udayi just observe
If such wanderers were able to discern in themselves even one of such qualities they would proclaim it with a banner
But the Tathagata is content
Then the Lord said to Sariputta And therefore you Sariputta should frequently speak about this matter to monks and nuns to male and female layfollowers
And any foolish people who have doubts or queries about the Tathagata will by listening to such talk have their doubts and queries resolved
This was how the Venerable Sariputta proclaimed his confidence in the Lord
And so one name for this exposition is The Serene Faith
and said It is clear to me Lord that there never has been never will be and is not now another ascetic or Brahmin who is better or more enlightened than the Lord
wise skilled and clever who kept out strangers and let in those he knew
and you Lord who are now the Arahant fullyenlightened Buddha have done the same
Since this commentary will be clearer if we first examine the grounds on which the Exalted One delivers a sutta we will deal with this matter first
 There are four grounds for the delivery of a sutta personal inclination  the inclination of others  the proposal of a question  and the occurrence of a special incident 
Among these those suttas which the Exalted One declares entirely through his own inclination without being requested by others have personal inclination as the ground for their delivery
Some examples of this class are the Akankheyya Sutta  the Vattha Sutta  the Mahasatipatthana Sutta  the Mahasalayatanavibhanga Sutta  the Ariyavamsa Sutta  and many suttas on the right endeavours the bases of spiritual success the faculties powers factors of enlightenment and factors of the path
Those suttas which he declares by reason of the inclinations of others after discerning their inclination acquiescence state of mind aspiration and capacity for understanding have the inclinations of others as the ground for their delivery An instance is the case of Rahula when the Exalted One perceiving that the factors maturing towards emancipation had reached maturity in Rahula thought Let me now lead Rahula to the destruction of the cankers
Some suttas of this class are the Ciilarahula Sutta  the Maharahula Sutta  the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta  and the Dhatuvibhanga Sutta 
When the four assemblies the four classes nagas supannas gandhabbas asuras yakkhas the gods of the sense sphere heavens and Mahabrahmas approach the Exalted One and ask questions about the factors of enlightenment
those suttas have the proposal of a question as the ground for their delivery To this class belong numerous suttas of the Samyuttanikaya and the Sakkapanha  Culavedalla  Mahavedalla  Samannaphala  and other suttas
And those suttas declared because a special incident has occurred
Examples are the Dhammadayada  Culasihanada  the Candupama Puttamamsupama Darakkhandhupama Aggikkhandhupama Phenapindupama and Paricchattakupama Suttas
Of these four this sutta has the occurrence of a special incident as the ground for its delivery
And what was that incident
The arising of conceit on account of learning
For it is told five hundred brahmins who were masters of the three Vedas heard the Exalted One teaching the Dhamma and recognizing the danger in sense pleasures and the benefit in renunciation went forth into homelessness in his presence In no long time they mastered the entire word of the Buddha and on account of their learning gave rise to conceit Whatever the Exalted One says they thought that we quickly understand The Exalted One does not say anything which does not come within scope of the three genders the four kinds of terms and the seven declensions Thus there is nothing in what he says that presents a knotty problem to us
As a result they neglected to show proper reverence for the Exalted One rarely going to attend upon him or to listen to him teach the Dhamma
The Exalted One understood the course their minds were taking and aware that it would not be possible for them to realize the path or the fruit so long as the pillar of conceit was not uprooted from their minds he made their conceit the occasion for the delivery of a sutta Skillful in teaching he undertook this teaching on  the exposition of the root of all dhammas for the purpose of shattering their conceit
Of all means without exception 
For the word all expresses the lack of an exception
The word dhamma is found used in the following senses the scriptures  the Truths  concentration  wisdom  nature  things endowed with a specific nature  emptiness  merit  a disciplinary offense  the knowable  etc
He saw the Dhamma understood the Dhamma in the sense of the Truths
Those Exalted Ones were of such dhammas concentration
Truth dhamma fortitude generosity 
Of a nature to be born of a nature to grow old of a nature to die nature
Wholesome dhammas  things endowed with a specific nature
On that occasion there are dhammas emptiness
Dhamma well practised issues in bliss merit
Two dhammas are unfixed a disciplinary offense
And in the passage All dhammas in all their modes enter the threshold of the Exalted Ones portal of knowledge it is the knowable
Here the word occurs in the sense of things endowed with a specific nature
This is the wordmeaning They hear their own characteristics thus they are dhammas 
The word root 
The word pariyaya occurs in the texts in the sense of teaching 
Here it has the meaning of teaching and cause
Thus the phrase the exposition of the root of all dhammas signifies the cause designated the particular rootcause of all dhammas or the teaching of the cause of all dhammas 
But this sutta has to be carefully interpreted It is not all specific natured dhammas of the four planes that is indicated by the words all dhammas
but only all dhammas pertaining to the three planes included in personality  This here is the purport
Herein he is uninstructed needs to be taught because he possesses neither learning nor spiritual achievement 
For he who possesses neither the learning running counter to the activity of conceiving because he has neglected to study question and discriminate the aggregates elements sense bases truths law of conditionality and foundations of mindfulness etc nor spiritual achievements because he has failed to achieve what should be achieved by practice is said to be  uninstructed  on account of his deficiency in learning and spiritual achievement
He is one who needs to be taught
He is
The worldling is socalled because he generates a multitude of diverse defilements etc
As it is said  They generate a multitude of defilements hence they are worldlings They have not destroyed the multiple forms of personalityview they look up to a multitude of teachers they have not emerged from the multitude of destinations they form multiple kammaformations they are swept away by a multitude of floods afflicted by a multitude of afflictions consumed by a multitude of fevers hence they are worldlings They are lustful and greedy for the five multiple strands of sense pleasure therein they are bourd infatuated addicted attached fastened and confinedhence they are worldlings They are obstructed hindered and enveloped by the five multiple hindrances there they are enclosed concealed and incarceratedhence they are worldlings 
Again one who is included among the incalculable multitude of people who live according to an inferior doctrine and are averse to the doctrine of the ariyans is called a worldling
And a person distinct or remote from the ariyans endowed with such noble qualities as virtue learning etc is called a worldling
Between the two types of worldlings mentioned in the following verse it is the blind worldling who is called the uninstructed worldling
The Enlightened One the kinsman of the sun Speaks of the worldling in a twofold way
One is the worldling blinded by darkness The other the worldling noble and good
The ariyans are socalled because they are remote from the defilements because they are not heading towards decline because they are heading towards growth and because they are worthy of being honoured by the world together with its gods  Buddhas paccekabuddhas and disciples of the Buddhas are called ariyans Or the Buddhas alone are called ariyans here
while the phrase the good men applies to paccekabuddhas and disciples as well
Men who shine through their possession of supramundane qualities are called good men 
Or both words apply to all three
Now he who by nature has no regard for the ariyans and does not welcome their sight is one  who is without regard for the ariyans
This type of man is of two kinds he who does not see them with the eye and he who does not see them with knowledge And here it is not seeing them with knowledge that is intended
For even though they be seen with the fleshly eye or with the divine eye they are still unseen
Though Sona Sigala and others saw ariyans with their eyes
Here is a story to illustrate this A cankerless elder had a personal attendant who had become a monk in old age One day after the two had walked for alms while following the elder carrying the latters bowl and outer robe the attendant asked Venerable sir the ariyans what are they like
The elder replied  Here there is an old man walking together with an ariyan doing his duties towards him carrying his bowl and robe yet even he does not know what the ariyans are like So difficult to know are the ariyans friend
And though this was said still the attendant didnt get the point
Thence it is not seeing with the eyes that is meant by the phrase regard  but seeing with knowledge
As it is said What is your purpose Vakkali in seeing this foul body He who sees the Dhamma Vakkali he sees me 
Therefore even though one sees the ariyans with ones eyes so long as one does not see the characteristics of impermanence seen by the ariyans and does not achieve the Dhamma achieved by the ariyans for so long the ariyan state and the dhammas constituting an ariyan remain unseen and one is described as a person  without regard for the ariyans
That is without skill in the ariyan Dhamma classified into the foundations of mindfulness etc
Because he lacks in all of this Hes said to be undisciplined
This discipline is twofold the discipline of restraint and the discipline of abandoning 
And each part of this twofold discipline is again divided into five
The discipline of restraint is fivefold as restraint by virtue  by mindfulness  by knowledge  by patience  and by energy 
He guards the faculty of the eye he acquires restraint over the faculty uf the eye this is restraint by mindfulness
Those streams which flow throughout the world Ajita said the Lord
He patiently endures cold and heat  this is restraint by patience
 He does not tolerate an arisen thought of sensual desire he abandons it  this is restraint by energy
This entire fivefold restraint is called  restraint  and discipline  because it respectively restrains and disciplines any bodily misconduct which should be restrained and disciplined
Thus the discipline of restraint is classified as fivefold
Thus personalityview is abandoned by the defining of mentalitymateriality the views of acausality and wrong causal relationships by the discernment of conditions uncertainty in regard to this by the subsequent transcending of doubts the assumption of  I  and  mine  by the insightcomprehension of groups the perception of the path in what is not the path by the discrimination of the path from what is not the path annihilationism by the perception of arising eternalism by the perception of fall the perception of fearlessness in the fearful by the perception of fear the perception of satisfaction by the perception of unsatisfactoriness the perception of delight by the contemplation of disenchantment the nondesire for release by the knowledge desiring release nonequanimity by the knowledge of equanimity running contrary to the structure of dhammas and to nibbana by conformityknowledge and the assumption of the sign of formations by changeoflineage  This is called  abandoning by factorsubstitution
Abandoning by suppression is the abandonment of the hindrances etc by the obstructive power of concentration either at the level of access or absorption  This is likened to preventing the growth of watermoss by striking the surface of the water with a pot
Abandoning by eradication is the abandonment of the flock of defilements by completely severing the possibility of their occurrence It is achieved through the development of the four supramundane paths and occurs in the individual mentalcontinua of the four individuals attaining to these paths
The subsiding of the defilements at the four moments of fruition is the abandoning by subsiding
Nibbana in which all that is conditioned is abandoned by the escape from all that is conditioned is the abandoning by escape
Since this entire fivefold abandoning is abandoning in the sense of giving up  and discipline in the sense of disciplining it is called the discipline of abandoning
Or else it is called the discipline of abandoning because whatever is abandoned is also disciplined
Thus this discipline of abandoning is classified as fivefold
Because his restraint is repeatedly disrupted and because he has not abandoned what should be abandoned the uninstructed worldling lacks this discipline that is described briefly as twofold and in detail as tenfold And lacking it he is said to be  undisciplined
The same method applies to the corresponding statements in terms of the good men
As it is said  Those who are ariyans are also good men
and those who are good men are also ariyans
In order to show this topic by means of a teaching which has a dhamma as subject and an individual as term of expression
For the teaching of the Buddha is of four kinds a teaching which has dhammas as subject and dhammas as terms of expression  a teaching which has individuals as subject and dhammas as terrms of expression  a teaching which has individuals as subject and individuals as terms of expression  and a teaching which has dhammas as subject and individuals as terms of expression 
Therein There are bhikkhus these three feelings
What are the three
Pleasant feeling painful feeling and neither pleasant nor painful feeling
This person consists of six elements six bases of contact eighteen mental rangings and four determinations  this is a teaching which has individuals as subject and dhammas as terms of expression
 There are bhikkhus three kinds of individuals existing in the world
What are the three
The blind the oneeyed and the twoeyed
And What bhikkhus is the fear of a bad destination
Herein bhikkhus someone reflects  The result of bodily misconduct in the life to come is evil
In the present case since the worldling consists of the bases which have not been fully understood  and the conceiving which is the root of all the dhammas intended here is itself rooted in lack of full understanding  therefore he describes the worldling first for when he is introduced the meaning will be made clear through a teaching which has individuals as terms of expression
hindrances
clingingaggregates
the best treasure of man and so on
and the Exalted One speaks a sutta in reply
 these have the occurrence of a special incident as the ground for their pronouncement
since it was delivered by the Exalted One on account of the occurrence of a special incident
and signifies the lack of an exception in whatever term it comes into connection with
In the passage Herein a bhikkhu masters the Dhamma the suttas songs etc  it occurs in the sense of the scriptures
wisdom
here means particular root cause 
cause 
and turn 
called a worldling for such reasons As that he generates a multitude of things
Because he is immersed in the herd And because he is a man who is distinct
that is Buddhas paccekabuddhas and disciples are all both ariyans and good men
for these eyes apprehend only the outer appearance of the ariyans not their interior ariyan state
they were not seers of the ariyans
Here
The discipline is first twofold Each part again divides by five
Therein He is endowed perfectly endowed with this restraint of the Patimokkha  this is restraint by virtue
Mindfulness serves to curb them in
This I call the restraint of the streams
But wisdom only turns them off 
this indicates restraint by knowledge
The discipline of abandoning is also fivefold as abandoning by factorsubstitution  by suppression  by eradication  by subsiding  and by escape 
Among these the abandoning by factor substitution is the abandoning of a negative factor by the class of insightknowledge opposed to it in the same way that darkness is abandoned when a lamp is lit
for there is no difference in meaning
Whether the ariyans is said or the good men the Dhamma of the ariyans or the Dhamma of the good men the discipline of the ariyans  or  the discipline of the good men these are one identical the same equivalents interchangeable terms
Why does the Exalted One after announcing I will teach you bhikkhus the exposition of the root of all dhammas proceed to describe the worldling without even teaching the exposition of the root
 this is a teaching which has dhammas as subject and dhammas as terms of expression
 this is a teaching which has individuals as subject and individuals as terms of expression
 this is a teaching which has dhammas as subject and individuals as terms of expression
that is to say the four foundations of mindfulness the four right efforts the four roads to power the five spiritual faculties the five mental powers the seven factors of enlightenment the Noble Eightfold Path
By these a monk through the destruction of the corruptions cay in this very life by his own superknowledge realise and attain the corruptionfree liberation of heart and liberation by wisdom and abide therein
HE PERCEIVES EARTH AS EARTH Having thus described the worldling the Master goes on to show his manner of conceiving the bases such as earth etc which is the generative source of all the dhammas included in personality
Therein earth is fourfold characteristicearth  composite earth  objectified earth  and earth as conventional designations 
In the passage What friends is the internal earth element
That which is internal belonging to oneself hard solid  this is characteristicearth
In the passage  If he should dig the earth or cause the earth to be dug this is composite earth
The twenty parts of the body beginning with headhairs etc and the external elements such as iron and copper are also included in composite earth
For composite earth consists of earth together with its accompanying material dhammas such as colour etc 
somebody who obtains jhana with the earthkasina as basis and is reborn in the world of the gods gains the name  earth deity  after his means of arriving at such a state
All these meanings of the word  earth  are relevant to the present context
For whatsoever instance among these four kinds of earth the worldling perceives as earth he perceives  it is earth  he perceives as a segment of earth  he perceives through a perversion of perception seizing upon the conventional expression it is earth  
Or without releasing this segment of earth he perceives it as a being or as belonging to a being
Why does he perceive it in this way This should not be asked
for like a madman the worldling
Or else the reason is that he has no regard for the ariyans etc
HAVING PERCEIVED EARTH AS EARTH Having perceived earth with a perverted perception the worldling afterwards conceives it ie construes or discriminates it through the gross proliferating tendencies of craving conceit and views which are here called conceivings  This accords with the statement Concepts due to proliferation are grounded upon perception  He apprehends it in diverse ways contrary 
Thence it is said  He conceives earth
To show the ways in which he conceives it by a gross method the twenty parts of the body such as headhairs bodyhairs etc may be mentioned as internal earth  The external earth may be understood through
the passage in the Vibhanga  What is the external earth element
Whatever is external and is hard solid hardness the state of being hard exterior not kammically acquired such as
iron copper tin lead silver pearl gem cats eye shell stone coral silver coin gold ruby variegated precious stone grass wood gravel potsherd earth rock mountain 
The earthsign in the triad of internal objects may also be included  This is the interpretation of the meaning
HE CONCEIVES EARTH Through the three conceivings he conceives  I am earth earth is mine  another is earth earth belongs to another Or else he conceives internal earth through the conceiving of craving through the conceiving of conceit and through the conceiving of views Or alternatively he conceives internal earth by the conceiving of craving through the conceiving of conceit and through the conceiving of views
How
He arouses desire and lust for the headhairs etc he relishes them delights in them welcomes them and remains cleaving to them
And so too for the bodyhairs nails teeth skin or any other stimulating object
Thus he conceives internal earth by the conceiving of craving
Let my head hairs etc be thus in the future
Let my bodyhairs be thus  etc Or he yearns for them with delight 
Or resolving his mind on the acquisition of what he has not obtained he thinks  By this virtue  or by this holy life may I have moist soft delicate blueblack hair etc
Again on account of the beauty or ugliness of his own head hairs etc he arouses conceit  I am superior  or  I am equal  or I am inferior
Thus he conceives internal earth through the conceiving of conceit
He adheres to the headhairs etc as a soul  according to the method that has come down The soul and the body are the same thus he conceives internal earth through the conceiving of views
Or else in direct contrast to the method given in the suttas   The internal earth element and the external earth element are only the earth element This is not mine  he adheres to the earth element in the headhairs etc as  This is mine this am I this is my self
In this way too he conceives internal earth through the conceiving of views
Thus he conceives internal earth through the three conceivings
As the internal so the external
How
He arouses desire and lust for iron copper etc
Thinking  iron is mine copper is mine he takes possession of them  guards them and keeps watch over them Thus he conceives external earth through the conceiving of craving
Again on account of the beauty or ugliness of his own iron or copper possessions etc he arouses conceit  I am superior  or  I am equal  or  I am inferior Thus he conceives external earth through the conceiving of conceit
Then perceiving a soul in iron he adheres to iron as a soul
Or else  Herein someone considers the earthkasina as the self thinking
The earthkasina is I I am the earthkasina 
In this way too he conceives external earth through the conceiving of views
Thus he conceives external earth through the three conceivings
In this way the statement he conceives earth is to be interpreted in terms of the three conceivings
The remainder we will discuss only in brief
HE CONCEIVES IN EARTH Here in earth is the locative case
Therefore he conceives  I am in earth he conceives  There is an obstruction  an impediment  for me in earth he conceives Another is in earth he conceives There is an obstruction an impediment for another in earth This is the meaning here
Or alternatively this statement may be interpreted according to the following method  How does one consider the self to be in material form
Here someone regards feeling perception the mental formations and consciousness as the self and thinks This self of mine in material form Thus he regards the self as in material form  In this way assuming feeling etc to be the self he misconstrues some instance of earth either internal or external to be the locus for this self Conceiving  This self of mine is in earth he conceives in earth This is the way he conceives through views
The conceiving of craving and conceit should be understood as the affection he arouses for this self of his and the conceit based upon it
When in this same way he conceives the self of another to be in earth this is the conceiving of views
But the other types of conceiving are also recognized
HE CONCEIVES FROM EARTH Here  from earth  is the ablative case
Therefore he conceives from earth should be understood to mean that he conceives himself or another together with their accessories to originate or to emanate from earth or he conceives the self to be other than the earth  This is his conceiving of views
The conceivings of craving and conceit can be understood as the affection and conceit he arouses in regard to the base conceived with the conceiving of views
Others take the phrase  he conceives from earth  to mean that after developing meditation upon a limited earthkasina he assumes the existence of an immeasurable self which is different from the kasina object and conceives  my self is external to earth
HE CONCEIVES EARTH IS MINE Here he lays claim to the entire great earth by way of craving thus in this case only one conceiving the conceiving of craving is relevant
This interpretation applies to all instances of earth internal and external divided according to the aforesaid classification eg  headhairs are mine bodyhairs are mine iron is mine copper is mine
HE DELIGHTS IN EARTH He delights in earth with its aforementioned classifications he relishes it clings to it
If this meaning has already been shown by the statement  he conceives earth why is it here said  he delights in earth 
This has not been explained by the ancients 
For the Exalted One has fully penetrated that element of Dhamma which when fully penetrated confers elegance in teaching through diverse and variegated methods
Therefore after first showing the origination of defilements by way of conceiving he now shows the same thing by way of delighting as an example of his elegance in teaching
Or  For one who conceives earth conceives in earth conceives from earth conceives earth is mine is not able to abandon the craving or views founded upon earth therefore he also delights in earth
But he who delights in earth delights in suffering  and suffering is the danger he says this in order to point out the danger
For the Exalted One has said  Bhikkhus he who delights in the earth element delights in suffering He who delights in suffering I declare is not released from suffering 
WHAT IS THE REASON BECAUSE IT HAS NOT BEEN FULLY UNDERSTOOD BY HIM I DECLARE Having thus shown the worldlings conceiving and delight based upon earth with these words the Master reveals the reason why the worldling conceives and delights in earth
This is the meaningIf it is asked For what reason does the worldling conceive earth Why does he conceive and delight in earth
the answer is  because it has not been fully understood by him ie because he has not fully understood the base
He who fully understands the earth understands it by the three types of full understanding the full understanding of the known  the full understanding of scrutinization  and the full understanding of abandoning 
Therein what is the full understanding of the known
He fully understands the earth element thus  This is the internal earth element this the external earth element This is its characteristic this its function manifestation and proximate cause This is full understanding of the known
What is the full understanding by scrutinization
Having known it in this way he scrutinizes the earth element in fortytwo modes as impermanent suffering a sickness etc  This is full understanding by scrutinization
What is the fall understanding by abandoning
Having scrutinized it in this way he abandons desire and lust for the earth element through the supreme path  This is full understanding by abandoning
Or alternatively the defining of mentalitymateriality is the full understanding of the known
He who fully understands earth undetstands it by these three full understandings But for the worldling there is no such full understanding Therefore due to his lack of full understanding he conceives earth and delights in it
Someone perceives the earthkasina here the objectified earth is the earthkasina also called the earthsign 
 Earth as conventional designation
seizes upon anything he can in whatever way he can
or as the Exalted One will say later on because it has not been fully understood by him
Thus in this way he conceives internal earth through the conceiving of craving
he relishes them delights in them welcomes them and remains cleaving to them
the same method in regard to copper etc
Thus he conceives external earth by the conceiving of views
he considers the earthkasina and the self as nondual   he interprets the earthsign as a self according to the method given in the Patisambhidamagga 
but I offer my own opinion as a display of elegance of teaching or in order to point out the danger 
the insight comprehension of the groups as far as conformity knowledge is the full understanding by scrutinization
and the knowledge of the ariyan path is the full understanding by abandoning
in four ways
thus one descends into the mothers womb unknowing stays there unknowing and leaves it unknowing
in four ways
but through hearing a sound made by humans nonhumans or devas 
That is the second way
but by applying ones mind and attending to something conveyed by Sound
That is the third way
by divining anothers thoughts in ones mind and one says As far as soandsos mindforce is directed
so his thoughts will turn to that thing
Water as water  Water like earth is fourfold characteristic composite objectified and conventional designation
Among these  What is the internal waterelement
That which is internal belonging to oneself water liquidity moisture moistness the internal coherence factor of matter kammically acquired etc  characteristicwater is explained thus 
Taking up the water kasina he apprehends the sign in water this is composite water
The rest is the same as in the case of earth
But by way of interpretation the internal water element is given with the twelve items beginning thus Bile phlegm etc  The external water element should be understood thus  What is the external water element
That which is external water liquidity moisture moistness the external coherence factor of matter not kammically acquired
such as the sap of roots the sap of tree trunks the sap of bark the juice of leaves fruit juice milk curd ghee butter oil honey molasses and waters in the earth or atmosphere  The watersign in the triad of internal objects is also included
 Fire as fire  In the section on fire the detailed account should be understood according to the aforementioned method
But by way of interpretation the internal fire element is stated in terms of a fourfold division thus  That by which one is warmed by which one ages by which one is heated and by which whatever is eaten drunk chewed and tasted gets fully digested 
 What is the external fire element
That which is external fire fiery heat hotness warmth warmness external not kammically acquired
Air as air  The same method as above applies in this section on air but by way of interpretation the internal air element is stated thus Winds moving upwards winds moving downwards winds residing in the bowels winds residing in die abdomen winds moving along in all the limbs sharp winds cutting winds rending winds inhalation exhalation  
 What is the external air element
That which is external air airy the external oscillation of matter not kammically acquired
The rest by the aforesaid method
This is the conveyancemode of the characteristic  defined in the Nettippakarana By this principle when the four primary elements are mentioned derivative materiality is implied along with them since it shares the characteristic of material form
The primaries together with derivative materiality make up the aggregate of material form
Therefore the assertion that the uninstructed worldling conceives earth water fire and air signifies that he regards material form as the self
The assertion that he conceives in earth in air signifies that he regards the self to be in material form
The assertion that he conceives from earth from air which implies the self to be other than material form signifies that he regards the self to be possessed of material form or material form to be in the self
These are the four conceivings of personalityview based upon materiality
These reduce to only two views one is the annihilationist view  three are the eternalist view  This distinction should be understood
such as a log fire a splint fire a grass fire a cowdung fire a husk fire a rubbish fire lightning  the heat of a fire the heat of the sun the heat from an accumulation of logs the heat from an accumulation of grass grain and wares  The external fire element should be understood thus 
such as the easterly winds the westerly winds northerly winds southerly winds cold winds hot winds gentle winds strong winds black winds highaltitude winds wing winds supaIJJa winds winds from a palmleaf winds from a fan  The external air element should be understood thus 
When one idea is mentioned all Ideas of like characteristic
Are mentioned too this constitutes The Mode Conveying Characteristics
HE PERCEIVES BEINGS AS BEINGS  Since the worldling arouses conceivings towards the beings who are discerned by reference to formations  as well as towards formations themselves after having explained the conceiving based on formations under the heading of material form the Exalted One sets out to expound these living beings beginning with the above words
Therein the word being is found in the following senses the five aggregates  nonhumans  elements  existing  the cankerless saint  living beings  trees  etc
Whatever beings are here assembled  here it is nonhumans
The four primary elements are the cause here it is the elements
If a fact an offence requiring expiation  here existing
 The being who swallows time here the cankerless saint
All beings lay down the body in the world here living beings
The destruction of plant life  here trees
In the present case the meaning of living beings applies But not without a distinction
for here beings signifies only living beings below the heaven of the Four Great Kings 
Therein  he perceives beings as beings the method has been stated
How
 He sees a householder or a householders son supplied and furnished with the five strands of sense pleasure having apprehended beings in this way he takes hold of the notion that  beings are beautiful  or  beings are happy  and becomes attached Having seen them having heard smelled tasted touched cognized them he becomes attached
thus he conceives beings through the conceiving of craving
Or resolving his mind on the acquisition of what he has not obtained he thinks O that I may be reborn in the company of great wealthy Khattiyas etc  Thus too he conceives beings through the conceiving of craving
When depending on his excellence or deficiency in relation to other beings he ranks himself as superior to others
As it is said  Herein someone on account of birth or an a certain ground previously ranked himself as equal to others
at a later time he ranks himself as superior
and others as inferior Such a kind of conceit is called arrogance  
When he conceives beings thus  Beings are permanent stable eternal not subject to change or All living beings all creatures all beings all souls are without power without strength without energy evolving in the grip of fate chance or nature experiencing pleasure and pain in the six classes  this is the conceiving of views
In this way he conceives beings through the three conceivings
How does he conceive himself in beings 
When he wishes for his own rebirth or attainment of happiness among such and such beings
Or when he gives a gift undertakes precepts or observes the Uposatha  wishing for rebirth among those beings 
When having apprehended beings in terms of an aggregation  he ranks some beings as superior some as equal some as inferior 
So too he conceives some beings as permanent and stable
He conceives from beings  he conceives from beings when he conceives himself or others together with their accessories to originate from some being this is his conceiving of views
When he arouses affection and conceit for the base conceived through the conceiving of views these are his conceivings ofcraving and conceit
 He conceives  beings are mine   here the conceiving of craving is alone relevant
This occurs when he lays claim to beings thus  My sons my daughters my goats and sheep my poultry and swine my elephants cattle horses and mares
He delights in beings  the method has been stated 
Because they have not been fully understood by him   the beings are not fully understood because he has not fully understood the formations by reference to which beings are discerned
The interpretation should be made by the method stated
Having shown in brief the bases of conceiving by way of formations and living beings with the words gods as gods the Exalted One sets out to show the same thing in detailed classification according to the division of planes
Therein they revel in the five strands of sense pleasure or in their own psychic powers thus they are called gods  they play or they shine is the meaning
There are three kinds of gods gods by convention  gods by rebirth  and gods by purification 
Gods by convention are kings queens and princes
Gods by rebirth are the gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings and the higher heavenly worlds
And gods by purifiation are arahants cankerless saints
Here gods by rebirth are meant But not without a distinction
for Mara and his retinue in the Paranimmitavasavatti heavenly world are excepted only the remaining gods in the remaining six sense sphere heavenly worlds are intended
The entire explanation of the meaning should be understood in the way set forth in the section on beings
 Pajapati  here Pajapati is Mara
Some say that this is a designation for the great kings etc who are overlords in the various groups of gods
but the Great Commentary  rejects this as incorrect for these are already included under the category of gods Mara alone is intended here by the word Pajapati for he is the overlord of this generation made up of living beings
Where does he reside
In the Paranimmita vasavatti heavenly world
Some say that the king of the Vasavattis exercises rule there
while Mara lives in one place wielding sovereignty over his own retinue like a rebel prince in a frontier corner of a kingdom
Here is the interpretation When he arouses desire after seeing or hearing that Pajapati is beautiful of longlife and abundant happiness then he conceives him through the conceiving of craving
When he resolves his mind on the acquisition of what he has not obtained thinking O that I may be reborn in the company of Pajapati in this way too he conceives Pajapati through the conceiving of craving
When after attaining the state of Pajapati he gives rise to the conceit  I am the ruler of creatures the overlord  he conceives Pajapati through the conceiving of conceit
Thinking  Pajapati is permanent and stable or Pajapati will he annihilated and destroyed or  Pajapati is without power without strength without energy evolving in the grip of fate chance or nature experiencing pleasure and pain in the six classes he conceives Pajapati through the conceiving of views
 In Pajapati  here the conceiving of views is alone applicable
someone conceives Those dhammas which are found in Pajapati are permanent stable eternal not subject to change
Or else he conceives There is no evil in Pajapati nor are any evil deeds found in him
 From Pajapati  here the three conceivings are relevant
How
Here someone conceives himself or another together with their accessories to originate or emanate from Pajapati this is his eonceiving of views
When he arouses affection and conceit for the base conceived through the conceiving of views these are his conceivings of craving and conceit
 Pajapati is mine  here the conceiving of craving is alone relevant
This occurs when he lays claim to Pajapati thus Pajapati is my master he is my lord
The rest by the method stated
Brahma as Brahma  he is magnified with distinguished qualities thus he is Brahma
Mahabrahma is called  Brahma  so too is the Tathagata brahmins mother and father and what is supreme
In the passage  Brahma of one thousand Brahma of two thousand   it is Mahabrahma
Brahma bhikkhus this is a designation for the Tathagata  here it is the Tathagata
Dispeller ofdarkness enlightened one universal eye
 Mother and father are called  Brahma  teachers of old 
He sets in motion the wheel of Brahma   here supreme
Here it is the Brahma who is first to be born and whose lifespan lasts for the aeon that is intended
The ministers of Brahma and the assembly of Brahma should also be included
 The gods of Streaming Radiance  a radiance streams forth  streams out  from their bodies like light from the flame of a torch penetrating further and further and descending thus they are gods of Streaming Radiance 
By mentioning these all beings occupying the plane of the second jhanathe gods of Limited Radiance  of Immeasurable Radiance  as well as of Streaming Radianceshould be included for all these occupy a single level
The gods of Refulgent Glory  they are covered with glory  bestrewn with glory their bodies are a single mass radiant and beautiful like a resplendid blazing piece of gold placed in a golden casket
the gods of Limited Glory  of Immeasurable Glory as well as of Refulgent Gloryshould be included for all these occupy a single level
The gods of Abundant Fruit 
these are Brahmas on the plane of the fourth jhana
They vanquish thus they are Vanquishers 
What do they vanquish
The four immaterial aggregates
This is a designation for the beings of the nonpercipient realm
The nonpercipient gods occupy one section of the same plane as the gods of Abundant Fruit where they remain in the same posture in which they are reborn throughout their lives all with similar material form resulting from the similarity of their productive kamma consciousness
Some say the Vanquishers are the thousand Brahmas who are overlords among the Brahmas
In the interpretation when he arouses desire and lust after hearing that the Vanquishers are beautiful and longlived then he conceives the Vanquishers through the conceiving of craving
When he resolves his mind on the acquisition of what he has not obtained thinking O that I may be reborn in the company of the Vanquishers in this way too he conceives the Vanquishers through the conceiving of craving
Ranking himself as inferior and the Vanquishers as superior he conceives them through the conceiving of conceit
Misapprehending the Vanquishers as permanent and stable he conceives them through the conceiving of views
The rest follows the method stated in the section on Pajāpati
In the passage  Do you see bhikkhus that this has come into being   it is the five aggregates
 He conceives beings  this and the following can be interpreted through the three conceivings
or as inferior
or as equal he conceives beings through the conceiving of conceit
he conceives in beings through the conceiving of craving
in this way too he conceives in beings through the conceiving of craving
he conceives in beings through the conceiving of conceit
some as impermanent and unstable or he conceives I too am a certain somebody among beings
thus he conceives in beings through the conceiving of views
The retinue of Mara should be understood as included along with Mara
It arises when
Gone to the worlds end transcending all existence
The cankerless released from all suffering
The bringer of truth honoured by Brahma 
here it is a brahmin
here mother and father
The explanation of the meaning should be understood by the method stated in the section on Pajapati
By mentioning these all beings occupying the plane of the third jhana
The interpretation of the meaning for these three sections is the same as the method in the section on beings
but this is incorrect since those are already included in the Brahma section
Discussing the heavenly worlds in succession the Exalted One shows the nonpercipient realm and then skips over the pure abodes in order to discuss the base of infinite space  The reason he omits the pure abodes is because his is an explanation of the round of existence  and the pure abodes pertain to the ending of the round  since they are inhabited exclusively by gods who are nonreturners and arahats
Or the reason is that the lifespan of these gods is only a few thousands of aeons and they only exist during the time when a Buddha has appeared in the world
But Buddhas sometimes do not appear for an incalculable number of aeons and during this time the plane of the pure abodes is empty
For the realm of the pure abodes belongs to the Buddhas like a campground to a king
For this reason they are not included in the stations of consciousness or the nine abodes of beings But these conceivings occur at all times
therefore the Buddha only speaks of the planes which always exist
The base of infinite space is the four aggregates based on this planethe wholesome  resultants  and inoperatives 
But here only the aggregates of those reborn on that plane are meant for this is a discussion delimiting the planes of existence
The same method in the case of the base of infinite consciousness etc
But here the conceiving of conceit should be interpreted according to the method of the section on Pajapati
The interpretation of the meaning in these four sections follows the method given in the section on the Vanquishers
Having thus shown the bases of conceiving in detail by classifying them into their distinct planes etc the Exalted One now shows all the dhammas of the three planes inluded in personality which function as the bases of conceiving by classifying them into a fourfold scheme as the seen heard sensed and cognized
Therein the seen  means what is seen by the fleshly eye and by the divine eye
This is a designation for the visible form base 
He conceives the seen  he conceives the seen with the three conceivings
How
Seeing the visible form base in terms of the perception of beauty and the perception of pleasure  he arouses desire and lust for it relishes it and delights in it
For this has been said by the Exalted One Beings become lustful bhikkhus over the form of a woman entranced infatuated intoxicated and fettered Coming under the sway of the form of a woman they sorrow for a long time 
Thus he conceives the seen with the conceiving ov craying
Or he thinks  May my body be thus in the future and brings delight to bear upon it or he gives alms yearning for the attainment of physical beauty and so on in detail
In these ways too he conceives the seen with the conceiving of craving
He arouses conceit on account of the excellence or deficiency of his own form in relation to anothers thinking
 I am superior to him or  I am equal or  I am inferior Thus he conceives the seen with the conceiving of conceit
He conceives the visible form base as permanent stable and eternal or as a self or the property of a self or as auspicious or inauspicious Thus he conceives the seen with the conceiving of views
In this way he conceives the seen with the three conceivings
How does he conceive himself  in the seen 
He conceives in the seen when he regards the self to be in visible form 
Or just as milk is in the mothers breast
This is his conceiving of views
The conceivings of craving and cenceit are the affection and conceit he arouses in regard to the base conceived by the conceiving of views
Thus he conceives in the seen
The remainder should be understood by the method stated in the section on earth
Lust etc are in visible form  he conceives in the seen when he thinks 
The heard  what is heard by the fleshy ear or by the divine ear This is a designation for the sound base 
The sensed  that which is apprehended by sensing ie by approach and contact What is meant is that it is cognized through the mutual adherence of the sense faculty and objects  This is a designation for the bases of odour flavour and touch 
The cognized  cognized with the mind This is a designation for the remaining seven sense bases or for the mental object 
But here only that which is included in personality is applicable
In detail these sections should be understood by the method used in the section on the seen
Having thus shown all personality distributed into four classes as the seen etc the Exalted One with the words unity and diversity  now shows the same as divided into two classes through a section on the attainer and on the nonattainer 
By the word unity he shows the attainer
This is the wordmeaning unityoneness 
The four immaterial aggregates pertain to the case of the attainer all five aggregates to the case of the nonattainer The interpretation can be made by the method of the Dispensation  thus He regards material form as the self etc or by the commentarial method given in the section on earth having determined by investigation which is appropriate
But some say that unity indicates the method of unity and diversity the method of diversity 
Others say the adherence to the views  the self is immutable after death and percipient of unity percipient of diversity is meant
Neither of these is correct for they arent intended here
Having thus shown all personality as twofold now collecting it together he shows the same thing again as singlefold with the words cc all as all 
This is the method of interpretation Relishing all  he conceives all through the conceiving of craving
Conceiving all as created by himself thus These beings have been created by me he conceives all with the conceiving of conceit
All is caused by past kamma All is created by God All is without cause without condition All exists All does not exist etcin these ways he conceives all through the conceiving of views
How does he conceive himself  in all
Here someone holds such a view  My self is great 
Imagining all the world to be the container for the self he conceives This self of mine is in all  This is his conceiving of views
His conceivings of craving and conceit are the affection he arouses for this self and the conceit based upon it respectively
The rest should be understood by the method given in the section on earth
Having shown all personality as singiefoid with the words  nibbana as nibbana  he shows the same as again singlefold by a different method
Here  nibbana   When this self furnished and supplied with the five strands of sense pleasure revels in them
Relishing this nibbana he conceives it with the conceiving of craving
Holding that which is in reality not nibbana to be nibbana and to be permanent etc he conceives nibbana through the conceiving of views
Taking his self to be other than nibbana conceiving  This is nibbana this the self This self of mine is in nibbana he conceives himself  in nibbana  This is his conceiving of views
The affection he arouses for this self and the conceit based on it are his conceivings of craving and of conceit respectively
This is the method he conceives himself apart  from nibbana 
The affection he arouses for this self and the conceit based upon it are his conceivings of craving and of conceit respectively
He conceives  nibbana is mine  thus O how blissful is my nibbana
The rest by the method stated
Here is the summing up verse
Because he does not understand The person as it really is
The worldling only generates Conceivings in the persongroup 
Though in truth foul and perishable Painful void of an inner lord 
The fool takes it in the opposite way Grasps hold of it through his conceivings
He contemplates the persongroup As beautiful and pleasurable
Plunging in through conceivings of craving Like a moth into a candle flame
Standing on ideas of permanence Extolling himself for his excellence
Like filth being poured into filth Conceivings of conceit arise
Like a madman his image in a glass The fool takes the self to be real
And so too property of this self These are his conceivings in terms of views
This that we have called  conceiving  Is the very subtle bondage of Mara
Flexible and difficult to break By this the worldling is held in thrall
Though struggling and striving with all his might He does not escape the round of births
But circles on like a leashbound dog Tied to a firmly planted post
This worldling attached to the persongroup Is constantly slain with vehement force
By the pains of birth disease and age By all the sufferings of the round
Therefore I say to you good sir Discern the person with sharp insight
As bound to pain an impure mass Subject to break up void of self
The sage perceiving as it is This the true nature of our being
Abandons all conceivings modes And from all suffering finds release
and by the word diversity the nonattainer
diversity manyness 
then it has attained to supreme nibbana here and now  should be understood as the five kinds of supreme nibbana here and now  which have come down in the passage beginning 
The conceit he arouses because of this nibbana when he thinks I have attained nibbanathis is the way he conceives nibbana through the conceiving of conceit
taking his self to be other than nibbana conceiving  This is nibbana this the self This self of mine comes from nibbiina it is other than nibbana he conceives himself apart from nibbana This is his conceiving of views
So far the Exalted One has shown the cognitive process of the worldling in regard to the bases such as earth etc which process becomes the root of all the dhammas included in personality Now with the words  A bhikkhu who is a learner he undertakes to show the cognitive process of the learner  as it occurs in regard to these same bases
In what sense is the learner called by this name
He is a learner because he has obtained the dhammas that make him a learner
For this is said  To what extent Lord is one a learner
 Here bhikkhu a bhikkhu is endowed with a learners right view a learners right concentration
To this extent a bhikkhu is a learner 
Moreover he learns  therefore he is a learner
For this is said  He learns bhikkhu thus he is called a learner
And what does he learn
He learns the higher virtue the higher consciousness and the higher wisdom He learns bhikkhu thus he is called a learner 
The nobleminded worldling who fulfils the practice in conformity  who is endowed with virtue restrained over the doors of the senses moderate in eating who applies himself to wakefulness and is devoted to the development of the constituents of enlightenment in the first and last watches of the night thinking  Today or tomorrow I will achieve one of the fruits of recluseship he too is called a learner because he learns
But in this place only the learner who has attained to penetration is meant not even the nobleminded worldling
Who has not attained his hearts ideal 
In the passage The heart is a snare that wanders about in midair  it means lust
Mind mentality mentation here mind
A learner who has not attained his hearts ideal here arahatship
In the present case arahatship is intended
Thus the meaning is  who has not attained arahatship
Security from bondage   security from the four bonds
Yearning  there are two yearnings the yearning of craving and the yearning of desire 
here is intended
The phrase means that he desires to attain security from bondage desires to achieve it he slants slopes and inclines to it as his goal
HE DIRECTLY KNOWS EARTH AS EARTH He directly knows earth in its nature as earth  unlike the worldling who perceives it with a completely perverted perception
Further he knows it with distinguished knowledge  What is meant is that resolving upon the earth in accordance with its real nature he knows it as impermanent suffering and nonself
He cannot be described either as one who conceives or as one who does not conceive
What is the purport
Because he has not abandoned any of the conceivings the worldling is described as one who conceives
The arahat who has abandoned them all is described as one who does not conceive
The learner has abandoned the conceiving of views and has diminished the others Therefore he cannot be described as one who conceives like the worldling nor can he be described as one who does not conceive like the arahat
IN ORDER THAT HE MAY FULLY UNDERSTAND IT The base of conceiving should be fully understood by the learner through the three full understandings for he has entered the course of rightness  and is bound for enlightenment Unlike the worldling he is not wholly lacking in full understanding and unlike the arahat he has not completed full understanding
the word manasa has the meanings of lust  mind  and arahatship
yearning as desire to do the wholesome 
LET HIM NOT CONCEIVE EARTH 
Having thus shown the cognitive process of the learner in regard to the bases such as earth etc with the words A bhikkhu who is an arahat the Exalted One next undertakes to show the cognitive process of the cankerless saint 
Therein arahat  one who is remote from the defilements  far from the defilements The meaning is one who has abandoned the defilements
As the Master says And how bhikkhus is a bhikkhu an arahat
He is remote from evil unwholesome dhammas from dhammas which are defiling leading to renewed existence disturbing bringing painful results conducing to birth ageing and death
Thus bhikkhus a bhikkhu is an arahat  A cankerless saint the four cankers are the canker of sensual desire the canker of desire for existence the canker of wrong views and the canker of ignorance For the arahat these four cankers are destroyed abandoned eradicated silenced consumed by the fire of knowledge so that they can no more arise again therefore he is called a cankerless saint
 Lived the holy life  he has lived in coresidence with his teacher dwelt in the ariyan path and abided in the ten ariyan abidings He has lived the life completed the course thus he is one who has lived the holy life Done what had to be done  in comparison to the nobleminded worldling the seven learners are doing what has to be done by the four paths For the cankerless saint all that should be done has been done and completed There is nothing further for him to do to achieve the destruction ofsuffering thus he has done what had to be done
For this is said
There is nothing to add to what he has done Nor does anything remain that he must do
Laid down the burden  there are three burdens the burden of the aggregates the burden of the defilements and the burden of kammaformations  For the arahat these three burdens have been laid down thrown down deposited cast down therefore he is called one who has laid down the burden
Attained his own goal 
For that is ones own goal ones personal goal in the sense that it is connected with oneself that it can never be abandoned by oneself and that it is ones supreme goal
Eliminated the fetters of existence  the ten fetters are the fetters of sensual lust aversion conceit views doubt clinging to rules and rituals lust for existence jealousy stinginess and ignorance
These are called fetters because they fetter  connect beings to the states of existence or because they fetter one existence to the next
These fetters of existence are eliminated by the arahat abandoned consumed by the fire of knowledge therefore he is called one who has eliminated the fetters of existence
Emancipated through final knowledge  what is meant by  final knowledge
He has known scrutinized investigated clarified and illuminated with knowledge perfectly as it really is the aggregates  meaning of aggregates the bases  meaning of bases the elements meaning of elements sufferings meaning of oppressing the origins meaning of source cessations meaning of peace the paths meaning of seeing or the division beginning thus All formations are impermanent etc
Since his mind is emancipated from all defilements the arahat is emancipated by the emancipation of mind
And since he is resolved upon nibbiina he is also emancipated in nibbana
Therefore he is called  emancipated by final knowledge
BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN FULLY UNDERSTOOD BY HIM The arahat has fully understood the bases of conceiving through the three kinds of full understanding
Therefore he neither conceives the base nor does he conceive the conceiving The remainder by the method stated
At the end of the nibbana section three additional sections are stated in terms of the destruction of lust hate and delusion
Each should be applied to each of the sections dealing with the bases beginning with earth
BECAUSE HE IS DEVOID OF LUST THROUGH THE DESTRUCTION OF LUST Those outside who are devoid of lust for sensual pleasures are not  devoid of lust through the destruction of lust
The arahat alone is Therefore it is said  Because he is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust
This method should also be applied to the cases of hate and delusion
Just as when it is said  because it has been fully understood by him the meaning is that because it has been fully understood he conceives neither the base nor the conceiving so here too because he is devoid of lust he conceives neither the base nor the conceiving
And here the section on full understanding is stated for the purpose of showing the fulfilment of the development of the path 
Or else the arahat does not conceive for two reasons because he has fully understood the base and because he has eradicated the unwholesome roots
Therefore the section on full understanding shows his full understanding of the base the others his eradication of the unwholesome roots
In the three latter sections the following distinction should be understood Having seen the danger in lust he dwelt in the contemplation of suffering became emancipated through the deliverance of the wishless  and is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust
Having seen the danger in hate he dwelt in the contemplation of impermanence became emancipated through the deliverance of the signless  and is devoid of hate through the destruction of hate
And having seen the danger in delusion he dwelt in the contemplation of nonself became emancipated through the deliverance of emptiness  and is devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion
If such is the case since no one becomes emancipated through three deliverances shouldnt two sections be omitted No
Why
Because there is no specification
For it was said a bhikkhu who is an arahat without specification
It was not said that he is emencipated by the wishless deliverance or by either of the other two therefore all that is appropriate for the arahat should be mentioned
Or else without distinction whoever is an arahat by fully understanding the suffering in change  becomes devoid of lust through the destruction of lust by fully understanding the suffering in painful feeling  becomes devoid of hate through the destruction of hate
Or by fully understanding a desirable object  he becomes devoid of lust through the destruction of lust
and by fully understanding a neutral object  he becomes devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion
Or by eradicating the latent tendency to lust for a pleasant feeling he becomes devoid of lust through the destruction of lust and by eradicating the latent tendencies to aversion and delusion for painful and neutral feelings respectively he becomes devoid of hate and devoid of delusion
Therefore showing these distinctions the Exalted One says  devoid of lust devoid of hate devoid of delusion
For such a bhikkhu perfectly released Who dwells with ever tranquil mind
by own goal arahatship is meant
 Emancipated  there are two emancipations emancipation of mind and nibbana
Only one condensed statement is given since the meaning is the same in all cases
just as the statement on full understanding should be applied to all terms
the others for the purpose of showing the fulfilment of the realization of the fruit 
and by fully understanding the suffering in formations  becomes devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion
by fully understanding an undesirable object  he becomes devoid of hate through the destruction of hate
Having thus shown the cognitive process of the cankerless saint in regard to the bases such as earth etc with the words  The Tathagata bhikkhus the Exalted One next undertakes to show his own cognitive process
Therein  the Tathagata  the Exalted One is called the Tathagata for eight reasons because he has thus come  hecause he has thus gone  because he has arrived at the real characteristic  because he has awakened to real dhammas in accordance with actuality  because he is a seer of the real  because he is a speaker of the real  because he acts in accordance with his teaching  and in the sense of surpassing 
He is an  arahat for the following reasons because he is remote from the defilements  because his enemies and the spokes have been destroyed  because he is worthy to receive the requisites etc and because ot absence of secret evildoing
And he is a perfectly enlightened Buddha because he is perfectly and by himself enlightened to all dhammas
This is a summary
for a detailed treatment of these two words consult the Visuddhimagga the chapter on the Recollection of the Buddha
BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN FULLY UNDERSTOOD TO THE END BY THE TATHAGATA  Here the base of conceiving has been fully understood by the Tathagata
It has been  fully understood to the end  fully understood to the conclusion fully understood to the limit fully understood without any remainder is meant
For although there is no distinction between Buddhas and disciples in regard to the abandoning of defilements by the four paths there is a distinction in regard to their range of full understanding
Disciples can attain nibbana after insightcomprehension of only one segment of the four elements
But for the Buddhas there isnt even the slightest thing in the formations which hasnt been seen weighed scrutinized and realized with knowledge
Delight is prior craving 
Having understood he has known that the delight in the previous existence is the root of the present suffering
 Existence   kammaexistence
 Birth   the resultant aggregates
Since those are born they are called birth
What has come to be a living being 
This is meant he has known that ageing and death come upon the aggregates of the living being that has come to be through rebirthexistence
To this extent showing the cause for his elimination of the conccivings to be his penetration of dependent origination when he attained omniscience after comprehending the formations with insight while sitting in the invincible posture at the foot of the Bodhi tree he shows dependent origination with its four sections  three links  three periods of time and twenty modes 
How is all this shown
Here delight is one section
Suffering is given as a second existence is a third and birth ageing and death are the fourth
Thus the four sections should be understood
Thus just as there are three links between the four fingers there are also three links between the four groups
Delight belongs to the past period of time birth ageing and death to the future and suffering and existence to the present Thus the three periods of time should be understood
In the past there were five modes of which craving alone has come down under the name delight But though they are not mentioned in the text ignorance formations clinging and existence are included along with craving since they all share the characteristic of being conditions
The phrase  birth ageing and death  indicates the aggregates which are subject to birth ageing and death and thus future consciousness mentality materiality the sixfold base contact and feeling are implied
These twenty modes have the characteristics described as follows  In the previous kammaexistence ignorance with its characteristic of delusion formations of accumulating craving of attachment clinging of involvement and existence of volitionthese five dhammas in the previous kammaexistence are conditions for rebirthlinking in this existence
Here consciousness with its characteristic of rebirthlinking mentalitymateriality of des cending the bases of sensitivity contact of touching and feeling of being feltthese five dhammas in the rebirthexistence in this life are conditioned by previously done kamma
With the maturation of the sense bases here ignorance with its characteristic of delusion formations of accumulating craving of attachment clinging of involvement and existence of volitionthese five dhammas in the present kammaexistence are conditions for future rebirthlinking
In the future consciousness with its characteristic of rebirthlinking mentalitymateriality of descen ding the bases of sensitivity contact of touching and feeling of being feltthese five dhammas in future rebirthexistence are conditioned by kamma done here
Thus by the statement  He has understood that delight is the root of suffering and that with existence there is birth and that for what has come to be there is ageing and death this entire dependent origination with its four sections three links three periods of time and twenty modes is shown
Next the Exalted One says THEREFORE BHIKKHUS THROUGH THE COMPLETE DESTRUCTION FADING AWAY CESSATION ABANDONING AND RELINQUISHING OF ALL CRAVINGS THE TATHAGATA HAS AWAKENED TO THE SUPREME PERFECT ENLIGHTENMENT I DECLARE
Destruction is the ultimate destruction by the supramundane path
The following words are synonyms for destruction
For those cravings that are destroyed have also faded away ceased been abandoned and been relinquished
Or else  destruction  can be interpreted as the common function of the four paths
Or else through the destruction of those by which he might conceive earth and so forth until through the  relinquishing  of those through which he might delight in earth These interpretations are all possible there is nothing to exclude them
 Supreme  which is unsurpassed the best of all
The word bodhi is used in the texts to signify a tree the path the knowledge of omniscience  and nibbana
In the passages  first enlightened at the foot of the Bodhi tree  and  between Bodhi and Gaya  it is the tree that is called bodhi
In the passage  the knowledge of the four paths is called bodhi  it is the path
In the passage He of the most excellent profound wisdom attained bodhi  it is the knowledge of omniscience
In the following it is nibbana  Having attained to bodhi the deathless the unconditioned  
Here the Exalted Ones knowledge of the path of arahatship is intended
Is the path of arahatship attained by disciples the supreme enlightenment or not
It is not
Why
Because it does not yield all the noble qualities 
For some disciples the path of arahatship yields only the fruit of arahatship for some the threefold knowledge for some the six abhinnas for some the four discriminations  for some the knowledge of the pāramī of disciples
For paccekabuddhas it yields only the knowtedge of a paccekabuddhas enlightenment
But for Buddhas it yields the endowment with all noble qualities just as the coronation of a king confers sovereignty over all the nation
Therefore any other degree of enlightenment is not the supreme enlightenment
Awakened to  directly known penetrated attained achieved
 I declare  I explain I teach proclaim establish reveal analyze make manifest
Therein this is the interpretation  The Tathagata bhikkhus does not conceive earth  does not delight in earth
What is the reason Because he has understood that delight is the root of suffering and that with existence there is birth and that for what has come to be there is ageing and death
And what is more since he has understood dependent origination thus the craving called  delight  has been abandoned in all its aspects by the Tathagata Through the complete destruction of all cravings the Tathagata has awakened to the supreme perfect enlightenment
therefore he does not conceive earth  does not delight in earth I declare This is meant by reason of his awakening he does not conceive and does not delight I declare
Or else Since cravings have gone to complete destruction through his understanding of dependent origination by the method Delight is the root of suffering therefore bhikkhus through the complete destruction of all cravings the Tathagata has awakened to the supreme perfect enlightenment I declare
By reason of his awakening he does not conceive earth  does not delight in earth
 Thus spoke the Exalted One  the Exalted One spoke this entire sutta from the end of the introduction to the words  awakened to the supreme perfect enlightenment I declare showing his supremely deep knowledge of omniscience which does not yield a foothold to the wisdom of others The text comprises two recitation sections and eight major expository sectionsone on the worldling one on the learner four on the arahat and two on the Tathagata Each major section in turn contains twentyfour minor sections from earth down to nibbana
But though this sutta endowed with variegated methods and elegance of teaching was spoken by the Exalted One with a Brahmalike voice sweet as the song of the cuckoo pleasing to the ear consecrating the hearts of the wise with the ambrosia of the deathless
Why not
Because they didnt understand it
Since they didnt understand the meaning of the sutta they didnt rejoice in it
For though endowed with variegated methods and elegance of teaching at the time this sutta was for them like delicious food placed before a man with his mouth bound by a thick broad cloth
But didnt the Exalted One fulfil the paramis for four immeasurables plus a  aeons and attain omniscience all for the purpose of teaching the Dhamma to others in a way they could understand
If so why didnt they understand it in the way he taught it
The reason has been given in the section explainining the grounds for the delivery of this sutta  he undertook this teaching for the purpose of shattering their conceit Therefore this need not be repeated here Having heard this sutta taught for the purpose of shattering their conceit they thought The theorist he says perceives earth The learner the arahat and the Tathagata directly know it
What is this How is this Previously we could quickly understand whatever the Exalted One said But now we cannot make head or tail out of this exposition of the root O the Buddhas are immeasurable and unfathomable  Thus they became humble like snakes with drawn fangs and went respectfully to attend upon the Buddha and listen to the Dhamma
A short time afterwards a number of bhikkhus sitting together in the Dhamma hall started the following conversation O the spiritual power of the Buddhas Those brahminmonks were so puffed up with conceit but the Masters teaching on the exposition of the root made them humble This was the talk going on among these bhikkhus
Then the Exalted One came out from his Fragrant Cottage went to the Dhamma hall displaying a wonder appropriate for the occasion sat down in the special seat reserved for him and said to the bhikkhus  What kind of conversation were you having just now bhikkhus
They reported the matter to the Master
The Master said It is not only now bhikkhus but in the past as well that I humbled these men while they were going about with their heads swollen with conceit
Then the Exalted One related the following story of the past a parallel to the present incident
 Once upon a time bhikkhus a certain famous brahmin was living in Benares a master of the three Vedas knowing the text and context of the Itihasas the fifth of the brahminical authorities with their invocations liturgy and wordanalysis and he was fully versed in Natural Science and that of the marks of the Great Man He taught mantras to five hundred brahmin youths
Those youths being clever learned much quickly bore it well in mind and did not forget what they learned
The brahmin too did not have the closed fist of some teachers but taught them every branch of knowledge as though pouring water into a jar telling them  This branch of knowledge leads to so much welfare in this life and in the next
In time those brahmin youths aroused the conceit Whatever our teacher knows that we know We too can now be teachers From then on those youths became disrespectful towards their teacher and neglectful of their duties
The teacher aware of the situation thought  I will cut down their conceit 
One day when they came to attend on him after they had done homage and took their seats he said  Dears I will give you a riddle Solve it if you can 
 Give it teacher give it  they eagerly replied so intoxicated were they with the pride of their learning
The teacher said 
Answer this riddle dears
But though they pondered it over and over they couldnt figure it out but could only remain silent
The teacher dismissed them  Enough for today Go by tomorrow you should be able to answer it
But even though ten and twenty of them tried to solve it together still they couldnt make head or tail out of the riddle
The next day they went to the teacher and reported  We cant understand the meaning of this riddle
The teacher in order to cut down their conceit recited this stanza
Hearing this those youths became silent shamefaced shoulders slumped downcast scratching the ground with their fingers
Then the teacher seeing that they were ashamed said  Learn dears the solution to this riddle
Then he explained  Time  is the earlier part of the day and the later part of the day
Beings are living beings
Time does not eat the skin and flesh of beings but swallows and devours them by depriving them of life beauty and strength by crushing their youth and by destroying their health
Together with itself thus devouring them it does not omit anything but devours all
Not only does it devour all beings but it also devours itself
For the earlier part of the day does not remain when the later part arrives
The being who swallows up this time this is the arahat the cankerless saint
For he is called one who swallows up time because he has eaten up time by barring out the possibility of future rebirth
 He consumes the consumer of beings  it is craving which consumes beings in the planes of misery This the arahat has burnt up with the fire of knowledge and reduced to ashes Thence he is said to  consume the consumer of beings
 When this explanation was given those youths perceived the meaning of the riddle as clearly as the smooth and rough parts of a road illuminated at night by the light of a thousand lamps They all vowed  As long as life lasts we will live under our teacher Great indeed are these teachers We were so puffed up with conceit on account of learning that we did not even know the meaning of a four line stanza  Humbled from then on they performed their proper duties towards their teacher as they did in the past and in the next life were born in heaven
At that time bhikkhus I was the teacher and these bhikkhus were the brahmin youths
Thus in the past as well I humbled these men when they were going about with their heads swollen with conceit
Hearing this story of the past thinking  in the past as well we were knocked down because of conceit those bhikkhus became even more humble and applied themselves even more to their individual meditationsubjects
On a later occasion the Exalted One walking on tour through the country reached Vesali where he dwelt at the Gotamaka shrine Knowing that the understanding of those five hundred bhikkhus had become mature he taught them the Gotamaka Sutta 
Through direct knowledge  bhikkhus I teach Dhamma not without direct knowledge I teach a firmly ground Dhamma with firm grounds  not groundlessly I teach Dhamma that is convincing  not unconvincing
And since I teach Dhamma through direct knowledge etc
It is sufficient for you to be pleased bhikkhus sufficient for you to be exultant sufficient for you to be joyful
The Exalted One is a perfectly enlightened Buddha the Dhamma is wellexpounded the Sangha is practising the good path
Thus spoke the Exalted One And while this exposition was being spoken the ten thousandfold world system shook
Having heard this sutta those five hundred bhikkhus attained arahatship together with the four discriminations right in their very seats Thus on this occasion the present teaching reached the fulfilment of its purpose
suffering is the five aggregates 
 root  is the beginning 
This is the meaning he has known that with kammaexistence rebirthexistence occurs
Between craving and suffering there is one link between suffering and existence a second and between existence and birth a third
Here all cravings  is the same as delight
fading away as the first path  cessation as the second  abandoning  as the third and  relin quishing  as the fourth 
Or else through the destruction of those cravings by which he might perceive earth as earth
through the  fading away  of those by which he might conceive earth
through the cessation of those by which he might conceive in earth
through the abandoning of those by which he might conceive from earth
and through the  relinquishing  of those by which he might conceive  earth is mine
perfect enlightenment the perfect enlightenment and selfenlightment 
others say the knowledge of omniscience as well
those bhikkhus did not delight in the word of the Exalted One
 Time swallows all beings that live Together with itself as well
But the being that swallows up this time He consumes the consumer of beings
 Many downy heads were held high with conceit
But some clever man has bound them by their necks 
and the later part of the day does not remain when the next day arrives
my exhortation and my instruction should be put into practice
in four ways
That is the first attainment of vision
he comes to know the unbroken stream of human consciousness as established both in this world and in the next
That is the third attainment
he comes to know the unbroken stream of human consciousness that is not established either in this world or in the next
That is the fourth attainment of vision
There are these seven types
the BothWaysLiberated the WisdomLiberated the BodyWitness the VisionAttainer the FaithLiberated the DhammaDevotee the FaithDevotee
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the designation of individuals
There are these seven factors of enlightenment mindfulness investigation of states energy delight tranquillity concentration and equanimity
which are four painful progress with slow comprehension painful progress with quick comprehension pleasant progress with slow comprehension pleasant progress with quick comprehension
how one should avoid not only any speech involving lying but also speech that is divisive or sneeringly triumphant but should use wise words words to be treasured words in season
of which there are four The Blessed Lord knows by his own skilled observation That one will by following instructions by the complete destruction of three fetters become a StreamWinner no more subject to rebirth in lower worlds firmly established destined for full enlightenment
then with the reduction of greed hatred and delusion become a OnceRetumer
by the complete destruction of the five lower fetters be spontaneously reborn
by the destruction of the corruptions gain in this very life the deliverance of mind the deliverance through wisdom which is uncorrupted
There are three such theories
Here some ascetic or Brahmin by means of ardour endeavourrecalls various past existences 
up to several hundred thousand births 
and he says I know the past whether the universe was expanding or contracting
but I do not know the future whether it will expand or contract


The word all is found to be applied to four cases the allinclusive all  the all of restricted reference  the all of the sense bases  and the all of personality 
Thus in the passage All dhammas in all their modes enter the threshold of the Exalted Ones portal of knowledge  the allinclusive all is intended
In the passage You have all spoken well Sariputta  it is the all of restricted reference
In the passage I will teach you the all bhikkhus The eye and visible forms  the mind and mental objects  it is the all of the sense bases
And in the passage He perceives all as all  it is the all of personality
Among these four the allinclusive all has unrestricted application the other three restricted application In the present case the all of personality is meant 
They bear their own characteristics  although there are no dhammas devoid of their own characteristics this is still said for the purpose of showing that these are mere dhammas endowed with their specific natures devoid of such attributions as that of a being etc Whereas such entities as self beauty pleasurableness and permanence etc or nature  substance  soul  body etc which are mere misconstructions due to craving and views or such entities as skyflowers etc which are mere expressions of conventional discourse  cannot be discovered as ultimately real actualities  these dhammas can These dhammas are discovered as ultimately real actualities
And though there is no real distinction  still in order to facilitate understanding the exposition makes a distinction as a mere metaphorical device  
Also they are borne or they are discerned known according to their specific nature thus they are dhammas 
The meaning is the unique condition for each of the dhammas included in personality
And what is that
Craving conceit and views or ignorance etc 
For just as the conceivings of craving  which arise in reference to the bases of conceiving such as earth etc are the rootcause for their occurrence so also is ignorance etc
Thus it is said below  in conformity with this The uninstructed worldling etc Because it is not fully understood by him and  Delight is the root of suffering  and in addition  Because he is devoid of lust hate and delusion Hence their functioning as rootcauses is proved
The purport is all the dhammas beginning with earth which function as the bases for conceiving 
The worldling consists of the bases which have not been fully understood  the aggregates which have not been fully understood through the three kinds of full understanding 
For the aggregates are the bases of full understanding
The base of conceiving is apprehended merely through hearsay etc
But some raise the objection No conceiving takes place when the characteristic is seen and the perception which seizes upon as a solid mass and becomes the root for the assumption of views does not recognize the characteristic Therefore characteristicearth should not be included This is incorrect for the penetration of the characteristic is not intended here
thence the commentator says seizing upon the conventional expression
And not all perception seizes upon the mass nor does all become the root for the assumption of views Therefore conceiving also occurs in regard to the characteristicearth which appears through the bodydoor and elsewhere
Thence it was said that the base is apprehended merely through hearsay etc
Seizing upon the conventional expression 
Objection If the conventional expression is applied what is the fault Dont ariyans also make use of the conventional expression as when they say This venerable sir is the great earth etc
Reply It is not the mere employment of the expression that is intended here but the wrong adherence which is working through the conventional expression Thence he says he perceives through a perversion of perception
This is the meaningHe perceives it as beautiful  etc  through a perverted perception springing from unwise reflection 
By this weak conceiving through craving conceit and views is shown
If so  why is perception mentioned
Because it is evident
Just as when a fire is smouldering and smoke is seen although the fire still exists we say  there is smoke  rather than  there is fire because the smoke is more evident
in an analogous way although conceiving is already exercising its function  this function is not distinct The function of perception alone is distinct for perception is more evident But this perception accords with the conceiving and works in conjunction with the latter therefore he says he perceives through a perversion of perception
And when it is said that he perceives it thinking  it is earth it means that without releasing a segment of earth from among these four kinds he perceives what is in its true nature devoid of self etc as endowed with a self etc  like one perceiving a lump on the head as a piece of gold
Papañcasaṅkhā portions of papanca 
Because of these beings are detained in samsara ie delayed thus these are proliferating tendencies  Conceiving  because of these people conceive ie misconstrue  things as This is mine etc Craving conceit and views are referred to here by two synonymous terms conceivings and proliferating tendencies
He apprehends it  contrary   like the conceiving of views the conceivings of craving and conceit also apprehend things contrary to realitycraving assuming the repulsive to be beautiful conceit the inferior to be superior etc
The earthsign is the counterpart sign of the earthkasiṇa
The commentary shows the three conceivings in relation to ones own continuum and the continua of others in a condensed interpretation
 I am earth  by this he shows the conceiving of views and the conceiving of conceit with an internal object for this phrase implies adherence to a view of self or Imaking 
Earth is mine this signifies the conceiving of craving and the conceiving of conceit the latter is a possible interpretation because through conceit one considers oneself superior on account of some segment of earth which has come into ones possession
Conceiving may be analyzed in relation to the other two phrases in the same way
One who obtains jhana through the earthkasiṇa may adhere to the object perceived in his meditationvision as a self or he may take that object as a sign of his superiority Thus he conceives  I am earth  Apprehending this kasiṇa object as my self he conceives  earth is mine
On the other hand if he adheres to this object doctrinally as another person or as a god he conceives  another is earth  and if he adheres to it as the self of another he conceives earth belongs to another
Since in earth is a locative expression the statement means that he construes the basis for conceiving as a receptacle for his self for the self of another and for the accessories of both
Query Isnt it true that composite earth is a receptablesupport for the succession of dhammas both those connected and unconnected with the faculties And the otherscharacteristicearth the earthkasina sign and the earth deitiesobjectsupports for the mental factors which take them as their objects So there is nothing wrong here 
Reply No because he misconstrues the basis of conceiving as a support
For through the conceivings of views and conceit he takes earth as the support for  I ie for a self the reference of these conceivings Thus he conceives  I am in earth And through the conceiving of craving he takes earth as the support for the selfs accessories the reference of this conceiving Thus he conceives  There is an obstruction an impediment for me in earth
When he says in material form he includes the part by mentioning the whole 
Since the whole can never be found without its parts by mentioning the whole the part is also included
 The other types of conceiving are also recognized  when one regards another as superior etc on account of his success power etc taking his self to exist with earth as dependence support this is the conceiving of conceit And when one resolves ones mind upon these objects this is the conceiving of craving
 To originate or to emanate from earth origination from earth can be interpreted by way of the doctrine of the primordial egg   Then there existed an egg made of gold Brahma himself originated in that  Or it can be understood by way of the doctrine of atomism  which holds that the molecule originates from the coupling of atoms Emanation from earth can be interpreted by way of theism with its doctrine of the creative play of God  which maintains that all this world emerged from God
He conceives the self to be other than the earth he takes the self to be water etc In the first alternative the ablative has the characteristic of agency  in the second it has the characteristic of contrast 
Just as when affection and conceit are aroused for a base conceived by views the conceiving of craving and conceit arise so we can understand that when one ranks oneself as superior etc on account of a base conceived by craving or misconstrues that base as the property of a self and the self as its permanent master then the conceivings of conceit and views arise
 That element of Dhamma the supreme enlightenment
This is called an element because it bears  bears up  all knowable dhammas according to their specific nature or because it bears up the entire succession of dhammas of the beings to be trained preventing them from falling into the suffering of the planes of misery and the suffering of samsara and because it occurs in an unperverted mode
The supreme enlightenment is the path knowledge  founded upon his knowledge of omniscience and his knowledge of omniscience founded upon his pathknowledge
 Conceiving  is the misconstruing of the object which occurs by way of desiring selfpromotion and misapprehension 
Delighting on the other hand is that through which cleaving occurs This is the difference between conceiving and delighting 
Therein the  full understanding of the known  is the wisdom of full understanding by which one fully understands delimits  the plane of insight 
For this understands the dhammas of the three planes delimiting them as internal and external and defining their characteristics functions etc thereby it makes it known understood evident that  this is the plane of insight
Here it should be understood in terms of the earth element
The  full understanding of scrutinization understands the five clingingaggregates in their true nature as impermanent  by delimiting them through insightcomprehension and scrutinizing their modes of impermanence etc together with their accompaniments
The supreme path is the path of arahatship
Either is the full understanding of abandoning which in the abstract sense is the wisdom which abandons by eradicating them 
Thus characteristicearth is included by mentioning  hard solid etc
Since the worldling when he perceives any of these four kinds of earth perceives it only as a portion of earth and not as a portion of water etc it is said he perceives as a segment of earth
in this way the commentator shows that the perception of characteristicearth also occurs through the medium of the conventional expression
Just as applied thought and the other jhana factors despite their distinct specific natures are nevertheless all jhana factors in so far as they share the common nature of closely contemplating the object in the same way craving conceit and viewsdespite their distinct specific natures as yearning  selfinflation  and misapprehension  respectivelyare all forms of conceiving in so far as they occur in the common mode of misconstruing the object 
The misconstruing is the adherence to the object as I  and mine
or it is the supramundane path 
for this abandons desire and lust without remainder
By showing the conceiving of personalityview the conceivings of craving and conceit based on materiality are also shown
For these take the form of the affection and conceit he arouses for the base he conceives through the conceiving of views
Or else the conceiving of craving based on materiality is shown by the statements that he conceives the elements as  mine  and delights in them with the conceiving of conceit following it in conformity
 When he regards the self as in visible form  taking the immaterial dhammas such as feeling etc to be the self or all dhammas apart from the visible form base imagining the visible form base internally or externally as its container  he conceives This self of mine is in this visible form base Thus he conceives in the seen
 A section on the attainer  on the occasion of a jhana pertaining to the finematerial sphere or the immaterial sphere 
Since the jhana occurs in a single mode on a single object it is called unity The occurrence of the resultant jhana may also be included in the section on the attainer
 A section on the nonattainer  on the occasion of the occurrence of sense sphere dhammas
For even in access concentration  the mind has not completely attained to unity
 Relishing all  when there is no perception of the danger in all dhammas pertaining to the three planes due to the absence of disenchantment they are contemplated as satisfaction and craving increases
For this has been said by the Exalted One  For one who dwells contemplating satisfaction in dhammas subject to the fetters craving increases  
 Conceiving all as created by himself through conceit he conceives himself to be the creator and ranks himself as superior etc by conceiving all to be created by him for such a conceit only arises when he conceives himself to be the creator
The etc after all does not exist indicates that fatalism  etc should be included
 My self is great  by this he shows the doctrine which regards all as the manifestation of the self 
The rest should be understood by the method given in the section on earth  the conceiving which occurs thus  I am in all an obstacle an impediment for me is in all another is in all an obstacle an impediment for another is in all
He conceives himself apart  from all  when he holds the view that All this world is made of spirit  and conceives the origination or emanation of the self to proceed from the all consisting in spirit The affection and conceit he arouses for the base conceived by the conceiving of views are his conceivings of craving and conceit respectively
Conceiving All is my self or my creator or my master he conceives all is mine Delighting in it with craving and views he delights in all Thus the occurrence of the conceivings should be understood here
Those who hold the doctrine of supreme nibbana here and now conceive the five aggregates which have attained to the ultimate happiness to be nibbana but in reality they remain only personality 
The five kinds are the happiness of sense pleasures mentioned in the commentary and the happiness of the four finematerial sphere jhanas
 With distinguished knowledge  without falling short of the true nature of dhammas and without overshooting the mark as confused comprehension and wrong understanding do he knows it with distinguished knowledge which directly confronts the true nature of dhammas without falling away from it The meaning is with the full understanding through scrutinization based on the full understanding of the known and with one section of the full understanding of abandoning
Mā maññi ma he conceives by way of the unabandoned forms of conceiving amaññī  he does not conceive by way of the abandoned forms of conceiving Combined the two yield mā maññi
The learner cannot be described as  one who conceives  like the worldling who has not abandoned any of the conceivings nor as  one who does not conceive  like the arahat who has abandoned them all
For him part of the conceivings are abandoned part unabandoned
And though the conceivings that are unabandoned have been greatly diminished by him he still should not conceive through those much less through the others due to the absence of a more distinct conceiving
Since it is possible for him to fully understand that which should be fully understood conceivings do not arise for him in the way they do for the worldling who is destitute 
This absence of conceiving is for the purpose of fully understanding the base it is not an absence of conceiving achieved through the full understanding of the base as is the case with the arahat
Or else mā maññī is a command prohibiting an optional action like Do not injure do not hurt etc The meaning is he should not conceive 
Thus I heard The Mahāsuññatā Sutta 
Of Kāḷakhemaka  He was called Black because of the colour of his skin but his name was Khemaka
Dwelling a dwelling made in that same Nigrodhas park in one part by erecting a surrounding wall building a gate house constructing dwellings like those called haṃsavaṭṭaka  such as a meeting hall a refectory and so forth
Many resting places bed chair mattress pillow straw mat leather mat spread grass spread leaves spread straw and so forth were prepared They were placed bed touching bed  spread straw touching spread straw so that it resembled the dwelling place of bhikkhus who have formed themselves into a society
Do many The Blessed One has no doubts because of the complete destruction of all his defilements during the Session of Enlightenment The question is a rhetorical one and the word do is merely rhetorical
No one who is uncertain gets to the acme of attainment
Before this it seems the Blessed One had not seen ten or twelve bhikkhus living in one place
Then it occurred to him This social life is developed to the utmost in the round of becoming As water collects into rivers so social life is developed by beings in hell in the animal world in the realm of ghosts and in the Asura group and also in the human world the divine world and the Brahma world
For hell is ten thousand leagues across and is crammed with beings like a tube packed with bath powder There is no counting or reckoning the beings in the place of torture by the fivefold binding see MN  and  likewise in the places of paring with adzes and so forth see MN  and  Such is the way they roast in society
As to the animal world there is no counting or reckoning the termites in a single termite hill and likewise ants in each ants nest
Such is social life in the animal world too
And there are ghost cities a quarter or half a league across crowded with ghosts
Such is social life in the ghost realm too
The tenthousand league sphere of Asura demons is like an earring or hole when the needle is put into the ear  
Such is social life in the Asura Group too
As regards the human world there were  in the large clans living at Sāvatthī and inside and outside Rājagaha  people  koṭis
Such is social life in certain places of the human world too
Beginning with the earth deities there is social life in the divine world and the Brahma world also
Each deity has two and a half koṭis of dancers even up to nine koṭis Also there are ten thousand Brahmas living in one place
Thereupon he thought For four incalculable ages and a hundred thousand aeons the Perfections have been fulfilled by me for the purpose of undoing living in societies And as soon as these bhikkhus have formed themselves into a society and get to delight in society they will act contrary to that
Then feeling concern for the Dhamma he thought again If it were possible to announce a training precept that two bhikkhus should not live in one place I would do so but that is not possible
So I shall expound the discourse called The Great Way of Voidness which for training clansmen will be like an announced training precept like a fulllength looking glass placed at the city gate
After that just as Khattiyas nobles and so on seeing their blemishes in that looking glass get rid of them and become unblemished so indeed even for  years after I have attained complete extinction clansmen delighting in solitude will make an end of the suffering due to the round of becoming by harkening to this discourse and avoiding society
And the number of clansmen who by harkening to this discourse and avoiding society have as though fulfilling the Blessed Ones wish made an end of suffering and attained complete extinction is past reckoning
For in the Vālikapiṭṭhi Monastery in Ceylon the Abhidhamma scholar called the Elder Abhaya after reciting this discourse together with a number of bhikkhus on the occasion of taking up residence for the rainy season exclaimed The Fully Enlightened One enjoins us to act thus and what are we doing
And by avoiding society and delighting in solitude all of them attained arahatship within that same rainy season
This discourse is called the breakerup of societies
Of Ghatā of the one so named
At the dwelling This dwelling too was built like Kāḷakhemakas dwelling in a part of Nigrodhas park
Making robes the repairing of those already made by patching washing and so forth old and dirty ones and it is also the making up of unmade ones by arranging and sewing cloth provided for the purpose of robes Both are right but here making up of unmade ones is intended
for people had given the Elder nanda material for robes
And those bhikkhus sitting from the time announced for the needle work in the morning get up from it some time unannounced
It is our time for robe making The Elder it seems thought Surely it is those resting places that have not been arranged by those bhikkhus that will have been seen by the Blessed One
consequently the Master is displeased and desires to give a severe reproof I will be a support for those bhikkhus That is why he spoke as he did
But the intention here is this Venerable Sir these bhikkhus are living in this way not just because they delight in being busy but on account of robemaking
A bhikkhu nanda does not shine forth nanda whether it is an instance of being busy or whether it is an instance of robemaking or not still a bhikkhu who delights in company does not shine forth
Do not be a support where there is no occasion for support
Here company is gathering with ones own community
So whether he delights in company or in society in either case a bhikkhu who likes the fullness of society who is bound by the ties of society does not shine forth
But it is when a bhikkhu sweeps out his daytime quarters after his meal and after washing his feet well takes up his basic meditation subject and devotes himself to delight in solitude he shines forth in the Enlightened Ones Dispensation
The bliss of renunciation the bliss in him who has renounced sensedesires
The bliss of seclusion is the bliss of seclusion from sensedesires too
But what leads to the pacification of greed and so forth is the bliss of peace
Obtain  at will one who obtains his desire who obtains his wish without trouble
Temporary free from defilement on any occasion of full absorption
Delectable agreeable
Mind deliverance the mind deliverance of the finematerial and immaterial worlds
For it is said The four absorptions jhāna and the four immaterial attainments these are the temporary liberation
Permanent not deliverance from defilements occasionally but rather deliverance which is perpetual and supramundane
For it is said The four noble paths and the four fruitions of recluseship these are the permanent liberation
Unshakeable not to be shaken by defilements
So far what has been said
A bhikkhu who delights in company who is bound by the ties of society will be unable to produce either mundane or supramundane special qualities But by avoiding society and delighting in solitude he can do so
For just as in the case of the Bodhisatta Vipassi as long as he wandered during seven years surrounded by eightyfour thousand homeless ones he was unable to produce the special quality of omniscience but by avoiding society and delighting in solitude he climbed to the summit of enlightenment and produced the special quality of omniscience in seven days
Also as long as our Bodhisatta wandered with the Group of Five during six years he was unable to produce the special quality of omniscience but when they left him by delighting in solitude he climbed the summit of enlightenment and produced the special quality of omniscience
Having thus pointed out the lack of attainment of special qualities of one who delights in company he said I do not see nanda etc in order to point out how this flaw arises
Here one material form is a physical body
In him who delights  therein in him who delights through greed for that material form
will not cause  to arise that would not cause these things to arise in him who delights in that material form I do not see any such material form And then they arise too as they did in Sañjaya owing to the changed state of Sāriputta and Moggallāna called their coming to the discipleship of Him of the Ten Powers see Vinaya Mahā Vagga as they did in Nāthaputa owing to the changed state of the householder UPali see MN  and as they did in the rich man in the Piyajātika Sutta see MN 
But this  nanda What is the sequence of meaning
For the purpose of removing the occasion in which any unintelligent bhikkhu newly gone forth should say The Fully Enlightened One leads us away from society like cattle sent into a field and he exhorts us to solitude but he himself lives surrounded by kings kings ministers and so on he began this part of the teaching in order to show that the Perfect One is alone even when sitting in the midst of a community extending over a world sphere
His mind tends to seclusion tends to Nibbāna
It has put an end to is without remainder of unsupported by dissociated from states which give rise to cankers
Associated with dismissal associated with such words as You may go
But at what periods did the Blessed One speak thus
Either during the period of activity following the meal or during the period of activity in the first watch of the night
For after the meal the Blessed One adopts the lions pose in the Perfumed Cell and then he rises and sits absorbed in fruition attainment
At that time the community gathers for the purpose of hearing the Dhamma
Then the Blessed One who knows the time comes forth from the Perfumed Cell and goes to the Enlightened Ones exalted seat and he teaches the Dhamma Then not exceeding the time like one judging the cooking of a medicinal oil he dismisses the community with his mind inclining to seclusion
Also in the first watch of the night he dismisses the community thus The night is well advanced now it is time to do as you think fit
For since reaching enlightenment even the Buddhas twofold fivedoor consciousness incline to Nibbāna
Therefore nanda because dwelling in voidness is peaceful and sublime therefore
Internally only internally as to the range of object 
Possessed of full awareness fully aware through successfully knowing the meditation subject
Externally in regard to anothers five aggregates
Internally and externally at one time internally at another time externally
The imperturbable āneñjā this is a term for the four immaterial attainments of the sphere of boundless space and so forth he brings to mind the imperturbable immaterial attainment resolving I will become one who is Both Ways Released ubhato bhāgavimatto that is one who has attained both all eight meditative attainments and arahatship
For when one who has emerged from a basic jhāna which is still unfamiliar and brings to mind voidness internally his mind does not enter into voidness
Thereupon thinking How about anothers continuity of aggregates he brings it to mind externally There also it does not enter into it
Thereupon thinking How about at one time in my own continuity and another time in anothers continuity he brings to mind internally and externally There also it does not enter into it
Thereupon desiring to become one who is Both Ways Released thinking How about the immaterial attainment he brings to mind the imperturbable There also it does not enter into voidness
Now in that case he should not give up his effort and go following after supporters and so on but the same basic jhāna should be thoroughly brought to mind again and again
Thus he said In that same and so on in order to point out that it is like a tree cutters axe that does not have its effect but by resharpening the edge the axe may cut Similarly his repeatedly bringing to mind the basic jhāna will have its effect in regard to the meditation subject
Now in order to point out that when one has practised this his bringing to mind succeeds in respect to whatever he brings to mind he enters into
Thus he is possessed of full awareness therein so when the meditation subject succeeds while he is walking he is possessed of full awareness through knowing that his meditation subject has succeeded
Lies down stretches himself out
Thus he is possessed of full awareness thus he is one who practises full awareness through knowing I shall not indulge
In the second paragraph he is one who practises full awareness through knowing In such talk I shall indulge This bhikkhus serenity and insight are fresh  and for the purpose of guarding them the seven kinds of suitable things are needed
Abode resort and speech and person The food
This is said for the purpose of pointing these out
As regards the two paragraphs dealing with thoughts full awareness should be understood as knowing respectively the not thinking and the thinking of the thoughts
Having thus stated two of the paths by the abandoning of wrong thoughts he now said There are nanda these five cords of sensedesire and so on speaking of the insight for the third path
Concerned with any source of defilement concerned with any reason whatever among these five cords of sense desire for the arising of defilements
Attachment unabandoned defilement which appears as attachment
Then it being present
Possessed of full awareness possessed of full awareness through knowing the insuccess of the meditation subject
In the second paragraph
For when he reviews thus Is desire and greed in regard to these five cords of sensedesire abandoned in me or not and knows that it is not abandoned this bhikkhu exerts energy and abolishes it by means of the path of NonReturn Thereupon when he reviews after emerging from the fruition which follows next upon the path he knows that it is abandoned He is possessed of full awareness through knowing that is what is meant
Now speaking of the Arahat path he said There are nanda the five aggregates as objects of clinging and so on
Is abandoned means that the conceit I am the desire the inherent tendency to assert I am based on materiality is abandoned
likewise that based on feeling and so on Full awareness should be understood as previously stated
These nanda are states is said with reference to the states of serenity samatha and insight vipassana and path and fruition set forth above
Of  profitable origin come from what is profitable
For profitable states can be both profitable and derived from the profitable that is to say the first jhāna is profitable the second jhāna is both profitable and derived from the profitable the sphere of nothingness is profitable and the sphere of neither perceptionnornonperception is both profitable and derived from the profitable the sphere of neither perceptionnornonperception is profitable and the path of Streamentry is both profitable and derived from the profitable the path of NonReturn is profitable and the path of Arahatship is both profitable and derived from the profitable
Likewise the first jhāna is profitable and states associated therewith are both profitable and derived from the profitable the path of Arahatship is profitable and the states associated therewith are both profitable and derived from the profitable
Noble free from defilements and purified
Supramundane beyond the world and purified
Inaccessible to the Evil One inaccessible to Māra the Evil One
For Māra does not see the mind of a bhikkhu who sits absorbed in the eight attainments when they are made the basis of insight Nor is he able to know the consciousness that occurs in dependence on that as object
That is why inaccessible is said
What do you think Why did he say this
He said it in order to point out that there is one advantage in society
In seeking the Masters company in going to in frequenting
Now because there are some who dwell alone and who are not successful in getting at the meaning of the scriptures he therefore said Yet when this is so ananda and so on pointing out the disadvantage in solitude with reference to that
Here Yet when this is so nanda means when this solitary state exists
The teacher is a teacher who is a sectarian outside the Dispensation
By the teachers undoing the undoing of the teacher is by the undoing due to defilements that have arisen inside him
So with the other kinds of undoing
He has been struck down they that is the unsuitable things have killed him
But why is it said that the undoing of the dweller in the life of purity has a more painful result a more bitter result and it even leads to rebirth in states of woe
Going into homelessness outside the Dispensation brings small gain there is no outstandingly great or special quality to be developed there but only the eight meditative attainments and the five supernormal powers beginning with the miraculous powers
Accordingly just as there is no great suffering for one who falls from the back of a donkey  so since in a sect outside the Dispensation he falls only from worldly special qualities lokiyaguṇa it is not said in this way of the first two kinds of undoing
But going into homelessness in the Dispensation brings great gain Here the outstandingly special qualities are the four paths the four fruitions and nibbāna
Accordingly just as when a noble youth wellborn on both parental sides traversing a city and seated in the place of honour on the back of an elephant falls from the elephants back he comes to great suffering so since in falling away from the Dispensation he falls away from the expectation of the aforesaid nine supramundane special qualities lokuttaraguṇa
Therefore the construing should be done both with the preceding meaning and with the following meaning thus because the undoing of the dweller in the life of purity leads to greater suffering than the other two kinds because the practice of hostility towards the Blessed One see the Discourse  for long leads to harm and suffering but the practice of amity towards the Blessed One leads to welfare
In amity by the practice of amity
In hostility by the practice of hostility
Erring do they turn aside from the Masters teaching one who transgresses on purpose even by as much as an offence of wrongdoing dukkata or wrong speech dubbhāsita is called one who errs turns aside
It is one who does not so transgress that is called one who does not err does not turn aside
which is why he was doing work on robes there with a number of bhikkhus
thinking When the sewing is finished we shall set our resting places in order They had not set them in order as
society is gathering with different sorts of people
what leads to the enlightenment due to the path is the bliss of enlightenment
one who obtains without pain
one who obtains in abundance
Any sign any sign mark of visible objects and so forth of materiality and so forth
Internally internally as regards place of occurrence
Voidness fruition attainment through Voidness
Voidness internally in himself internally the meaning is produced in regard to his own five aggregates
In that same sign of concentration as before is said with reference to jhāna treated as the basis for insight
Dwelling in this way in this way consisting of serenity concentration and insight samathavipassanā
Here after walking for any given length of time now knowing I am able to walk for so long he should stand without breaking the sequence of postures
and so in each section
the climate and posture Select and cultivate of each The kind that is most suitable
possessed of full awareness means possessed of full awareness through knowing the success of the meditation subject
the death of his special qualities and virtues is stated by this
it is said in this way of the undoing of the dweller in the life of purity
I Shall not nanda treat you as I shall not behave towards you like Raw unbaked
Damp clay a raw not quite dry pot
For a potter takes the raw not quite dry clay pot gently with both hands lest it should break
Accordingly I shall not behave towards you as the potter behaves towards the damp clay
Repeatedly admonishing after advising once I shall not be silent I shall advise and instruct by repeatedly admonishing
Repeatedly testing by repeatedly testing for flaws
Just as the potter tests for those that are cracked split or faulty among the baked pots and puts them aside and he takes only those that are wellbaked after he has tapped them again and again so I too shall advise and instruct by repeatedly testing
The rest is clear throughout
He who is sound will stand the test he among you thus advised by me who is sound through having reached the path and its fruition will stand the test
Furthermore the worldly special qualities as well are here intended by sound
A disciple nanda is not Here though one who is welltaught who has studied much has been compared by the Blessed One to a soldier possessed of the five weapons in the passage The welltaught noble disciple bhikkhus abandons the unprofitable and develops the profitable he abandons the reproachable and develops the irreproachable and so he safeguards himself A IV 
Therefore one who explains the ten examples of talk in this sutta should do so pausing here for that purpose
So in this sutta the ten examples of talk that is talk of wanting little of contentment and so forth are given in three places
he therefore said a disciple nanda is not and so on pointing out that he is not justified in seeking his company with that aim alone in view
but he who does so has them
Nevertheless since he who does not after learning the scriptures practise in conformity with them lacks those weapons
Now in order to point out with what aim in view the Masters company should be sought he said But such talk as is and so on
in such talk I shall indulge Paragraph  they are given by way of the suitable and the unsuitable in the passage for the sake of expositions of discourses and stanzas Paragraph  they are given as scriptures learned by ear and in this place Paragraph  they are given directly as something to be fulfilled
Talk of kings is talk about kings proceeding like this Mahāsammata Mandhātu Dhammāsoka had so much power and so on
So too in the case of robbers and so on
As regards these such talk as such and such a king is handsome good looking and so forth is both worldly talk and animal talk that is pointless
But if it proceeds So and so who was so powerful came to destruction it keeps within the meditation subject
And as regards robbers talk about Mūladeva or Meghamāla being so powerful and about their deeds thus Ah what heroes  is worldly talk and animal talk
And as regards battles it is animal talk when it is instigated by satisfaction of sensedesires thus In the Bhārata battle and so forth so and so was killed thus was wounded thus
Moreover it is wrong to talk about food and so forth according to satisfaction of sensedesires thus We chewed we ate we drank we used what looked like this smelt like this tasted like this was like this to touch But it is right to talk of it meaningfully thus Formerly we gave food drink clothing beds garlands and perfumes that looked like this and so forth to the virtuous we made such an offering at the shrine
As regards relatives and so on it is wrong to say according to satisfaction of sensedesires our relatives are brave capable or formerly we went about in vehicles like this But it should be said meaningfully thus even those relatives of ours have passed away or formerly we gave sandals like this to the Order
Villages it is wrong to talk of villages as good or bad to live in or easy or hard to get alms in or according to satisfaction of sensedesires thus The inhabitants of such and such a village are brave capable But it is right to talk meaningfully thus They have faith they have confidence or They have come to destruction and have passed away
So too in the case of towns cities and countries
Talk of women is wrong when instigated by satisfaction of sense desires and is about appearance figure and so forth it is right only if it proceeds thus they have faith confidence or they have come to destruction
Talk of heroes is wrong if it is in accordance with satisfaction of sensedesires thus the soldier called Nandamitta was a hero it is right only if it proceeds thus He had faith or He has come to destruction
Talk of street inhabitants is wrong if it accords with satisfaction of sensedesires thus The people of such and such a street are easy to live with brave capable it is right only if it proceeds thus They have faith or They have come to destruction
Talk of wells is said of talk of places for getting water or it is talk of women watercarriers
It is wrong when concerned with satisfaction of sensedesires thus She is pretty she is clever at dancing and singing it is right only if it begins She has faith has confidence
Talk of the dead is talk of past relatives
Talk of trivialities is meaningless talk of different kinds that is not included in those already dealt with and still to be dealt with
Talk of the origin of the world is talk of the Lokāyatas sophists vitanḍa and chatter of the kind beginning This world was created by whom It was created by so and so A crow is white because its bones are white A crane is red because its blood is red
Talk of the origin of the sea is meaningless talk of the seas origin of the kind beginning thus Why is it called sea samudda Because it was excavated by the god Sagara Because he marked it with the seal mudd of his hand saying The ocean sgara has been excavated by me it is called sea samudda
Whether things are or are not is talk asserting that for some meaningless reason or other there is consequently existence there is consequently nonexistence
And here existence is eternity and nonexistence is annihilation
So with this talk on whether things are or are not animal talk is of thirty two kinds
but when it proceeds even they came to destruction then talk in each case conforms to a meditation subject
the definition here is the same as that for present relatives
existence is increase nonexistence is diminution
existence sensepleasure non existence is self mortification
one birth two births three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand lives many aeons of contraction of expansion of contraction and expansion Then I was called soandso this was my clan my caste I ate this had these happy and unhappy experiences lived for so long And when I passed away from there I was reborn in such andsuch other circumstances Passing away from there I was reborn here
yet whatever existence they have previously experienced whether in the World of Form or in the Formless World whether conscious unconscious or neitherconsciousnorunconscious
they remember the details of those past lives
and there is the kind that is free of the corruptions and not bound up with attachment which is called Ariyan
being one he becomes many  being many he becomes one he appears and disappears he passes through fences walls and mountains unhindered as if through air
he sinks into the ground and emerges from it as if it were water
he walks on the water without breaking the surface as if on land
he flies crosslegged through the sky like a bird with wings
he even touches and strokes with his hand the sun and moon mighty and powerful as they are
and he travels in the body as far as the Brahma world
and if he wishes Let me abide with the nondisgusting feeling disgust he can so abide
also feeling either disgust or nondisgust in the presence of both
or Ignoring both the disgusting and the nondisgusting may I abide in equanimity mindful and clearly aware he can so abide
The Exalted One is called the Tathāgata for eight reasons
 because he has thus come  because he has thus gone  because he has come to the real characteristic  because he has awakened to real dhammas in accordance with actuality  because he is a seer of the real  because he is a speaker of the real  because he practices what he teaches  and in the sense of vanquishing or surpassing 
 Why is the Exalted One called the Tathāgata because he has thus come
Because he has come in the same way that the previous perfectly enlightened Buddhas came engaged in exertion for the welfare of the whole world camethat is as the Exalted Vipassī Sikhī Vessabhū Kakusandha Koṇāgamana and Kassapa 
What is meant
Our Exalted One has come through the very same aspiration that these Exalted Ones came through
Or just as the Exalted Vipassī  the Exalted Kassapa came after they had fulfilled the full thirty pāramīsie the ten basic ten intermediate and ten ultimate pāramīs of giving virtue renunciation wisdom energy patience truthfulness determination loving kindness and equanimity made the five great relinquishingsie the relinquishing of limbs eyes wealth kingdom and children and wife fulfilled the preliminary effort the preliminary conduct the preaching of the Dhamma conduct for the good of relatives etc and reached the summit in conduct developing intelligenceexactly thus has our Exalted One come 
Or else just as the Exalted Vipassī  Kassapa came by developing and cultivating the four foundations of mindfulness the four right endeavors the four bases of spiritual success the five faculties the five powers the seven factors of enlightenment and the Noble Eightfold Pathexactly thus has our Exalted One come
Hence he is the Tathāgata because he has thus come
As Vipassī in the world and the other
Thus he the allseeing is called Tathāgata
Why is he called the Tathāgata because he has thus gone
Because as soon as he was born he went in the same way that the Exalted Vipassī Kassapa went as soon as they were born
And how did the Exalted One go
As soon as he was born he stood with his feet planted evenly on the ground and then facing north went forward with a stride of seven steps
As it is said As soon as the bodhisattva was born nanda he stood with his feet planted evenly on the ground then while a white parasol was held over him facing north he went forward with a stride of seven steps Having surveyed all the directions he then uttered the roar of the Leader of the Herd I am the foremost in the world I am preeminent in the world I am supreme in the world This is my last birth There is now no renewal of existence 
not unreal  for it foretokened his numerous achievements of spiritual distinction as follows
When as soon as he was born he stood with his feet planted evenly on the ground
When he walked facing north  that was the foretoken of his supremacy in all the world 
When he stood surveying all the directions after completing the seventh step that foretokened his obtaining the unobstructed knowledge of omniscience
And his uttering the roar of the Leader of the Herd was the foretoken of his setting in motion the supreme irreversible Wheel of the Dhamma
Just as the previous Exalted Ones went thus exactly thus did the present Exalted One go  And his way of going was real not unreal for it foretokened the above achievements of spiritual distinction
Hence the ancients have said
The very moment the master bull was born
Gotama took a stride of seven steps
And like a lion poised on a mountain top
Hence he is the Tathāgata because he has thus gone
Or alternatively as the Exalted Vipassī  Kassapa went exactly thus did the present Exalted One go That is abandoning sensual desire by renunciation ill will by benevolence slothandtorpor by the perception of light restlessnessandremorse by nondistraction and perplexity by the defining of dhammas shattering ignorance with knowledge dispelling discontent with joy knocking away the panel of the hindrances with the first jhāna making applied and sustained thought subside with the second jhāna making rapture fade away with the third jhāna and abandoning pleasure and pain with the fourth jhāna surmounting perceptions of material forms impingement and diversity with the attainment of the base of infinite space the perception of the base of infinite space with the attainment of the base of infinite consciousness the perception of the base of infinite consciousness with the attainment of the base of nothingness and the perception of the base of nothingness with the attainment of the base of neither perception nor nonperception
In that very same way the Sakyan sage came
great sages of the past Came to the state of omniscience
His way of going was real 
that was the foretoken of his obtaining the four bases of spiritual success 
His stride of seven steps foretokened his obtaining the gems of the seven factors of enlightenment
the golden staffed chowries that appeared his defeat of all the sectarian teachers
the white parasol his obtaining the stainless white parasol of the supreme deliverance of arahatship
He stood upon the earth with even feet
Beneath the parasol the Maruts held
When he finished taking seven steps
He surveyed all directions with his gaze
Uttered his roar complete in factors eight
Then he went abandoning the perception of permanence with the contemplation of impermanence the perception of pleasure with the contemplation of suffering the perception of self with the contemplation of nonself delight with the contemplation of disenchantment lust with the contemplation of fading away origination with the contemplation of cessation grasping with the contemplation of relinquishment the perception of compactness with the contemplation of destruction accumulation with the contemplation of fall the perception of stability with the contemplation of change the sign with the contemplation of the signless wish with the contemplation of the wishless adherence with the contemplation of emptiness adherence due to grasping at substance with the higher wisdom of insight into dhammas adherence due to confusion with the knowledge and vision of things as they really are the adherence due to reliance with the contemplation of danger nonreflection with the contemplation of reflection and adherence due to bondage with the contemplation of the rounds end Then he went demolishing the defilements coexisting with wrong view with the path of streamentry abandoning the gross defilements with the path of the oncereturner extirpating the defilements accompanied by subtle with the path of the nonreturner and eradicating all defilements with the path of arahatship
Thus he is the Tathāgata because he has thus gone
 Why is he called the Tathāgata because he has come to the real characteristics   The earth element has the characteristic of hardnessthat is real not unreal 
the water element of flowing
 Material form has the characteristic of deformation
 The faculty of faith has the characteristic of resolution
 The power of faith has the characteristic of not wavering because of faithlessness
 The enlightenment factor of mindfulness has the characteristic of awareness
 right view has the characteristic of seeing
 ignorance has the characteristic of unknowing
The elements have the characteristics of emptiness
The truths have the characteristic of reality
The purification of virtue has the characteristic of restraint
attention of being the originator
emancipation of being the essence and nibbāna the plunge into the deathless of being the consummation All these characteristics are real not unreal
Through the movement of his faculty of knowledge he has come to the real characteristic  he has reached it without falling away from it fully arrived at ittherefore he is the Tathāgata
Thus he is the Tathāgata because he has come to the real characteristic
the fire element of heat
the wind element of distending
the space element of intangibility
the consciousness element of cognizing
feeling of being felt

 Why is he called the Tathāgata because he awakened to real dhammas in accordance with actuality
It is the Four Noble Truths that are called real dhammas
As it is said These Four Noble Truths bhikkhus are real not unreal not otherwise 
What four
This is suffering bhikkhusthis is real not unreal not otherwise and so on in detail
The Exalted One awakened to those truths Therefore because he awakened to real dhammas he is called the Tathāgata
for here the word gone has the meaning awakened 
Further the fact that aging and death originate and commence with birth as condition is real not unreal not otherwise  The fact that the kammaformations originate and commence with ignorance as condition is real not unreal not otherwise The fact that ignorance is the condition for the kammaformations the kamma formations for consciousness  birth for aging and death is real not unreal not otherwise
All that the Exalted One awakened to Because he awakened to real dhammas he is called the Tathāgata
Hence he is the Tathāgata because he awakened to real dhammas in accordance with actuality
Why is he called the Tathāgata because he is a seer of the real
In this world together with its gods etc in this generation with its rulers and its men whatever visibleform object there is that enters the threshold of the eyedoor of the innumerable beings throughout the innumerable world systemsthat the Exalted One knows and sees in all its modes
And knowing and seeing it thus  as desirable or undesirable etc and as found under the applicable term among the seen heard sensed and cognized according to the method given thus
What is the material form that is the visibleform base
The material form derivative upon the four primary elements that is of colored appearance visible impinging blue yellow etc  he has analyzed it under numerous names in thirteen sections and by fiftytwo methods This is real not unreal
The same method applies to sounds entering the threshold of the eardoor 
For the Exalted One has said In this world bhikkhus together with its gods etc in this generation with its rulers and its men whatever is seen heard sensed cognized reached sought after or examined by the mindthat I know
that I have directly known That the Tathāgata has understood But the Tathāgata does not take a stand upon it 
Hence he is the Tathāgata because he is a seer of the real
Here the term Tathāgata should be understood to mean a seer of the real
Why is he called the Tathāgata because he is a speaker of the real
In the fortyfive year interval between the night when the Exalted One sitting in the invincible posture on the terrace of enlightenment crushed the heads of the three Māras and awakened to the supreme perfect enlightenment and the night when he attained parinibbāna in the nibbānaelement without residue while lying between the twin Sāl trees whatever the Exalted One spoke whether in the first middle or final periods following the enlightenmentthe discourses mixed prose and verse expositions stanzas joyous exclamations sayings birth stories wonders and miscellaniesall this is irreproachable in meaning and in phrasing free from excess and deficiency perfect in all its modes crushing the vanity of lust hatred and delusion
There is not even as much as a hairs tip in this that is defective It all appears as though it had been stamped with a single seal measured with a single ruler or weighed upon a single pair of scales It is all real not unreal not otherwise
As it is said Between the night when the Tathāgata awakens to the supreme perfect enlightenment and the night when he attains parinibbāna in the nibbānaelement without residue whatever he speaks utters or expoundsall that is real not otherwise
Therefore he is called the Tathāgata 
For here the word gata has the meaning of enunciation 
Hence he is the Tathāgata because he is a speaker of the real
Further the word āgada or āgadana means pronouncement that is a statement 
His pronouncement is real and undistorted Thus changing the letter d to a t the derivation of the word Tathāgata may be understood in this sense
Why is he called the Tathāgata because he practices what he teaches
The bodily action of the Exalted One conforms to his speech and his speech conforms to his bodily action therefore he is one who practices what he teaches and teaches what he practices
Since he is of such a nature his bodily action has gone thus  proceeding in accordance with his speech
As it is said As the Tathāgata says so he does
Therefore he is called the Tathāgata 
Hence he is the Tathāgata because he practices what he teaches
and his speech has gone thus proceeding in accordance with his bodily action thus he is the Tathāgata
as he does so he says
 Why is he called the Tathāgata in the sense of vanquishing or surpassing 
From the pinnacle of existence downwards and from the Avīci hell upwards throughout the innumerable world systems the Tathāgata surpasses all beings in regard to virtue concentration wisdom emancipation and knowledgeandvision of emancipation There is none his equal or measure He is unequalled immeasurable incomparablethe king of kings the god of gods the Sakka above all Sakkas the Brahmā above all Brahmās
Thus it is said In this world bhikkhus together with its gods etc in this generation with its rulers and its men the Tathāgata is the vanquisher the unvanquished the universal seer the wielder of power Therefore he is called the Tathāgata
Here the wordderivation should be understood as follows
What kind
His elegance of teaching and his accumulation of merit
For by means of these he vanquishes all the rival teachers as well as this world together with its gods in the same way that a powerful physician vanquishes snakes with a divine medicine
Thus his medicine for vanquishing all the world is his real undistorted elegance of teaching and his accumulations of merit
Changing the letter d to a t the derivation of the word Tathāgata may be understood thus he is the Tathāgata in the sense of vanquishing
Furthermore he is the Tathāgata because he has gone through reality and because he has really gone 
Here gone has the meanings of undergone  gone beyond  attained  and practiced 
Thus he is the Tathāgata because he has gone throughie undergonereality by fully understanding the entire world through the scrutinization 
He is the Tathāgata because he has gone throughie gone beyondreality by fully understanding the world through the abandonment of its origin
He is the Tathāgata because he has gone throughie attainedreality by realizing the cessation of the world
And he is the Tathāgata because he has really gone alongie practicedthe way leading to the cessation of the world
Thus the Exalted One has said
The world bhikkhus has been awakened to by the Tathāgata the Tathāgata is detached from the world
The cessation of the world has been awakened to by the Tathāgata the Tathāgata has realized the cessation of the world
The way leading to the cessation of the world has been awakened to by the Tathāgata the Tathāgata has developed the way leading to the cessation of the world
Whatever there is in this world together with its gods etc all that has been awakened to by the Tathāgata
Therefore he is called the Tathāgata 
The meaning of the word Tathāgata should be understood as given
But this is the mere introduction to the explanation of the nature of a Tathāgata
Agada is as it were a kind of medicine
The origin of the world has been awakened to by the Tathāgata the Tathāgata has abandoned the origin of the world
For only a Tathāgata himself can explain the nature of a Tathāgata in its completeness
Though the five great relinquishings belong to the perfection of giving they are mentioned separately in order to show that they are distinct forms of relinquishing that they are extremely difficult to practice and that they are distinct requisites for enlightenment For the same reasons the relinquishing of the eyes is mentioned separately from the relinquishing of the limbs And though they all involve possessions the relinquishing of children and wife is mentioned separately from the relinquishing of wealth and kingdom
The preliminary effort is the achievement of the meditative attainments and the direct knowledges together with the preliminary portion of practice for these consisting in the duties of advancing and retreating 
The preliminary conduct is the achievement of extraordinary practice in giving etc included in the Cariyāpiṭaka
But some say the preliminary effort is the aspiration and the preliminary conduct either the practice of giving etc or solitary wandering by way of bodily seclusion
The preaching of the Dhamma is talk that establishes and matures beings in the three types of enlightenment by explaining to them the practice of giving etc fewness of wishes etc the unsatisfactoriness of saṃsāra and the benefit of nibbāna
Conduct developing intelligence is the widening of knowledge by means of the knowledge of the ownership of action  the study of blameless occupations and blameless fields of knowledge the study of the aggregates bases etc and the scrutinization of the three characteristics In denotation it is the same as the perfection of wisdom but is mentioned separately in order to show the requisite of knowledge
By mentioning the foundations of mindfulness  he shows the way of arrival that has been brought to its climax for those states can be understood as the constituents of the supramundane paths and fruits Or the foundations of mindfulness etc can be considered only as the accompaniments of insight by taking them as the preliminary portion of practice
And here it should be understood that by mentioning the aspiration he shows the beginning of the way of arrival by mentioning the pāramīs he shows the middle and by mentioning the four foundations of mindfulness etc he shows the consummation
In the first case the participle gone in the word Tathāgata is explained in the sense of bodily movement In the second case it is explained in the sense of the movement of knowledge
Here he first shows the Exalted Ones state of Tathāgatahood distinguished by its movement of knowledge by way of the preliminary practice for the first jhāna stated as the abandoning of the five hindrances sensual desire and the rest next by the eight meditative attainments together with their means and then by the eighteen principal insights
Since the perception of impermanence and the rest come to perfection for one established in the full understanding of the known which drives away the delusion obstructing the discernment of mentalitymateriality and the overcoming of doubt the shattering of ignorance is the means for insight So too since the jhānas etc are easily achieved when discontent is dispelled by joy based on delight in the attainments the dispelling of discontent is the means for the meditative attainments
The contemplation of impermanence is a name for the insight apprehending the impermanence of the dhammas pertaining to the three planes
The perception of permanence is the wrong perception of conditioned dhammas as permanent or eternal Under the heading of perception views and cognition should also be included
The same method applies to the cases that follow
The contemplation of disenchantment is the contemplation that occurs in the mode of becoming disenchanted with formations
Delight is craving accompanied by rapture
The contemplation of fading away is contemplation that occurs in the mode of fading away
Contemplation of cessation is either the contemplation of the cessation of formations
or the contemplation that formations cease only and do not arise again by way of a future reorigination
thus it is said by the contemplation of cessation he makes cease and does not originate them
This is powerful desire for liberation
The contemplation of relinquishment is contemplation that occurs in the mode of relinquishing
this is the establishing of reflection
Grasping is the apprehension as permanent etc
The perception of compactness is the apprehension of identity because of continuity aggregation function or object
Accumulation is the forming 
Change is the attainment of distinct stages
The perception of stability is the apprehension of lastingness
The sign is the apprehension of formations as graspable entities due to the compactness of their aggregation etc and to the delimitation of their individual functions
Wish is the wishing of lust etc in denotation it is the inclination towards formations because of craving
Adherence is the settled view of a self
Higher wisdom of insight into dhammas is the scrutinization of all dhammas as impermanent suffering etc
Adherence due to grasping at substance is the inversion of apprehending a substance in the insubstantial
Adherence due to confusion is the adherence the world originated through the creative play of God etc
Adherence due to reliance is the apprehension of formations as a shelter and a haven the reliance is craving
The contemplation of reflection is the knowledge that formations of such and such a kind are being relinquished
The ending of the round is nibbāna the departure from the round The contemplation of the ending of the round is changeoflineage  the contemplation which occurs taking nibbāna as its object
The adherence due to bondage is the adherence to formations due to being bound
Under numerous names the visible form object is described as desirable undesirable neutral inferior past future present internal external seen cognized visible form visibleform base visibleform element a colored appearance visible impingent blue yellow etc
In thirteen sections this is said in reference to the thirteen expository sections which have come down in the chapter on material form 
By fiftytwo methods this is said in reference to the four methods of defining contained in each of the thirteen sections
This is real because of the undistortedness of his vision and the incontrovertible character of his teaching
The analytical derivation of the word Tathāgata should be understood thus he goes to ie he sees and knows these dhammas beginning with the visibleform object in the very way they exist in their specific nature and mode
is this the mere introduction
Why
Because the word Tathāgata like the word diligence contains the entire practice of the Dhamma as well as all the qualities of a Buddha
We now undertake a detailed explanation of the pāramīs for clansmen following the suttas who are zealously engaged in the practice of the vehicle to great enlightenment  in order to improve their skillfulness in accumulating the requisites for enlightenment
 In what sense are they called pāramīs
 How many are there
 What is their sequence
 What are their characteristics functions manifestations and proximate causes
 What is their condition
 What is their defilement
 What is their cleansing
 What are their opposites
 How are they to be practiced
 How are they analyzed
 How are they synthesized
 By what means are they accomplished
 How much time is required to accomplish them
 What benefits do they bring
 What is their fruit
The answers follow What are the pāramīs
The pāramīs are the noble qualities such as giving etc accompanied by compassion and skillful means and untainted by craving conceit and views
The bodhisattvas the great beings are supreme  since they are the highest of beings by reason of their distinguished qualities such as giving virtue etc The pāramīsthe activities of giving etcare their character or their conduct
Or else he excels thus he is supreme  the bodhisattva is the fulfiller and guardian of the noble qualities such as giving etc that which belongs to the supremethe character or conduct of the one who is supreme is a pāramī ie the activities of giving etc
In brief there are ten
These have come down in the texts in their specific character
As it is said
And again it is said How many dhammas are there venerable sir culminating in Buddhahood
There are Sāriputta ten dhammas culminating in Buddhahood
What are the ten
Giving Sāriputta is a dhamma culminating in Buddhahood Virtue renunciation wisdom energy patience truthfulness determination loving kindness and equanimity are dhammas culminating in Buddhahood
Thus spoke the Exalted One Having spoken thus the WellFarer the Teacher further said
Giving virtue then renunciation Wisdom and energy come to five
This is said by way of their synthesis
 What is their sequence
Here sequence means sequence of teaching This sequence is rooted in the order in which the pāramīs are initially undertaken which in turn is rooted in the order in which they are investigated The quality that is investigated and undertaken at the beginning is taught first
Therein giving is stated first for giving assists virtue and is easy to practice
Giving accompanied by virtue is abundantly fruitful and beneficial so virtue is stated immediately after giving
Virtue accompanied by renunciation  renunciation by wisdom  wisdom by energy  energy by patience  patience by truthfulness  truthfulness by determination  determination by loving kindness  and loving kindness accompanied by equanimity is abundantly fruitful and beneficial thus equanimity is stated immediately after loving kindness
Equanimity is accompanied by compassion and compassion by equanimity
 How can the bodhisattvas the great compassionate ones look upon living beings with equanimity
Some teachers say Sometimes they show equanimity towards living beings when it is necessary to do so
But others say They do not show equanimity towards living beings but towards the offensive actions performed by beings
Another method may be given Giving is stated at the beginning because it is common to all beings since even ordinary people practice giving because it is the least fruitful and because it is the easiest to practice
Virtue is stated immediately after giving because virtue purifies both the donor and the recipient to show that while giving benefits others virtue prevents the affliction of others in order to state a factor of abstinence immediately after a factor of positive activity and in order to show the cause for the achievement of a favorable state of future existence right after the cause for the achievement of wealth
Energy is stated immediately after wisdom because the function of wisdom is perfected by the arousing of energy to show the miraculous work the bodhisattva undertakes for the welfare of beings after he has reached reflective acquiescence in their emptiness to state the causal basis for exertion right after the basis for equanimity and to state the arousing of energy right after the activity of careful consideration according to the statement The activity of those who have carefully considered brings excellent results
 to show that the bodhisattva must patiently endure the suffering created by others even when he is working to the utmost for their welfare  Patience is mentioned immediately after energy
Truthfulness is stated immediately after patience because the determination to practice patience continues long through truthfulness having first mentioned the patient endurance of wrongs inflicted by others to mention next fidelity to ones word to render them help in order to show that a bodhisattva who through patience does not vacillate in the face of abuse through truthful speech does not relinquish  and to show the truthfulness of the knowledge developed through reflective acquiescence in the emptiness of beings
and to show right after the veracity of knowledge the complete accumulation of the requisites of enlightenment  for one who knows things as they really are determines upon the requisites of enlightenment and brings them to completion by refusing to vacillate in the face of their opposites   Determination is stated immediately after truthfulness
Equanimity is mentioned immediately after loving kindness because equanimity purifies loving kindness in order to show the indifference one must maintain towards the wrongs inflicted by others when one is providing for their welfare having mentioned the development of loving kindness to state next the development of the quality which evolves from it and to show the bodhisattvas wonderful virtue of remaining impartial even towards those who wish him well Thus the sequence of the pāramīs should be understood as explained
This is the schedule of the questions What are the pāramīs
 In what sense are they called pāramīs
 How many are there
Reflecting then I saw the first pāramī is giving
The great way followed by the sages of the past
Patience truth resolution love With equanimity these are ten
But some say there are six
which we will explain below 
Renunciation is mentioned immediately after virtue because renunciation perfects the achievement of virtue in order to list good conduct of mind immediately after good conduct of body and speech because meditation succeeds easily for one who has purified virtue in order to show that the purification of ones end through the abandoning of the offensive mental defilements follows the purification of ones means by the abandoning of offensive actions and to state the abandoning of mental obsessions immediately after the abandoning of bodily and verbal transgressions
Wisdom is mentioned immediately after renunciation because renunciation is perfected and purified by wisdom to show that there is no wisdom in the absence of meditation since concentration is the proximate cause of wisdom and wisdom the manifestation of concentration
 in order to list the causal basis for equanimity immediately after the causal basis for serenity and to show that skillful means in working for the welfare of others springs from meditation directed to their welfare
 because patience is perfected by energy as it said The energetic person by arousing energy overcomes the suffering imposed by beings and formations
 because patience is an adornment of energy as it is said The patience of the energetic person shines with splendor
 in order to state the causal basis for serenity immediately after the basis for exertion for restlessness due to excessive activity is abandoned through reflective acquiescence in the Dhamma 
 in order to show the perseverance of an energetic person since one who is patient and free from restlessness perseveres in his work
 in order to show the absence of craving for rewards in a bodhisattva diligently engaged in activity for the welfare of others for there is no craving when he reflects on the Dhamma in accordance with actuality and
and because the undertaking proceeds imperturbably only when determination is unshakable  Loving kindness is mentioned immediately after determination
 having first shown nondeception in speech to show next unshakable commitment to ones word for a bodhisattva devoted to truth proceeds to fulfill his vows of giving etc without wavering
 because truthfulness is perfected by determination since abstinence becomes perfect in one whose determination is unshakable
 because loving kindness perfects the determination to undertake activity for the welfare of others in order to list the work of actually providing for the welfare of others right after stating the determination to do so for one determined upon the requisites of enlightenment abides in loving kindness
 What are their characteristics functions manifestations and proximate causes Firstly all the pāramīs without exception have as their characteristic the benefitting of others as their function the rendering of help to others or not vacillating as their manifestation the wish for the welfare of others or Buddhahood and as their proximate cause great compassion or compassion and skillful means
Taken separately the perfection of giving is the volition of relinquishing oneself and ones belongings accompanied by compassion and skillful means The perfection of virtue is good conduct of body and speech accompanied by compassion and skillful means in denotation it is the abstinence from what should not be done the volition to do what should be done etc
The perfection of renunciation is the act of consciousness that occurs renouncing sense pleasures and existence preceded by the perception of their inherent unsatisfactoriness and accompanied by compassion and skillful means The perfection of wisdom is the comprehension of the general and particular characteristics of dhammas accompanied by compassion and skillful means
The perfection of energy is bodily and mental work for the welfare of others accompanied by compassion and skillful means The perfection of patience is the endurance of harm imposed by beings and formations or the act of consciousness occurring in such a mode predominated by nonaversion and accompanied by compassion and skillful means The perfection of truthfulness is nondeceptiveness in speech analyzed into an abstinence a volition etc accompanied by compassion and skillful means The perfection of determination is the unshakable determination to undertake  accompanied by compassion and skillful means or it is the act of consciousness occurring in such a mode The perfection of loving kindness is the wish to provide for the welfare and happiness of the world accompanied by compassion and skillful means in denotation it is benevolence The perfection of equanimity is the attitude of impartiality towards desirable and undesirable beings and formations dispelling attraction and repulsion accompanied by compassion and skillful means
 Giving has the characteristic of relinquishing its function is to dispel greed for things that can be given away its manifestation is nonattachment or the achievement of prosperity and a favorable state of existence an object that can he relinquished is its proximate cause
Virtue has the characteristic of composing  coordinating and establishing are also mentioned as its characteristic
Its function is to dispel moral depravity or its function is blameless conduct its manifestation is moral purity shame and moral dread are its proximate cause
Renunciation has the characteristic of departing from sense pleasures and existence its function is to verify their inherent unsatisfactoriness its manifestation is the withdrawal from them a sense of spiritual urgency is its proximate cause
Wisdom has the characteristic of penetrating the real specific nature  or the characteristic of sure penetration like the penetration of an arrow shot by a skillful archer its function is to illuminate the objective field like a lamp its manifestation is non confusion like a guide in a forest concentration or the four truths is its proximate cause
Energy has the characteristic of striving its function is to fortify its manifestation is indefatigability an occasion for the arousing of energy or a sense of spiritual urgency is its proximate cause
Patience has the characteristic of acceptance its function is to endure the desirable and undesirable its manifestation is tolerance or nonopposition seeing things as they really are is its proximate cause
Truthfulness has the characteristic of nondeceptiveness in speech its function is to verify in accordance with fact its manifestation is excellence honesty is its proximate cause
Determination has the characteristic of determining upon the requisites of enlightenment its function is to overcome their opposites its manifestation is unshakeableness in that task the requisites of enlightenment are its proximate cause
Loving kindness has the characteristic of promoting the welfare  its function is to provide for their welfare or its function is to remove resentment its manifestation is kindliness seeing the agreeable side of beings is its proximate cause
Equanimity has the characteristic of promoting the aspect of neutrality its function is to see things impartially its manifestation is the subsiding of attraction and repulsion reflection upon the fact that all beings inherit the results of their own kamma is its proximate cause
And here it should be mentioned that accompaniment by compassion and skillful means is the distinguishing feature of the characteristic of each virtueeg of relinquishing in the case of giving etc
For the virtues such as giving etc which occur in the mental continuities of bodhisattvas are always accompanied by compassion and skillful means It is this which makes them pāramīs
 What is their condition
The condition of the pāramīs is firstly the great aspiration 
This is the condition for all the pāramīs without exception
The aspiration for Buddhahood only succeeds when made by one who has attained to the human state of existence not when made by one existing as a nāga supaṇṇa etc
The male sex  For one who has attained to the human state the aspiration only succeeds when made by a man not when made by a woman eunuch neuter or hermaphrodite
Why
For the aforesaid reason  and because there is no fulfillment of the required characteristics 
As it is said This is impossible bhikkhus this cannot come to pass that a woman might become a Holy One a perfectly enlightened Buddha 
The cause  the achievement of the necessary supporting conditions
Even for a man the aspiration only succeeds for one endowed with the necessary supporting conditions that is one who has achieved the requisite causal foundation not for anyone else
The sight of the Master  the personal presence of the Master
The aspiration only succeeds when made by one aspiring in the presence of a living Buddha When made after the Exalted One has passed into parinibbānabefore a shrine at the foot of the Bodhi Tree in front of an image or in the presence of paccekabuddhas or the Buddhas disciplesthe aspiration does not succeed
Why
Because the recipient lacks the power 
The aspiration only succeeds when made in the presence of the Buddhas for they alone possess spiritual power adequate to the loftiness of the aspiration
The going forth  The aspiration succeeds only when made in the presence of the Exalted Buddha by one who has gone forth  either as a bhikkhu or as an ascetic who maintains the doctrine of kamma and the moral efficacy of action it does not succeed for one living in the household state
Why
Because the household state does not correspond with that of a Buddha 
The great bodhisattvas attain the supreme enlightenment only after they have gone forth into homelessness not while they are still householders Therefore at the time of making the resolution it is only one who has gone forth endowed with the appropriate qualities and determination who can succeed
The achievement of noble qualities  the achievement of such noble qualities as the direct knowledges etc
For the aspiration only succeeds when made by one who has gone forth and gained the eight meditative attainments and the five mundane kinds of direct knowledge it does not succeed for one devoid of these qualities
Why
Because one devoid of them is incapable of investigating the pāramīs It is because he possesses the necessary supporting conditions and the direct knowledges that the Great Man after he has made the aspiration is able to investigate the pāramīs by himself
Extreme dedication  extreme devotion
The aspiration only succeeds for one endowed with the aforesaid qualities who at the time has such strong devotion for the Buddhas that he is prepared to relinquish his very life for them
Strong desire  wholesome desire the wish for accomplishment
One possessed of the aforesaid qualities must have strong desire yearning and longing to practice the dhammas culminating in Buddhahood Only then does his aspiration succeed not otherwise
The following similes illustrate the magnitude of the desire required If he were to hear He alone can attain Buddhahood who can cross a whole world system filled with water and reach the farther shore by the bare strength of his armshe would not deem that difficult to do but would be filled with desire for the task and would not shrink away
If he were to hear He alone can attain Buddhahood who can tread across a whole world system filled with flameless smokeless redhot coals cross over and reach the other side etc
If he were to hear Buddhahood can only be attained after being tortured in hell for four incalculables and a  aeonshe would not deem that difficult to do but would be filled with desire for the task and would not shrink away Such is the magnitude of the desire required
The aspiration made by one endowed with these eight factors is in denotation the act of consciousness occurring together with the collection of these eight factors
Its characteristic is rightly resolving to attain the supreme enlightenment
Its function is to yearn Oh may I awaken to the supreme perfect enlightenment and bring wellbeing and happiness to all beings  It is manifest as the root cause for the requisites of enlightenment Its proximate cause is great compassion or the achievement of the necessary supporting conditions
Since it has as its object the inconceivable plane of the Buddhas and the welfare of the whole immeasurable world of beings it should be seen as the loftiest most sublime and most exalted distinction of merit endowed with immeasurable potency the root cause of all the dhammas culminating in Buddhahood
Simultaneous with its arising the Great Man enters upon the practice of the vehicle to great enlightenment He becomes fixed in his destiny irreversible and therefore properly gains the designation bodhisattva His mind becomes fully devoted to the supreme enlightenment in its completeness and his capacity to fulfill the training in the requisites of enlightenment is established
For when their aspiration succeeds the Great Men correctly investigate all the pāramīs with their selfevolved knowledge which prefigures their future attainment of omniscience Then they undertake their practice and fulfill them in due order
as was done by the wise Sumedha when he made his great aspiration
The aspiration has four conditions  four causes  and four powers 
Therein what are the four conditions
First the Great Man sees a Tathāgata performing a miracle replete with wonders and marvels through the great spiritual power of a Buddha
His mind taking this display as its object and support becomes fixed upon the great enlightenment and he thinks This Dhammaelement is indeed endowed with tremendous spiritual power since by penetrating it the Exalted One has acquired such a wonderful and marvelous nature and such inconceivable spiritual power
Taking this display of the Buddhas spiritual power as condition and support he resolves upon the supreme enlightenment and fixes his mind on this goal
In the second case he does not see the great spiritual power of the Tathāgata but he hears The Exalted One is of such and such a nature
Taking this as condition and support he resolves upon the supreme enlightenment and fixes his mind on this goal
In the third he neither sees the great spiritual power of the Tathāgata nor hears about it from another but he hears someone expounding the Tathāgatas Dhamma with a discourse concerning the spiritual power of a Buddha such as a discourse on the ten powers of a Tathāgata 
Taking this as condition and support he resolves upon the supreme enlightenment and fixes his mind on this goal
In the fourth case he neither sees the great spiritual power of the Tathāgata nor hears about it from another nor hears the Dhamma of the Tathāgata But he is a man of lofty temperament and a noble disposition and he thinks I will protect the heritage lineage tradition and law of the Buddhas To this end he honors reveres esteems worships and venerates the Dhamma Taking this as condition and support he resolves upon the supreme enlightenment and fixes his mind on this goal
What are the four causes for the great aspiration
First the Great Man is naturally endowed with the necessary supporting conditions  having observed his course of duties under former Buddhas
The Great Man is naturally endowed with a compassionate temperament and disposition He desires to alleviate the suffering of beings and is even ready to relinquish his own body and life to do so
Until he reaches his goal the Great Man is willing to struggle and strive for an extremely long time along a course involving great hardship without fear and without becoming disenchanted with all the suffering of the round all for the sake of the welfare of other beings
The Great Man relies upon good friends who restrain him from evil and establish him in what is good
These are the necessary supporting conditions with which the Great Man is endowed Just as his temperament slants slopes and slides without deviation to full enlightenment so too it inclines to conduct for the welfare of beings
Because he is endowed with such supporting conditions the following traits appear in him creating a sharp distinction between himself and beings bound for the enlightenment of a disciple or the enlightenment of a paccekabuddha  with regard to their faculties  ways of practice  and skillfulness 
First the Great Man endowed with the necessary supporting conditions possesses lucid faculties and lucid knowledge but not so the others
Second the Great Man practices not for his own welfare but for the welfare of others
And third he applies skillfulness to his practice through his ingenuity in creating opportunities and his skill in distinguishing what is possible from what is not possible
Thus the Great Man is naturally inclined to giving and delights in giving Whenever he has anything that may be given away he gives it away and does not feel any annoyance on account of giving He is constantly and continually in the habit of sharing He gives joyfully full of solicitude not with an apathetic mind Even after giving a large gift he does not become complacent much less after giving a small gift To generate zeal in others he speaks in praise of giving he delivers discourses concerned with giving he is elated when he sees others practicing giving and he gives fearlessness to others in fearful situations These are some of the Great Mans traits indicating the perfection of giving due to his inclination towards giving
Again the Great Man feels shame and moral dread over evil deeds such as taking life etc He is benevolent towards living beings He is meek goodnatured free from craftiness and hypocrisy upright easy to admonish and endowed with qualities which make him easy to admonish gentle compliant and humble He never takes an article belonging to someone else not even a blade of grass If he offers to cover anothers expenses himself he does not break his word If someone through forgetfulness or negligence leaves some article behind he reminds him and endeavors to prevent it from falling into anothers hands He is not lustful does not arouse even an evil thought over women bound to other men and avoids misconduct with women from afar He is a speaker of truth devoted to truth one who reconciles those who are at variance and promotes friendships his speech is endearing preceded by a smile congenial he speaks on the good speaks on the Dhamma He is free from covetousness ill will and inverted views possessing the knowledge of the ownership of action and the knowledge in conformity with the Four Noble Truths He is grateful and thankful venerates his elders is completely pure in his livelihood and a lover of the Dhamma He exhorts others to undertake the Dhamma restrains beings in every possible way from doing what is improper and establishes them in the fulfillment of their duties He himself endeavors to fulfil his own duties and if he finds that he has done something he should not have done he immediately desists These are some of the Great Mans traits indicating the perfection of virtue due to his inclination towards virtue
Again his defilements and hindrances are feeble He inclines towards solitude and is generally free from distraction Evil thoughts do not invade his mind When he has gone into solitude he can concentrate his mind with little trouble Thoughts of loving kindness readily flow from him even towards those who are hostile towards him how much more then towards others He is mindful remembering and recollecting what was done and said long ago and intelligent being endowed with wisdom nourished by the Dhamma He is adroit in the fulfilment of his various duties and energetic in working for the welfare of beings Through the power of his patience he can endure anything His determination is unshakable and he stands firm in his undertakings  And he remains equanimous in all situations requiring equanimity These are some of the Great Mans traits indicating the remaining pāramīs due to his inclination towards the qualities for which they stand
When it is said of the Great Man endowed with these traits indicating the requisites of enlightenment that reliance upon good friends is a cause for the great aspiration
this in brief is the characteristic of the good friend The good friend possesses faith virtue learning renunciation energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom
Through his accomplishment in faith he has faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata and in kamma and its fruits thus he does not abandon his wish for the welfare of beings the root cause for the supreme enlightenment Through his accomplishment in virtue he is dear and agreeable to beings revered and esteemed an exhorter a censor of evil a teacher patient in speech Through his accomplishment in learning he gives profound discourses leading to the welfare and happiness of beings Through his accomplishment in renunciation he is of few wishes content secluded and aloof Through his accomplishment in energy he is energetic in promoting the welfare of beings Through his accomplishment in mindfulness his mindfulness is established in blameless states Through his accomplishment in concentration he is undistracted and concentrated in mind Through his accomplishment in wisdom he understands things in their undistorted nature Through mindfulness he examines the consequences of wholesome and unwholesome actions through wisdom he understands as they really are what is beneficial and harmful for beings through concentration he unifies his mind on that matter and through energy he restrains beings from what is harmful and enjoins them in what is beneficial
Hence it is said
The talks he gives are deep and profound He does not enjoin one in improper ways
Relying on a good friend possessed of these qualities the Great Man brings to perfection his own achievement of the necessary supporting conditions
Having fully purified his end and means and come into possession of the four powers it is not long before he acquires the eight factors makes the great aspiration and becomes established in the state of a bodhisattvairreversible fixed in destination bound for full enlightenment
These are his four powers
The external power is the longing or undeviating inclination for the supreme enlightenment which is grounded upon consideration for others through this power the Great Man dominated by a consideration for the world and upheld by a sense of moral dread forms the aspiration fulfills the pāramīs and attains the supreme enlightenment
The power of the supporting conditions is the longing or undeviating inclination for the supreme enlightenment based on the achievement of the necessary supporting conditions through this power the Great Man endowed with sharp faculties and a lucid constitution and upheld by mindfulness forms the aspiration fulfills the pāramīs and attains the supreme enlightenment
The power of effort is the Great Mans endowment with the appropriate effort for supreme enlightenment that is his thoroughness and perseverance in his work through this power the Great Man with purified effort and uninterrupted work forms the aspiration fulfills the pāramīs and attains the supreme enlightenment
The aspiration originating by means of the four conditions the four causes and the four powers and succeeding when it becomes endowed with the collection of eight factors is the conditionthe root causefor the pāramīs
When it arises four wonderful and marvellous qualities establish themselves in the Great Man He develops a heart of love for all living beings in every realm of existence just as if they were his own dear children
His inclination and efforts turn towards promoting the welfare and happiness of beings
The potential Buddhaqualities within himself grow more and more prominent and come to maturity
Since the Great Man possesses the condition for the loftiest flood of merit and goodness the very nutriment of happiness he becomes worthy of gifts the ultimate receptacle for the reverence of beings an unequalled field of merit for the world
It is in this way that the great aspiration with its numerous noble qualities and benefits functions as the condition for the pāramīs
Like the aspiration great compassion and skillful means are also conditions for the pāramīs
Therein skillful means is the wisdom which transforms giving into requisites of enlightenment Through their great compassion and skillful means the Great Men devote themselves to working uninterruptedly for the welfare of others without any concern for their own happiness and without any fear of the extremely difficult course of conduct that great bodhisattvas must follow And their nature is such that they are able to promote the welfare and happiness of beings even on occasions when they are merely seen heard of or recollected inspires confidence
Through his wisdom the bodhisattva perfects within himself the character of a Buddha and through his compassion the ability to perform the work of a Buddha Through wisdom he brings himself across  through compassion he leads others across Through wisdom he understands the suffering of others through compassion he strives to alleviate their suffering Through wisdom he becomes disenchanted with suffering through compassion he accepts suffering Through wisdom he aspires for nibbāna through compassion he remains in the round of existence Through compassion he enters saṃsāra through wisdom he does not delight in it Through wisdom he destroys all attachments but because his wisdom is accompanied by compassion he never desists from activity that benefits others Through compassion he shakes with sympathy for all but because his compassion is accompanied by wisdom his mind is unattached Through wisdom he is free from Imaking and my making through compassion he is free from lethargy and depression So too through wisdom and compassion respectively he becomes his own protector and the protector of others a sage and a hero one who does not torment himself and one who does not torment others one who promotes his own welfare and the welfare of others fearless and a giver of fearlessness dominated by consideration for the Dhamma and by consideration for the world grateful for favors done and forward in doing favors for others devoid of delusion and devoid of craving accomplished in knowledge and accomplished in conduct possessed of the powers and possessed of the grounds of self confidence Thus wisdom and compassion as the means for attaining each of the specific fruits of the pāramitās is the condition for the pāramīs
And the same pair is a condition for the resolution as well
The four factorszeal intelligence stability and beneficent conductare likewise conditions for the pāramīs Because they serve as the basis for the arising of Buddhahood these factors are called grounds for Buddhahood 
Herein zeal means energy in striving for the requisites of enlightenment
Intelligence is wisdom in applying skillful means to the requisites of enlightenment
Stability is determination an unshakable determination of the will
Beneficent conduct is the development of loving kindness and compassion
For bodhisattvas seeing the fault in sense pleasures and in household life incline to renunciation Seeing the fault in company they incline to solitude Seeing the faults in greed hatred and delusion they incline to nongreed nonhatred and nondelusion Seeing the fault in all the realms of existence bodhisattvas incline to escape
Therefore these six inclinations of bodhisattvas are conditions for the pāramīs
For the pāramīs do not arise without seeing the danger in greed etc and the superiority of nongreed etc The inclination to nongreed etc is the slanting of the mind towards relinquishing etc because of the superiority of nongreed etc
For bodhisattvas through their inclination towards giving see the fault in its opposite ie in stinginess and therefore fulfill the perfection of giving
Through their inclination towards virtue they see the fault in moral depravity and therefore fulfill the perfection of virtue
Through their inclination towards renunciation they see the fault in sense pleasures and in household life through their inclination towards knowing things as they really are they see the faults in ignorance and perplexity through their inclination towards energy they see the fault in laziness through their inclination towards patience they see the fault in impatience through their inclination towards truthfulness they see the fault in deceptive speech through their inclination towards determination they see the fault in lack of determination through their inclination towards loving kindness they see the fault in ill will and through their inclination towards equanimity they see the danger in the vicissitudes of the world Thus they fulfill the perfection of renunciation and the other perfections down to equanimity
In this way the inclination towards giving and towards the other nine virtues by bringing about the achievement of all the pāramīs serve as their condition
Reviewing the danger in their opposites and the benefits in their practice is another condition for the pāramīs eg in the case of the perfection of giving the danger in nonrelinquishing and the benefit in relinquishing
This is the method of reviewing The perfection of giving should be reflected upon thus Possessions such as fields land bullion gold cattle buffaloes slaves children wives etc bring immense harm to those attached to them Because they stimulate desire they are wanted by many people they can be confiscated by kings and thieves they spark off disputes and create enemies they are basically insubstantial to acquire and protect them one has to harass others when they are destroyed many kinds of calamities such as sorrow etc follow and because of attachment to these things the mind becomes obsessed with the stain of stinginess and as a result one is reborn in the plane of misery
On the other hand one act of relinquishing these things is one step to safety Therefore one should diligently relinquish them
Further when a suppliant asks for something a bodhisattva should reflect He is my intimate friend for he divulges his own secret to me He is my teacher for he teaches me When you go you have to abandon all Going to the world beyond you cannot even take your own possessions He is a companion helping me to remove my belongings from this world which like a blazing house is blazing with the fire of death In removing this he helps me to get rid of the worry it costs me He is my best friend for by enabling me to perform this noble act of giving he helps me to accomplish the most eminent and difficult of all achievements the attainment of the plane of the Buddhas
He should further reflect He honors me with a lofty task therefore I should acknowledge that honor faithfully And Since life is bound to end I should give even when not asked much more when asked And Those with a lofty temperament search for someone to give to but he has come to me on his own accord because of my merit And Bestowing a gift upon a suppliant will be beneficial to me as well as to him And Just as I would benefit myself so should I benefit all the world And If there were no suppliants how would I fulfill the perfection of giving And Everything I acquire should be obtained only to give to others And When will beggars feel free to take my belongings on their own accord without asking And How can I be dear and agreeable to beggars and how can they be dear and agreeable to me How can I give and after giving be elated exultant filled with rapture and joy And how can beggars be so on my account How can my inclination to giving be lofty How can I give to beggars even without beings asked knowing their hearts desire And Since there are goods and beggars have come not to give them something would be a great deception on my part And How can I relinquish my own life and limbs to those who ask for them
He should arouse a desire to give things away without concern by reflecting Good returns to the one who gives without his concern just as the boomerang returns to the one who threw it without his concern
If a dear person asks for something he should arouse joy by reflecting One who is dear is asking me for something
If an indifferent person asks for something he should arouse joy by reflecting Surely if I give him something he will become my friend
And if a hostile person asks for something he should be especially happy thinking My foe is asking me for something though he is hostile towards me by means of this gift he will surely become my dear friend
Thus he should give to neutral and hostile people in the same way he gives to dear people having first aroused loving kindness and compassion
If due to their cumulative force states of greed should arise for things that can be given away the bodhisattvaaspirant should reflect Well now good man when you made the aspiration for full enlightenment did you not surrender this body as well as the merit gained in relinquishing it for the sake of helping all beings Attachment to external objects is like the bathing of an elephant therefore you should not be attached to anything
Suppose there is a great medicine tree and someone in need of its roots takes away its roots someone in need of its shoots bark trunk limbs heartwood branches foliage flowers or fruits takes away its shoots bark trunk etc The tree would not be assailed by such thoughts as They are taking away my belongings In the same way when I have undertaken to exert myself for the welfare of all the world I should not arouse even the subtlest wrong thought over this wretched ungrateful impure body which I have entrusted to the service of others
And besides what distinction can be made between the internal material elements and the external material elements  They are both subject to inevitable breaking up dispersal and dissolution This is only confused prattle the adherence to this body as This is mine this am I this is my self
I should have no more concern over my own hands feet eyes and flesh than over external things Instead I should arouse the thought to surrender them to others Let those who need them take them away
 As he reflects in this way resolved upon full enlightenment without concern for his body or life his bodily vocal and mental actions will easily become fully purified
When his bodily vocal and mental actions along with his livelihood become purified he abides in the practice of the true way and through his skillful means in regard to gain and loss he is able to benefit all beings to an even greater extent by relinquishing material gifts and by giving the gift of fearlessness and the gift of the true Dhamma This is the method of reflecting on the perfection of giving
The perfection of virtue should be reflected upon as follows Even the waters of the Ganges cannot wash away the stain of hatred yet the water of virtue is able to do so Even yellow sandalwood cannot cool the fever of lust yet virtue is able to remove it Virtue is the unique adornment of the good surpassing the adornments cherished by ordinary people such as necklaces diadems and earrings It is a sweetscented fragrance superior to incense as it pervades all directions and is always in place a supreme magical spell which wins the homage of deities and of powerful khattiyas etc a staircase ascending to the world of the gods to the heaven of the Four Great Kings etc a means for achieving the jhānas and the direct knowledges a highway leading to the great city of nibbāna the foundation for the enlightenment of disciples paccekabuddhas and perfectly enlightened Buddhas And as a means for the fulfilment of all ones wishes and desires it surpasses the tree of plenty and the wishfulfilling gem
And the Exalted One has said The hearts resolution of the virtuous bhikkhus succeeds on account of his purity 
And If bhikkhus a bhikkhu should wish May I be dear and agreeable to my companions in the Holy Life revered and esteemed he should be perfect in fulfilling the rules of conduct 
And Wholesome virtues nanda lead to freedom from remorse 
And These householders are the five benefits of the virtuous mans endowment with virtue  Thus the noble qualities of virtue should be reflected upon by way of these suttas
and the danger in moral depravity by way of such suttas as The Simile of the Mass of Fire 
Virtue should be reflected upon as the basis for rapture and joy as giving immunity from fear of selfreproach the reproach of others temporal punishment and an evil destination after death as praised by the wise as the root cause for freedom from remorse as the basis for security and as surpassing the achievements of high birth wealth sovereignty long life beauty status kinsmen and friends
For great rapture and joy arise in the virtuous man when he reflects on his own accomplishment in virtue I have done what is wholesome I have done what is good I have built myself a shelter from fear
The virtuous man does not blame himself and other wise men do not blame him and he does not encounter the dangers of temporal punishment or an evil destination after death
To the contrary the wise praise the noble character of the virtuous man
And virtue is the supreme basis for security since it is the foundation for diligence a blessing and a means for achieving great benefits such as preventing the loss of wealth etc Accomplishment in virtue surpasses birth in a good family since a virtuous man of low birth deserves to be worshipped even by great powerful khattiyas
Virtue surpasses material wealth for it cannot be confiscated by thieves follows one to the world beyond produces great fruit and acts as the foundation for such qualities as serenity etc
And because of their virtue beings attain sovereignty in their respective orders Virtue is superior even to life for it is said that a single day in the life of the virtuous is better than a hundred years of life devoid of virtue  and there being life the disavowal of the training is called death 
Virtue surpasses the achievement of beauty for it makes one beautiful even to ones enemies and it cannot be vanquished by the adversities of aging and sickness
As the foundation for distinguished states of happiness virtue surpasses such distinguished dwellings as palaces mansions etc and such distinguished social positions as that of a king prince or general
Because it promotes ones highest welfare and follows one to the world beyond virtue surpasses kinsmen and friends even those who are close and affectionate
Again in accomplishing the difficult task of selfprotection virtue is superior to troops of elephants horses chariots and infantry as well as to such devices as mantras spells and blessings for it depends on oneself does not depend on others and has a great sphere of influence
Thus it is said The Dhamma protects the one who lives by the Dhamma 
When one reflects in this way upon the numerous noble qualities of virtue ones unfulfilled achievement of virtue will become fulfilled and ones unpurified virtue will become purified
If due to their cumulative force states antithetical to virtue such as aversion should arise from time to time the aspirant should reflect Did you not make the resolution to win full enlightenment One defective in virtue cannot even succeed in mundane affairs much less in supramundane matters You should reach the peak of virtue for virtue is the foundation for supreme enlightenment the foremost of all achievements You should always be well behaved safeguarding your virtue perfectly more carefully than a hen safeguarding its eggs
Further by teaching the Dhamma you should help beings to enter and reach maturity in the three vehicles But the word of a morally dubious man is no more reliable than the remedy of a doctor who does not consider what is suitable for his patients How can I be trustworthy so that I can help beings to enter and reach maturity in the three vehicles I must be pure in character and in virtue
How can I acquire the distinguished attainments such as the jhānas etc so that I will be capable of helping others and of fulfilling the perfection of wisdom etc The distinguished attainments such as the jhānas etc are not possible without purification of virtue Therefore virtue should be made perfectly pure
The perfection of renunciation should be reflected upon by first discerning the dangers in household life according to the text Household life is constricting a path for the dust of passions etc  in sense pleasures according to the text Sense pleasures are like a skeleton etc  and in sensual desire according to the text Suppose a man borrowed a loan and undertook work etc  Then in the opposite way one should reflect upon the benefits in going forth according to the text Going forth is like open space etc 
This is a brief statement For details one should consult such suttas as The Great Mass of Suffering or The Simile of the Venomous Snakes 
For the perfection of wisdom the noble qualities of wisdom should be considered as follows Without wisdom the virtues such as giving do not become purified and cannot perform their respective functions
Just as without life the bodily organism loses its luster and cannot perform its proper activities and as without consciousness the sense faculties cannot exercise their functions in their respective spheres just so without wisdom the faculties such as faith etc cannot perform their functions Wisdom is the chief cause for the practice of the other pāramīs
By means of wisdom the act of relinquishing exercised with skillful means and practiced for the welfare of others attains the status of a pāramī
Again without wisdom virtue cannot be severed from the defilements of craving etc and therefore cannot even reach purification much less serve as the foundation for the qualities of an omniscient Buddha
Only the man of wisdom clearly recognizes the dangers in household life in the strands of sense pleasure and in saṃsāra and sees the benefits in going forth in attaining the jhānas and in realizing nibbāna and he alone goes forth into homelessness develops the jhānic attainments and directed towards nibbāna establishes others therein
Energy devoid of wisdom does not accomplish the purpose desired since it is wrongly aroused and it is better not to arouse energy at all than to arouse it in the wrong way
But when energy is conjoined with wisdom there is nothing it cannot accomplish if equipped with the proper means
Again only the man of wisdom can patiently tolerate the wrongs of others not the dullwitted man
In the man lacking wisdom the wrongs of others only provoke impatience but for the wise they call his patience into play and make it grow even stronger
The wise man having understood as they really are three noble truths their causes and opposites never speaks deceptively to others
So too having fortified himself with the power of wisdom the wise man in his fortitude forms an unshakable determination to undertake all the pāramīs
Only the man of wisdom is skillful in providing for the welfare of all beings without discriminating between dear people neutrals and enemies
And only by means of wisdom can he remain indifferent to the vicissitudes of the world such as gain and loss without being affected by them
In this way one should reflect upon the noble qualities of wisdom recognizing it to be the cause for the purification of all the pāramīs
Furthermore without wisdom there is no achievement of vision and without the achievement of vision there can be no accomplishment in virtue One lacking virtue and vision cannot achieve concentration and without concentration one cannot even secure ones own welfare much less the lofty goal of providing for the welfare of others Therefore a bodhisattva practicing for the welfare of others should admonish himself Have you made a thorough effort to purify your wisdom
For it is by the spiritual power of wisdom that the Great Beings established in the four foundations benefit the world with the four bases of beneficence help beings enter the path to emancipation and bring their faculties to maturity
Without energy a man cannot even achieve success in worldly works directed to visible ends But there is nothing the energetic indefatigable man cannot achieve
One lacking energy cannot undertake to rescue all beings from the great flood of saṃsāra
But one bristling with energy can achieve perfection in all he undertakes The perfection of energy should be reflected upon thus 
The noble qualities of energy should be further reviewed as follows One intent on rescuing himself alone from the mire of saṃsāra cannot fulfil his ideal if he relaxes his energy how much less one who aspires to rescue the entire world And Through the power of energy such wrong thoughts as the following are kept away It is quite right for you to escape from the suffering of saṃsāra by yourself alone for so long as you are a foolish worldling the host of defilements is as difficult to restrain as a herd of mad elephants the kamma caused by them is like a murderer with drawn sword the evil destinations based on these actions stand constantly before you with open doors and evil friends are always around to enjoin you in those actions and admonish you to practice them  And If even full enlightenment can be achieved by ones own energy what can be difficult
The perfection of patience should be considered next Patience is the unimpeded weapon of the good in the development of noble qualities for it dispels anger the opposite of all such qualities without residue It is the adornment of those capable of vanquishing the foe the strength of recluses and brahmins a stream of water extinguishing the fire of anger the basis for acquiring a good reputation a mantra for quelling the poisonous speech of evil people the supreme source of constancy in those established in restraint Patience is an ocean on account of its depth a shore bounding the great ocean of hatred a panel closing off the door to the plane of misery a staircase ascending to the worlds of the gods and Brahmās the ground for the habitation of all noble qualities the supreme purification of body speech and mind
Patience should be further strengthened by reflecting Those who lack patience are afflicted in this world and apply themselves to actions that will lead to their affliction in the life to come And Although this suffering arises through the wrong deeds of others this body of mine is the field for that suffering and the action which is its seed was sown by me alone And This suffering will release me from the debt of that kamma And If there were no wrongdoers how could I accomplish the perfection of patience And Although he is a wrongdoer now in the past he was my benefactor And A wrongdoer is also a benefactor for he is the basis for the developing of patience And All beings are like my own children Who becomes angry over the misdeeds of his own children And He wrongs me because of some residue of anger in myself I should remove this residue And I am just as much the cause as he is for the wrong on account of which this suffering has arisen And All those dhammas by which wrong was done and those to whom it was doneall those at this very moment have ceased With whom then should you now be angry and by whom should anger be aroused When all dhammas are nonself who can do wrong to whom
If due to its cumulative force anger caused by the wrongs of others should continue to overpower the mind one should reflect Patience is the contributive cause for rendering help to others in return for their wrongs And This wrong by causing me suffering is a condition for faith since suffering is said to be the decisive support for faith and it is also a condition for the perception of discontent with all the world  And This is the nature of the sense facultiesto encounter desirable and undesirable objects
How then is it possible not to encounter undesirable objects And Under the control of anger a person becomes mad and distraught so why retaliate And All these beings are watched over by the Buddha as if they were his own dear children Therefore I should not be angry with them And When the wrongdoer is endowed with noble qualities I should not be angry with him And when he does not have any noble qualities then I should regard him with compassion And Because of anger my fame and noble qualities diminish and to the pleasure of my enemies I become ugly sleep in discomfort etc And Anger is the only real enemy for it is the agent of all harm and the destroyer of all good And When one has patience one has no enemies And Because of his wrong the wrongdoer will meet suffering in the future but so long as I remain patient I will not And Enemies are the consequence of my angry thought When I vanquish anger by patience my foe who is the byproduct of my anger will also be vanquished And I should not relinquish the noble quality of patience because of a little anger Anger is the antithesis and obstruction to all noble qualities so if I become angry how can my virtue etc reach fulfilment And when those qualities are absent how can I devote myself to helping other beings and attain the ultimate goal in accordance with my vows And When there is patience the mind becomes concentrated free from external distraction With the mind concentrated all formations appear to reflection as impermanent and suffering all dhammas as nonself nibbāna as unconditioned deathless peaceful and sublime and the Buddhaqualities as endowed with inconceivable and immeasurable potency
Then established in acquiescence in conformity the groundlessness of all Imaking and minemaking becomes evident to reflection thus Mere dhammas alone exist devoid of a self or of anything pertaining to a self They arise and pass away in accordance with their conditions They do not come from anywhere they do not go anywhere they are not established anywhere There is no agency in anything whatsoever In this way a bodhisattva becomes fixed in his destiny bound for enlightenment irreversible This is the method of reflecting upon the perfection of patience
The perfection of truthfulness should be reviewed thus Without truthfulness virtue etc is impossible and there can be no practice in accordance with ones vows All evil states converge upon the transgression of truth One who is not devoted to truth is unreliable and his word cannot be accepted in the future On the other hand one devoted to truth secures the foundation of all noble qualities With truthfulness as the foundation he is capable of purifying and fulfilling all the requisites of enlightenment Not deceived about the true nature of dhammas he performs the functions of all the requisites of enlightenment and completes the practice of the bodhisattva path
The perfection of determination should be reviewed thus Without firmly undertaking the practice of giving  maintaining an unshakable determination in the encounter with their opposites and practicing them with constancy and vigor the bases of enlightenmentie the requisites such as giving etcdo not arise
The noble qualities of loving kindness should be reflected upon as follows One resolved only upon his own welfare cannot achieve success in this world or a happy rebirth in the life to come without some concern for the welfare of others how then can one wishing to establish all beings in the attainment of nibbāna succeed without loving kindness And if you wish to ultimately lead all beings to the supramundane achievement of nibbāna you should begin by wishing for their mundane success here and now And I cannot provide for the welfare and happiness of others merely by wishing for it Let me put forth effort to accomplish it And Now I support them by promoting their welfare and happiness afterwards they will be my companions in sharing the Dhamma And Without these beings I could not acquire the requisites of enlightenment Since they are the cause for the manifestation and perfecting of all the Buddhaqualities these beings are for me a supreme field of merit the incomparable basis for planting wholesome roots the ultimate object of reverence Thus one should arouse an especially strong inclination towards promoting the welfare of all beings And why should loving kindness be developed towards all beings Because it is the foundation for compassion
For when one delights in providing for the welfare and happiness of other beings with an unbounded heart the desire to remove their affliction and suffering becomes powerful and firmly rooted
And compassion is the first of all the dhammas culminating in Buddhahoodtheir footing foundation root head and chief
The perfection of equanimity should be considered thus When there is no equanimity the offensive actions performed by beings cause oscillation in the mind And when the mind oscillates it is impossible to practice the requisites of enlightenment And Even though the mind has been softened with the moisture of loving kindness without equanimity one cannot purify the requisites of enlightenment and cannot dedicate ones requisites of merit along with their results to furthering the welfare of beings Moreover the undertaking determination fulfilment and completion of all the requisites of enlightenment succeed through the power of equanimity For without equanimity the aspirant cannot relinquish something without making false discriminations over gifts and recipients Without equanimity he cannot purify his virtue without always thinking about the obstacles to his life and to his vital needs Equanimity perfects the power of renunciation for by its means he overcomes discontent and delight It perfects the functions of all the requisites to examine them according to their origin When energy is aroused to excess because it hasnt been examined with equanimity it cannot perform its proper function of striving Forbearance and reflective acquiescence are possible only in one possessed of equanimity Because of this quality he does not speak deceptively about beings or formations By looking upon the vicissitudes of worldly events with an equal mind his determination to fulfil the practices he has undertaken becomes completely unshakable And because he is unconcerned over the wrongs done by others he perfects the abiding in loving kindness Thus equanimity is indispensable to the practice of all the other pāramīs Such is the reflection on the perfection of equanimity
Thus reviewing the danger in their opposites and the benefits in their practice is a condition for the pāramīs
Another condition for the pāramīs consists in the fifteen dhammas comprising right conduct and the five mundane kinds of direct knowledge together with their requisites
The thirteen ascetic practices and the qualities such as fewness of wishes are the requisites for the four states beginning with restraint by virtue
Among the seven good dhammas the requisites for faith are the seven recollectionsof the Buddha the Dhamma and the Saṅgha of virtue generosity the deities and peace the avoidance of mean people and association with affectionate people reflection upon things inspiring confidence and the disposition towards faith
The requisites for shame and moral dread are reflection upon the danger in immoral conduct reflection upon the danger in the plane of misery reflection on the fortifying character of wholesome states the avoidance of people devoid of shame and moral dread and association with people endowed with these qualities and the disposition towards shame and moral dread
The requisites for learning are previous effort interrogation application to the true Dhamma the study of blameless branches of knowledge maturity of the faculties remoteness from the defilements the avoidance of ignorant people and association with learned people and the disposition towards erudition
The requisites for energy are reflection upon the fearfulness in the plane of misery reflection upon the course to be followed reflection upon the greatness of the Dhamma the dispelling of sloth and torpor the avoidance of lazy people and association with energetic people reflection upon right endeavor and the disposition towards energy
The requisites for mindfulness are mindfulness and clear comprehension the avoidance of people with confused mindfulness and association with people with established mindfulness and the disposition towards mindfulness
And the requisites for wisdom are interrogation the cleansing of the bases  the harmonization of the faculties the avoidance of dullwitted people and association with wise people reflection upon the profound course of knowledge and the inclination towards wisdom
The requisites for the four jhānas are the four factors beginning with restraint by virtue the development of meditation in the preliminary portion with a certain object among the thirtyeight objects of meditation and the five achievements of mastery
But we do not adduce it at length for fear of getting caught up in excessive details
So too the wheels of achievement etc are also conditions for the pāramīs
This is the aspiration supported by the eight qualifications  which occurs thus Crossed I would cross freed I would free tamed I would tame calmed I would calm comforted I would comfort attained to nibbāna I would lead to nibbāna purified I would purify enlightened I would enlighten
The human state 
the human state the male sex the cause the sight of the Master
the going forth the achievement of noble qualities extreme dedication and strong desire
 The eight qualifications through which the aspiration succeeds are 
Because these other states do not correspond with the state of a Buddha 
Why
If he were to hear He alone can attain Buddhahood who can tread across a whole world system that has become a solid mass of sharp pointed swordstakes cross over and reach the other side etc
If he were to hear He alone can attain Buddhahood who can cut through a whole world system that has become a jungle of thorny creepers covered by a solid thicket of bamboo cross over and reach the other side etc
for in the presence of former Buddhas he has made the resolution for full enlightenment declaring mentally or verbally I too would become a perfectly enlightened Buddha and promote the welfare and happiness of all beings
for the welfare and happiness of the many out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of gods and men but not so the others
He is dear revered and esteemed A teacher patient in speech
The internal power is the longing or undeviating inclination for the supreme enlightenment which is grounded upon personal ideals and in reverence for the Dhamma through this power the Great Man dominated by his personal ideals and upheld by a sense of shame forms the aspiration fulfills the pāramīs and attains the supreme enlightenment
yet his mind does not become defiled by worldly affection for children
Another set of conditions is the six inclinationsthe inclinations towards renunciation solitude nongreed nonhatred nondelusion and escape
So too for bodhisattvas striving for enlightenment the inclination towards each of the ten pāramīs is a condition for the practice of each
since giving to those who ask wins their affection
and the virtuous man is not subject to the remorse which arises in the immoral man when he thinks I have committed evil wicked sinful deeds
Because it enables one to achieve supreme sovereignty over ones own mind virtue surpasses the sovereignty of khattiyas etc
For when their wisdomeyes open up the great bodhisattvas give even their own limbs and organs without extolling themselves and disparaging others Like medicinetrees they give devoid of discrimination filled with joy throughout the three times
but giving for ones own benefit is like an investment
Through the power of wisdom again they are devoted to the investigation of the aggregates sense bases etc fully comprehend the processes of origination and cessation in accordance with actuality develop the qualities of giving etc to the stages of distinction and penetration and perfect the training of bodhisattvas Thus the perfection of wisdom should be reinforced by determining the noble qualities of wisdom with their numerous modes and constituents
even if his energy is only moderate he will give up in the middle
Herein the dhammas comprising right conduct are restraint by virtue guarding the doors of the sense faculties moderation in eating application to wakefulness the seven good dhammas and the four jhānas
The way the factors of right conduct etc serve as conditions for the requisites of enlightenment  can be adduced as follows He is capable of offering the gift of fearlessness to beings through the purification of his means by virtue etc of offering material gifts through the purification of his end  and of offering the gift of the Dhamma through the purification of both and so on as is appropriate in each case
What is their defilement 
In general being misapprehended by craving etc is the defilement of all the pāramīs
Taken separately discriminating thoughts over gifts and recipients are the defilement of the perfection of giving Discriminating thoughts over beings and times are the defilement of the perfection of virtue Discriminating thoughts of delight in sense pleasures and existence and of discontent with their pacification are the defilement of the perfection of renunciation Discriminating thoughts of I and mine are the defilement of the perfection of wisdom discriminating thoughts leaning to listlessness and restlessness of the perfection of energy discriminating thoughts of oneself and others of the perfection of patience discriminating thoughts of avowing to have seen what was not seen etc of the perfection of truthfulness discriminating thoughts perceiving flaws in the requisites of enlightenment and virtues in their opposites of the perfection of determination discriminating thoughts confusing what is harmful with what is beneficial of the perfection of loving kindness and discriminating thoughts over the desirable and undesirable of the perfection of equanimity Thus the defilements should be understood
What is their cleansing 
Their cleansing is the removal of the taints of craving etc and the absence of the aforementioned discriminations
For the pāramīs become pure and luminous when untainted by such defilements as craving conceit views anger malice denigration domineering envy stinginess craftiness hypocrisy obstinacy presumption vanity and negligence and when devoid of the discriminating thoughts over gifts and recipients etc
Further giving is opposed to greed hatred and delusion since it applies the qualities of nongreed non hatred and nondelusion to gifts recipients and the fruits of giving respectively Virtue is opposed to greed hatred and delusion since it removes crookedness and corruption in bodily conduct etc Renunciation is opposed to these three corruptions since it avoids indulgence in sense pleasures the affliction of others and self mortification Wisdom opposes them in so far as greed etc create blindness while knowledge restores sight Energy opposes them by arousing the true way free from both listlessness and restlessness Patience opposes them by accepting the desirable the undesirable and emptiness Truthfulness is their opposite because it proceeds in accordance with fact whether others render help or inflict harm Determination is the opposite of these three defilements since after vanquishing the vicissitudes of the world it remains unshakable in fulfilling the requisites of enlightenment in the way they have been undertaken Loving kindness is the opposite of greed hatred and delusion through its seclusion from the hindrances And equanimity is their opposite by dispelling attraction and repulsion towards desirable and undesirable objects respectively and by proceeding evenly under varying circumstances
 What are their opposites 
In general all the defilements and all unwholesome dhammas are their opposites Taken separately stinginess is the opposite of giving and so on as mentioned earlier
 How are they to be practiced
The perfection of giving firstly is to be practiced by benefitting beings in many waysby relinquishing ones happiness belongings body and life to others by dispelling their fear and by instructing them in the Dhamma
Herein giving is threefold by way of the object to be given the giving of material things  the giving of fearlessness  and the giving of the Dhamma 
Among these the object to be given can be twofold internal and external
The external gift is tenfold food drink garments vehicles garlands scents unguents bedding dwellings and lamps
These gifts again become manifold by analyzing each into its constituents eg food into hard food soft food etc
The sense objects such as visible forms become manifold when analyzed into blue etc
He gives generously not ungenerously He gives sufficiently not insufficiently when there is something to be given
And when there is not enough to give sufficiently to all he distributes evenly whatever can be shared
But he does not give things that bring affliction to others such as weapons poisons and intoxicants Nor does he give amusements that are harmful and lead to negligence
And he does not give unsuitable food or drink to a person who is sick even though he might ask for it and he does not give what is suitable beyond the proper measure
Again when asked he gives to householders things appropriate for householders and to monks things appropriate for monks He gives to his mother and father kinsmen and relatives friends and colleagues children wife slaves and workers without causing pain to anyone Having promised an excellent gift he does not give something mean He does not give because he desires gain honor or fame or because he expects something in return or out of expectation of some fruit other than the supreme enlightenment He does not give detesting the gift or those who ask He does not give a discarded object as a gift not even to unrestrained beggars who revile and abuse him Invariably he gives with care with a serene mind full of compassion He does not give through belief in superstitious omens but he gives believing in kamma and its fruit When he gives he does not afflict those who ask by making them do homage to him etc but he gives without afflicting others He does not give a gift with the intention of deceiving others or with the intention of injuring he gives only with an undefiled mind He does not give a gift with harsh words or a frown but with words of endearment congenial speech and a smile on his face Whenever greed for a particular object becomes excessive due to its high value and beauty its antiquity or personal attachment the bodhisattva recognizes his greed quickly dispels it seeks out some recipients and gives it away And if there should be an object of limited value that can be given and a suppliant expecting it without a second thought he bestirs himself and gives it to him honoring him as though he were an uncelebrated sage
Asked for his own children wife slaves workers and servants the Great Man does not give them while they are as yet unwilling to go afflicted with grief But when they are willing and joyful then he gives them
But if he knows that those who ask for them are demonic beingsogres demons or goblinsor men of cruel disposition then he does not give them away So too he will not give his kingdom
to those intent on the harm suffering and affliction of the world but he would give it away to righteous men who protect the world with Dhamma
This firstly is the way to practice the giving of external gifts
The internal gift should be understood in two ways
How
Just as a man for the sake of food and clothing surrenders himself to another and enters into servitude and slavery in the same way the Great Man wishing for the supreme welfare and happiness of all beings desiring to fulfil his own perfection of giving with a spiritually oriented mind for the sake of enlightenment surrenders himself to another and enters into servitude placing himself at the disposal of others
Whatever limbs or organs of his might be needed by others hands feet eyes etche gives them away to those who need them without trembling and without cowering He is no more attached to them and no more shrinks away than if they were external objects Thus the Great Man relinquishes an internal object in two ways for the enjoyment of others according to their pleasure or while fulfilling the wishes of those who ask for his own selfmastery In this matter he is completely generous and thinks I will attain enlightenment through nonattachment
Thus the giving of the internal gift should be understood
Herein giving an internal gift he gives only what leads to the welfare of the recipient and nothing else
The Great Man does not knowingly give his own body limbs and organs to Māra or to the malevolent deities in Māras company thinking Let this not lead to their harm
And likewise he does not give to those possessed by Māra or his deities or to madmen
But when asked for these things by others he gives immediately because of the rarity of such a request and the difficulty of making such a gift
The giving of fearlessness is the giving of protection to beings when they have become frightened on account of kings thieves fire water enemies lions tigers other wild beasts dragons ogres demons goblins etc
This is the method In brief he gives a talk on giving on virtue and on heaven on the unsatisfactoriness and defilement in sense pleasures and on the benefit in renouncing them
In detail to those whose minds are disposed towards the enlightenment of disciples he gives a discourse establishing and purifying them by elaborating upon the noble qualities of whichever among the following topics is appropriate going for refuge restraint by virtue guarding the doors of the sense faculties moderation in eating application to wakefulness the seven good dhammas application to serenity by practicing meditation on one of the thirtyeight objects  application to insight by contemplating the objects of insight interpretation such as the material body the progressive stages of purification the apprehension of the course of rightness the three kinds of clear knowledge the six direct knowledges the four discriminations and the enlightenment of a disciple
Thus the Great Man gives the gift of the Dhamma to beings
When he gives a material gift the Great Man gives food thinking May I by this gift enable beings to achieve long life beauty happiness strength intelligence and the supreme fruit of unsullied bliss He gives drink wishing to allay the thirst of sensual defilements garments to gain the adornments of shame and moral dread and the golden complexion  vehicles for attaining the modes of psychic potency and the bliss of nibbāna scents for producing the sweet scent of virtue garlands and unguents for producing the beauty of the Buddhaqualities seats for producing the seat on the terrace of enlightenment bedding for producing the bed of a Tathāgatas rest dwellings so he might become a refuge for beings lamps so he might obtain the five eyes He gives visible forms for producing the fathomwide aura  sounds for producing the Brahmālike voice  tastes for endearing himself to all the world and tangibles for acquiring a Buddhas elegance He gives medicines so he might later give the ageless and deathless state of nibbāna He gives slaves the gift of freedom so he might later emancipate beings from the slavery of the defilements He gives blameless amusements and enjoyments in order to produce delight in the true Dhamma He gives his own children as a gift in order that he might adopt all beings as his children by granting them an ariyan birth He gives his wife as a gift in order that he might become master over the entire world He gives gifts of gold gems pearls coral etc in order to achieve the major marks of physical beauty  and gifts of the diverse means of beautification in order to achieve the minor features of physical beauty He gives his treasuries as a gift in order to obtain the treasury of the true Dhamma the gift of his kingdom in order to become the king of the Dhamma the gift of monasteries parks ponds and groves in order to achieve the jhānas etc the gift of his feet in order that he might approach the terrace of enlightenment with feet marked with the auspicious wheels the gift of his hands in order that he might give to beings the rescuing hand of the true Dhamma to help them across the four floods the gift of his ears nose etc in order to obtain the spiritual faculties of faith etc the gift of his eyes in order to obtain the universal eye the gift of his flesh and blood with the thought May my body be the means of life for all the world May it bring welfare and happiness to all beings at all times even on occasions of merely seeing hearing recollecting or ministering to me  And he gives the gift of his head in order to become supreme in all the world
Giving thus the Great Man does not give unwillingly nor by afflicting others nor out of fear moral shame or the scolding of those in need of gifts When there is something excellent he does not give what is mean He does not give extolling himself and disparaging others He does not give out of desire for the fruit nor with loathing for those who ask nor with lack of consideration Rather he gives thoroughly with his own hand at the proper time considerately without discrimination
filled with joy throughout the three times Having given he does not become remorseful afterwards
The external gift can also become sixfold when analyzed by way of sense object  visible forms sounds smells tastes tangibles and nonsensory objects
So too the external gift is manifold by way of the divers valuables and belongings such as gems gold silver pearls coral etc fields lands parks etc slaves cows buffaloes etc
When the Great Man gives an external object he gives whatever is needed to whomever stands in need of it and knowing by himself that someone is in need of something he gives it even unasked much more when asked
He does not give because he expects something in return
The giving of the Dhamma is an undistorted discourse on the Dhamma given with an undefiled mind that is methodical instruction conducive to good in the present life to good in the life to come and to the ultimate good By means of such discourses those who have not entered the Buddhas Dispensation enter it while those who have entered it reach maturity therein
So too for beings whose minds are disposed towards the enlightenment of paccekabuddhas and of perfectly enlightened Buddhas he gives a discourse establishing and purifying them in the two vehicles by elaborating upon the greatness of the spiritual power of those Buddhas and by explaining the specific nature characteristic function etc of the ten pāramīs in their three stages
He does not become either conceited or obsequious in relation to the recipients but behaves amiably towards them Bountiful and liberal he gives things together with a bonus
For when he gives food thinking I will give this along with a bonus he gives garments etc as well
And when he gives garments thinking I will give this along with a bonus he gives food etc as well
And when he gives a gift of one of the sense objects such as visible forms he gives the other sense objects also as a bonus
The gift of visible forms should be understood thus Having gained something such as a flower garment or relic of a blue yellow red or white color etc considering it in terms of its visible form thinking to make a gift of a visible form he offers it to a worthy recipient together with its base
The gift of sounds should be understood by way of the sounds of drums etc
It is certainly not possible to give a sound as one gives a cluster of lotuses tearing it out by its bulb and roots and placing it in the hands But one gives a gift of sound by giving its base
Thus he makes a gift of sound by presenting a musical instrument such as drums or tom toms to the Triple Gem
The gift of scents is made when after getting a delightfully scented object such as scented roots powdered scent etc considering it in terms of its scent thinking to make a gift of scent he offers it to the Triple Gem He relinquishes a scented object such as agaru or sandalwood for the purpose of making an offering of scent
The gift of tastes is made when after getting a delightfully flavored object such as flavored roots etc considering it in terms of its taste thinking to make a gift of taste he gives it to worthy recipients Or he relinquishes a flavorful object such as grain cows etc
The gift of tangibles should be understood by way of beds chairs etc and by way of coverlets and mantels etc
The gift of mental objects  should be understood by way of nutriment drink and life since it is the mentalobject base that is intended here
Having gained a delightful object such as nutriment considering it as part of the mentalobject base thinking to make a gift of a nonsensory object he gives nutrimentie ghee butter etc
This entire accomplishment in giving he dedicates to the welfare and happiness of the whole world and to his own unshakable emancipation through supreme enlightenment
He dedicates it to the attainment of inexhaustible desire  inexhaustible concentration ingenuity knowledge and emancipation
In practicing the perfection of giving the Great Being should apply the perception of impermanence to life and possessions He should consider them as shared in common with many and should constantly and continuously arouse great compassion towards beings
Just as when a house is blazing the owner removes all his property of essential value and himself as well without leaving anything important behind so does the Great Man invariably give without discrimination and without concern
This is the method of practicing the perfection of giving
Now comes the method of practicing the perfection of virtue Since the Great Man desires to adorn beings with the adornment of the virtue of the omniscient at the beginning he must first purify his own virtue
Herein virtue is purified in four modes by the purification of ones inclinations  by the undertaking of precepts  by nontransgression  and by making amends for transgressions 
For someone who is dominated by personal ideals is naturally disgusted with evil through the purity of his own inclinations and purifies his conduct by arousing his inward sense of shame
Someone else who is dominated by a consideration for the world afraid of evil purifies his conduct by receiving precepts from another person and by arousing his sense of moral dread
Both establish themselves in virtue through non transgression
But if due to forgetfulness they sometimes break a precept
Virtue is twofold as avoidance and performance 
Herein this is the method by which virtue as avoidance should be practiced A bodhisattva should have such a heart of sympathy for all beings that he does not feel any resentment towards anyone even in a dream
Because he is dedicated to helping others he would no more misappropriate the belongings of others than he would take hold of a poisonous watersnake
If he is a monk he should live remote from unchastity abstaining from the seven bonds of sexuality not to speak of adultery
When he speaks his statements should be truthful beneficial and endearing and his talk measured timely and concerned with the Dhamma His mind should always be devoid of covetousness ill will and inverted views He should possess the knowledge of the ownership of kamma and have settled faith and affection for recluses and brahmins who are faring and practicing rightly
Because he abstains from unwholesome states and from the unwholesome courses of kamma leading to the four planes of misery and the suffering of the round and because he is established in the wholesome courses of kamma leading to heaven and liberation through the purity of his end and the purity of his means the Great Mans wishes for the welfare and happiness of beings succeed immediately exactly in the way they are formed
Since he desists from injuring others he gives the gift of fearlessness to all beings He perfects the meditation on loving kindness without trouble and enjoys the eleven benefits of loving kindness  He is healthy and robust attains longevity abundant happiness and distinguished characteristics and eradicates the mental impression of hatred
So too because he desists from taking what is not given his possessions cannot be confiscated by thieves etc
By desisting from unchastity he becomes unexcitable peaceful in body and mind dear and agreeable unsuspicious to beings A good report circulates concerning him He is without lust or attachment to women is devoted to renunciation achieves distinguished characteristics and eradicates the mental impression of greed
By desisting from false speech his word comes to be authoritative for others He is regarded as reliable and trustworthy one whose statements are always accepted He is dear and agreeable to deities His mouth gives off a sweet fragrance and his bodily and vocal conduct are protected He achieves distinguished characteristics and eradicates the mental impressions of the defilements
By desisting from slander he obtains a retinue and following that cannot be divided by the attacks of others He possesses unbreakable faith in the true Dhamma He is a firm friend as exceedingly dear to beings as though they were acquainted with him in the last existence And he is devoted to nondefilement
By desisting from harsh speech he becomes dear and agreeable to beings pleasant in character sweet in speech held in esteem And he develops a voice endowed with eight factors
By desisting from idle chatter he becomes dear and agreeable to beings revered held in esteem His statements are accepted and his talk is measured
He acquires great influence and power and becomes skillful in answering the questions of others with the ingenuity that creates opportunities  And when he reaches the plane of Buddhahood he becomes capable of answering the numerous questions of beings speaking numerous languages all with a single reply
Through his freedom from covetousness he gains what he wishes and obtains whatever excellent possessions he needs He is honored by powerful khattiyas He can never be vanquished by his adversaries is never defective in his faculties and becomes the peerless individual
Through his freedom from ill will he gains a pleasant appearance He is esteemed by others and because he delights in the welfare of beings he automatically inspires their confidence He becomes lofty in character abides in loving kindness and acquires great influence and power
Through his freedom from wrong view he gains good companions Even if he is threatened with the guillotine he will not perform an evil deed Because he holds to the ownership of kamma he does not believe in superstitious omens His faith in the true Dhamma is established and firmly rooted He has faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgatas and no more delights in the diversity of outside creeds than a royal swan delights in a dung heap He is skillful in fully understanding the three characteristics  and in the end gains the unobstructed knowledge of omniscience Until he attains final enlightenment he becomes the foremost in whatever order of beings  and acquires the most excellent achievements
Thus esteeming virtue as the foundation for all achievementsas the soil for the origination of all the Buddhaqualities the beginning footing head and chief of all the dhammas culminating in Buddhahoodand recognizing gain honor and fame as a foe in the guise of a friend a bodhisattva should diligently and thoroughly perfect his virtue as a hen guards its eggs through the power of mindfulness and clear comprehension in the control of bodily and vocal action in the taming of the sense faculties in purification of livelihood and in the use of the requisites
This firstly is the method of practicing virtue as avoidance
The practice of virtue as performance should be understood as follows Herein at the appropriate time a bodhisattva practices paying homage rising up making reverential salutations and courteous conduct towards good friends worthy of reverence At the appropriate time he renders them service and he waits upon them when they are sick
When he receives wellspoken advice he expresses his appreciation He praises the noble qualities of the virtuous and patiently endures the abuse of antagonists He remembers help rendered to him by others rejoices in their merits dedicates his own merits to the supreme enlightenment and always abides diligently in the practice of wholesome dhammas When he commits a transgression he acknowledges it as such and confesses it to his coreligionists Afterwards he perfectly fulfils the right practice
He is adroit and nimble in fulfilling his duties towards beings when these are conducive to their good He serves as their companion
When beings are afflicted with the suffering of disease etc he prepares the appropriate remedy
He dispels the sorrow of those afflicted by the loss of wealth etc Of a helpful disposition he restrains with Dhamma those who need to be restrained rehabilitates them from unwholesome ways and establishes them in wholesome courses of conduct
He inspires with Dhamma those in need of inspiration
And when he hears about the loftiest most difficult inconceivably powerful deeds of the great bodhisattvas of the past resulting in the ultimate welfare and happiness of beings by means of which they reached perfect maturity in the requisites of enlightenment he does not become agitated and alarmed but reflects Those Great Beings were only human But by developing themselves through the orderly fulfilment of the training they attained the loftiest spiritual power and the highest perfection in the requisites of enlightenment I too should practice the same training in virtue etc In that way I too will gradually fulfil the training and in the end attain the same state
Then with unflagging energy preceded by this faith he perfectly fulfils the training in virtue etc Again he conceals his virtues and reveals his faults He is few in his wishes content fond of solitude aloof capable of enduring suffering and free from anxiety He is not restless puffed up fickle scurrilous or scattered in speech but calm in his faculties and mind Avoiding such wrong means of livelihood as scheming etc he is endowed with proper conduct and a suitable resort  He sees danger in the slightest faults and having undertaken the rules of training trains himself in them energetic and resolute without regard for body or life He does not tolerate even the slightest concern for his body or life but abandons and dispels it how much more then excessive concern
He abandons and dispels all the corruptions such as anger malice etc which are the cause for moral depravity
He does not become complacent over some minor achievement of distinction and does not shrink away but strives for successively higher achievements
In this way the achievements he gains do not partake of diminution or stagnation The Great Man serves as a guide for the blind explaining to them the right path To the deaf he gives signals with gestures of his hands and in that way benefits them with good So too for the dumb
To cripples he gives a chair or a vehicle or some other means of conveyance
He strives that the faithless may gain faith that the lazy may generate zeal that those of confused mindfulness may develop mindfulness that those with wandering minds may become accomplished in concentration and that the dullwitted may acquire wisdom
He strives to dispel sensual desire
Out of gratitude to those who have helped him he benefits and honors them with a similar or greater benefit in return congenial in speech and endearing in his words
He is a companion in misfortune
Understanding the nature and character of beings he associates with whatever beings need his presence in whatever way they need it
But he proceeds only by rehabilitating them from the unwholesome and establishing them in the wholesome not in other ways
For in order to protect the minds of others bodhisattvas behave only in ways which increase the wholesome
He does not criticize those who are dear to others in front of them nor praise those who are resented by them
He is not intimate with those who are not trustworthy
He does not refuse a proper invitation
He encourages those endowed with faith with a discourse on the benefits of faith
If the bodhisattva has attained to the direct knowledges he may inspire a sense of spiritual urgency in the negligent by showing them the fate of those in hell etc as is fit Thereby he establishes the faithless in faith 
and brings to maturity those already endowed with these qualities
In this way through his virtuous conduct the Great Mans immeasurable flood of merit and goodness ascends to ever increasing heights
The detailed explanation of virtue is given in diverse ways in the Visuddhimagga in the passage beginning Virtue is the states beginning with volition present in one who abstains from the destruction of life etc or in one who fulfills the practice of the duties  All that should be brought in here
The same method with gifts of vehicles etc
or by giving medicine for the voice such as oil and molasses to preachers of the Dhamma or by announcing a lecture on the Dhamma chanting the scriptures giving a discourse on the Dhamma holding a discussion or expressing appreciation for the good deeds of others
For having gained some soft delightful blameless tangible object such as a bed chair cushion pillow undergarment or upper garment considering it in terms of its tangible qualities thinking to make a gift of a tangible item he gives it to worthy recipients
having gained the aforesaid tangible objects he relinquishes them
or a drinkie the eight kinds of drink such as mango juice etc or considering it a gift of life he gives a ticketmeal or a fortnightly meal etc gets doctors to wait upon the sick and afflicted liberates animals from a net has a fishing net or birdcage destroyed releases prisoners from prison causes an injunction to be given forbidding the slaughter of animals or undertakes any action of a similar nature for the sake of protecting the life of beings
through their sense of shame and moral dread respectively they quickly make amends for it through the proper means of rehabilitation
If he is a householder he should never arouse even an evil thought of lust for the wives of others
and his pāramīs reach fulfilment for such is his nature
He is unsuspicious to others dear and agreeable trustworthy unattached to prosperity and success inclined to relinquishing and he eradicates the mental impression of greed
ill will slothandtorpor restlessnessandworry and perplexity in those obsessed by these hindrances
and to dispel wrong thoughts of sensuality ill will and aggression in those subjugated by these thoughts
and he practices together with whatever beings need to practice with him in whatever way of practice is necessary for them
So too because his inclination is to benefit others he should never harm them abuse them humiliate them arouse remorse in them or incite them to act in ways that should be avoided Nor should he place himself in a higher position than those of inferior conduct He should be neither altogether inaccessible to others nor too accessible and he should not associate with others at the wrong time
He associates with beings whom it is proper to associate with at the appropriate time and place
or engage in persuasion or accept excessively
and he encourages as well those endowed with virtue learning generosity and wisdom with a discourse on the benefits of those qualities
He makes them enter the Buddhas Dispensation
Only there is this distinction in that work the discussion of virtue has come down for beings who seek the enlightenment of disciples  but here because the discussion is intended for great bodhisattvas  it should be explained making compassion and skillful means the forerunners
Just as the Great Man does not dedicate the merits from his practice of virtue to his own release from affliction in the unfortunate destinations or to his own achievement of kingship in the fortunate destinations or to becoming a worldruling monarch a god Sakka Māra or Brahmā so too he does not dedicate it to his own attainment of the threefold knowledge the six direct knowledges the four discriminations the enlightenment of a disciple or the enlightenment of a paccekabuddhas But rather he dedicates it only for the purpose of becoming an omniscient Buddha in order to enable all beings to acquire the incomparable adornment of virtue
This is the method of practicing the perfection of virtue
The perfection of renunciation is the wholesome act of consciousness that occurs renouncing sense pleasures and existence preceded by the perception of their inherent unsatisfactoriness and accompanied by compassion and skillful means The bodhisattva should practice the perfection of renunciation by first recognizing the unsatisfactoriness in sense pleasures etc according to the following method For one dwelling in a home there is no opportunity to enjoy the happiness of renunciation etc because the home life is the dwelling place of all the defilements because a wife and children impose restrictions  and because the diverse crafts and occupations such as agriculture and trade lead to numerous entanglements And sense pleasures like a drop of honey smeared over the blade of a sword give limited satisfaction and entail abundant harm They are fleeting like a show perceived in a flash of lightning enjoyable only through an inversion of perception like the adornments of a madman a means of vengeance like a camouflaged pit of excrement unsatisfying like a thin drink or water moistening the fingers afflictive like food inwardly rotten a cause for calamity like a baited hook the cause of suffering in the three times like a burning fire a basis for bondage like monkeys glue a camouflage for destruction like a murderers cloak a place of danger like a dwelling in an enemy village food for the Māra of the defilements like the supporter of ones foes subject to suffering through change like the enjoyment of a festival inwardly burning like the fire in the hollow of a tree fraught with danger like a ball of honey suspended from bīrana grass in an old pit intensifying thirst like a drink of salt water resorted to by the vulgar like liquor and wine and giving little satisfaction like a chain of bones Having recognized the unsatisfactoriness in sense pleasures in accordance with this method he should then by the reverse method contemplate the benefits in renunciation with a mind slanting sloping and inclining towards the happiness of renunciation solitude and peace
Since renunciation is rooted in the going forth  the going forth should be undertaken
If the Great Being is living at a time when no Buddha has arisen in the world he should go forth under ascetics or wanderers who maintain the doctrine of kamma and the moral efficacy of action
But when the perfectly enlightened Buddhas appear in the world he should go forth only in their Dispensation
Having gone forth he should establish himself in virtue as described above and in order to cleanse his virtue should undertake the ascetic practices
For Great Men who undertake the ascetic practices and maintain them properly become content and few in their wishes The stains of their defilements are washed off in the waters of such noble qualities as effacement solitude aloofness from society the arousal of energy and ease of maintenance and all their conduct becomes purified through their blameless rules observances and noble qualities Established in three of the ancient traditions of the ariyans they are able to achieve the fourth of the ariyan traditions ie delight in meditation entering and abiding in jhāna both access and absorption through whichever among the forty subjects of meditation are appropriate
Thus they completely fulfil the perfection of renunciation
At this point it would be proper to explain in detail the thirteen ascetic practices and the forty meditation subjects for the development of concentration ie the ten kasiṇadevices the ten impurities the ten recollections the four divine abodes the four immaterial states the one perception and the one analysis
But since all these are explained in complete detail in the Visuddhimagga it should be understood in the way stated there
Only there is this distinction in that work the subject is explained for beings who seek the enlightenment of disciples But here because it is intended for great bodhisattvas it should be explained making compassion and skillful means the forerunners
This is the method of practicing the perfection of renunciation
Just as light cannot coexist with darkness wisdom cannot coexist with delusion Therefore a bodhisattva wishing to accomplish the perfection of wisdom should avoid the causes of delusion
These are the causes of delusion discontent languor drowsiness lethargy delight in company attachment to sleep irresoluteness lack of enthusiasm for knowledge false overestimation of oneself non interrogation not maintaining ones body properly lack of mental concentration association with dullwitted people not ministering to those possessed of wisdom selfcontempt false discrimination adherence to inverted views athleticism lack of a sense of spiritual urgency and the five hindrances
Avoiding these causes of confusion one should apply effort to learning as well as to the jhānas etc
So too out of his wish for the welfare of others the bodhisattva should develop the wisdom of ingenuity in creating opportunities to fulfil his various duties to his fellow beings and the skillful means in understanding their happiness and misery
Then he should develop wisdom born of reflection by first reflecting upon the specific nature of the dhammas such as the aggregates and then arousing reflective acquiescence in them
Next he should perfect the preliminary portion of the wisdom born of meditation by developing the mundane kinds of full understanding through the discernment of the specific and general characteristics of the aggregates etc
To do so he should fully understand all internal and external dhammas without exception as follows This is mere mentalitymateriality  which arises and ceases according to conditions There is here no agent or actor It is impermanent in the sense of not being after having been suffering in the sense of oppression by rise and fall and nonself in the sense of being insusceptible to the exercise of mastery Comprehending them in this way he abandons attachment to them and helps others to do so as well Entirely out of compassion he continues to help his fellow beings enter and reach maturity in the three vehicles assists them to achieve mastery over the jhānas deliverances concentrations attainments and mundane direct knowledges and does not desist until he reaches the very peak of wisdom and all the Buddhaqualities come within his grasp
The wisdom born of meditation may be divided into two groups The first comprises the mundane direct knowledges together with their accessories namely the knowledge of the modes of psychic power the knowledge of the divine earelement the knowledge of penetrating other minds the knowledge of recollecting past lives the knowledge of the divine eye the knowledge of kammic retribution and the knowledge of the future The second comprises the five purificationspurification of view purification by overcoming doubt purification by knowledge and vision of what is and what is not the path purification by knowledge and vision of the way and purification by knowledge and vision The first four of these are mundane the last is supramundane After acquiring through study and interrogation a knowledge of the dhammas such as the aggregates etc constituting the soil of wisdom he should establish himself in the two purifications constituting its roots purification of virtue and purification of mind and then accomplish the five purifications just mentioned which constitute the trunk of wisdom Since the method for accomplishing these along with the analysis of their objective sphere is explained in complete detail in the Visuddhimagga it should be understood in the way given there
Only in that work the explanation of wisdom has come down for beings seeking the enlightenment of disciples But here because it is intended for the great bodhisattvas it should be explained making compassion and skillful means the forerunners One further distinction must also be made here insight should be developed only as far as purification by knowledge and vision of the way without attaining purification by knowledge and vision
A Great Being who has formed his aspiration for supreme enlightenment should for the sake of fulfilling his pāramīs always be devoted to what is proper and intent upon service Therefore he should be zealous in providing for the welfare of beings and from time to time day by day should reflect Have I accumulated any requisites of merit and knowledge today What have I done for the welfare of others
In order to help all beings he should surrender some possession of his with a mind unconcerned with body or life
Whatever action he does bodily or vocal all should be done with a mind slanting towards full enlightenment all should be dedicated to enlightenment
He should turn his mind away from sense pleasures whether superior or inferior
He should work energetically for the welfare of beings be capable of enduring everything whether desirable or undesirable and should speak without deception
Whatever causes suffering for beings all that he should be ready to take upon himself
He should frequently reflect upon the greatness of the Buddhas and the greatness of their spiritual power
Whatever action he does by body or speech all should be preceded with a mind slanting towards full enlightenment
In this way the Great Being the bodhisattva devoted to what is proper endowed with strength firm in striving day by day accumulates immeasurable requisites of merit and knowledge through the practice of the pāramīs
Further having relinquished his own body and life for the use and protection of beings the bodhisattva should seek out and apply the antidotes to the various kinds of suffering to which beings are exposedhunger thirst cold heat wind sun etc
This firstly is the method for a bodhisattva not yet established on the plane of concentration
One established on the plane of concentration bestows upon beings the rapture tranquillity happiness concentration and true knowledge produced in the achievements of distinction as they are experienced by himself He procures them and dedicates them to all
Such a bodhisattva should contemplate the whole world of sentient beings immersed in the great suffering of saṃsāra and in the sufferings of the defilements and kamma formations at its base He should see the beings in hell experiencing violent racking agonizing pains uninterruptedly over long periods produced as they are cut up dismembered split pulverized and roasted in scorching fires the great suffering of the animals due to their mutual hostility as they afflict harass and kill one another or fall into captivity at the hands of others and the suffering of the various classes of ghosts going about with their bodies aflame consumed and withered by hunger thirst wind and sun weeping and wailing as their food turns into vomit and spittle He should contemplate as well the suffering experienced by men which is often indistinguishable from the suffering in the plane of misery the misery and ruin they encounter in their search  the various punishments they may meet such as the cutting off of their hands etc ugliness deformity and poverty affliction by hunger and thirst being vanquished by the more powerful pressed into the service of others and made dependent upon others and when they pass away falling over into the hells the realm of ghosts and the animal kingdom He should see the gods of the sensesphere being consumed by the fevers of lust as they enjoy their sense objects with scattered minds living with their fever unextinguished like a mass of fire stoked up with blasts of wind and fed with a stock of dry wood without peace dejected and dependent on others And he should see the gods of the finematerial and immaterial spheres after so long a life span in the end succumb to the law of impermanence plunging from their heights back down into the round of birth aging and death like birds swooping swiftly down from the heights of the sky or like arrows shot by a strong arm descending in the distance And having seen all his he should arouse a sense of spiritual urgency and suffuse all beings universally with loving kindness and compassion
Accumulating the requisites of enlightenment in this way by body speech and mind without interruption he should fulfil the perfection of energy arousing zeal while working thoroughly and perseveringly and acting without cowering in order that all the pāramīs may reach fulfilment
While striving for the state of Buddhahood the store and repository of inconceivable immeasurable vast lofty stainless incomparable undefiled qualities he should encourage the arising of energy for such energy is endowed with inconceivable spiritual power which common people cannot even hear about much less practice
It is entirely through the spiritual power of energy that the practice of all the requisites of enlightenment succeedsthe threefold arising of the great aspiration the four grounds for Buddhahood the four bases of beneficence the single flavor of compassion the reflective acquiescence which is the specific condition for the realization of the Buddhaqualities being untainted amidst all things the perception of all beings as his own dear children not being fatigued by all the sufferings of saṃsāra the relinquishing of everything that may be given away delight in so giving the determination upon the higher virtue etc unshakeableness therein rapture and exultation in wholesome actions the inclination towards seclusion application to the jhānas being insatiable in blameless states teaching the Dhamma to others as he has learned it out of the wish for their welfare firm initiative in setting beings upon the true path sagacity and heroism being imperturbable in face of the abusive speech and wrongs of others the determination upon truth mastery over the meditative attainments the attainment of power through the direct knowledges the comprehension of the three characteristics the accumulation of the requisites for the supramundane path by practicing meditation in the foundations of mindfulness etc and the descent on to the nine supramundane dhammas Thus from the time of forming the aspiration until the great enlightenment a bodhisattva should perfect his energy thoroughly and uninterruptedly without surrendering so that it might issue in higher and higher states of distinction
And when this energy succeeds all the requisites of enlightenmentpatience truthfulness determination etc as well as giving virtue etcwill succeed for all these occur in dependence on energy The practice of patience and the rest should be understood in accordance with the same method
Thus through giving relinquishing his own happiness and belongings to others he practices the benefitting of others in many ways through virtue the protection of their lives property and wives the nonbreach of his word endearing and beneficial speech non injury etc through renunciation many kinds of beneficial conduct such as giving the gift of the Dhamma in return for their material gifts through wisdom skillful means in providing for their welfare through energy the arousing of zeal in his work without slacking off through patience the enduring of the wrongs of others through truthfulness not breaking his pledge to help others without deception through determination remaining unshakable in rendering them help even when encountering difficulties through loving kindness concern for their welfare and happiness and through equanimity remaining imperturbable whether others render help or inflict harm This is the practice that the great bodhisattva compassionate for all beings undertakes for the sake of incalculable beings by means of which he accumulates immeasurable requisites of merit and knowledge not shared by worldlings
Their condition has been stated They should be accomplished thoroughly
or in brief any states which when indulged in prevent the unarisen wisdom from arising and cause the arisen wisdom to diminish
This is an analysis of the sphere of learning the five aggregates the twelve sense bases the eighteen elements the four truths the twentytwo faculties the twelve factors of dependent origination the foundations of mindfulness etc the various classifications of dhammas such as the wholesome etc as well as any blameless secular fields of knowledge that may be suitable for promoting the welfare and happiness of beings particularly grammar Thus with wisdom mindfulness and energy preceded by skillful means a bodhisattva should first thoroughly immerse himself in this entire sphere of learningthrough study listening memorization learning and interrogation then he should establish others in learning In this way the wisdom born of learning can be developed
and should apply skillful means to the fulfilment of his various duties
He should suffuse all beings with universal loving kindness and compassion
and he should rejoice in the merits of all beings
And whatever happiness he himself gains by alleviating these kinds of suffering and the happiness he gains when his own bodily and mental afflictions subside in delightful parks gardens mansions pools and forest abodes and the happiness of the blissful jhānic attainments he hears are experienced by the Buddhas their enlightened disciples paccekabuddhas and great bodhisattvas established in the practice of renunciationall that he seeks to procure universally for all beings
How are they analyzed 
They are analyzed into thirty pāramīs ten pāramīs ten intermediate pāramīs  and ten ultimate pāramīs 
Herein some teachers say that the ten basic pāramīs are the intermingled bright and dark dhammas practiced by a bodhisattva who has just formed his aspiration whose end is the welfare of others and whose means are directed towards working for this end the intermediate pāramīs are the bright dhammas untainted by any darkness and the ultimate pāramīs are the dhammas which are neither dark nor bright
Others say that the basic pāramīs are being filled at the time of the commencement the intermediate pāramīs are filled on the plane of bodhisattvahood and the ultimate pāramīs reach perfect fulfilment in all modes on the plane of Buddhahood
Or alternatively the basic pāramīs involve working for the welfare of others on the plane of bodhisattvahood the intermediate pāramīs working for ones own welfare and the ultimate pāramīs the fulfilment of the welfare of both oneself and others with the achievement of the Tathāgatas powers and grounds of selfconfidence on the plane of Buddhahood
Thus they analyze the pāramīs according to the beginning middle and consummation by way of the resolution  the undertaking  and their completion respectively
Still others analyze them according to the division in the accumulation of merit of those who are by nature compassionate and free from hate according to whether they have attained to the happiness of existence the happiness of emancipation or the ultimate happiness
Again some say that among those upheld by a sense of shame mindfulness and selfesteem who give predominance to the supramundane Dhamma and revere virtue concentration and wisdom the pāramīs are analyzed according to their ability to facilitate the attainment of the three types of enlightenmentthe basic pāramīs issuing in the enlightenment of a disciple who requires the help to cross  the intermediate pāramīs in the enlightenment of a paccekabuddha who crosses over himself  and the ultimate pāramīs in the enlightenment of a supreme Buddha who helps others across
Others hold that the basic pāramīs are the requisites occurring from the time of the mental resolution until the resolution by speech the intermediate those which occur from the time of the spoken resolution until the resolution by body and the ultimate those which occur following the resolution by body
But still others explain that the basic pāramīs are the requisites which occur by rejoicing in the merits of others the intermediate those which occur by exhorting others to practice and the ultimate those which occur through ones own practice
So too some say the basic pāramīs are the requisites of merit and knowledge issuing in a happy state of existence the intermediate those issuing in the happiness of nibbāna for oneself and the ultimate those issuing in both kinds of happiness for others
The basic perfection of giving is the relinquishing of ones children wife and belongings such as wealth the intermediate perfection of giving  the relinquishing of ones own limbs and the ultimate perfection of giving  the relinquishing of ones own life
The three stages in the perfection of virtue should be understood as the nontransgression on account of the three children and wife limbs and life the three stages in the perfection of renunciation as the renunciation of those three bases after cutting off attachment to them the three stages in the perfection of wisdom as the discrimination between what is beneficial and harmful to beings after rooting out craving for ones belongings limbs and life
 How are they synthesized
Just as the ten pāramīs become thirtyfold through analysis so they become sixfold through their specific nature as giving virtue patience energy meditation and wisdom
One part of the perfection of truthfulness ie its aspect of truthful speech or abstinence from falsehood is included in the perfection of virtue and one part ie its aspect of truthful knowledge in the perfection of wisdom
The perfection of loving kindness is included in the perfection of meditation
The perfection of determination is included by all
These six pāramīs fall into at least fifteen pairs of complementary qualities which perfect fifteen other pairs of qualities
How The pairgiving and virtueperfects the pair of doing what is beneficial for others and abstaining from what is harmful to them The pairgiving and patienceperfects the pair of nongreed and nonhatred The pairgiving and energyperfects the pair of generosity and learning The pairgiving and meditationperfects the abandoning of sensual desire and hatred
The pair giving and wisdom the ariyan vehicle and burden The dyad of virtue and patience the purification of means and the purification of the end The dyad of virtue and energy the dyad of meditative development  The dyad of virtue and meditation the abandoning of moral depravity and of mental obsession The dyad of virtue and wisdom the dyad of giving The dyad of patience and energy the dyad of acceptance and heat The dyad of patience and meditation the abandoning of opposing and favoring The dyad of patience and wisdom the acceptance and penetration of emptiness The dyad of energy and meditation the dyad of exertion and nondistraction The dyad of energy and wisdom the dyad of refuges The dyad of meditation and wisdom perfects the dyad of vehicles  The triad of giving virtue and patience perfects the abandoning of greed hatred and delusion The triad of giving virtue and energy perfects the giving of wealth life and bodily vitality The triad of giving virtue and meditation perfects the three bases of meritorious deeds The triad of giving virtue and wisdom perfects the triad of giving material gifts fearlessness and the Dhamma
In the same way the other triads and tetrads may be applied to one another as is appropriate in each case
These six pāramīs are also included in the four foundations which provide a synthesis of all the pāramīs
What are they The foundations of truth the foundation of relinquishment the foundation of peace and the foundation of wisdom
Here is the word explanation it is a foundation because it is founded by this or it is founded upon this or it itself is a foundation It is truth and it is a foundation or it is the foundation for truth or truth is the foundation for thisthus it is the foundation of truth
The same with the rest
Therein taking them first without distinction after making his aspiration for the supramundane qualities the Great Being filled with compassion for all beings establishes the foundation of truth by acquiring all the pāramīs in conformity with his vow
Taken separately giving is a proximate cause for the four foundations of wholesome dhammas as follows since one vows to give to those who ask without deceiving them gives without violating ones vows and rejoices without deceiving them about the gift through the relinquishing of the opposite qualities such as stinginess etc through the pacification of greed hatred delusion and fear in regard to the objects to be given the recipients the act of giving and the loss of the objects to be given respectively through giving according to desert at the proper time in the appropriate manner and through the preeminence of wisdom
Virtue is a proximate cause for the four foundations thus through non transgression of the restraint undertaken through the relinquishing of moral depravity through the pacification of misconduct and through the preeminence of wisdom
Patience is a proximate cause for the four foundations thus through patient acceptance in accordance with ones vow through the relinquishing of discrimination against others on account of their wrongs through the pacification of the obsession of anger and through the pre eminence of wisdom
Energy is a proximate cause for the four foundations through working for the welfare of others in accordance with ones vows through the relinquishing of dejection through the pacification of unwholesome dhammas and through the preeminence of wisdom
Meditation is a proximate cause for the four foundations through concern for the welfare of the world in accordance with ones vow through the relinquishing of the hindrances through the pacification of the mind and through the preeminence of wisdom
And wisdom is a proximate cause for the four foundations through skillful means in promoting the welfare of others in accordance with ones vow through the relinquishing of unskillful activity through the pacification of the fevers springing from delusion and through the attainment of omniscience
The foundation of truth is practiced by acting in accordance with ones vow and understanding
The foundation of truth is embraced by the threefold truth and opposed to the three corruptions 
The foundation of relinquishing is embraced by the threefold relinquishment and opposed to the three corruptions
The foundation of peace is embraced by the threefold pacification and opposed to the three corruptions
And the foundation of wisdom is embraced by the threefold knowledge and opposed to the three corruptions
The foundation of truth embraces the foundations of relinquishment peace and wisdom through nondeceptiveness and through acting in accordance with ones vow The foundation of relinquishment embraces the foundations of truth peace and wisdom through the relinquishing of their opposites and as the fruit of relinquishing everything The foundation of peace embraces the foundations of truth relinquishment and wisdom through the pacification of the fever of defilement and the fever of kamma And the foundation of wisdom embraces the foundations of truth relinquishment and peace since they are all preceded and accompanied by knowledge Thus all the pāramīs are grounded in truth clarified by relinquishment intensified by peace and purified by wisdom
For truth is the cause for their genesis
In the beginning truth is the foundation since his vow is made in accordance with truth In the middle relinquishment is the foundation since after forming his aspiration the bodhisattva relinquishes himself for the welfare of others
In the end peace is the foundation since the consummation is the attainment of perfect peace
And in every phasethe beginning the middle and the endwisdom is the foundation since the entire career originates when wisdom is present does not exist when it is absent and because the nature accords with the vow
Through the foundations of truth and relinquishment which promote ones own and others welfare and create reverence and love the Great Men as laymen benefit others with material gifts
And through the foundations of peace and wisdom which likewise promote ones own and others welfare and create reverence and love the Great Men as monks benefit others with the gift of the Dhamma
The fulfilment of the four foundations takes place in the bodhisattvas last existence
Some say that rebirth into the final existence takes place when the four foundations are fulfilled
 the bodhisattva descends into his mothers womb remains there and emerges mindfully and clearly comprehending through his commencement of the foundation of wisdom Through his fulfilment of the foundations of truth as soon as he is born he goes forward with a stride of seven steps facing north surveys all the directions and with a voice encompassed by truth roars his lions roar three times I am the foremost in the world I am preeminent in the world I am supreme in the world
Through the commencement of the foundation of peace when he sees the old man the sick man the corpse and the monk skilled in a section of the four truths his intoxication with youth health and life becomes pacified
And through the commencement of the foundation of relinquishment he is able to relinquish without concern a great circle of relatives and the sovereignty of a worldruling monarch that lay within his grasp
Others hold as a second position that the four foundations are fulfilled with the enlightenment
For through the commencement of the foundation of truth in accordance with his vow he penetrates the Four Noble Truths thus the foundation of truth is fulfilled
Through the commencement of the foundation of relinquishment he relinquishes all the defilements and corruptions thus the foundation of relinquishment is fulfilled
Through the commencement of the foundation of peace he attains the supreme peace thus the foundation of peace is fulfilled
And through the commencement of the foundation of wisdom he obtains the unobstructed knowledge thus the foundation of wisdom is fulfilled
But despite the ultimacy of the enlightenment this position is untenable
Others hold as a third position that the four foundations are fulfilled with the setting in motion of the Wheel of the Dhamma
For having commenced the foundation of truth he fulfils the foundation of truth by teaching the Four Noble Truths in their twelve modes
Having commenced the foundation of relinquishment he fulfils the foundation of relinquishment by making the great offering of the true Dhamma
Having himself attained the supreme peace through his commencement of the foundation of peace he fulfils the foundation of peace by to others
And having commenced the foundation of wisdom he fulfils the foundation of wisdom by understanding the propensities etc of the people to be trained
This position too is not tenable for even at this point the function of a Buddha has not yet been concluded
Still others hold as a fourth position that the four foundations are fulfilled with the parinibbāna
For with the parinibbāna the foundation of truth is fulfilled by the attainment of the ultimate truth
The virtue of one who has commenced the foundation of truth is to be known by living together with him
The honesty of one who has commenced the foundation of relinquishment is to be known through intercourse with him
The fortitude of one who has commenced the foundation of peace is to be known on occasions of misfortune
And the wisdom of one who has commenced the foundation of wisdom is to be known through discussion with him
Thus his purification of virtue livelihood mind and view should be known
Again through his commencement of the foundation of truth he does not follow a wrong course out of hatred since he is free from deceptiveness
Through his commencement of the foundation of relinquishment he does not follow a wrong course out of greed since he is without attachment
Through his commencement of the foundation of peace he does not follow a wrong course out of fear since he is without obstruction
And through his commencement of the foundation of wisdom he does not follow a wrong course out of delusion since he comprehends things as they really are
Thus through the first foundation he tolerates without hatred through the second he uses without greed through the third he avoids without fear and through the fourth he dispels without delusion
Through the first he attains the happiness of renunciation and through the others the happiness of solitude of peace and of enlightenment respectively
So too through the four foundations he attains respectively the rapture and happiness born of seclusion the rapture and happiness born of concentration the bodily happiness unaccompanied by rapture and the happiness of equanimity born of the purification of mindfulness
Thus it should be understood how the body of the pāramīs is included in the four foundations which are adorned with numerous noble qualities
And just as the pāramīs are all included in the four foundations they are also included in wisdom and compassion
For all the requisites of enlightenment can be included in wisdom and compassion
 By what means are they accomplished
The means by which the pāramīs are accomplished is the four factored method the accumulation without omission of all the requisites of merit etc for the sake of supreme enlightenment by performing them without deficiency performing them thoroughly with respect and high esteem performing them perseveringly without interruption and enduring effort over a long period without coming to a halt halfway
We will explain the length of time later
For the sake of the supreme enlightenment the Great Being striving for enlightenment should first of all surrender himself to the Buddhas thus I offer myself up to the Buddhas
And whenever he obtains any possession he should first of all resolve upon it as a potential gift
When he has made a mental determination to completely relinquish whatever possessions come his way whether animate or inanimate there are four shackles to giving  namely not being accustomed to giving in the past the inferiority of the object to be given the excellence and beauty of the object and worry over the loss of the object When the bodhisattva possesses objects that can be given and suppliants are present but his mind does not leap up at the thought of giving and he does not want to give
he should conclude Surely I have not been accustomed to giving in the past therefore a desire to give does not arise now in my mind
So that my mind will delight in giving in the future I will give a gift With an eye for the future let me now relinquish what I have to those in need Thus he gives a gift generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharing
In this way the Great Being destroys shatters and eradicates the first shackle to giving
Again when the object to be given is inferior or defective the Great Being reflects Because I was not inclined to giving in the past at present my requisites are defective Therefore though it pains me let me give whatever I have as a gift even if the object is low and inferior In that way I will in the future reach the peak in the perfection of giving
Thus he gives whatever kind of gift he can generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharing
In this way the Great Being destroys shatters and eradicates the second shackle to giving
When a reluctance to give arises due to the excellence or beauty of the object to be given the Great Being admonishes himself Good man havent you made the aspiration for the supreme enlightenment the loftiest and most superior of all states Well then for the sake of enlightenment it is proper for you to give excellent and beautiful objects as gifts
Thus he gives what is excellent and beautifulgenerous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharing
In this way the Great Man destroys shatters and eradicates the third shackle to giving
When the Great Being is giving a gift and he sees the loss of the object being given he reflects thus This is the nature of material possessions that they are subject to loss and to passing away
Moreover it is because I did not give such gifts in the past that my possessions are now depleted Let me then give whatever I have as a gift whether it be limited or abundant In that way I will in the future reach the peak in the perfection of giving
Thus he gives whatever he has as a giftgenerous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharing
In this way the Great Being destroys shatters and eradicates the fourth shackle to giving
Reflecting upon them thus in whatever way is appropriate is the means for dispelling the harmful shackles to the perfection of giving
The same method used for the perfection of giving also applies to the perfection of virtue and the other perfections
Further selfsurrender to the Buddhas is also a means for the complete accomplishment of the pāramīs
For when the Great Man straining and striving for the fulfilment of the requisites of enlightenment encounters troubles difficult to endure depriving him of happiness and his means of support or when he encounters injuries imposed by beings and formationsdifficult to overcome violent sapping the vitalitythen since he has surrendered himself to the Buddhas he reflects I have relinquished my very self to the Buddhas Whatever comes let it come For this reason he does not waver does not quake does not undergo the least vacillation but remains absolutely unshaken in his determination to undertake the good
For by fully understanding all dhammas in accordance with their nature the Great Being who has formed the resolution to attain the supreme enlightenment remains untainted by them and his selflove thereby becomes eliminated and exhausted Then since through the repeated practice of great compassion he has come to regard all beings as his dear children his loving kindness compassion and affection for them increase In conformity with this stage the Great Man having expelled the defilements such as stinginess etc opposed to the requisites of enlightenment and dispelled greed hatred and delusion in regard to himself and others further causes people to enter and reach maturity in the three vehicles by benefitting them to the utmost with the four bases of beneficence which accompany the four foundations namely giving loving speech beneficent conduct and equality of treatment
For the great compassion and the great wisdom of the Great Beings are adorned by giving Their giving is adorned and accompanied by loving speech loving speech by beneficent conduct and beneficent conduct by equality of treatment
When the bodhisattvas are practicing the requisites of enlightenment they treat all beings without exception as equal with themselves and perfect their sense of equality by remaining the same under all circumstances pleasant or painful
And when they become Buddhas their ability to train people is perfected by benefitting them to the utmost with these same four bases of beneficence brought to fulfilment by the four foundations
For the perfectly enlightened Buddhas the base of giving is brought to fulfilment by the foundation of relinquishment the base of loving speech by the foundation of truth the base of beneficent conduct by the foundation of wisdom and the base of equal treatment by the foundation of peace
For in regard to parinibbāna all the disciples and paccekabuddhas are completely equal to the Tathāgatas
Thus it is said There is no diversity among them in regard to emancipation 
He is truthful generous and peaceful Endowed with wisdom and sympathy
He is the great compassionate Teacher Equanimous yet seeking the welfare of all
Still he abides devoted to their welfare Oh how wonderful is the Conqueror
Always engaged in work promoting The welfare and happiness of all living beings
the three stages in the perfection of energy as striving for the relinquishing of the aforementioned things the three stages in the perfection of patience as the endurance of obstacles to ones belongings limbs and life the three stages in the perfection of truthfulness as the non abandoning of truthfulness on account of ones belongings limbs and life the three stages in the perfection of determination as unshakable determination despite the destruction of ones belongings limbs and life bearing in mind that the pāramīs ultimately succeed through unflinching determination the three stages in the perfection of loving kindness as maintaining loving kindness towards beings who destroy ones belongings etc and the three stages in the perfection of equanimity as maintaining an attitude of impartial neutrality towards beings and formations whether they are helpful or harmful in regard to the aforementioned three bases  In this way the analysis of the pāramīs should be understood
When this set is considered the perfection of renunciation as the going forth into homelessness is included in the perfection of virtue as seclusion from the hindrances in the perfection of meditation and as a generally wholesome dhamma in all six pāramitās
and the perfection of equanimity in the perfections of meditation and of wisdom
the foundation of relinquishment by relinquishing their opposites
the foundation of peace by pacifying their opposites with all the qualities of the pāramīs
and the foundation of wisdom by skillful means in promoting the welfare of others through those same qualities
the foundation of relinquishment by relinquishing objects of sense enjoyment and the defilement of sensuality
the foundation of peace by the pacification of hatred and suffering
and the foundation of wisdom by understanding and penetration
relinquishment the cause for their acquisition peace the cause for their growth and wisdom the cause for their purification
the foundation of relinquishment by the relinquishing of all the strata of existence
the foundation of peace by the pacification of all formations
Herein after he has commenced the foundation of truth the Great Mans fulfilment of the foundation of truth is particularly evident at his birth which is the field for his loving kindness After he has commenced the foundation of wisdom his fulfilment of the foundation of wisdom is particularly evident at his enlightenment which is the field for his compassion After he has commenced the foundation of relinquishment his fulfilment of the foundation of relinquishment is particularly evident when he sets in motion the Wheel of the Dhamma which is the field for his sympathetic joy And after he has commenced the foundation of peace his fulfilment of the foundation of peace is particularly evident at his parinibbāna which is the field for his equanimity
and the foundation of wisdom by the completion of the purpose of wisdom
and the noble qualities such as giving  accompanied by wisdom and compassion are the requisites for the great enlightenment culminating in the perfection of Buddhahood
Whatever requisite of life comes my way that I will give to those who need it and I myself will only use what remains over from this gift
In brief the destruction of selflove and the development of love for others are the means for the accomplishing of the pāramīs
they are identical without any distinction
Complete in all the requisites What good can he not achieve
Free from concern on all occasions Oh how wonderful is the Conqueror
Dispassionate towards all dhammas And towards all beings of equal mind
He never ceases on account of the trouble Oh how wonderful is the Conqueror
The Blessed Lord is able here and now to enjoy the surpassing happiness of dwelling in the four jhanas
and there will be in the future Arahant Buddhas equal in enlightenment to myself
when being endowed with such power and influence he does not make a display of himself
How much time is required to accomplish them
As a minimum four incalculables and a hundred thousand great aeons  as a middle figure eight incalculables and a hundred thousand great aeons and as a maximum sixteen incalculables and a hundred thousand great aeons
For those in whom wisdom is predominant faith is weakest and wisdom keenest for those in whom faith is predominant wisdom is middling  and for those in whom energy is predominant wisdom is weakest  But supreme enlightenment must be achieved by the power of wisdom so it is said in the commentary
But others say that the classification of the time required for bodhisattvas obtains by way of the keen middling and tender quality of their energy
Still others say that without distinction the three divisions of time correspond to the time required for their requisites of enlightenment to reach fulfilment which in turn is determined by the keen middling and tender quality of their factors maturing towards emancipation 
Bodhisattvas also become threefold at the moment they form the aspiration according to their division into those who comprehend through a condensed teaching  those who comprehend through an elaborated teaching  and those who are capable of training 
The second has such supporting conditions that if he were disposed towards the enlightenment of a disciple he could attain arahatship together with the six direct knowledges while listening to a fourline stanza from the lips of the Exalted One even while the fourth line has not yet been concluded
And the third has the supporting conditions to attain arahatship together with the six direct knowledges when the fourline stanza he hears from the Exalted One has been concluded
These three types who form their aspirations without any allotted division of time receive predictions directly from the Buddhas
Then they fulfil the pāramīs in order and reach the supreme enlightenment according to the aforementioned time allotted to each type But that these Great Beingsday by day giving great gifts like those given by Vessantara accumulating all the other pāramīs in the same way making the five great relinquishings reaching the summit in conduct for the good of relatives conduct for the good of the world and conduct developing intelligenceshould become perfectly enlightened Buddhas before the time allotted to their respective types is fulfilled this is not possible
Why
Because their knowledge is not yet mature enough and their accumulation of the factors culminating in Buddhahood not yet complete
For just as grain ripens only after the lapse of the time required  so too the supreme enlightenment is perfected only after the lapse of the aforementioned periods of time Before then even though striving with all his might the bodhisattva cannot attain enlightenment The pāramīs are fulfilled according to the aforementioned distinction of time Thus it should be understood
 What benefits do they bring
The benefits obtained by bodhisattvas who have formed their aspirations are explained thus
They never appear as tawny titans Or ghosts consumed by hunger and thirst
Though reborn in the plane of woe They do not take on minor forms
Their hearing is intact from birth Nor are they dumb or lame of limb
They never become of female sex Eunuchs or hermaphrodites
Those men bound for enlightenment
They never hold inverted views But recognize the law of kamma
They are born at times in heavenly worlds But not in the insentient
Those true men bent on renunciation Detached from all the planes of existence
Some other benefits of the pāramīs are the following the sixteen wonderful and marvellous qualities that begin Mindful and clearly comprehending nanda the bodhisattva passes away from the Tusita heaven and descends into his mothers womb  the thirty two portents such as cold disappears and heat is allayed and when the bodhisattva is born this tenthousandfold world system shakes trembles and quakes etc  and the other qualities shown here and there in the Jātakas the Buddhavaṃsa etc such as the fulfilment of the bodhisattvas wishes his mastery over kamma and so forth
Other benefits are the pairs of complementary qualities such as non greed and nonhatred already discussed
Moreover from the time that he makes the aspiration the bodhisattva becomes like a father to all beings wishing for their welfare By reason of his distinguished qualities he is worthy of offerings worthy of reverence worthy of esteem a supreme field of merit
He is generally dear to humans and to nonhumans alike and is protected by deities
Because his mind is grounded in loving kindness and compassion he cannot be harmed by wild beasts etc Whatever order of beings he is reborn in on account of his distinguished merit he surpasses the other beings there in his superior beauty fame happiness strength and dominion He is healthy and robust His faith is very pure and lucid His energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom are also very pure and lucid His defilements disturbances and passions are weak Because his defilements are weak he is easy to admonish adroit patient meek congenial and hospitable He is free from anger malice denigration domineering envy stinginess craftiness hypo crisy obstinacy pride presumption and negligence He endures torments at the hands of others but never torments anyone himself Whenever he enters a village area the unarisen dangers and calamities facing the beings there generally do not arise and those that have arisen subside And whenever he is reborn in the planes of misery unlike the common inhabitants there he is not oppressed by excessive suffering but acquires an even greater sense of spiritual urgency
Therefore these distinguished qualities of the Great Mansuch as being like a father to beings being worthy of offerings etcfound in this or that state of existence are the benefits of the pāramīs
Further the accomplishment of life span the accomplishment of form the accomplishment of family the accomplishment of sovereignty credibility and greatness of spiritual power are also benefits of the Great Mans pāramīs
Therein the accomplishment of life span is length of life or longevity in whatever state of exist ence he takes rebirth in by this means he concludes whatever wholesome undertakings he began and accumulates many wholesome qualities
The accomplishment of form is beauty of form comeliness or loveliness by this means he inspires confidence and esteem in beings who take physical form as their standard
The accomplishment of family is rebirth in excellent families by this means he is to be worth approaching and ministering to by beings who are intoxicated with the vanity of birth etc
Credibility means trustworthiness reliability by this means he becomes an authority for beings and his command cannot be disregarded
Greatness of spiritual power means magnitude of spiritual power by this means he cannot be vanquished by others but he himself invari ably vanquishes themby Dhamma by righteousness and by his genuine noble qualities Thus the accomplishment of life span and the rest are benefits of the Great Mans pāramīs These are the cause for the growth of his own boundless requisites of merit and the means by which he leads other beings to enter and reach maturity in the three vehicles
 What is their fruit
Their fruit is in brief the state of perfect Buddhahood In detail it is the acquisition of the formbody resplendent with the multitude of meritorious qualities such as the thirtytwo characteristics of a Great Man the eighty minor marks of physical beauty the fathomwide aura etc and founded upon this the glorious Dhamma body radiant with its collection of infinite and boundless meritorious qualitiesthe ten powers the four grounds of selfconfidence the six kinds of knowledge not held in common with others the eighteen unique Buddhadhammas and so forth
And so numerous are the Buddhaqualities that even a perfectly enlightened Buddha could not finish describing them even after many aeons This is their fruit
And it is said
If a Buddha were to speak in praise of a Buddha Speaking nothing else through the duration of an aeon
This threefold division obtains by way of those in whom wisdom is predominant those in whom faith is predominant and those in whom energy is predominant respectively
Among these he who comprehends through a condensed teaching has such supporting conditions that if he were disposed towards the enlightenment of a disciple he could attain arahatship together with the four discriminations and the six direct knowledges while listening to a fourline stanza from the lips of a perfectly enlightened Buddha even while the third line has not yet been concluded
Those men in all factors complete Bound for perfect enlightenment
Though wandering through the round of births For countless aeons yet to come
Never arise in Avīci hell Nor in the intermundane voids
And when reborn in the world of men They never come deprived of sight
Never commit the five dark deeds Always pure in their way of life
or pure abodes
Plough their course for the good of the world Striving to fulfil the pāramīs
The accomplishment of sovereignty is great ness of power greatness of influence and greatness of retinue by means of these he is able to benefit with the four bases of beneficence those who need to be benefited and to restrain with Dhamma those who need to be restrained
Sooner would the longstanding aeon reach its end But the praise of the Tathāgata would not reach its end
that the Blessed Lord
does not make display of himself 
so it is
he does not make a display of himself
that one will by following instructions by the complete destruction of three fetters and the reduction of greed hatred and delusion become a OnceRetumer and having returned once more to this world will put an end to suffering
that one will by following instructions by the complete destruction of the five lower fetters be spontaneously reborn and there will reach Nibbana without returning from that world
that one will by following instructions by the destruction of the corruptions gain in this very life the deliverance of mind the deliverance through wisdom which is uncorrupted and which one has understood and realised by ones own superknowledge
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans in the mansion in the mango grove of the Sakyan family called Vedhañña Archer
And on that occasion Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta had just died in Pāvā
On his death the Nigaṇṭhas had split into two factions They kept arguing quarreling  disputing stabbing one another with weapons of the mouth You dont understand this DhammaVinaya I understand this DhammaVinaya How could you understand this DhammaVinaya
You practice wrongly I practice rightly
Im consistent Youre inconsistent
What should be said first you said last What should be said last you said first
What you cogitated so long has been turned inside out Your position has been overthrown Youre trapped so go try to release your position or disentangle yourself if you can
Nothing but slaughter as it were was being committed among the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭasons
Even the lay disciples of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta dressed in white seemed disenchanted disgusted  repelled by the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭasons and at how that poorly proclaimed DhammaVinaya was poorly expounded not leading out not conducive to calming expounded by one who was not rightly selfawakened its foundation now broken without an arbiter
Then Cunda the novice who had spent the Rains at Pāvā went to Ven nanda at Sāmagāma and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven nanda Venerable sir Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta has just died in Pāvā
On his death the Nigaṇṭhas have split into two factions They keep arguing quarreling  disputing stabbing one another with weapons of the mouth You dont understand this DhammaVinaya I understand this DhammaVinaya How could you understand this DhammaVinaya You practice wrongly I practice rightly Im consistent Youre inconsistent What should be said first you said last What should be said last you said first What you cogitated so long has been turned inside out Your position has been overthrown Youre trapped so go try to release your position or disentangle yourself if you can Nothing but slaughter as it were is being committed among the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭasons Even the lay disciples of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta dressed in white seem disenchanted disgusted  repelled by the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭasons and at how that poorly proclaimed DhammaVinaya was poorly expounded not leading out not conducive to calming expounded by one who was not rightly selfawakened its support now broken without an arbiter
When this was said Ven nanda said to Cunda the novice Friend Cunda there is warrant here for talking to the Blessed One
Lets go to the Blessed One and on arrival report this matter to him
As you say venerable sir Cunda the novice responded to Ven nanda
Then Ven nanda  Cunda the novice went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there Ven nanda said to the Blessed One Lord Cunda the novice here has said that Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta has just died in Pāvā  Even the lay disciples of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta dressed in white seem disenchanted disgusted  repelled by the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭasons and at how that poorly proclaimed DhammaVinaya was poorly expounded not leading out not conducive to calming expounded by one who was not rightly selfawakened its support broken without an arbiter
Thats the way it is Cunda with a poorly proclaimed DhammaVinaya poorly expounded not leading out not conducive to calming expounded by one who is not rightly selfawakened
There is the case Cunda where a teacher is not rightly selfawakened and his DhammaVinaya is poorly proclaimed poorly expounded not leading out not conducive to calming expounded by one who is not rightly selfawakened A disciple of that Dhamma does not dwell practicing the Dhamma in accordance with that Dhamma practicing masterfully living in line with that Dhamma but deviates from it
He is to be told It is a gain for you friend wellgained by you thatwhen your teacher is not rightly selfawakened and his DhammaVinaya is poorly proclaimed poorly expounded not leading out not conducive to calming expounded by one who is not rightly selfawakened
There Cunda the teacher is to be criticized the Dhamma is to be criticized but the disciple is to be thus praised
Whoever might say to such a disciple Come friend practice in line with the Dhamma as taught and formulated by your teacher

There is the case Cunda where a teacher has appeared in the world worthy  rightly selfawakened And the Dhamma is wellproclaimed wellexpounded leading out conducive to calming expounded by one who is rightly selfawakened But his disciples have not been instructed in the meaninggoal of the True Dhamma nor has the complete holy life been entirely disclosed to them made plain with all its steps collected complete with miracles wellproclaimed as far as human beings  devas
Then their teacher disappears
When a teacher of that sort has died it is a matter of regret for his disciples
Why is that
Because A teacher has appeared in the world worthy  rightly selfawakened And the Dhamma is wellproclaimed wellexpounded leading out conducive to calming expounded by one who is rightly selfawakened But we have not been instructed in the meaninggoal of the True Dhamma nor has the complete holy life been entirely disclosed to us made plain with all its steps collected complete with miracles wellproclaimed as far as human beings  devas

Now if a holy life is endowed with those factors yet there is no teacher who is an elder of long standing long gone forth senior attained to old age
But when a holy life is endowed with those factors and there is a teacher who is an elder of long standing long gone forth senior attained to old age
But if a holy life is endowed with those factors and there is a teacher who is an elder of long standing long gone forth senior attained to old age yet there are no elder monk disciples of his that are experienced trained mature attained to security from the yoke
But when a holy life is endowed with those factors and there is a teacher who is an elder of long standing long gone forth senior attained to old age and there are elder monk disciples of his who are experienced trained mature attained to security from the yoke

But when a holy life is endowed with those factors and there is a teacher who is an elder of long standing long gone forth senior attained to old age and there are elder monk disciples of his who are experienced trained mature attained to security from the yoke
Cunda I am now a teacher who has appeared in the world worthy  rightly selfawakened
And the Dhamma is wellproclaimed wellexpounded leading out conducive to calming expounded by one who is rightly selfawakened
My disciples have been instructed in the meaninggoal of the True Dhamma and the complete holy life has been entirely disclosed to them made plain with all its steps collected complete with miracles wellproclaimed as far as human beings  devas

Cunda to the extent that I am now a teacher who has appeared in the world I do not see any other teacher who has attained supremacy in terms of gains  supremacy in terms of status equal to what I have
And to the extent that my community or group has appeared in the world I do not see any other community that has attained supremacy in terms of gains  supremacy in terms of status equal to what the Saṅgha of monks has
If one speaking rightly were to say a wellexpounded entirely complete wellproclaimed holy life consummate in all its aspects complete in all its aspects with nothing lacking  nothing in excess
Udaka Rāmaputta once made this statement Seeing one doesnt see
And what is it that seeing one doesnt see
One sees the blade of a wellsharpened razor but not the edge of the razor
This Cunda is called seeing one doesnt see
But this statement of Uddaka Rāmaputta is base vulgar common ignoble unprofitable dealing only with a razor
But how would one speaking rightly say Seeing one doesnt see One speaking rightly would say just this Seeing one doesnt see
And what is it that seeing one doesnt see
Such a wellexpounded entirely complete wellproclaimed holy life consummate in all its aspects complete in all its aspects with nothing lacking and nothing in excess This is what one sees
One doesnt see If this were taken away from here it would become purer
One doesnt see If this were added here it would become more complete
This is called seeing one doesnt see
Cunda if one speaking rightly were to say a wellexpounded entirely complete wellproclaimed holy life consummate in all its aspects complete in all its aspects with nothing lacking and nothing in excess
Therefore Cunda with regard to the qualities I have taught having directly known them you should all having assembled  gathered together recite  compare meaning with meaning expression with expression so that this holy life may long endure  remain steadfast for the benefit welfare  happiness of the multitude out of sympathy for the world for the benefit welfare  happiness of human beings  devas

The four establishings of mindfulness the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for awakening the noble eightfold path

If one of your fellows in the holy life should speak of the Dhamma in the Saṅgha
you should express neither delight nor scorn Neither delighting nor scorning you should say to him With regard to this meaning friend there are these expressions or those expressions Which are the more pertinent And with regard to these expressions there is this meaning or that meaning Which is the more pertinent
If he should say Friends with regard to this meaning these expressions are more pertinent than those and with regard to these expressions this meaning is more pertinent than that then he is neither to be praised nor disparaged
Neither praising nor disparaging him you should show him how to examine that meaning  those expressions
If another one of your fellows in the holy life should speak of the Dhamma in the Saṅgha

Cunda I dont teach you the Dhamma only for the restraint of effluents in the present life
I teach you the Dhamma both for the restraint of effluents in the present life and for the warding off of effluents in the afterlife
Therefore the robe I have allowed you is enough simply to counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that cause shame
The alms food I have allowed you is enough simply for the survival  continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking Thus will I destroy old feelings and not create new feelings  I will maintain myself be blameless  live in comfort
The lodgings I have allowed you are enough simply to counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles simply for protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusion
The medicinal requisites used for curing the sick that I have allowed you are enough simply to counteract any pains of illness that have arisen and for maximum freedom from disease
Now its possible Cunda that wanderers of other sects might say The Sakyanson contemplatives live devoted to the devotion to pleasure
When they are saying that the wanderers of other sects should be told Which devotion to pleasure friends
for devotion to pleasure has many modes many permutations
 There are four devotions to pleasure Cunda that are base vulgar common ignoble unprofitable that do not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation calming direct knowledge selfawakening or unbinding
Which four
There is the case where a certain fool finds pleasure  rapture for himself in killing living beings
This is the first devotion to pleasure
Further there is the case where a certain person finds pleasure  rapture for himself in taking what is not given
Further there is the case where a certain person finds pleasure  rapture for himself in telling lies
This is the third devotion to pleasure
Further there is the case where a certain person goes about endowed  provided with the five strings of sensuality
This is the fourth devotion to pleasure
These are the four devotions to pleasure Cunda that are base vulgar common ignoble unprofitable that do not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation calming direct knowledge selfawakening or unbinding
Now its possible that wanderers of other sects might say The Sakyanson contemplatives live devoted to these four devotions to pleasure
They are to be told Not so
They would not be speaking rightly of you They would be slandering you with what is unfactual  untrue
There are four devotions to pleasure Cunda that lead exclusively to disenchantment dispassion cessation calming direct knowledge selfawakening  unbinding
Which four
There is the case where a monk quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
This is the first devotion to pleasure
Further Cunda with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations the monk enters  remains in the second jhāna rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluationinternal assurance
This is the second devotion to pleasure
Further Cunda with the fading of rapture the monk remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body He enters  remains in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding
This is the third devotion to pleasure
Further Cunda with the abandoning of pleasure  painas with the earlier disappearance of elation  distressthe monk enters  remains in the fourth jhāna purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is the fourth devotion to pleasure
These are the four devotions to pleasure that lead exclusively to disenchantment dispassion cessation calming direct knowledge selfawakening  unbinding
Now its possible Cunda that wanderers of other sects might say The Sakyanson contemplatives live devoted to these four devotions to pleasure
They are to be told That is so
They would be speaking rightly of you They would not be slandering you with what is unfactual  untrue
Its possible that wanderers of other sects might say Living devoted to these four devotions to pleasure friends what fruits what rewards can be expected
The wanderers of other sects saying that are to be told Living devoted to these four devotions to pleasure friends four fruits four rewards can be expected
Which four
Friends there is the case where a monk with the wasting away of three fetters is a streamenterer certain never again destined for the lower realms headed for selfawakening
This is the first fruit the first reward
Further friends the monkwith the wasting away of three fetters and with the attenuation of passion aversion  delusionis a oncereturner who on returning only once more to this world will make an ending to stress
This is the second fruit the second reward
Further the monkwith the wasting away of the five lower fettersis due to arise spontaneously  there to totally unbind destined never again to return from that world
This is the third fruit the third reward
Further the monkwith the ending of effluentsenters  remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized it for himself right in the here  now
Living devoted to these four devotions to pleasure friends these four fruits these four rewards can be expected
Now its possible Cunda that wanderers of other sects might say The Sakanson contemplatives live without an established Dhamma
The wanderers of other sects saying that should be told There are friends Dhammas taught  formulated by the Blessed Onethe one who knows the one who sees worthy  rightly selfawakenedthat are not to be transgressed throughout life
Just like a gate post or iron post that is deeply buried wellplanted immovable unshakable
Friends an arahant monk whose effluents are ended who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who is released through right gnosis cannot possibly transgress nine principles
 It is impossible for a monk whose effluents are ended to intentionally deprive a living being of life It is impossible for a monk whose effluents are ended to take in the manner of stealing what is not given It is impossible for a monk whose effluents are ended to engage in sexual intercourse It is impossible for a monk whose effluents are ended to tell a conscious lie It is impossible for a monk whose effluents are ended to consume storedup sensual things as he did before when he was a householder  It is impossible for a monk whose effluents are ended to follow a bias based on desire It is impossible for a monk whose effluents are ended to follow a bias based on aversion It is impossible for a monk whose effluents are ended to follow a bias based on fear It is impossible for a monk whose effluents are ended to follow a bias based on delusion
An arahant monk whose effluents are ended who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who is released through right gnosis cannot possibly transgress nine principles
Now its possible Cunda that some wanderers of other sects might say Gotama the contemplative describes unlimited knowledge  vision with regard to the past but doesnt describe unlimited knowledge  vision with regard to the future What is this How is this
Those wanderers of other sects construe the sort of knowing that is not knowledge  vision to be the sort of knowing that is knowledge  vision just like inexperienced fools
The Tathāgatas memoryrecollection knowledge with regard to the past is such that he recollects whatever he wants
The Tathāgatas knowledge with regard to the future arises born from his awakening This is the last birth There is now no further becoming
With regard to what is past If it is unfactual untrue  unbeneficial the Tathāgata does not declare it
If it is factual true but unbeneficial the Tathāgata does not declare it
If it is factual true  beneficial the Tathāgata has a sense of the proper time for giving the answer to that question
With regard to what is future
With regard to what is present If it is unfactual untrue  unbeneficial the Tathāgata does not declare it
If it is factual true but unbeneficial the Tathāgata does not declare it
If it is factual true  beneficial the Tathāgata has a sense of the proper time for giving the answer to that question
Thus Cunda with regard to things that are past future  present the Tathāgata is one who speaks at the proper time speaks what is true speaks what is factual speaks the meaning speaks Dhamma speaks Vinaya Thus he is called the Tathāgata
Cunda whatever in this worldwith its devas Māras  Brahmās this generation with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  common peopleis seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect that has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata Thus he is called the Tathāgata
From the night the Tathāgata fully awakens to the unsurpassed right selfawakening until the night he totally unbinds in the unbinding property with no fuel remaining whatever the Tathāgata has said spoken explained
is just so tatha and not otherwise Thus he is called the Tathāgata
The Tathāgata is one who does in line with tatha what he teaches one who teaches in line with what he does
Thus he is called the Tathāgata
In this world with its devas Māras  Brahmās this generation with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  common people the Tathāgata is the unconquered conqueror allseeing the wielder of power Thus he is called the Tathāgata
Its possible Cunda that wanderers of other sects might say How is it friends Is it the case that after death a Tathāgata exists Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
The wanderers of other sects who say this should be told Friends it is undeclared by the Tathāgata that after death a Tathāgata exists Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
 Its possible that wanderers of other sects might say How is it friends Is it the case that after death a Tathāgata does not exist
The wanderers of other sects who say this should be told Friends it is undeclared by the Tathāgata that after death a Tathāgata neither does nor does not exist Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless 
Its possible that wanderers of other sects might say But why friends is this undeclared by Gotama the contemplative
The wanderers of other sects who say this should be told Friends it isnt connected with the goal isnt connected with the Dhamma isnt fundamental to the holy life It doesnt lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation calming direct knowledge selfawakening unbinding Thats why its undeclared by the Blessed One 
Its possible that wanderers of other sects might say But what friends is declared by Gotama the contemplative
The wanderers of other sects who say this should be told This is stress is declared by the Blessed One This is the origination of stress is declared by the Blessed One This is the cessation of stress is declared by the Blessed One This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress is declared by the Blessed One
Its possible that wanderers of other sects might say And why friends is this declared by Gotama the contemplative
The wanderers of other sects who say this should be told This is connected with the goal is connected with the Dhamma is fundamental to the holy life It leads to disenchantment dispassion cessation calming direct knowledge selfawakening unbinding
Thats why its declared by the Blessed One
Cunda the viewdependencies diṭṭhinissayā concerning beginningpoints that I have declared as they are to be declared
And the viewdependencies concerning endpoints that I have declared as they are to be declared
And which are the viewdependencies concerning beginningpoints that I have declared as they are to be declared and as they are not to be declared 
There are certain contemplatives  brahmans who are of this view this opinion The self  the cosmos are eternal Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
There are certain contemplatives  brahmans who are of this view this opinion The self  the cosmos are not eternal Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless  The self  the cosmos are both eternal  not eternal  The self  the cosmos are neither eternal nor noteternal  The self  the cosmos are selfmade  The self  the cosmos are othermade  The self  the cosmos are both selfmade  othermade  Without selfmaking or othermaking the self  the cosmos are spontaneously arisen Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
There are certain contemplatives  brahmans who are of this view this opinion Pleasure  pain are eternal Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless  Pleasure  pain are not eternal Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless  Pleasure  pain are both eternal  not eternal  Pleasure  pain are neither eternal nor noteternal  Pleasure  pain are selfmade  Pleasure  pain are othermade  Pleasure  pain are both selfmade  othermade  Without selfmaking or othermaking pleasure  pain are spontaneously arisen Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
As for the contemplatives  brahmans who are of this view this opinion The self  the cosmos are eternal Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless I going to them
When they say Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
Why is that
Because with regard to that there are some beings who are percipient otherwise
In fact my doctrine is the better one
Similarly with the remaining views
These Cunda are the viewdependencies concerning beginningpoints that I have declared as they are to be declared
and as they are not to be declared Would I simply declare them to you
And which are the viewdependencies concerning endpoints that I have declared as they are to be declared and as they are not to be declared 
There are certain contemplatives  brahmans who are of this view this opinion After death the self is possessed of form  free from disease Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
There are certain contemplatives  brahmans who are of this view this opinion After death the self is formless Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless  After death the self is both possessed of form  formless  After death the self is neither possessed of form nor formless  After death the self is percipient  After death the self is not percipient  After death the self is both percipient  not percipient  After death the self is neither percipient nor not percipient  The self is annihilated destroyed  does not exist after death Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
As for the contemplatives  brahmans who are of this view this opinion After death the self is possessed of form  free from disease Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless I going to them
When they say Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
Why is that
Because with regard to that there are some beings who are percipient otherwise
And I do not see that this doctrine is even equal to mine so how better
In fact my doctrine is the better one
Similarly with the remaining views
These Cunda are the viewdependencies concerning endpoints that I have declared as they are to be declared
and as they are not to be declared Would I simply declare them to you
Its for the abandoning  transcending of these viewdependencies concerning beginningpoints and viewdependencies concerning endpoints that I have thus taught  formulated the four establishings of mindfulness
Which four
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itselfardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselvesardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the world He remains focused on the mind in  of itselfardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the world He remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselvesardent alert  mindfulsubduing greed  distress with reference to the world
Its for the abandoning  transcending of these viewdependencies concerning beginningpoints and viewdependencies concerning endpoints
Now on that occasion Ven Upavāṇa was standing behind the Blessed One fanning him
He said to the Blessed One Its amazing lord Its astounding
how inspiring this Dhammasequence is how very inspiring this Dhammasequence is What is the name of this Dhammasequence
In that case Upavāṇa you may remember this Dhammasequence simply as The Inspiring 
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven Upavāṇa delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Thus I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Svatthi in Jetas Wood Anthapindikas Park
A certain deity then in the nights last extreme the extreme of whose brilliance set the whole of Jetas Wood aglow approached the Blessed One and after showing respect to him stood at one side
And so standing the deity addressed the Blessed One in verses thus
Gods and men there are full many That have tried to find good omens
Which they hope will bring them safety Tell then the supreme good omen
Not consorting with the foolish Rather with the wise consorting
Honouring the honourable This is a supreme good omen
Living in befitting places Having in the past made merit
Right direction in selfguidance This is a supreme good omen
Ample learning and a craft too With a welltrained disciplining
Any speech that is well spoken This is a supreme good omen
Aid for mother and for father And support for wife and children
Spheres of work that bring no conflict This is a supreme good omen
Giving TrueIdeal conduct With support for kin provided
Unexceptionable actions This is a supreme good omen
Shrinking abstinence from evil From besotting drink refraining
Diligence in True Ideals This is a supreme good omen
Then respect and humble manner With content and grateful bearing
Hearing Truth when it is timely This is a supreme good omen
Patience meekness when corrected Seeing monks
and then discussion Of the Truth when it is timely This is a supreme good omen
Ardour a Divine Life leading Seeing Truths that are called Noble
Realization of Extinction This is a supreme good omen
Though by worldly ideas tempted Neer his cognizance shall waver
Sorrowless secure stainless This is a supreme good omen
Since by working suchlike omens Men are everywhere unvanquished
And go everywhere in safety That is their supreme good omen
Whatever beings are assembled here So be they native to the earth or sky
Let beings each and all have peace of mind And also listen closely to these words
Therefore o beings give attention all Work lovingkindness for the race of men
By day by night their offerings they bring Wherefore protect them well with diligence
Whatever to be prized what rarest jewel Is found here or beyond or in the heavens
None is there equal to a Perfect One This jewel rare is in the Enlightened One

What should be done by one with skill in good The State of Peace to have attained is this
He would be able right upright And meek and gentle and not proud
Contented easy to support Unbusy frugal
and serene In faculties prudent modest Not fawning upon families
He would no slight thing do at all That other wise men might deplore
Then he would think  Joyful and safe Let every creatures heart rejoice
Whatever breathing beings there are No matter whether frail or firm With none excepted
 long or big Or middlesized or short or small Or thick
or those seen or unseen Or whether dwelling far or near
That are or that yet seek to be Let every creatures heart rejoice
Let none another one undo Or slight him at all anywhere
Let them not wish each other ill With provocation or resistive thought
Thus as a mother with her life Might guard her son her only child
Would he maintain unboundedly His thought for every living being
His thought of love for all the world He would maintain unboundedly
Above below and all around Unchecked no malice with or foe
Standing or walking seated too Or lying down the while undrowsing
He would pursue this mindfulness This is Divine Abiding here they say
But he that traffics not with views Is virtuous with perfected seeing
Till purged of greed for sensedesires He will surely come no more to any womb
you are one who does not dwell practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma practicing masterfully living in line with the Dhamma but deviates from it
The person who urged him the thing urged and the person who practiced in line with what was urged
would all produce much demerit
you are one who dwells practicing the Dhamma in accordance with that Dhamma practicing masterfully living in line with that Dhamma and acts to conform to it
The person who praised him the thing praised and the person who being praised aroused even greater persistence

Then the Teacher manifesting the infinite power of a Buddha began to preach the Law
you are one who dwells practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma practicing masterfully living in line with the Dhamma and acts to conform to it
The person who praised him the thing praised and the person who being praised aroused even greater persistence
would all produce much merit
and now our teacher has disappeared
and now our teacher has disappeared
Because he is free from lust through the destruction of lust

This is the second devotion to pleasure

one year
He who renounced his possessions at the feet of Buddha Dīpaṅkara
Wishing for Perfect Awakening I worship his hair relics
He who fulfilled the conditions for unsurpassed Awakening
And attained the state of Awakening his noble hair relics I revere
After attaining the state of Awakening he announced at the sixth place
The Kings Stead Tree his liberation his noble hair relics I revere
There he partook of the betel leaves and myrobalan given by Lord Sakka
And the water from Lake Anotatta I worship his hair relics
Then the green rock bowl was given by the Four Great Kings
The one who is Lord sought the benefit of the world him I revere
Then sweet rice balls were given by the two brothers
And he also enjoyed milkrice his splendid head I revere
He who then gave the two refuges to Tapussa and Bhallika
The foremost of all in the world his noble head I revere
Then he gave to those supporters there eight of his hairs
The one who is Lord desiring the benefit of the world him I revere
After bringing them they built at Pokkharabbati
The hair shrine endowed with life I revere all this in former times
On every one of the Fast Days dark rays are emitted
The Fortunate One surely brings benefit to the world I rever him always
In time the CrestJewel and the Clothes Shrine of the Buddhatobe was built
In a Buddhaperiod this is the foremost of all I revere it
I revere I worship I honour the hair relics
May the merit of writing these verses be a condition for me to attain the destruction of the pollutants
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time amongst many monks
after returning from the almsround after the meal
assembling together and sitting in the Round Hall
this conversation arose
Now who venerable friends knows a craft
Who has trained in what craft
Which craft is the greatest of the crafts
Then some said this Elephantcraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Horsecraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Chariotcraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Bowcraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Swordcraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Fingercalculationcraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Abacuscraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Accountancycraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Writingcraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Poetrycraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Natural philosophycraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Political sciencecraft is the greatest of the crafts
Now this conversation that arose amongst those monks was left unfinished
Then the Fortunate One having risen from seclusion in the evening time
went to the Round Hall
and after going he sat down on the prepared seat
Having sat down the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
What is the talk about monks amongst those who have assembled at present
and what is the conversation amongst you that was left unfinished
Here reverend Sir after returning from the almsround after the meal
assembling together and sitting in the Round Hall
this conversation arose
Now who venerable friends knows a craft
Who has trained in what craft
Which of the crafts is the greatest of the crafts
Then some said this Elephantcraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Horsecraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Chariotcraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Bowcraft is the greatest of the crafts

some said this Writingcraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Poetrycraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Natural philosophycraft is the greatest of the crafts
some said this Political sciencecraft is the greatest of the crafts
This is the conversation reverend Sir that we left unfinished
then the Fortunate One arrived
This is certainly not suitable monks for you
sons of good family who through faith have gone forth from the home to homelessness
that you should talk such talk
When you have assembled together monks there are two things that you ought to do
talk about the Dhamma or maintain noble silence
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
One who lives without craft light desiring others' welfare
With restrained faculties completely free in every way
Who wanders homeless unselfish not yearning
Having given up conceit solitary  he is a monk
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Uruvelā
on the bank of the river Nerañjarā at the root of the Goatherds Banyan tree in the first period after attaining Awakening
Then at that time the Fortunate One
was sitting in one crosslegged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of freedom
Then with the passing of those seven days the Fortunate One
arose from that concentration
Then a certain brāhmaṇa who was by nature a grumbler
went to the Fortunate One
and after going he exchanged greetings with the Fortunate One
After exchanging courteous talk and greetings he stood on one side
While stood on one side that brāhmaṇa said this to the Fortunate One
To what extent dear Gotama is one a brāhmaṇa
And again what things make one a brāhmaṇa
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
That brāhmaṇa who has removed bad things
Not grumbling free from blemish selfrestrained
With perfect understanding and the spiritual life accomplished
Righteously he might speak a word about the Brahman
For him there is no arrogance anywhere in the world
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Saṅgāmajī
had arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Fortunate One
Venerable Saṅgāmajīs former wife heard
Master Saṅgāmajī it seems has arrived at Sāvatthī
and taking her little boy she went to Jetas Wood
Then at that time venerable Saṅgāmajī
was dwelling for the day sat at the root of a certain tree
Then venerable Saṅgāmajīs former wife
went to venerable Saṅgāmajī
and after going she said to venerable Saṅgāmajī
I have a little son ascetic you must take care of me
After that was said venerable Saṅgāmajī was silent
For a second time venerable Saṅgāmajīs former wife
said to venerable Saṅgāmajī
I have a little son ascetic you must take care of me
For a second time venerable Saṅgāmajī was silent
For a third time venerable Saṅgāmajīs former wife
said to venerable Saṅgāmajī
I have a little son ascetic you must take care of me
For a third time venerable Saṅgāmajī was silent
Then venerable Saṅgāmajīs former wife
having put the boy down in front of venerable Saṅgāmajī went away saying
This is your son ascetic you must take care of him
But venerable Saṅgāmajī did not look at the boy nor did he speak to him
Then venerable Saṅgāmajīs former wife
having gone not far away looking round saw that venerable Saṅgāmajī
was neither looking at the boy nor was he speaking to him
Having seen that this occured to her
This ascetic does not even have need of a son
Therefore after turning back and taking the boy she went away
The Fortunate One saw with the divineeye
which is purified and surpasses that of normal men
that venerable Saṅgāmajīs former wife had such bad manners
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
In her coming he does not rejoice  in her leaving he does not grieve
Saṅgāmajī Victorious in Battle free from the shackle  him I call a brāhmaṇa
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time many young boys
who were between Sāvatthī and Jetas Wood were catching little fish
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe was entering Sāvatthī for alms
The Fortunate One saw those many young boys
who were between Sāvatthī and Jetas Wood catching fish
Having seen that he went to those young boys
and after going he said this to those young boys
Are you afraid boys of suffering Is suffering unpleasant to you
Yes reverend Sir we are afraid of suffering suffering is unpleasant to us
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
If you have fear of suffering  if suffering is unpleasant to you
Don't do any bad deeds  whether in the open or in secret
But if you will do or now do do bad deeds
For you there is no freedom from suffering  even after going while running away
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time the Fortunate One was instructing rousing enthusing and cheering
the monks with a Dhamma talk connected with Emancipation
Those monks after making it their goal applying their minds
considering it with all their mind were listening to Dhamma with an attentive ear
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
There is monks an unborn unbecome unmade unconditioned
If monks there were not that unborn unbecome
unmade unconditioned you could not know an escape here
from the born become made and conditioned
But because there is an unborn unbecome
unmade unconditioned therefore you do know an escape
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
was living near Suppāraka on the bank of the ocean
being venerated respected revered honoured esteemed
in receipt of robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sick
Then when Bāhiya of the Bark Robe had gone into hiding into seclusion
this reflection arose in his mind
Among those in the world who are Worthy Ones
or have entered the path to Worthiness I am one of them
Then a devatā who was a former bloodrelative of Bāhiya of the Bark Robe
being compassionate and desiring his welfare
knowing with his mind the reflection in the mind of Bāhiya of the Bark Robe
went to Bāhiya of the Bark Robe
and after going he said this to Bāhiya of the Bark Robe
You are certainly not a Worthy One Bāhiya
Nor have you entered the path to Worthiness
This practice of yours is not one whereby you could be a Worthy One
or one who has entered the path to Worthiness
Then who now in this world with its devas are Worthy Ones
or have entered the path to Worthiness
There is Bāhiya in the northern countries a city by the name of Sāvatthī
There the Fortunate One dwells at the present time who is a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha
He Bāhiya the Fortunate One is certainly a Worthy One and teaches the Dhamma for attaining Worthiness
Then Bāhiya of the Bark Robe being greatly moved by that devatā
immediately went away from Suppāraka and staying for only one night in every place
went to Sāvatthī Jetas Wood and to Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time many monks were walking in meditation in the open air
Then Bāhiya of the Bark Robe went to those monks
and after going he said this to those monks
Where reverend Sirs is the Fortunate One living at present
the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha We have a desire to see
the Fortunate One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
The Fortunate One Bāhiya has entered among the houses for alms
Then Bāhiya of the Bark Robe having hurriedly
left Jetas Grove and having entered Sāvatthī
saw the Fortunate One walking for alms in Sāvatthī
confident inspiring confidence with sense faculties at peace mind at peace
having attained supreme selfcontrol and calm
controlled guarded with restrained faculties a true nāga
After seeing him he went to the Fortunate One
and after going and prostrating himself with his head at the Fortunate Ones feet
he said this to the Fortunate One
Let the Fortunate One preach the Dhamma to me reverend Sir let the Happy One preach the Dhamma
that will be for my benefit and happiness for a long time
After that was said the Fortunate One said this to Bāhiya of the Bark Robe
It is the wrong time for you Bāhiya we have entered among the houses for alms
For a second time Bāhiya of the Bark Robe said this to the Fortunate One
But it is hard to know reverend Sir the dangers to the Fortunate Ones life
or the dangers to my life
Let the Fortunate One preach the Dhamma to me reverend Sir let the Happy One preach the Dhamma
that will be for my benefit and happiness for a long time
For a second time the Fortunate One said this to Bāhiya of the Bark Robe
It is the wrong time for you Bāhiya we have entered among the houses for alms
For a third time Bāhiya of the Bark Robe said this to the Fortunate One
But it is hard to know reverend Sir the dangers to the Fortunate Ones life
or the dangers to my life
Let the Fortunate One preach the Dhamma to me reverend Sir let the Happy One preach the Dhamma
that will be for my benefit and happiness for a long time
In that case Bāhiya you should train yourself thus
in what is heard there must be only what is heard
in what is sensed there must be only what is sensed
in what is cognized there must be only what is cognized
This is the way Bāhiya you should train yourself
And since for you Bāhiya in what is seen there will be only what is seen
in what is heard there will be only what is heard
in what is sensed there will be only what is sensed
in what is cognized there will be only what is cognized
therefore Bāhiya you will not be with that
and since Bāhiya you will not be with that therefore Bāhiya you will not be in that
and since Bāhiya you will not be in that therefore Bāhiya you
 just this is the end of suffering
Then through the Fortunate Ones brief teaching of this Dhamma
Bāhiya of the Bark Robes mind was immediately
freed from the pollutants without attachment
Then the Fortunate One having advised
Bāhiya of the Bark Robe with this brief advice went away
Then not long after the Fortunate One had gone
a cow with a young calf having attacked Bāhiya of the Bark Robe deprived him of life
Then the Fortunate One after walking for alms in Sāvatthī
while returning from the almsround after the meal
after going out from the city with many monks
saw that Bāhiya of the Bark Robe had died
After seeing him he addressed the monks saying
Monks take up Bāhiya of the Bark Robes body
and after putting it on a bier carrying it away and burning it make a memorial mound for him
your fellow in the spiritual life monks has died
Yes reverend Sir said those monks and after replying to the Fortunate One
putting Bāhiya of the Bark Robes body on a bier
carrying it away burning it and making a memorial mound for him
they went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side those monks said this to the Fortunate One
Burnt reverend Sir is Bāhiya of the Bark Robes body and the memorial mound for him has been made
What is his destination What is his future state
A wise man monks was Bāhiya of the Bark Robe
who practiced Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma
and did not trouble me on account of the Dhamma
Completely emancipated monks is Bāhiya of the Bark Robe
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
In the place where the water earth   fire and wind find no footing
There the stars do not shine  nor does the sun give light
There the moon does not glow  there darkness is not found
And when the sage the brāhmaṇa has experienced nibbāna through his own sagacity
Then from both form and formless  happiness and suffering he is free
This exalted utterance was also said by the Fortunate One so I have heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Sāriputta
was sitting not far away from the Fortunate One
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
and was attending to mindfulness at the front
The Fortunate One saw that venerable Sāriputta was sitting not far away
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
and was attending to mindfulness at the front
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Just like a mountain rock  unagitated well established
So is the monk through the destruction of delusion   like a mountain he does not shake
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Uruvelā
on the bank of the river Nerañjarā at the root of the Mucalinda tree in the first period after attaining Awakening
Then at that time the Fortunate One
was sitting in one crosslegged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of freedom
Then at that time a great cloud arose out of season
bringing seven days of rainy weather cold winds and overcast days
Then the Nāga King Mucalinda after leaving his domicile
and surrounding the Fortunate Ones body seven times with his coils
stood with his great hood stretched out above his head thinking
May the Fortunate One not be cold may the Fortunate One not be hot
may the Fortunate One not be affected by gadflies mosquitoes wind the heat of the sun and serpents
Then with the passing of those seven days the Fortunate One
arose from that concentration
Then the Nāga King Mucalinda
having understood that the sky was now clear without a cloud
having unravelled his coils from the Fortunate Ones body
and after withdrawing his own form and creating the appearance of a young brāhmaṇa
stood in front of the Fortunate One revering the Fortunate One with raised hands
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
There is happiness and detachment for the one who is satisfied  who has heard the Dhamma and who sees
There is happiness for him who is free from illwill in the world  who is restrained towards breathing beings
The state of dispassion in the world is happiness  the complete transcending of sense desires
But for he who has removed the conceit I am   this is indeed the highest happiness
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Subhūti
was sitting not far away from the Fortunate One
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
having attained a concentration free from thought
The Fortunate One saw venerable Subhūti sat not far away
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
who had attained a concentration free from thought
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
For he who has dispelled thoughts
Totally cut them off within himself without remainder
Perceiving the formless nibbāna beyond the shackle
Having overcome the four yokes  he surely does not come to birth again
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Uruvelā
on the bank of the river Nerañjara at the root of the Awakening tree in the first period after attaining Awakening
Then at that time the Fortunate One
was sitting in one crosslegged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of freedom
Then with the passing of those seven days the Fortunate One
after rising from that concentration looked around the world with his Buddhaeye
The Fortunate One looking around the world with his Buddhaeye saw
beings being tormented with many torments
and being burned with many fevers
born from passion and born from hatred and born from delusion
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
This world overcome by contact is tormented
It speaks of a disease as the self
For with whatever it conceives
Hereafter it becomes otherwise
Continually becoming other the world is shackled by continuity overcome by continuity
It greatly rejoices in continuity
What it rejoices in that is fearful
What it fears that is suffering
This spiritual life is lived for the complete giving up of continuity
For whatever the ascetics or brāhmaṇas
say about freedom from continuity being through further continuity
all of them are not free from continuity I say
Or whatever the ascetics or brāhmaṇas
say about the escape from continuity being through discontinuity
all of them have not escaped from continuity I say
Conditioned by cleaving this suffering originates
through the destruction of all attachment there is no origination of suffering
See this world overcome by many kinds of ignorance
beings who delight in beings are not free from continuity
Whatever continuities in existence there are everywhere in every respect
all those continuities are impermanent suffering changeable things
Seeing it like this as it really is with right wisdom
Craving for continuity is given up  and he does not rejoice in discontinuity
From the complete destruction of craving there is a fading away of ignorance without remainder cessation and Emancipation
For that monk who is emancipated
Without attachment there is no continuity in existence
He has vanquished Māra is victorious in battle
He is such a one who has overcome all continuations in existence
at one time the Fortunate One was walking on walking tour amongst the Kosalans
together with a great Community of monks
Then the Fortunate One having gone down from the road
went to the root of a certain tree
and after going he sat down on the prepared seat
Then a certain cowherd went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side the Fortunate One
instructed roused enthused and cheered that cowherd with a Dhamma talk
Then that cowherd having been instructed
roused enthused and cheered by the Fortunate One with a Dhamma talk
said to the Fortunate One
May the Fortunate One consent reverend Sir to me
offering him a meal on the morrow together with the Community of monks
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence
Then that cowherd having understood the Fortunate Ones consent
after rising from his seat worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One went away
Then with the passing of that night that cowherd in his own residence
having had an abundance of rich milkrice and fresh ghee made ready
announced the time to the Fortunate One saying It is time reverend Sir the meal is ready
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe together with the Community of monks
went to that cowherds residence
and after going he sat down on the prepared seat
Then that cowherd with his own hand served and satisfied
the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head with rich milkrice and fresh ghee
Then that cowherd when the Fortunate One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl
having taken a low seat sat down on one side
While sat on one side the Fortunate One
after instructing rousing enthusing and cheering
that cowherd with a Dhamma talk having risen from the seat went away
Then not long after the Fortunate One had gone
while between the boundaries of the villages a certain man deprived that cowherd of life
Then many monks went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side those monks said this to the Fortunate One
Today reverend Sir the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head
was served and satisfied by a cowherd with rich milkrice and fresh ghee
now it seems that cowherd reverend Sir
while between the boundaries of the villages was deprived of life by a certain man
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Whatever an enemy might do to an enemy   or a foe to a foe
A wrongly directed mind  may do more harm to him than that
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Kuṇḍiya at Kuṇḍadhāna Wood
Then at that time the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā
While she was affected by painful sharp harsh and bitter feelings
she consented to three thoughts For sure the Fortunate One is a Perfect Sambuddha
who teaches the Dhamma for the giving up of suffering such as this
for sure the Fortunate Ones Community of disciples are good in their practice
who practice for the giving up of suffering such as this
it is sure that Emancipation is truly happy
where suffering such as this is not found
Then the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā addressed her husband saying
Come Master you must go to the Fortunate One
and after going in my name you should worship the Fortunate Ones feet with your head
and ask if he is free from affliction free from sickness in good health strong and living comfortably and say

That is the best thing said the Koliyan gentleman
and after replying to Suppavāsā the Koliyan lady
he went to the Fortunate One

Happy may the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā be and healthy
and may she give birth to a healthy son
And with this word of the Fortunate One the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā
became happy and healthy and gave birth to a healthy son
Yes reverend Sir said the Koliyan gentleman
and after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the Fortunate One
rising from his seat worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One
he returned to his own home
The Koliyan gentleman saw that the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā was happy and healthy
and had given birth to a healthy son Having seen that it occured to him
Surely it is wonderful surely it is marvellous
the Realised Ones great power and great majesty
in as much as this Koliyan lady Suppavāsā
with this word of the Fortunate One
became happy and healthy and to a healthy son gave birth
and he was elated gladdened joyful and happy
Then the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā addressed her husband saying
Come Master you must go to the Fortunate One

The Koliyan lady Suppavāsā reverend Sir worships the Fortunate Ones feet with her head

For seven days she invites the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head for a meal
May the Fortunate One consent reverend Sir to seven meals from the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā
together with the Community of monks 
That is the best thing said the Koliyan gentleman and after replying to Suppavāsā the Koliyan lady
he went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side the Koliyan gentleman said this to the Fortunate One
The Koliyan lady Suppavāsā reverend Sir worships the Fortunate Ones feet with her head
And she says this The Koliyan lady Suppavāsā reverend Sir

May the Fortunate One consent reverend Sir to seven meals from the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā
together with the Community of monks 
Then at that time a certain lay follower
had invited the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head to a meal on the morrow
Now that lay follower was venerable Mahāmoggallānas supporter
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable Mahāmoggallāna saying
 Come Moggallāna you must go to that lay follower
and after going please say this to that lay follower
Friend the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā

for wealth and for life  but for faith you are the surety
If reverend Sir master Mahāmoggallāna
is my surety for two things  for wealth and for life 
the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā may make her seven meals
and afterwards I will make mine
Then venerable Mahāmoggallāna after conciliating that lay follower
went to the Fortunate One
and after going he said this to the Fortunate One
That lay follower has been conciliated by me reverend Sir
let the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā make her seven meals and afterwards he can make his
Then the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā
for seven days with her own hand served and satisfied the Community of monks
with the Buddha at its head with excellent comestibles and edibles
Then she made the little boy worship the Buddha and the whole Community of monks
Then venerable Sāriputta said this to that little boy
Can you bear up little boy Can you carry on
Do you have any pain
How reverend Sāriputta can I bear up How can I carry on
For seven years I have been living in a bloodbath
Then it occured to the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā
My son is consulting with the general of the Dhamma
and she became elated gladdened joyful and happy
Then the Fortunate One after seeing that the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā
was elated gladdened joyful and happy
said this to the Koliyan lady Suppavāsā
Suppavāsā do you long for another such son
Fortunate One I long for another seven such sons
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
The disagreeable in an agreeable form  the unlovely in a lovely form
The painful in the form of pleasure  overcome the heedless one
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Sāriputta
was sitting not far away from the Fortunate One
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
with few longings satisfied completely secluded unattached
with energy aroused applying himself to the higher mind
The Fortunate One saw venerable Sāriputta who was sitting not far away
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
with few longings satisfied completely secluded detached
with energy aroused applying himself to the higher mind
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
For he with higher mind for the heedful one
For the sage who is training in the path of sagacity
There are no griefs for such a one
For a peaceful one  he is one who is always mindful
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at the Eastern Monastery in Migāras mothers mansion
Then at that time the Fortunate One
was sitting surrounded by the Community of monks on the Observance Day
Then venerable nanda when the night had passed
when the first watch of the night had gone after rising from his seat arranging his robe on one shoulder
and raising his hands in respectful salutation said this to the Fortunate One
The night has passed reverend Sir the first watch of the night has gone
for a long time the Community of monks has been sitting
may the Fortunate One recite the Pātimokkha for the monks
When that was said the Fortunate One was silent
For a second time venerable nanda when the night had passed
when the middle watch of the night had gone after rising from his seat arranging his robe on one shoulder
and raising his hands in respectful salutation said this to the Fortunate One
The night has passed reverend Sir the middle watch of the night has gone
for a long time the Community of monks has been sitting

For a second time the Fortunate One was silent
For a third time venerable nanda when the night had passed
when the last watch of the night had gone when dawn had risen when the night had a joyful appearance

and raising his hands in respectful salutation said this to the Fortunate One
The night has passed reverend Sir the last watch of the night has gone
dawn has risen the night has a joyful appearance for a long time the Community of monks has been sitting
may the Fortunate One recite the Pātimokkha for the monks
The assembly is not completely pure nanda
Then it occurred to venerable Mahāmoggallāna
With regard to which person did the Fortunate One say this
The assembly is not completely pure nanda 
Then venerable Mahāmoggallāna
applied his mind and encompassed fully the whole of that Community of monks with his mind
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna saw that person who was lacking in virtue
of bad character of impure and doubtful conduct who covered up his deeds
who was not an ascetic though making it known he was an ascetic who was not living the spiritual life though making it known he was living the spiritual life
who was filthy inside polluted and gone rotten
sat in the middle of the Community of monks
Having seen him after rising from his seat he went to that person
and after going he said this to that person
Get up friend you have been seen by the Fortunate One
there is no longer communion for you with the monks
Then that person was silent
For a second time venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this to that person
Get up friend you have been seen by the Fortunate One

For a second time that person was silent
For a third time venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this to that person
Get up friend you have been seen by the Fortunate One
there is no longer communion for you with the monks
For a third time that person was silent
Then venerable Mahāmoggallāna having taken that person by the arm
having expelled him outside the doorway and drawn the lock
went to the Fortunate One
and after going he said this to the Fortunate One
I have expelled that person reverend Sir the assembly is now completely pure
may the Fortunate One venerable Sir recite the Pātimokkha for the monks
It is wonderful Moggallāna it is marvellous Moggallāna
how that foolish person waited until he was grabbed by the arm
Then the Fortunate One addressed the monks
From now onwards monks I will not hold the Observance
or recite the Pātimokkha
From now onwards monks you must hold the Observance
and recite the Pātimokkha
This is impossible monks it is not permitted
that the Realised One should hold the Observance in an assembly that is not completely pure
and should recite the Pātimokkha

Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
On what is covered defilement pours down  on what is open it does not pour down
Therefore what is covered open up  so that it does not pour down on you
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time
a certain monk was sitting not far away from the Fortunate One
and after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
he was bearing painful sharp harsh and bitter feelings that had arisen as a result of former unwholesome deeds
mindfully with full awareness and without being troubled
The Fortunate One saw that monk sitting not far away
who after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
was bearing painful sharp harsh and severe feelings that had arisen as a result of former unwholesome deeds
mindfully with full awareness and without being troubled
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
For the monk who has given up all deeds
For he who is throwing off the dust of what was done before
For he who is unselfish stable suchlike
There is no need to speak to people
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time a certain lay follower from Icchānaṅgala
had arrived at Sāvatthī with some business or other
Then that lay follower having concluded that business in Sāvatthī
went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side the Fortunate One said this to that lay follower
At long last lay follower you have made arrangements
so to say for coming here
For a long time reverend Sir I have desired to come to see the Fortunate One
but I have been engaged with some sort of duty and business or another
and I have thus been unable to come to see the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
For he who has nothing there is happiness indeed
For the one who has discerned the Dhamma for the learned
See how one who has something is troubled
He is a person who is in a state of bondage in regard to other people
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time a certain lay followers
only son who was beloved and dear had died
Then many lay followers with wet clothes and hair
in the middle of the day went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side the Fortunate One said this to those lay followers
Now why are you lay followers with wet clothes and hair
coming here in the middle of the day
When that was said that lay follower said this to the Fortunate One
My only son who was beloved and dear reverend Sir has died
That is why we with wet clothes and hair are coming here in the middle of the day
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Hosts of devas and many men are tied by the satisfaction in forms that are loved
Miserable and worn out  they come under the power of the King of Death
For sure those who are heedful day and night give up forms that are loved 
They surely dig up the root of misery  which is Deaths bait so difficult to transcend
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Sāriputta
venerable Mahāmoggallana venerable Mahākassapa
venerable Mahākaccāyana venerable Mahākoṭṭhita
venerable Mahākappina venerable Mahācunda
venerable Anuruddha venerable Revata
and venerable Nanda went to the Fortunate One
The Fortunate One saw those venerable ones coming while still far away
and having seen them he addressed the monks saying
These brāhmaṇas are coming monks
these brāhmaṇas are coming monks
After that was said a certain monk who was a brāhmaṇa by birth
said to the Fortunate One
To what extent dear Gotama is one a brāhmaṇa
And again what things make one a brāhmaṇa
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Those who having removed bad things live always mindful
The Buddhas who have destroyed the fetters  truly they are brāhmaṇas in the world
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time the Fortunate One
was venerated respected revered honoured esteemed and in receipt of
robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sick
also the Community of monks was venerated respected revered honoured esteemed and in receipt of
robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sick
But wanderers from other sects
were not venerated not respected not revered not honoured not esteemed nor were they in receipt of
robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sick
Then those wanderers from other sects
being unable to bear the veneration of the Fortunate One and the Community of monks
after seeing the monks in the village or the wilderness
with vulgar and rough words scolded abused annoyed and troubled them
Then many monks went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side those monks said this to the Fortunate One
At present reverend Sir the Fortunate One is venerated respected revered honoured esteemed and in receipt of
robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sick
also the Community of monks is venerated respected revered honoured esteemed and in receipt of
robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sick
But wanderers from other sects

Then those wanderers from other sects reverend Sir
being unable to bear the veneration of the Fortunate One and the Community of monks
after seeing the monks in the village or the wilderness
with vulgar and rough words scold abuse annoy and trouble them
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Affected by pleasure and pain in the village or wilderness
you should certainly not consider it as due to oneself or another
Contacts affect one with cleaving as condition
How could contacts affect one without cleaving
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Nanda
the Fortunate Ones brother his mothers sisters son
confessed this to many monks
I have no great delight venerable friends living the spiritual life
I am not able to endure the spiritual life
having disavowed the training I will return to what is inferior
Then a certain monk went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side that monk said this to the Fortunate One
Venerable Nanda reverend Sir the Fortunate Ones brother his mothers sisters son
confesses this to many monks
I have no great delight venerable friends living the spiritual life
I am not able to endure the spiritual life
having disavowed the training I will return to what is inferior 
Then the Fortunate One addressed a certain monk saying
Please go monk and with my word address the monk Nanda saying
The Teacher venerable friend Nanda calls you 
Yes reverend Sir said that monk and after replying to the Fortunate One
he went to venerable Nanda
and after going he said this to venerable Nanda
The Teacher venerable friend Nanda calls you
Yes venerable friend said venerable Nanda and after replying to that monk
he went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side the Fortunate One said this to venerable Nanda
Is it true as it seems Nanda that you confessed this to many monks saying
I have no great delight venerable friends living the spiritual life
I am not able to endure the spiritual life
having disavowed the training I will return to what is inferior 
Yes reverend Sir
But why do you Nanda have no great delight living the spiritual life
are not able to endure the spiritual life
and having disavowed the training will return to what is inferior
As I was leaving from home reverend Sir a Sakyan girl the most beautiful woman in the country
with her hair halfcombed having looked round said this to me
Master may you quickly return
Remembering that reverend Sir
I have no great delight living the spiritual life
I am not able to endure the spiritual life
and having disavowed the training I will return to what is inferior
Then the Fortunate One having taken venerable Nanda by the arm
just as a strong man might stretch out a bent arm
or bend in an outstretched arm
in the same way did he disappear from Jetas Wood and reappear amongst the Tāvatisa devas
Then at that time five hundred celestial dovefooted nymphs
had come to attend to Sakka the lord of the devas
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable Nanda saying
Do you see Nanda these five hundred celestial dovefooted nymphs
Yes reverend Sir
What do you think about this Nanda
who has the most perfect form is the most fair to behold is the most pleasing
the Sakyan girl the most beautiful woman in the country
or these five hundred celestial dovefooted nymphs
Like a disfigured monkey reverend Sir with its ears and nose cut off
so is the Sakyan girl reverend Sir the most beautiful woman in the country
compared with these five hundred celestial nymphs she does not count
she is not even a fraction she is not even half a fraction she is not even to be compared
These five hundred celestial nymphs
certainly have the most perfect form are the most fair to behold are the more pleasing
Take delight Nanda Take delight Nanda I am your surety
for gaining five hundred celestial dovefooted nymphs
If reverend Sir the Fortunate One is my surety
for gaining five hundred celestial dovefooted nymphs
I will take great delight reverend Sir in living the spiritual life under the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One having taken venerable Nanda by the arm
just as a strong man might stretch out a bent arm
or bend in an outstretched arm
in the same way did they disappear from amongst the Tāvatisa devas and reappear in Jetas Wood
The monks heard Venerable Nanda it seems
the Fortunate Ones brother his mothers sisters son
is living the spiritual life for the sake of celestial nymphs
the Fortunate One it seems is his surety
for gaining five hundred celestial dovefooted nymphs
Then venerable Nandas monkfriends accosted venerable Nanda
with words about a hireling with words about a lackey saying
It seems venerable Nanda is a hireling it seems venerable Nanda is a lackey
he is living the spiritual life for the sake of celestial nymphs
the Fortunate One it seems is his surety
for gaining five hundred celestial dovefooted nymphs
Then venerable Nanda at his monkfriends'
words about a hireling words about a lackey
was distressed ashamed and disgusted
and while dwelling solitary secluded heedful ardent and resolute
after no long time attained that good for which sons of good family
rightly go forth from the home to homelessness
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
and dwelt having known having directly experienced and having attained nibbāna himself in this very life
Destroyed is birth
accomplished is the spiritual life
done is what ought to be done
there is no more of this mundane state  this he knew
And venerable Nanda became another of the Worthy Ones
Then a certain devatā when the night had passed
having lit up the whole of Jetas Wood with his surpassing beauty
went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he stood on one side
While standing on one side that devatā said this to the Fortunate One
Venerable Nanda reverend Sir the Fortunate Ones brother his mothers sisters son
through the destruction of the pollutants without pollutants freed in mind freed through wisdom
dwells having known having directly experienced and having attained nibbāna himself in this very life
And this knowledge arose to the Fortunate One
Nanda through the destruction of the pollutants without pollutants freed in mind freed through wisdom
dwells having known having directly experienced and having attained nibbāna himself in this very life
Then venerable Nanda when that night had passed
went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While sat on one side venerable Nanda said this to the Fortunate One
That reverend Sir for which the Fortunate One was my surety
 for gaining five hundred celestial dovefooted nymphs 
I free the Fortunate One reverend Sir from that promise
Nanda having encompassed your mind fully with my mind I understood
Nanda through the destruction of the pollutants without pollutants freed in mind freed through wisdom
dwells having known having directly experienced and having attained nibbāna himself in this very life
Also a devatā announced that matter to me saying
Venerable Nanda reverend Sir the Fortunate Ones brother his mothers sisters son
through the destruction of the pollutants without pollutants freed in mind freed through wisdom
dwells having known having directly experienced and having attained nibbāna himself in this very life
When Nanda your mind was freed from the pollutants without attachment
then was I freed from that promise
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
He who has got out of the quagmire  who has crushed the thorn of sense desire
Who has arrived at the destruction of delusion  that monk does not shake in regard to pleasure and pain
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Rājagaha
in Bamboo Wood at the Squirrels Feeding Place
Then at that time the leper known as Suppabuddha Wide Awake was in Rājagaha
a poor man a wretched man a miserable man
Then at that time the Fortunate One
was sitting teaching Dhamma surrounded by a great assembly
The leper Suppabuddha saw
while still far away that great crowd of people assembled together
Having seen that this occurred to him
Undoubtedly in this place
some comestibles and edibles will be distributed
Well now I could go to that great crowd of people
perhaps I will get some comestibles or edibles in this place
Then the leper Suppabuddha went to that great crowd of people
The leper Suppabuddha saw the Fortunate One
sat teaching Dhamma surrounded by a great assembly
Having seen that this occurred to him
Here there are no comestibles or edibles being distributed
this ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma to the assembly
Perhaps I also could hear the Dhamma and he sat down right there and then thinking
I will also listen to the Dhamma
Then the Fortunate One applied his mind and encompassed fully the whole of that assembly with his mind thinking
Who here is able to understand the Dhamma
The Fortunate One saw the leper Suppabuddha
sat in that assembly and having seen him this occurred to him
This one here is able to understand the Dhamma
and having regard to the leper Suppabuddha he related a gradual talk
that is to say talk on giving talk on virtue talk on heaven
the danger degradation and defilement of sensual desires
and the advantages in renunciation  these he explained
When the Fortunate One knew that the leper Suppabuddha
was of ready mind malleable mind unhindered mind uplifted mind trusting mind
then he explained the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves
suffering origination cessation path
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain
would take the dye well
so to the leper Suppabuddha
on that very seat the dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma arose
Whatever has the nature of arising all that has the nature of ceasing
Then the leper Suppabuddha having seen the Dhamma attained the Dhamma
understood the Dhamma penetrated the Dhamma crossed over uncertainty being without doubts
attained full confidence having become independent of others in the Teachers teaching
after rising from his seat went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down at one side
While he was sitting on one side the leper Suppabuddha said this to the Fortunate One
Excellent reverend Sir Excellent reverend Sir
Just as reverend Sir one might set upright what has been overturned
or open up what has been closed or show a path to one who is lost
or bear an oil lamp in the darkness so that those with vision can see forms
just so has the Dhamma been explained by the Fortunate One in countless ways
I go reverend Sir to the Fortunate One for refuge
and to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks
Please bear it in mind reverend Gotama that I am a lay follower
who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I am furnished with life
Then the Fortunate One instructed roused
enthused and cheered the leper Suppabuddha with a Dhamma talk
and after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the Fortunate One
after rising from his seat worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One he went away
Then not long after the leper Suppabuddha had gone
a cow with a young calf having attacked him deprived him of life
Then many monks went to the Fortunate One
and after going and worshipping the Fortunate One they sat down on one side
While sat on one side those monks said this to the Fortunate One
That leper called Suppabuddha reverend Sir who was instructed roused enthused and cheered
by the Fortunate One with a Dhamma talk  he has died
What is his destination What is his future state
A wise man monks was Suppabuddha
who practiced Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma
and did not trouble me on account of the Dhamma
The leper Suppabuddha monks through the destruction of three fetters
is a streamenterer not subject to the fall and is assured of arriving at Full Awakening
When that was said a certain monk said this to the Fortunate One
What was the reason reverend Sir what was the cause through which the leper Suppabuddha became
a poor man a wretched man a miserable man
Formerly monks the leper Suppabuddha
was a son of a wealthy merchant in this very Rājagaha
While going to his pleasure park he saw the Independent Buddha Tagarasikkhī
entering the city for alms and having seen him this occurred to him
Who is this leper roaming around with his lepers robe
And having spat and circumambulated him disrespectfully on the left side he went away
As a result of that deed of his for many years for many hundreds of years
for many thousands of years for many hundreds of thousands of years he boiled in the nether regions
And as a result of the remaining part of that deed of his
he became a leper in this very Rājagaha
a poor man a wretched man a miserable man
But he came to the Dhamma and Discipline taught by the Realised One
and obtained faith obtained virtue obtained learning
obtained liberality obtained wisdom
After coming to the Dhamma and Discipline taught by the Realised One
and obtaining faith obtaining virtue obtaining learning
obtaining liberality obtaining wisdom
at the break up of the body after death he arose in a happy destiny in the world of Heaven
in the companionship of the Tāvatisa devas
And there he surely outshines the other devas with his beauty and repute
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
As a man with vision while he is endeavouring would avoid dangerous paths
So a wise man in the world of the living  should avoid bad deeds
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time many young boys
who were between Sāvatthī and Jetas Wood were attacking a snake with a stick
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe was entering Sāvatthī for alms
The Fortunate One saw those many young boys
between Sāvatthī and Jetas Wood attacking a snake with a stick
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
He who while seeking happiness for himself harms with a stick
Other beings who desire happiness  will not find happiness after passing away
He who while seeking happiness for himself does not harm with a stick
Other beings who desire happiness  will find happiness after passing away
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time the Fortunate One was instructing rousing enthusing and cheering
the monks with a Dhamma talk connected with Emancipation
Those monks after making it their goal applying their minds
considering it with all their mind were listening to Dhamma with an attentive ear
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
There is that sphere monks
where there is no earth no water no fire no air
no sphere of infinite space no sphere of infinite consciousness
no sphere of nothingness no sphere of neither perception nor nonperception
no this world no world beyond neither Moon nor Sun
There monks I say there is surely no coming
no going no persisting no passing away no rebirth
It is quite without support unmoving without an object
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time the Fortunate One was sitting reflecting on his own
abandonment of countless bad unwholesome things
and how through development countless wholesome things had come to fulfilment
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Before it was then it wasn't  before it wasn't then it was
It was not and it will not be  and at present it is not found
Thus I heard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Aññātakoṇḍañña Koṇḍañña hewhoknows
was sitting not far away from the Fortunate One
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
reflecting on his own freedom through the complete destruction of craving
The Fortunate One saw venerable Aññātakoṇḍañña
sat not far away after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
reflecting on his own freedom through the complete destruction of craving
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
For he who has no roots no ground  and no leaves how then creepers
That firm one free from bonds   who is worthy enough to blame him
The devas praise him  and he has also been praised by Brahma
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time venerable Kaṅkhārevata Doubting Revata
was sitting not far away from the Fortunate One
after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
reflecting on his own purification through crossing over doubt
The Fortunate One saw venerable Kaṅkhārevata
sat not far away after folding his legs crosswise and setting his body straight
reflecting on his own purification through crossing over doubt
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
Whatever doubts there are about here or hereafter
Understandable by oneself or understandable by another
The meditators give up all these
The ardent ones living the spiritual life
on the bank of the river Nerañjarā at the root of the Awakening tree in the first period after attaining Awakening
Then at that time the Fortunate One
was sitting in one crosslegged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of freedom
Then with the passing of those seven days the Fortunate One
after arising from that concentration for the first watch of the night
applied his mind thoroughly to conditional origination in forward order
This being so that is from the arising of this that arises
that is to say with ignorance as condition there are volitional processes
with volitional processes as condition consciousness
with consciousness as condition mind and bodily form
with mind and bodily form as condition the six sense spheres
with the six sense spheres as condition contact
with contact as condition feeling
with feeling as condition craving
with craving as condition attachment
with attachment as condition continuation
with continuation as condition birth
with birth as condition old age death
grief lamentation pain sorrow and despair all arise
and so there is an origination of this whole mass of suffering
Then the Fortunate One having understood the significance of it
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance
When the nature of things becomes really manifest
To the ardent meditating brāhmaṇa
Then all his doubts disappear
Since he knows the nature of a thing and its cause
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
in Jetas Wood at Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then at that time the Fortunate One
was venerated respected revered honoured esteemed and in receipt of
robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sick
also the Community of monks was venerated respected revered honoured esteemed and in receipt of
robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sick
But wanderers from other sects
were not venerated not respected not revered not honoured not esteemed nor were they in receipt of
robes almsfood dwellings and medicinal requisites to help when sick
Then those wanderers from other sects
being unable to bear the veneration of the Fortunate One and the Community of monks
went to the female wanderer Sundarī Beautiful
and after going they said this to the female wanderer Sundarī
Sister what would you venture to do for your kinsmens welfare
What can I do Masters what am I unable to do
I have given up my life for my kinsmens welfare
Then sister you must frequently go to Jetas Wood
Yes Masters said the female wanderer Sundarī
and after replying to those wanderers from other sects
she frequently went to Jetas Wood
When those wanderers from other sects knew
The female wanderer Sundarī has been seen by many people
frequently going to Jetas Wood
then having deprived her of life
and buried her into a trenchpit right there in Jetas Wood
they went to the Kosalan King Pasenadi
and after going they said this to the Kosalan King Pasenadi
Great King we no longer see the female wanderer Sundarī
But where do you suspect she is
In Jetas Wood Great King
