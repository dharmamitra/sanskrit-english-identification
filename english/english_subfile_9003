according as it is said What is success of the meritorious
according as it is said What is success through the sciences
and they show an elephant in space in the sky  and they show a manifold military array 
according as it is said The meaning of abandoning lust succeeds through renunciation thus it is success in the sense of succeeding due to right exertion applied here or there  The meaning of abandoning all defilements succeeds through the Arahant path thus it is success in the sense of succeeding due to right exertion applied here or there 
but success as transformation and success as the mindmade body are needed in this sense as well
for this has been said by the General of the Dhamma the Elder Sāriputta What are the four planes of supernormal power
for this is said What are the four bases for success 
he develops the basis for success that possesses both concentration due to energy and the will to strive he develops the basis for success that possesses both concentration due to natural purity of consciousness and the will to strive he develops the basis for success that possesses both concentration due to inquiry and the will to strive
this is a term for concentration obtained by giving precedence to zeal consisting in the desire to act
this is a term for the energy of right endeavour accomplishing its fourfold function 
it is reached is the meaning
this is a term for zeal etc
according as it is said Bhikkhus if a bhikkhu obtains concentration obtains unification of mind supported by zeal this is called concentration due to zeal
for this is said What are the eight steps
then the zeal is not the concentration the concentration is not the zeal
then the inquiry is not the concentration the concentration is not the inquiry
but this is how it is given in the Paṭisambhidā
but the preliminarywork consciousnesses have the hundred as their object or the thousand as their object And these latter are objects as appearances not as concepts
but that must be illustrated by the story
 and he set him this stanza
The elder consented saying I accept for all but CūḷaPanthaka
CūḷaPanthaka stood weeping at the gate
He sent a man telling him Go and return quickly with the lord
He went and caught hold of the elders robe
Others then see even when at a distance
to teach the Dhamma
who told him Today I taught this much Dhamma and he gave him the method
Moggallāna those who wish to see me should come tomorrow to the city of Saṅkassa Tomorrow being the Uposatha day of the full moon I shall descend to the city of Saṅkassa for the Mahāpavāraṇā ceremony
The Ruler of Gods commanded Vissakamma Good friend the Blessed One wishes to go to the human world tomorrow Build three flights of stairs one of gold one of silver and one of crystal
He did so
and all miracles of making unevident are called a vanishing
for in that both are displayed thus Here the Perfect One performs the Twin Miracle which is not shared by disciples
according as it is said
Yes venerable sir the householder replied to the venerable Mahaka and he spread out his upper robe on the terrace and scattered a bundle of hay on it
Then bhikkhus I performed a feat of supernormal power such that Brahmā and Brahmās retinue and those attached to Brahmās retinue might hear my voice and yet not see me and having vanished in this way I spoke this stanza
enclosure is a wall surrounding a house monastery  village etc
mountain is a mountain of soil or a mountain of stone
It becomes space only
it becomes hollow for him if he wants to go down or up it becomes cleft for him if he wants to penetrate it
The bhikkhus said Venerable sir only the space kasiṇa has been given in the text so it should certainly be mentioned
He is normally an obtainer of the spacekasiṇa attainment
Having adverted he resolves with knowledge Let there be space
There is space
and because of the power of his first resolve it is impossible that another mountain or tree can have sprung up meanwhile made by temperature
the former must go above or below it
and it is sinking down that is called diving in 
He is normally an obtainer of the waterkasiṇa attainment
There is water
the oil etc only oil etc
the water only water
the opposite is called unbroken
But one who wants to go in this way should attain the earthkasiṇa jhāna and emerge Then he should do the preliminary work determining thus Let the water in such an area become earth and he should resolve in the way already described
There is earth
Seated crosslegged he travels in space like a winged bird
he is normally an obtainer of the earthkasiṇa attainment He adverts to space
Having adverted he resolves with knowledge Let there be earth
he is exposed to the multitude
With his hand  so mighty and powerful here this possessor of supernormal power who has attained mind mastery  adverts to the moon and sun Having adverted he resolves with knowledge Let it be within hands reach
And when he has done this he not only touches the moon and sun
but if he wishes he makes a footstool of them and puts his feet on it he makes a chair of them and sits on it he makes a bed of them and lies on it he makes a leaningplank of them and leans on it
And as one does so do others
For even when several hundred thousand bhikkhus do this and each one succeeds
For just as when a thousand saucers are full of water and moon disks are seen in all the saucers
still the moons motion is normal and so is its radiance
And this miracle resembles that
Even as far as the Brahmāworld having made even the Brahmāworld the limit
He wields bodily mastery herein he wields selfmastery in the Brahmā world by means of the body
The meaning of this should be understood according to the text
still the motions of the moon and sun and their radiance remain the same
Here is the text
He wields bodily mastery even as far as the Brahmā world
if this possessor of supernormal power having reached mental mastery wants to go to the Brahmāworld though far he resolves upon nearness Let it be near It is near
Though near he resolves upon farness Let it be far It is far
Though many he resolves upon few Let there be few There are few
Though few he resolves upon many Let there be many There are many
With the divine eye he sees the finematerial visible form of that Brahmā
With the divine ear element he hears the voice of that Brahmā
With the knowledge of penetration of minds he understands that Brahmās mind
If this possessor of supernormal power having reached mental mastery wants to go to the Brahmā world with a visible body he converts his mind to accord with his body he resolves his mind to accord with his body Having converted his mind to accord with his body resolved his mind to accord with his body he arrives at blissful perception and light perception and he goes to the Brahmā world with a visible body
If this possessor of supernormal power having reached mental mastery wants to go to the Brahmāworld with an invisible body he converts his body to accord with his mind he resolves his body to accord with his mind
Having converted his body to accord with his mind resolved his body to accord with his mind he arrives at blissful perception and light perception and he goes to the Brahmāworld with an invisible body
He creates a finematerial visible form before that Brahmā mindmade with all its limbs lacking no faculty
If that possessor of supernormal power walks up and down the creation walks up and down there too
If that possessor of supernormal power stands  sits  lies down the creation lies down there too
If that possessor of supernormal power produces smoke  produces flames  preaches Dhamma  asks a question  being asked a question answers the creation being asked a question answers there too
If that possessor of supernormal power stands with that Brahmā converses enters into communication with that Brahmā the creation stands with that Brahmā there too converses enters into communication with that Brahmā there too
Whatever that possessor of supernormal power does the creation does the same thing 
Herein though far he resolves upon nearness having emerged from the basic jhāna he adverts to a faroff world of the gods or to the Brahmāworld thus Let it be near
Having adverted and done the preliminary work he attains again and then resolves with knowledge Let it be near It becomes near
The same method of explanation applies to the other clauses too
Herein who has taken what was far and made it near
The Blessed One
For when the Blessed One was going to the divine world after the Twin Miracle he made Yugandhara and Sineru near and from the earths surface he set one foot on Yugandhara and then he set the other on the summit of Sineru
Who else has done it
The Elder Mahā Moggallāna
For when the elder was leaving Sāvatthī after completing his meal he abridged the twelveleague crowd and the thirtyleague road to the city of Saṅkassa and he arrived at the same moment
Furthermore the Elder Cūḷa Samudda did it as well in Tambapaṇṇi Island
During a time of scarcity it seems seven hundred bhikkhus came to the elder one morning
The elder thought Where can a large community of bhikkhus wander for alms He saw nowhere at all in Tambapaṇṇi Island but he saw that it would be possible on the other shore at Pāṭaliputta  He got the bhikkhus to take their bowls and outer robes and he said Come friends let us go wandering for alms Then he abridged the earth and went to Pāṭaliputta
The bhikkhus asked What is the city venerable sir
It is Pāṭaliputta friends
 Pāṭaliputta is far away venerable sir
Friends experienced elders make what is far near
Where is the ocean  venerable sir
Friends did you not cross a blue stream on the way as you came
Yes venerable sir
Friends experienced elders also make what is vast small
but the ocean is vast
And the Elder Tissadatta did likewise when he had put on his upper robes after bathing in the evening and the thought of paying homage at the Great Enlightenment Tree arose in him
Who has taken what was near and made it far
The Blessed One
For although Aṅgulimāla was near to the Blessed One yet he made him far 
Who has made much little
The Elder Mahā Kassapa
One feast day at Rājagaha it seems there were five hundred girls on their way to enjoy the festival and they had taken moon cakes with them They saw the Blessed One but gave him nothing
On their way back however they saw the elder Thinking He is our elder they each took a cake and approached the elder
The elder took out his bowl and made a single bowlful of them all
The Blessed One had sat down first to await the elder
The elder brought them and gave them to the Blessed One
In the story of the rich man Illīsa however the Elder Mahā Moggallāna made little much And in the story of Kākavaḷiya the Blessed One did so
The Elder Mahā Kassapa it seems after spending seven days in attainment stood at the house door of a man in poor circumstances called Kākavaḷiya in order to show favour to the poor
His wife saw the elder and she poured into his bowl the unsalted sour gruel that she had cooked for her husband
The elder took it and placed it in the Blessed Ones hand
The Blessed One resolved to make it enough for the Greater Community of Bhikkhus
What was brought in a single bowl became enough for all
And on the seventh day Kākavaḷiya became a rich man
And not only in the case of making little much but whatever the possessor of supernormal power wishes whether to make the sweet unsweet etc it is successful for him
For so it was that when the Elder Mahā Anula saw many bhikkhus sitting on the banks of the Gaṅgā River in Sri Lanka eating plain rice which was all that they had got after doing their alms round he resolved Let the Gaṅgā River water be cream of ghee and he gave a sign to the novices
They fetched it in their vessels and gave it to the Community of Bhikkhus
All of them ate their meal with sweet cream of ghee
With the divine eye remaining here and extending light he sees the visible form of that Brahmā
And remaining here he also hears the sound of his speech
He converts his mind according to his body he converts the mind to accord with the material body
and he understands his mind
taking the consciousness of the basic jhāna he mounts it upon the body
he makes its going slow to coincide with that of the body
for the bodys mode of going is slow
He arrives at blissful perception and light perception he arrives at enters makes contact with reaches the perception of bliss and perception of lightness that are conascent with the consciousness whose object is the basic jhāna
And it is perception associated with equanimity that is called perception of bliss
for equanimity is called bliss since it is peaceful
And that same perception should be understood to be called perception of lightness too because it is liberated from hindrances and from the things that oppose it beginning with applied thought
But when he arrives at that state his physical body too becomes as light as a tuft of cotton
He goes to the Brahmāworld thus with a visible body as light as a tuft of cotton wafted by the wind
As he goes thus if he wishes he creates a path in space by means of the earth kasiṇa and goes on foot
If he wishes he resolves by means of the air kasiṇa that there shall be air and he goes by air like a tuft of cotton
Moreover the desire to go is the measure here
When there is the desire to go one who has made his mental resolve in this way goes visibly carried by the force of the resolution like an arrow shot by an archer
He converts his body to accord with his mind he takes the body and mounts it on the mind
He makes its going swift to coincide with that of the mind
for the minds mode of going is swift
He arrives at blissful perception and light perception he arrives at perception of bliss and perception of lightness that are conascent with the supernormal power consciousness whose object is the material body
The rest should be understood in the way already described
But here there is only the going of consciousness
When it was asked As he goes with an invisible body thus does he go at the moment of the resolutionconsciousnesss arising or at the moment of its presence or at the moment of its dissolution an elder replied He goes in all three moments
But does he go himself or does he send a creation
He does as he pleases
But here it is only the going himself that has been given in the text
Mindmade mindmade because created by the mind in resolution
Lacking no faculty this refers to the shape of the eye ear etc
If the possessor of supernormal power walks up and down the creation walks up and down there too etc all refers to what a disciple creates
but there is no sensitivity in a created visible form
but what the Blessed One creates does whatever the Blessed One does
and it also does other things according to the Blessed Ones pleasure
When this possessor of supernormal power while remaining here sees a visible object with the divine eye hears a sound with the divine ear element knows consciousness with the penetration of minds he does not wield bodily power in doing that
And when while remaining here he stands with that Brahmā converses enters into communication with that Brahmā he does not wield bodily power in doing that
And when he makes his resolve described in the way beginning though far he resolves upon nearness he does not wield bodily power in doing that
And when he goes to the Brahmāworld with a visible or an invisible body he does not wield bodily power in doing that
But when he enters upon the process described in the way beginning He creates a visible form before that Brahmā mindmade then he wields bodily power in doing that
The rest however is said here for the purpose of showing the stage prior to the wielding of the bodily power This firstly is success by resolve 
The difference between success as transformation and success as the mindmade body is as follows 
 One firstly who performs a transformation should resolve upon whatever he chooses from among the things beginning with the appearance of a boy described as follows He abandons his normal appearance and shows the appearance of a boy or the appearance of a nāga  or the appearance of a supaṇṇa  or the appearance of an asura  or the appearance of the Ruler of Gods  or the appearance of some other sensualsphere deity or the appearance of a Brahmā or the appearance of the sea or the appearance of a rock or the appearance of a lion or the appearance of a tiger or the appearance of a leopard or he shows an elephant or he shows a horse or he shows a chariot or he shows a foot soldier or he shows a manifold military array 
And when he resolves he should emerge from the fourth jhāna that is the basis for directknowledge and has one of the things beginning with the earth kasiṇa as its object and he should advert to his own appearance as a boy
After adverting and finishing the preliminary work he should attain again and emerge and he should resolve thus Let me be a boy of such and such a type
Simultaneously with the resolve consciousness he becomes the boy just as Devadatta did 
This is the method in all instances
But he shows an elephant etc is said here with respect to showing an elephant etc externally
Herein instead of resolving Let me be an elephant he resolves Let there be an elephant The same method applies in the case of the horse and the rest
This is success as transformation
 One who wants to make the mindmade body should emerge from the basic jhāna and first advert to the body in the way already described and then he should resolve Let it be hollow It becomes hollow
Then he adverts to another body inside it and having done the preliminary work in the way already described he resolves Let there be another body inside it
Then he draws it out like a reed from its sheath like a sword from its scabbard like a snake from its slough
Hence it is said Here a bhikkhu creates from this body another body possessing visible form mindmade with all its limbs lacking no faculty
Just as though a man pulled out a reed from its sheath and thought thus This is the sheath this is the reed the sheath is one the reed is another it was from the sheath that the reed was pulled out  and so on
And here just as the reed etc are similar to the sheath etc so too the mindmade visible form is similar to the possessor of supernormal power and this simile is given in order to show that
This is success as the mindmade body
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
called The Description of the Supernormal Powers
The twelfth chapter
It is now the turn for the description of the divine ear element
Herein and also in the case of the remaining three kinds of directknowledge the meaning of the passage beginning When his concentrated mind  should be understood in the way already stated 
and in each case we shall only comment on what is different The text is as follows He directs he inclines his mind to the divine ear element With the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human he hears both kinds of sounds the divine and the human those that are far as well as near
Herein with the divine ear element it is divine here because of its similarity to the divine
And this ear element consisting in knowledge which is produced by the power of this bhikkhus energy in development is similar to that so it is divine because it is similar to the divine
Furthermore it is divine because it is obtained by means of divine abiding and because it has divine abiding as its support
And it is an ear element in the sense of hearing and in the sense of being a soulless element
Also it is an ear element because it is like the ear element in its performance of an ear elements function
With that divine ear element  he hears 
Which is purified which is quite pure through having no imperfection
And surpasses the human which in the hearing of sounds surpasses stands beyond the human ear element by surpassing the human environment
He hears both kinds of sounds he hears the two kinds of sounds
What two
The divine and the human the sounds of deities and of human beings is what is meant
This should be understood as partially inclusive
Those that are far as well as near what is meant is that he hears sounds that are far off even in another worldsphere and those that are near even the sounds of the creatures living in his own body
This should be understood as completely inclusive
But how is this divine ear element aroused
The bhikkhu should attain jhāna as basis for directknowledge and emerge Then with the consciousness belonging to the preliminarywork concentration he should advert first to the gross sounds in the distance normally within range of hearing
the sound in the forest of lions etc or in the monastery the sound of a gong the sound of a drum the sound of a conch the sound of recitation by novices and young bhikkhus reciting with full vigour the sound of their ordinary talk such as What venerable sir  What friend  etc the sound of birds the sound of wind the sound of footsteps the fizzing sound of boiling water the sound of palm leaves drying in the sun the sound of ants and so on Beginning in this way with quite gross sounds he should successively advert to more and more subtle sounds
in the western direction in the northern direction in the southern direction in the upper direction in the lower direction in the eastern intermediate direction in the western intermediate direction in the northern intermediate direction and in the southern intermediate direction
He should give attention to the sound sign of gross and of subtle sounds
These sounds are evident even to his normal consciousness
As he gives his attention to the sound sign in this way thinking Now the divine ear element will arise minddoor adverting arises making one of these sounds its object
When that has ceased then either four or five impulsions impel the first three or four of which are of the sense sphere and are called preliminary work access conformity and changeoflineage while the fourth or the fifth is finematerialsphere absorption consciousness belonging to the fourth jhāna
Herein it is knowledge arisen together with the absorption consciousness that is called the divine ear element
After that absorption has been reached the divine ear element becomes merged in that ear of knowledge
then two fingerbreadths four finger breadths eight fingerbreadths a span a ratana  the interior of the room the veranda the building the surrounding walk the park belonging to the community the almsresort village the district and so on up to the limit of the worldsphere or even more This is how he should extend it by delimited stages
One who has reached directknowledge in this way hears also by means of directknowledge without reentering the basic jhāna any sound that has come within the space touched by the basic jhānas object
And in hearing in this way even if there is an uproar with sounds of conches drums cymbals etc right up to the Brahmāworld he can if he wants to still define each one thus This is the sound of conches this is the sound of drums
The explanation of the divine ear element is ended
for deities have as the divine ear element the sensitivity that is produced by kamma consisting in good conduct and is unimpeded by bile phlegm blood etc and capable of receiving an object even though far off because it is liberated from imperfections
He should give attention to the sound sign of the sounds in the eastern direction
but they are especially evident to his preliminaryworkconcentration consciousness
When consolidating it he should extend it by delimiting a single fingerbreadth thus I will hear sounds within this area
As to the explanation of knowledge of penetration of minds the text is as follows He directs he inclines his mind to the knowledge of penetration of minds He penetrates with his mind the minds of other beings of other persons and understands them thus he understands the manner of consciousness affected by greed as affected by greed and understands the manner of consciousness unaffected by greed as unaffected by greed he understands consciousness affected by hate as affected by hate and consciousness unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate he understands consciousness affected by delusion as affected by delusion and consciousness unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion he understands cramped consciousness as cramped and distracted consciousness as distracted he understands exalted consciousness as exalted and unexalted consciousness as unexalted he understands surpassed consciousness as surpassed and unsurpassed consciousness as unsurpassed he understands concentrated consciousness as concentrated and unconcentrated consciousness as unconcentrated he understands the liberated manner of consciousness as liberated and the unliberated manner of consciousness as unliberated  Here it goes all round  thus it is penetration  the meaning is that it delimits 
The penetration of the heart is penetration of minds 
It is penetration of hearts and that is knowledge thus it is knowledge of penetration of minds 
He directs his consciousness to that is what is meant
Of other beings of the rest of beings himself excluded
Of other persons this has the same meaning as the last
With his mind the minds with his manner of consciousness the manner of consciousness of other beings
Having penetrated  having delimited all round He understands he understands them to be of various sorts beginning with that affected by greed
But how is this knowledge to be aroused
That is successfully done through the divine eye which constitutes its preliminary work
Therefore the bhikkhu should extend light and he should seek out anothers manner of consciousness by keeping under observation with the divine eye the colour of the blood present with the matter of the physical heart as its support
So he should seek out anothers manner of consciousness by keeping under observation the colour of the blood in the physical heart thus This matter is originated by the joy faculty this is originated by the grief faculty this is originated by the equanimity faculty and so consolidate his knowledge of penetration of hearts
It is when it has been consolidated in this way that he can gradually get to understand not only all manner of sensesphere consciousness but those of finematerial and immaterial consciousness as well by tracing one manner of consciousness from another without any more seeing the physical hearts matter
For this is said in the Commentary When he wants to know anothers manner of consciousness in the immaterial modes whose physicalheart matter can he observe Whose material alteration originated by the faculties can he look at
No ones
The province of a possessor of supernormal power is simply this namely wherever the manner of consciousness he adverts to is there he knows it according to these sixteen classes
As regards the manner of consciousness affected by greed etc the eight manners of consciousness accompanied by greed should be understood as the manner of consciousness affected by greed
The remaining profitable and indeterminate manners of consciousness in the four planes are unaffected by greed
The four namely the two consciousnesses accompanied by grief  and the two consciousnesses accompanied respectively by uncertainty and agitation are not included in this dyad
It is the two consciousnesses accompanied by grief that are called consciousness affected by hate
And all profitable and indeterminate consciousnesses in the four planes are unaffected by hate
The remaining ten kinds of unprofitable consciousnesses are not included in this dyad
Affected by delusion  unaffected by delusion here only the two namely that accompanied by uncertainty and that accompanied by agitation are affected by delusion alone without being accompanied by the other two unprofitable roots But all the twelve kinds of unprofitable consciousnesses can also be understood as the manner of consciousness affected by delusion since delusion is present in all kinds of unprofitable consciousnesses
The rest are unaffected by delusion
Cramped is that attended by stiffness and torpor
Distracted is that attended by agitation
Exalted is that of the finematerial and immaterial spheres
Unexalted is the rest
Surpassed is all that in the three mundane planes
Unsurpassed is the supramundane
Concentrated is that attained to access and that attained to absorption
Unconcentrated is that not attained to either
Liberated is that attained to any of the five kinds of deliverance that is to say deliverance by substitution of opposites through insight by suppression through concentration by cutting off by means of the path by tranquillization by means of fruition and by renunciation as Nibbāna 
Unliberated is that which has not attained to any of the five kinds of liberation
So the bhikkhu who has acquired the knowledge of penetration of hearts understands all these manners of consciousness namely the manner of consciousness affected by greed as affected by greed  the unliberated manner of consciousness as unliberated
the wording being varied to suit those susceptible of teaching in another way and for the sake of elegance of exposition
For when a manner of consciousness accompanied by joy is present the blood is red like a banyanfig fruit
when a manner of consciousness accompanied by grief is present it is blackish like a roseapple fruit
when a manner of consciousness accompanied by serenity is present it is clear like sesame oil
But this explanation by means of the physical heart is for one who has not yet done any interpreting
though some elders include them too
though some elders include them too
As to the explanation of knowledge of recollection of past lives the text is as follows He directs he inclines his mind to the knowledge of recollection of past lives He recollects his manifold past lives that is to say one birth two births three births four births five births ten births twenty births thirty births forty births fifty births a hundred births a thousand births a hundred thousand births many eons of world contraction many eons of world expansion many eons of world contraction and expansion There I was so named of such a race with such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life span and passing away from there I reappeared elsewhere and there too I was so named of such a race with such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life span and passing away from there I reappeared here Thus with its aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives  Herein to the knowledge of recollection of past lives means for knowledge concerning recollection of past lives
Past lives is aggregates lived in the past in former births
Lived in that case means lived out undergone arisen and ceased in ones own subjective continuity
Or alternatively past lives is mental objects lived in the past in ones former births
Recollection of past lives the mindfulness by means of which he recollects the past lives is the recollection of past lives
Knowledge is the knowledge associated with that mindfulness
To the knowledge of recollection of past lives for the purpose of the knowledge of the recollection of past lives in this way for the attaining for the reaching of that knowledge is what is meant
Manifold of many kinds or that has occurred in many ways Given in detail is the meaning
Past lives is the continuity lived here and there taking the immediately previous existence as the beginning and working backwards
He recollects he recalls it following it out by the succession of aggregates or by death and rebirthlinking
There are six kinds of people who recollect these past lives They are other sectarians ordinary disciples great disciples chief disciples Paccekabuddhas and Buddhas
Herein other sectarians recollect only as far back as forty eons but not beyond that
Why
Ordinary disciples recollect as far back as a hundred eons and as far back as a thousand eons because their understanding is strong
The eighty great disciples recollect as far back as a hundred thousand eons
The two chief disciples recollect as far back as an incalculable age and a hundred thousand eons
Paccekabuddhas recollect as far back as two incalculable ages and a hundred thousand eons
For such is the extent to which they can convey their minds back respectively
But there is no limit in the case of Buddhas
Again other sectarians only recollect the succession of aggregates they are unable to recollect according only to death and rebirthlinking letting go of the succession of aggregates
They are like the blind in that they are unable to descend upon any place they choose
Ordinary disciples both recollect by means of the succession of aggregates and trace by means of death and rebirthlinking
Likewise the eighty great disciples
But the chief disciples have nothing to do with the succession of aggregates
When they see the death of one person they see the rebirthlinking and again when they see the death of another they see the rebirthlinking So they go by tracing through death and rebirththinking
Likewise Paccekabuddhas
Buddhas however have nothing to do either with succession of aggregates or with tracing through death and rebirthlinking
So they go and so they descend with the lions descent wherever they want even skipping over many millions of eons as though they were an elision in a text
And just as an arrow shot by such a master of archery expert in hairsplitting as Sarabhaṅga always hits the target without getting held up among trees creepers etc on its way and so neither gets held up nor misses so too since Buddhas go in this way their knowledge does not get held up in intermediate births or miss without getting held up or missing it seizes any instance required
Among these beings with recollection of past lives the sectarians vision of past lives seems like the light of a glowworm
Other sectarians see past lives as blind men go tapping with the point of a stick
Ordinary disciples do so as men who go on a log bridge
The great disciples do so as men who go on a foot bridge
The chief disciples do so as men who go on a cart bridge
Paccekabuddhas do so as men who go on a main foot path
And Buddhas do so as men who go on a high road for carts
In this connection it is the disciples recollection of past lives that is intended
Hence it was said above He recollects he recollects it following it out by the succession of aggregates or by death and rebirthlinking 
So a bhikkhu who is a beginner and wants to recollect in this way should go into solitary retreat on return from his alms round after his meal Then he should attain the four jhānas in succession and emerge from the fourth jhāna as basis for directknowledge He should then advert to his most recent act of sitting down for this purpose next
to the preparation of the seat to the entry into the lodging to the putting away of the bowl and outer robe to the time of eating to the time of returning from the village to the time of wandering for alms in the village to the time of entering the village to the time of setting out from the monastery to the time of paying homage at the shrine terrace and the Enlightenmenttree terrace to the time of washing the bowl to the time of picking up the bowl to the things done from the time of picking up the bowl back to the mouth washing to the things done in the early morning to the things done in the middle watch in the first watch In this way he should advert to all the things done during the whole night and day in reverse order
it is especially evident to his preliminarywork consciousness
But if anything there is not evident he should again attain the basic jhāna emerge and advert
By so doing it becomes as evident as when a lamp is lit
And so in reverse order too he should advert to the things done on the second day back and on the third fourth and fifth day and in the ten days and in the fortnight and as far back as a year
When by these means he adverts to ten years twenty years and so on as far back as his own rebirthlinking in this existence he should advert to the mentalitymateriality occurring at the moment of death in the preceding existence
But the mentalitymateriality in the previous existence has ceased without remainder and another has arisen and consequently that instance is as it were shut away in darkness and it is hard for one of little understanding to see it
Still he should not give up the task thinking I am unable to remove the rebirth linking and make the mentalitymateriality that occurred at the death moment my object
Just as when a strong man is felling a big tree for the purpose of making the peak of a gable but is unable to fell the big tree with an axe blade blunted by lopping the branches and foliage still he does not give up the task on the contrary he goes to a smithy and has his axe sharpened after which he returns and continues chopping the tree and when the axe again gets blunt he does as before and continues chopping it
And this meaning should also be illustrated by means of the wood cutter and the haircutter as well
Herein the knowledge that occurs making its object the period from the last sitting down for this purpose back to the rebirthlinking is not called knowledge of recollection of past lives
However when this bhikkhu has got back beyond the rebirthlinking there arises in him minddoor adverting making its object the mentalitymateriality that occurred at the death moment And when that has ceased then either four or five impulsions impel making that their object too
The first of these called preliminarywork etc in the way already described  are of the sense sphere
The last is a finematerial absorption consciousness of the fourth jhāna
The knowledge that arises in him then together with that consciousness is what is called knowledge of recollection of past lives
Herein one birth is the continuity of aggregates included in a single becoming starting with rebirthlinking and ending with death
So too with two births and the rest
But in the case of many eons of world contraction etc it should be understood that the aeon of world contraction is an aeon of diminution and the aeon of world expansion is an aeon of increase
Herein what supersedes the contraction is included in the contraction since it is rooted in it
and so too what supersedes the expansion is included in the expansion This being so it includes what is stated thus Bhikkhus there are four incalculables of the aeon
What four
The contraction what supersedes the contraction the expansion and what supersedes the expansion 
Herein there are three kinds of contraction contraction due to water contraction due to fire and contraction due to air 
Also there are three limits to the contraction the bhassara Brahmā world that of the Subhakiṇha  and that of the Vehapphala 
When the aeon contracts owing to fire all below the bhassara Brahmāworld is burnt up by fire
When it contracts owing to water it is all dissolved by water up to the Subhakiṇha Brahmāworld
When it contracts owing to air it is all demolished by wind up to the Vehapphala Brahmāworld
In breadth it is always one of the Buddhafields that is destroyed
For the Buddhafields are of three kinds that is the field of birth the field of authority and the field of scope
Herein the field of birth is limited by the ten thousand worldspheres
The field of authority is limited by the hundred thousand million worldspheres where the following safeguards are efficacious that is the Ratana Sutta  the Khandha Paritta  the Dhajagga Paritta  the ṭānāṭiya Paritta  and the Mora Paritta 
The field of scope is boundless immeasurable
As far as he wishes  it is said The Perfect One knows anything anywhere that he wishes
So one of these three Buddha fields that is to say the field of authority is destroyed
But when that is being destroyed the field of birth also gets destroyed
And that happens simultaneously and when it is reconstituted that happens simultaneously 
Now it should be understood how its destruction and reconstitution come about thus
On the occasion when the aeon is destroyed by fire first of all a great cloud heralding the aeons destruction appears and there is a great downpour all over the hundred thousand million worldspheres
People are delighted and they bring out all their seeds and sow them
But when the sprouts have grown enough for an ox to graze then not a drop of rain falls any more even when the asses bray Rain is withheld from then on
This is what the Blessed One referred to when he said Bhikkhus an occasion comes when for many years for many hundreds of years for many thousands of years for many hundreds of thousands of years there is no rain 
Beings that live by rain die and are reborn in the Brahmāworld and so are the deities that live on flowers and fruits
When a long period has passed in this way the water gives out here and there Then in due course the fishes and turtles die and are reborn in the Brahmā world and so are the beings in hell
Some say that the denizens of hell perish there with the appearance of the seventh sun 
Now there is no rebirth in the Brahmāworld without jhāna and some of them being obsessed with the scarcity of food are unable to attain jhāna so how are they reborn there
By means of jhāna obtained in the sensesphere divine world
For then the sensesphere deities called worldmarshal deities come to know that at the end of a hundred thousand years there will be the emergence of an aeon and they travel up and down the haunts of men their heads bared their hair dishevelled with piteous faces mopping their tears with their hands clothed in dyed cloth and wearing their dress in great disorder They make this announcement Good sirs good sirs at the end of a hundred thousand years from now there will be the emergence of an aeon This world will be destroyed Even the ocean will dry up This great earth and the Sineru King of Mountains will be consumed and destroyed
The destruction of the earth will extend as far as the Brahmāworld
Develop lovingkindness good sirs develop compassion gladness equanimity good sirs Care for your mothers care for your fathers honour the elders of your clans
When human beings and earth deities hear their words they mostly are filled with a sense of urgency They become kind to each other and make merit with lovingkindness etc and so they are reborn in the divine world
There they eat divine food and they do the preliminary work on the air kasiṇa and acquire jhāna
Others however are reborn in a sensesphere divine world through kamma to be experienced in a future life
For there is no being traversing the round of rebirths who is destitute of kamma to be experienced in a future life
They too acquire jhāna there in the same way
All are eventually reborn in the Brahmāworld by acquiring jhāna in a sensesphere divine world in this way
However at the end of a long period after the withholding of the rain a second sun appears
And this is described by the Blessed One in the way beginning Bhikkhus there is the occasion when   and the Sattasuriya Sutta should be given in full
Now when that has appeared there is no more telling night from day
The world is uninterruptedly scorched by the suns
But there is no sun deity in the aeon destruction sun as there is in the ordinary sun
But when the aeondestruction sun is present the sky is as blank as the disk of a looking glass and destitute of clouds and vapour
Beginning with the rivulet the water in all the rivers except the five great rivers dries up
After that at the end of a long period a third sun appears
And when that has appeared the great rivers dry up too
After that at the end of a long period a fourth sun appears
And when that has appeared the seven great lakes in Himalaya the sources of the great rivers dry up that is to say Sīhapapāta Haṃsapātana Kaṇṇamuṇḍaka Rathakāra Anotatta Chaddanta and Kuṇāla
After that at the end of a long period a fifth sun appears
After that at the end of a long period a sixth sun appears
And the hundred thousand million worldspheres are the same as this one
After that at the end of a long period a seventh sun appears
And when that has appeared the whole worldsphere together with the hundred thousand million other worldspheres catches fire
Even the summits of Sineru a hundred leagues and more high crumble and vanish into space
The conflagration mounts up and invades the realm of the Four Kings
When it has burnt up all the golden palaces the jewelled palaces and the crystal palaces there it invades the Realm of the Thirtythree
And so it goes right on up to the plane of the first jhāna
When it has burnt three lower Brahmāworlds it stops there at the bhassara world
As long as any formed thing the size of an atom still exists it does not go out
but it goes out when all formed things have been consumed And like the flame that burns ghee and oil it leaves no ash
The upper space is now all one with the lower space in a vast gloomy darkness
Then at the end of a long period a great cloud arises and at first it rains gently
and then it rains with ever heavier deluges like lotus stems like rods like pestles like palm trunks more and more And so it pours down upon all burnt areas in the hundred thousand million worldspheres till they disappear
Then the winds beneath and all around that water rise up and compact it and round it like water drops on a lotus leaf
How do they compact the great mass of water
By making gaps
Being thus compressed by the air compacted and reduced it gradually subsides
As it sinks the lower Brahmāworld reappears in its place and worlds divine reappear in the places of the four upper divine worlds of the sensual sphere
As the fresh water gets used up the essential humus makes its appearance on it
That possesses colour smell and taste like the surface film on milk rice when it dries up
Then the beings that were reborn first in the Brahmāworld of Streaming radiance fall from there with the exhaustion of their life span or when their merit is exhausted and they reappear here
They are selfluminous and wander in the sky
On eating the essential humus as is told in the Aggañña Sutta  they are overcome by craving and they busy themselves in making lumps of it to eat
Then their selfluminosity vanishes and it is dark
They are frightened when they see the darkness
Then in order to remove their fears and give them courage the suns disk appears full fifty leagues across They are delighted to see it thinking We have light and they say It has appeared in order to allay our fears and give us courage  so let it be called sun  So they give it the name sun 
Now when the sun has given light for a day it sets Then they are frightened again thinking We have lost the light we had
and they think How good if we had another light 
As if knowing their thought the moons disk appears fortynine leagues across
On seeing it they are still more delighted and they say It has appeared seeming as if it knew our desire  so let it be called moon  So they give it the name moon 
After the appearance of the moon and sun in this way the stars appear in their constellations
After that night and day are made known and in due course the month and half month the season and the year
On the day the moon and sun appear the mountains of Sineru of the Worldsphere and of Himalaya appear too
And they appear on the fullmoon day of the month of Phagguna  neither before nor after
How
Just as when millet is cooking and bubbles arise
Then as these beings make use of the essential humus gradually some become handsome and some ugly
The handsome ones despise the ugly ones
Owing to their contempt the essential humus vanishes
Then vessels appear
These beings put the rice into the vessels which they put on the tops of stones A flame appears spontaneously and cooks it
The cooked rice resembles jasmine flowers It has no need of sauces and curries
As soon as they eat this gross food urine and excrement appear in them
Then wound orifices break open in them to let these things out The male sex appears in the male and the female sex in the female
Then the females brood over the males and the males over the females for a long time
Owing to this long period of brooding the fever of sense desires arises
After that they practice sexual intercourse
For their overt practice of evil they are censured and punished by the wise and so they build houses for the purpose of concealing the evil
When they live in houses they eventually fall in with the views of the more lazy and they make stores of food
As soon as they do that the rice becomes enclosed in red powder and husks and no longer grows again of itself in the place where it was reaped
They meet together and bemoan the fact Evil has surely made its appearance among beings for formerly we were mindmade   and all this should be given in full in the way described in the Aggañña Sutta
After that they set up boundaries
Then some being takes a portion given to another
After he has been twice rebuked at the third time they come to blows with fists clods sticks and so on
When stealing censuring lying resorting to sticks etc have appeared in this way they meet together thinking Suppose we elect a being who would reprove those who should be reproved censure those who should be censured and banish those who should be banished and suppose we keep him supplied with a portion of the rice  
When beings had come to an agreement in this way in this aeon firstly this Blessed One himself who was then the Bodhisatta  was the handsomest the most comely the most honourable and was clever and capable of exercising the effort of restraint
They approached him asked him and elected him
Since he was recognized by the majority he was called Mahā Sammata Since he was lord of the fields he was called khattiya  Since he promoted others good righteously and equitably he was a king  This is how he came to be known by these names
For the Bodhisatta himself is the first man concerned in any wonderful innovation in the world So after the khattiya circle had been established by making the Bodhisatta the first in this way the brahmans and the other castes were founded in due succession
Herein the period from the time of the great cloud heralding the aeons destruction up till the ceasing of the flames constitutes one incalculable and that is called the contraction
This firstly is how the destruction by fire and reconstitution should be understood
The occasion when the aeon is destroyed by water should be treated in the way already described beginning First of all a great cloud heralding the aeons destruction appears  
There is this difference however While in the former case a second sun appeared in this case a great cloud of caustic waters appears
At first it rains very gently but it goes on to rain with gradually greater deluges pouring down upon the hundred thousand million worldspheres
As soon as they are touched by the caustic waters the earth the mountains etc melt away and the waters are supported all round by winds
The waters take possession from the earth up to the plane of the second jhāna
When they have dissolved away the three Brahmā worlds there they stop at the Subhakiṇhaworld
As long as any formed thing the size of an atom exists they do not subside
All beginning with The upper space is all one with the lower space in a vast gloomy darkness  is as already described
And beings falling from the Subhakiṇha Brahmāworld are reborn in the places beginning with the bhassara Brahmāworld
Herein the period from the time of the great cloud heralding the aeons destruction up till the ceasing of the aeondestroying waters constitutes one incalculable
That from the ceasing of the waters up till the great cloud of rehabilitation constitutes the second incalculable
That from the great cloud of rehabilitation  These four incalculables make up one great aeon
This is how the destruction by water and reconstitution should be understood
The occasion when the aeon is destroyed by air should be treated in the way already described beginning with the first of all a great cloud heralding the aeons destruction appears  
There is this difference however While in the first case there was a second sun here a wind arises in order to destroy the aeon
First of all it lifts up the coarse flue
They are swept from the earth up into the sky and instead of falling down again
Then eventually wind arises from underneath the great earth and overturns the earth flinging it into space
The earth splits into fragments measuring a hundred leagues measuring two three four five hundred leagues and they are hurled into space too and there they are broken to bits and cease to exist
The worldsphere mountains and Mount Sineru are wrenched up and cast into space
In this way it destroys the divine palaces built on the earth of Mount Sineru and those built in space it destroys the six sensualsphere divine worlds and it destroys the hundred thousand million worldspheres
Then worldsphere collides with worldsphere Himalaya Mountain with Himalaya Mountain Sineru with Sineru till they are broken to bits and disappear
The wind takes possession from the earth up to the plane of the third jhāna
There after destroying three Brahmāworlds it stops at the Vehapphala world
When it has destroyed all formed things in this way it spends itself too
Then all happens as already described in the way beginning The upper space is all one with the lower space in a vast gloomy darkness  
But here the world begins its reappearance with the Subhakiṇha Brahmāworld
And beings falling from the Vehapphala Brahmāworld are reborn in the places beginning with the Subhakiṇha Brahmāworld
Herein the period from the time of the great cloud heralding the aeons destruction up till the ceasing of the aeondestroying wind is one incalculable
That from the ceasing of the wind up till the great cloud of rehabilitation is the second incalculable  These four incalculables make up one great aeon
This is how the destruction by wind and reconstitution should be understood
What is the reason for the worlds destruction in this way
The three roots of the unprofitable are the reason
When any one of the roots of the unprofitable becomes conspicuous the world is destroyed accordingly
When greed is more conspicuous it is destroyed by fire
When hate is more conspicuous it is destroyed by water
Destroyed as it is in this way it is destroyed for seven turns in succession by fire
Sixtythree eons pass in this way
And now the air takes the opportunity to usurp the waters turn for destruction and in destroying the world it demolishes the Subhakiṇha Brahmāworld where the life span is the full sixtyfour eons
Now when a bhikkhu capable of recollecting eons is recollecting his former lives then of such eons as these he recollects many eons of world contraction many eons of world expansion many eons of world contraction and expansion
How
In the way beginning There I was 
Herein There I was in that eon of contraction I was in that kind of becoming or generation or destiny or station of consciousness or abode of beings or order of beings
So named such forenames as Tissa say or Phussa
Of such a race such family names as Kaccāna say or Kassapa
This is said of the recollection of his own name and race in his past existence
But if he wants to recollect his own appearance at that time or whether his life was a rough or refined one or whether pleasure or pain was prevalent or whether his life span was short or long he recollects that too
Hence he said with such an appearance  such the end of my life span
Here with such an appearance means fair or dark
Such was my food with white rice and meat dishes as food or with windfall fruits as food
Such my experience of pleasure and pain with varied experience of bodily and mental pleasure and pain classed as worldly and unworldly and so on
Such the end of my life span with such a life span of a century or life span of eightyfour thousand eons
And passing away from there I reappeared elsewhere having passed away from that becoming generation destiny station of consciousness abode of beings or order of beings I again appeared in that other becoming generation destiny station of consciousness abode of beings or order of beings
And there too I was then again I was there in that becoming generation destiny station of consciousness abode of beings or order of beings
So named etc are as already stated
Furthermore the words there I was refer to the recollection of one who has cast back retrospectively as far as he wishes
But the words there too I was etc are said in order to show the recollection of his name race etc there in the place of his reappearance next before this appearance
And passing away from there I reappeared here having passed away from that next place of reappearance I was reborn here in this khattiya clan or brahman clan
Thus so
With its aspects and particulars with its particulars consisting in name and race with its aspects consisting in appearance and so on
For it is by means of name and race that a being is particularized as say Tissa Kassapa
So the name and race are the particulars while the others are the aspects
He recollects his manifold past lives the meaning of this is clear
The explanation of the knowledge of recollection of past lives is ended
and lived in that case means lived by living in ones objective resort which has been cognized and delimited by ones own consciousness or cognized by anothers consciousness too In the case of recollection of those past Enlightened Ones who have broken the cycle and so on these last are only accessible to Enlightened Ones
Because their understanding is weak for lack of delimitation of mind and matter 
they go as the blind do without letting go of their sticks So they recollect without letting go of the succession of aggregates
for whatever instance they choose in many millions of eons or more or less is evident to them
that of ordinary disciples like the light of a candle
that of the great disciples like the light of a torch
that of the chief disciples like the light of the morning star
that of Paccekabuddhas like the light of the moon
and that of Buddhas like the glorious autumn suns disk with its thousand rays
While this much however is evident even to his normal consciousness
for a wise bhikkhu is able at the first attempt to remove the rebirthlinking and make the mentalitymateriality at the death moment his object
On the contrary he should again and again attain that same basic jhāna
and each time he emerges he should advert to that instance
and as he goes on chopping it in this way the tree falls at length because each time there is no need to chop again what has already been chopped and what has not yet been chopped gets chopped so too when he emerges from the basic jhāna instead of adverting to what he has already adverted to he should advert only to the rebirthlinking and at length he removes the rebirthlinking and makes the mentalitymateriality that occurred at the death moment his object
but it is called preliminarywork concentration knowledge
and some call it knowledge of the past 
but that is inappropriate to the finematerial sphere
It is with the mindfulness associated with that knowledge that he recollects his manifold past lives
that is to say one birth two births  thus with details and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives 
that quaked on the Perfect Ones taking rebirthlinking and so on
as one sun sets the other rises
Now when the ordinary sun is present thunder clouds and marestail vapours cross the skies
and when that has appeared there eventually comes to be not enough water left in the great ocean to wet one finger joint
and when that has appeared the whole worldsphere becomes nothing but vapour
all its moisture being evaporated
for the wind makes gaps in it here and there
But when it has sunk to the former earths level strong winds arise and
they stop it and hold it stationary like the water in a water pot when the outlet is plugged
so too there are mountains in the domed places seas in the hollow places and continents in the flat places
then simultaneously some parts are domes some hollow and some flat
and the rice without red powder or husk that ripens without tilling appears a clean sweetsmelling rice fruit
That too vanishes in the same way
and the badālatā creeper appears
and an outgrowth from the soil appears
Then that vanishes in the same way
since it has whatever flavour they want to taste
That from the ceasing of the flames of the aeon destruction up till the great cloud of rehabilitation which rains down upon the hundred thousand million worldspheres constitutes the second incalculable and that is called what supersedes the contraction
That from the time of the great cloud of rehabilitation up till the appearance of the moon and sun constitutes the third incalculable and that is called the expansion
That from the appearance of the moon and sun up till the reappearance of the great cloud of the aeon destruction is the fourth incalculable and that is called what supersedes the expansion
These four incalculables make up one great aeon
but they suddenly subside and vanish away when all formed things have been overwhelmed by them
except that here the world begins its reappearance with the bhassara Brahmāworld
then the fine flue then the fine sand coarse sand gravel stones etc until it lifts up stones as big as a catafalque and great trees standing in uneven places
they are broken to bits there and cease to exist
where they crash against each other till they are broken to bits and disappear
And when delusion is more conspicuous it is destroyed by wind
though some say that it is destroyed by fire when hate is more conspicuous
and by water when greed is more conspicuous
and the eighth turn by water
then again seven turns by fire
and the eighth turn by water then when it has been seven times destroyed by water at each eighth turn it is again destroyed for seven turns by fire
and the words and passing away from there refer to his reviewing after turning forward again consequently the words I appeared elsewhere can be understood to be said with reference to the place of his reappearance next before his appearance here which is referred to by the words I appeared here
but his distinctive personality is made known by means of appearance etc as dark or fair
As to the explanation of the knowledge of passing away and reappearance of beings here is the text He directs he inclines his mind to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings With the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly happy or unhappy in their destiny he understands beings as faring according to their deeds These worthy beings who were illconducted in body speech and mind revilers of Noble Ones wrong in their views acquirers of kamma due to wrong view have on the breakup of the body after death appeared in a state of loss in an unhappy destiny in perdition in hell but these worthy beings who are well conducted in body speech and mind not revilers of Noble Ones right in their views acquirers of kamma due to right view have on the breakup of the body after death appeared in a happy destiny in the heavenly world Thus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly happy or unhappy in their destiny he understands beings as faring according to their deeds  Herein to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance cutūpapātañāṇāya cutiyā ca upapāte ca ñāṇāya 
He directs he inclines his mind he both directs and inclines preliminarywork consciousness
He is the bhikkhu who does the directing of his mind
But as regards with the divine eye etc it is divine because of its similarity to the divine
And this eye consisting in knowledge which is produced by the power of this bhikkhus energy in development is similar to that so it is divine because it is similar to the divine
Also it is divine because it is obtained by means of divine abiding and because it has divine abiding as its support
And it is divine because it greatly illuminates by discerning light
And it is divine because it has a great range through seeing visible objects that are behind walls and so on
All that should be understood according to the science of grammar
It is an eye in the sense of seeing
Also it is an eye since it is like an eye in its performance of an eyes function
It is purified since it is a cause of purification of view owing to seeing passing away and reappearance
One who sees only passing away and not reappearance
But since one who sees both outstrips that twofold false view
And the Buddhas sons see both of these
Hence it was said above It is purified since it is a cause of purification of view owing to seeing passing away and reappearance
It surpasses the human in the seeing of visible objects by surpassing the human environment Or it can be understood that it surpasses the human in surpassing the human fleshly eye
With that divine eye which is purified and superhuman
Passing away and reappearing he cannot see them with the divine eye actually at the death moment of reappearance
Inferior despised disdained looked down upon scorned on account of birth clan wealth etc because of reaping the outcome of delusion
Superior the opposite of that because of reaping the outcome of nondelusion
Fair having a desirable agreeable pleasing appearance because of reaping the outcome of nonhate
Ugly having undesirable disagreeable unpleasing appearance because of reaping the outcome of hate
Unhappy in their destiny gone to an unhappy destiny
Faring according to their deeds moving on in accordance with whatever deeds may have been accumulated
Herein the function of the divine eye is described by the first expressions beginning with passing away
The order in which that knowledge arises is this Here a bhikkhu extends light downwards in the direction of hell and he sees beings in hell undergoing great suffering
That vision is only the divine eyes function
He gives it attention in this way After doing what deeds do these beings undergo this suffering
 Then knowledge that has those deeds as its object arises in him in this way It was after doing this
That vision also is only the divine eyes function
He gives attention to it in this way After doing what deeds do these beings enjoy this good fortune
 Then knowledge that has those deeds as its object arises in him in this way It was after doing this
There is no special preliminary work for this And as in this case so too in the case of knowledge of the future
for these have the divine eye as their basis and their success is dependent on that of the divine eye
As to illconducted in body etc it is bad conduct  or it is corrupted conduct because it is rotten with defilements thus it is illconduct 
The illconduct comes about by means of the body or the illconduct has arisen due to the body thus it is illconduct in body so too with the rest
Illconducted is endowed with illconduct
Revilers of Noble Ones being desirous of harm for Noble Ones consisting of Buddhas Paccekabuddhas and disciples and also of householders who are streamenterers they revile them with the worst accusations or with denial of their special qualities  they abuse and upbraid them is what is meant
Herein it should be understood that when they say They have no asceticism they are not ascetics they revile them with the worst accusation
and when they say They have no jhāna or liberation or path of fruition etc they revile them with denial of their special qualities
And whether done knowingly or unknowingly it is in either case reviling of Noble Ones
The following story should be understood in order to make this clear
An elder and a young bhikkhu it seems wandered for alms in a certain village
At the first house they got only a spoonful of hot gruel
The elders stomach was paining him with wind
He thought This gruel is good for me I shall drink it before it gets cold
The other was disgusted and remarked The old man has let his hunger get the better of him and has done what he should be ashamed to do
 Yes venerable sir I am a streamenterer
So one who reviles a Noble One even if he is one himself should go to him if he himself is senior he should sit down in the squatting position and get his forgiveness in this way I have said such and such to the venerable one may he forgive me
If he can neither go nor send he should go to the bhikkhus who live in that monastery and sitting down in the squatting position if they are junior or acting in the way already described if they are senior he should get forgiveness by saying Venerable sirs I have said such and such to the venerable one named so and so may that venerable one forgive me
If it is a bhikkhu who wanders alone and it cannot be discovered where he is living or where he has gone he should go to a wise bhikkhu and say Venerable sir I have said such and such to the venerable one named so and so When I remember it I am remorseful What shall I do 
He should be told Think no more about it the elder forgives you Set your mind at rest
If the Noble One has attained the final Nibbāna he should go to the place where the bed is on which he attained the final Nibbāna and should go as far as the charnel ground to ask forgiveness
When this has been done there is no obstruction either to heaven or to the path He becomes as he was before
Wrong in their views having distorted vision
Acquirers of kamma due to wrong view those who have kamma of the various kinds acquired through wrong view and also those who incite others to bodily kamma etc rooted in wrong view
And here though reviling of Noble Ones has already been included by the mention of verbal misconduct and though wrong view has already been included by the mention of mental misconduct it may be understood nevertheless that the two are mentioned again in order to emphasize their great reprehensibility
Reviling Noble Ones is greatly reprehensible because of its resemblance to kamma with immediate result
For this is said Sāriputta just as a bhikkhu possessing virtuous conduct concentration and understanding could here and now attain final knowledge so it is in this case I say if he does not abandon such talk and such thoughts and renounce such views he will find himself in hell as surely as if he had been carried off and put there 
On the breakup of the body on the giving up of the clungto aggregates
After death in the taking up of the aggregates generated next after that
Or alternatively on the breakup of the body is on the interruption of the life faculty
A state of loss and the rest are all only synonyms for hell
Hell is a state of loss because it is removed from the reason  known as merit which is the cause of attaining heaven and deliverance or because of the absence of any origin of pleasures
or alternatively when they are destroyed  they fall in here all their limbs being broken up thus it is perdition 
There is no reason reckoned as satisfying here thus it is hell 
Or alternatively the animal generation is indicated by the mention of states of loss
The realm of ghosts is indicated by the mention of the unhappy destiny
The race of asura demons is indicated by the mention of perdition
Hell itself in the various aspects of Avīci etc is indicated by the mention of hell
Have  appeared have gone to have been reborn there is the intention
The bright side should be understood in the opposite way
But there is this difference Here the mention of the happy destiny includes the human destiny
and only the divine destiny is included by the mention of heavenly
Herein a good destiny is a happy destiny 
It is the very highest in such things as the objective fields comprising visible objects etc thus it is heavenly 
All that is a world in the sense of crumbling and disintegrating  This is the word meaning
Thus with the divine eye etc is all a summingup phrase
Now a clansman who is a beginner and wants to see in this way should make sure that the jhāna which has a kasiṇa as its object and is the basis for directknowledge is made in all ways susceptible of his guidance Then one of these three kasiṇas that is to say the fire kasiṇa white kasiṇa or light kasiṇa should be brought to the neighbourhood of the arising of divineeye knowledge
He should make this access jhāna his resort and stop there to extend the kasiṇa
The light kasiṇa is the best of the three
So either that or one of the others should be worked up in the way stated in the Description of the Kasiṇas and it should be stopped at the level of access and extended there
And the method for extending it should be understood in the way already described there too
It is only what is visible within the area to which the kasiṇa has been extended that can be seen
However while he is seeing what is visible the turn of the preliminary work runs out
Thereupon the light disappears
When that has disappeared he no longer sees what is visible 
Then he should again and again attain the basic jhāna emerge and pervade with light
In this way the light gradually gets consolidated till at length it remains in whatever sized area has been delimited by him in this way Let there be light here
And here there is the simile of the man who set out on a journey by night with a grass torch
Someone set out on a journey by night it seems with a grass torch
His torch stopped flaming
Then the even and uneven places were no more evident to him
He stubbed the torch on the ground and it again blazed up
In doing so it gave more light than before
As it went on dying out and flaring up again eventually the sun rose
When the sun had risen he thought There is no further need of the torch and he threw it away and went on by daylight
Herein the kasiṇa light at the time of the preliminary work is like the light of the torch
His no more seeing what is visible when the light has disappeared owing to the turn of the preliminary work running out while he is seeing what is visible is like the mans not seeing the even and uneven places owing to the torchs stopping flaming
His repeated attaining is like the stubbing of the torch
His more powerful pervasion with light by repeating the preliminary work is like the torchs giving more light than before
The strong lights remaining in as large an area as he delimits is like the suns rising
His seeing even during a whole day what is visible in the strong light after throwing the limited light away is like the mans going on by day after throwing the torch away
Herein when visible objects that are not within the focus of the bhikkhus fleshly eye come into the focus of his eye of knowledgethat is to say visible objects that are inside his belly belonging to the heart basis belonging to what is below the earths surface behind walls mountains and enclosures or in another worldsphere and are as if seen with the fleshly eye then it should be understood that the divine eye has arisen
And only that is capable of seeing the visible objects here not the preliminarywork consciousnesses
But this is an obstacle for an ordinary man
Why
Because wherever he determines Let there be light it becomes all light even after penetrating through earth sea and mountains Then fear arises in him when he sees the fearful forms of spirits ogres etc that are there
owing to which his mind is distracted and he loses his jhāna So he needs to be careful in seeing what is visible 
Here is the order of arising of the divine eye
Knowledge conascent with that is called knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings and knowledge of the divine eye
The explanation of knowledge of passing away and reappearance is ended
the meaning is for the kind of knowledge by means of which beings passing away and reappearance is known for knowledge of the divine eye is what is meant
for deities have as divine eye the sensitivity that is produced by kamma consisting in good conduct and is unimpeded by bile phlegm blood etc and capable of receiving an object even though far off because it is liberated from imperfections
assumes the annihilation view
and one who sees only reappearance and not passing away assumes the view that a new being appears
that vision of his is therefore a cause for purification of view
he sees beings he watches beings as men do with the fleshly eye
But it is those who being on the verge of death will die now that are intended as passing away
and those who have taken rebirthlinking and have just reappeared that are intended by reappearing
What is pointed out is that he sees them as such passing away and reappearing
Happy in their destiny gone to a happy destiny
unsightly illfavoured is the meaning
or rich very wealthy because of reaping the outcome of nongreed
or poor with little food and drink because of reaping the outcome of greed
But the function of knowledge of faring according to deeds is described by this last expression
Likewise he extends light upwards in the direction of the sensualsphere divine world and he sees beings in the Nandana Grove the Missaka Grove the Phārusaka Grove etc enjoying great good fortune
This is what is called knowledge of faring according to deeds
it is weighty kamma resembling that of immediate result and it is an obstacle both to heaven and to the path But it is remediable
People brought a wooden stool to the doorstep and he sat down and drank it
The elder wandered for alms and on returning to the monastery he asked the young bhikkhu Have you any footing in this Dispensation friend
Then friend do not try for the higher paths
one whose cankers are destroyed has been reviled by you
The young bhikkhu asked for the elders forgiveness
and was thereby restored to his former state
If he himself is junior he should pay homage and sitting in the squatting position and holding out his hand palms together he should get his forgiveness in this way I have said such and such to you venerable sir forgive me
If the other has gone away he should get his forgiveness either by going to him himself or by sending someone such as a coresident
And this should also be done when he fails to get forgiveness in his presence
Then he should extend his hands palms together in the direction taken by the Noble One and say Forgive me
And there is nothing more reprehensible than wrong view
according as it is said Bhikkhus I do not see any one thing so reprehensible as wrong view 
and after death is beyond the death consciousness
The destiny  the refuge of suffering is the unhappy destiny  or the destiny produced by kamma that is corrupted by much hate is an unhappy destiny 
Those who commit wrongdoings being separated out fall in here thus it is perdition 
for the animal generation is a state of loss because it is removed from the happy destiny but it is not an unhappy destiny because it allows the existence of royal nāgas  who are greatly honoured
for that is both a state of loss and an unhappy destiny because it is removed from the happy destiny and because it is the destiny of suffering
but it is not perdition because it is not a state of perdition such as that of the asura demons
for that is both a state of loss and an unhappy destiny in the way already described and it is called perdition from all opportunities
the meaning here in brief is this so with the divine eye  he sees
the intention is that absorption should not be aroused here
for if he does induce absorption the kasiṇa will become the support for basic jhāna but not for the directknowledge preliminary work
Even if he sits watching all day he can still see visible objects
when minddoor adverting which has made its object that visible datum of the kind already described has arisen and ceased then making that same visible datum the object all should be understood in the way already described beginning Either four or five impulsions impel  
The last of these consciousnesses which accomplishes the aim is of the finematerial sphere belonging to the fourth jhāna
Here also the three or four prior consciousnesses are of the sense sphere and have applied and sustained thought
The Helper knower of five aggregates Had these five directknowledges to tell
When they are known there are concerning them These general matters to be known as well
Among these the divine eye called knowledge of passing away and reappearance has two accessory kinds of knowledge that is to say knowledge of the future and knowledge of faring according to deeds
Now in order to avoid confusion about the classification of their objects
The Sage has told four object triads
By means of which one can infer Just how these seven different kinds Of directknowledges occur
Here is the explanation
Four object triads have been told by the Greatest of the Sages
What four
The limitedobject triad the pathobject triad the past object triad and the internalobject triad
Herein knowledge of supernormal power occurs with respect to seven kinds of object that is to say as having a limited or exalted a past future or present and an internal or external object
How
When he wants to go with an invisible body after making the body dependent on the mind and he converts the body to accord with the mind  and he sets it mounts it on the exalted consciousness then taking it that the word in the accusative case is the proper object it has a limited object because its object is the material body
When he wants to go with a visible body after making the mind dependent on the body and he converts the mind to accord with the body and sets it mounts it on the material body then taking it that the word in the accusative case is the proper object it has an exalted object because its object is the exalted consciousness
But that same consciousness takes what has passed has ceased as its object therefore it has a past object
In those who resolve about the future as in the case of the Elder Mahā Kassapa in the Great Storing of the Relics and others it has a future object
When the Elder Mahā Kassapa was making the great relic store it seems he resolved thus During the next two hundred and eighteen years in the future let not these perfumes dry up or these flowers wither or these lamps go out
When the Elder Assagutta saw the Community of Bhikkhus eating dry food in the Vattaniya Lodging he resolved thus Let the water pool become cream of curd every day before the meal
At the time of going with an invisible body after making the body dependent on the mind it has a present object
At the time of converting the mind to accord with the body or the body to accord with the mind and at the time of creating ones own appearance as a boy etc it has an internal object because it makes ones own body and mind its object
But at the time of showing elephants horses etc externally it has an external object This is how firstly the kinds of supernormal power should be understood to occur with respect to the seven kinds of object
Knowledge of the divine ear element occurs with respect to four kinds of object that is to say as having a limited and a present and an internal or external object
How
Since it makes sound its object and since sound is limited  it therefore has a limited object But since it occurs only by making existing sound its object it has a present object
At the time of hearing sounds in ones own belly it has an internal object
At the time of hearing the sounds of others it has an external object
This is how the knowledge of the divine ear element should be understood to occur with respect to the four kinds of object
Knowledge of penetration of minds occurs with respect to eight kinds of object that is to say as having a limited exalted or measureless object path as object and a past future or present object and an external object
How
At the time of knowing others sensesphere consciousness it has a limited object
At the time of knowing their finematerialsphere or immaterialsphere consciousness it has an exalted object
At the time of knowing path and fruition it has a measureless object
And here an ordinary man does not know a stream enterers consciousness
But an Arahant knows the consciousness of all the others
And each higher one knows the consciousnesses of all those below him This is the difference to be understood
At the time when it has path consciousness as its object it has path as object
But when one knows anothers consciousness within the past seven days or within the future seven days then it has a past object and has a future object respectively
How does it have a present object
Present is of three kinds that is to say present by moment present by continuity and present by extent
Herein what has reached arising  presence  and dissolution is present by moment
What is included in one or two rounds of continuity is present by continuity
Herein when someone goes to a welllit place after sitting in the dark an object is not clear at first until it becomes clear one or two rounds of continuity should be understood to pass meanwhile
And when he goes into an inner closet after going about in a welllit place a visible object is not immediately evident at first until it becomes clear one or two rounds of continuity should be understood to pass meanwhile
When he stands at a distance although he sees the alterations of the hands of washermen and the alterations of the striking of gongs drums etc yet he does not hear the sound at first  until he hears it one or two rounds of continuity should be understood to pass meanwhile
This firstly is according to the Majjhima reciters
The Saṃyutta reciters however say that there are two kinds of continuity that is to say material continuity and immaterial continuity that a material continuity lasts as long as the muddy line of water touching the bank when one treads in the water takes to clear as long as the heat of the body in one who has walked a certain extent takes to die down as long as the blindness in one who has come from the sunshine into a room does not depart as long as when after someone has been giving attention to his meditation subject in a room and then opens the shutters by day and looks out the dazzling in his eyes does not die down
What is delimited by a single becoming is called present by extent
with reference to which it is said in the Bhaddekaratta Sutta Friends the mind and mental objects are both what is present Consciousness is bound by desire and greed for what is present Because consciousness is bound by desire and greed he delights in that When he delights in that then he is vanquished with respect to present states 
And here present by continuity is used in the Commentaries
while present by extent is used in the Suttas
Herein some say that consciousness present by moment is the object of knowledge of penetration of minds
What reason do they give
It is that the consciousness of the possessor of supernormal power and that of the other arise in a single moment
Their simile is this just as when a handful of flowers is thrown into the air the stalk of one flower is probably struck by the stalk of another and so too when with the thought I will know anothers mind the mind of a multitude is adverted to as a mass then the mind of one is probably penetrated by the mind of the other either at the moment of arising or at the moment of presence or at the moment of dissolution
That however is rejected in the Commentaries as erroneous and because the flaw of plurality of objects follows if presence of the same object to both adverting and impulsion is not insisted on
What should be understood is that the object is present by continuity and present by extent
Herein anothers consciousness during a time measuring two or three cognitive series with impulsions extending before and after the strictly currently existing cognitive series with impulsions is all called present by continuity
That is rightly said
Here is the illustration The possessor of supernormal power who wants to know anothers mind adverts The adverting consciousness makes the others consciousness that is present by moment its object and ceases together with it
After that there are four or five impulsions
of which the last is the supernormalpower consciousness the rest being of the sense sphere That same others consciousness which has ceased is the object of all these too and so they do not have different objects because they have an object that is present by extent
Or since what is present by continuity falls within what is present by extent it can therefore be understood that it has a present object simply in what is present by extent
It has an external object because it has only anothers mind as its object This is how knowledge of penetration of minds should be understood to occur with respect to the eight kinds of objects
Knowledge of past lives occurs with respect to eight kinds of object that is to say as having a limited exalted or measureless object path as object a past object and an internal external or notsoclassifiable object
How
At the time of recollecting sensesphere aggregates it has a limited object
At the time of recollecting finematerialsphere or immaterialsphere aggregates it has an exalted object
At the time of recollecting a path developed or a fruition realized in the past either by oneself or by others it has a measureless object
At the time of recollecting a path developed it has a path as object
But it invariably has a past object
Herein although knowledge of penetration of minds and knowledge of faring according to deeds also have a past object still of these two the object of the knowledge of penetration of minds is only consciousness within the past seven days
It knows neither other aggregates nor what is bound up with aggregates that is name surname and so on
It is said indirectly that it has a path as object since it has the consciousness associated with the path as its object
Also the object of knowledge of faring according to deeds is simply past volition
But there is nothing whether past aggregates or what is bound up with aggregates that is not the object of knowledge of past lives
for that is on a par with omniscient knowledge with respect to past aggregates and states bound up with aggregates This is the difference to be understood here
This is the method according to the Commentaries here
But it is said in the Paṭṭhāna Profitable aggregates are a condition as object condition for knowledge of supernormal power for knowledge of penetration of minds for knowledge of past lives for knowledge of faring according to deeds and for knowledge of the future 
And there too profitable and unprofitable aggregates are the object of knowledge of faring according to deeds
At the time of recollecting ones own aggregates it has an internal object
At the time of recollecting anothers aggregates it has an external object
In the past there was the Blessed One Vipassin
His mother was Bhandumatī His father was Bhandumant   At the time of recollecting the concepts consisting in name race in the way beginning and the concept consisting in the sign of the earth etc it has a notsoclassifiable object
And here the name and race must be regarded not as the actual words but as the meaning of the words which is established by convention and bound up with aggregates
For the actual words are limited since they are included by the sound base
Our preference here is this
This is how the knowledge of past lives should be understood to occur with respect to the eight kinds of object
Knowledge of the divine eye occurs with respect to four kinds of object that is to say as having a limited a present and an internal or external object
How
Since it makes materiality its object and materiality is limited it therefore has a limited object
Since it occurs only with respect to existing materiality it has a present object
At the time of seeing materiality inside ones own belly etc it has an internal object
At the time of seeing anothers materiality it has an external object This is how the knowledge of the divine eye should be understood to occur with respect to the four kinds of object
Knowledge of the future occurs with respect to eight kinds of object that is to say as having a limited or exalted or immeasurable object a path as object a future object and an internal external or notso classifiable object
How
At the time of knowing this This one will be reborn in the future in the sense sphere it has a limited object
At the time of knowing He will be reborn in the finematerial or immaterial sphere it has an exalted object
At the time of knowing He will develop the path he will realize fruition it has an immeasurable object
At the time of knowing He will develop the path it has a path as object too
But it invariably has a future object
Herein although knowledge of penetration of minds has a future object too nevertheless its object is then only future consciousness that is within seven days
But at the time of knowing name and race in the way beginning In the future the Blessed One Metteyya will arise
His father will be the brahman Subrahmā
His mother will be the brahmani Brahmavatī  it has a notsoclassifiable object in the way described under knowledge of past lives  This is how the knowledge of the future should be understood
Knowledge of faring according to deeds occurs with respect to five kinds of object that is to say as having a limited or exalted a past and an internal or external object
How
At the time of knowing sensesphere kamma it has a limited object
At the time of knowing finematerialsphere or immaterial sphere kamma it has an exalted object
Since it knows only what is past it has a past object
At the time of knowing ones own kamma it has an internal object
At the time of knowing anothers kamma it has an external object
This is how the knowledge of faring according to deeds should be understood to occur with respect to the five kinds of object
And when the knowledge described here both as having an internal object and having an external object knows these objects now internally and now externally it is then said that it has an internalexternal object as well
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
So these two along with the five beginning with the kinds of supernormal power make seven kinds of directknowledge given here
and so it all happened
and when the water was taken before the meal it was cream of curd
but after the meal there was only the normal water
nor does a streamenterer know a oncereturners and so up to the Arahants consciousness
and that an immaterial continuity consists in two or three rounds of impulsions Both of these are according to them called present by continuity
because even if one went on adverting for a hundred or a thousand years there is never co presence of the two consciousnesses that is to say of that with which he adverts and that of impulsion with which he knows
But in the Saṃyutta Commentary it is said that present by extent should be illustrated by a round of impulsions
And while they have a single object it is only the supernormalpower consciousness that actually knows anothers consciousness not the others
just as in the eyedoor it is only eyeconsciousness that actually sees the visible datum not the others 
So this has a present object in what is present by continuity and what is present by extent
and therefore four aggregates are also the objects of knowledge of penetration of minds and of knowledge of faring according to deeds
according as it is said The discrimination of language has a limited object 
At the time of knowing Soandso will be reborn there it has an external object
At the time of knowing I shall be reborn there it has an internal object
But there is nothing in the future as described under the knowledge of past lives  that is not an object of knowledge of the future
for it knows neither any other aggregate nor what is bound up with aggregates
The thirteenth chapter
concluding The Description of Directknowledge
it is a name for a great islandoffering starting with the Cetiyagiri and extending over the whole island and up to a league into the sea
It is the path traversed by a ploughshare in ploughing that is called a sītā
They become of the kinds desired they become whatever the kinds that were desired
for they come to possess as many varieties in appearance etc as it was wished they should have
But although they become manifold in this way by being made the object in different modes of appearance nevertheless it is only a single resolution consciousness that occurs
This is its power For it is like the single volition that produces a personality possessed of many different facets  And there it is the aspiration to become that is a condition for the differentiation in the kamma
and kammaresult is imponderable And here too it is the preliminarywork consciousness that should be taken as a condition for the difference And the field of supernormal power is imponderable too
Anāthapiṇḍikas younger brother
There is only the going of consciousness there is only a going that is the same as that of the mind
But how does the body whose going being that of matter is slow come to have the same going as the mind which quickly passes
Its going is not the same in all respects
for in the case of converting the mind to conform with the body the mind does not come to have the same going as the body in all respects
For it is not that the mind then occurs with the moment of a material state which passes slowly
instead of passing with its own kind of moment which is what establishes its individual essence But rather the mind is called converted to accord with the going of the body as long as it goes on occurring in a continuity that conforms with the body until the desired place is arrived at This is because its passing occurs parallel with that of the body whose going is slow owing to the resolution Let the mind be like this body And likewise it is while the body keeps occurring in suchwise that its arrival at the desired place comes about in only a few quick passes of the mind instead of passing slowly as in those who have not developed the roads to powerand this mode of occurrence is due to the possession of the perception of lightness to say nothing of the resolve Let this body be like this mindthat the body is called converted to accord with the going of the mind not because it arrives at the desired place in a single consciousness moment
And when taken thus the simile Just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or bend his outstretched arm can be taken literally
And this must be accepted in this way without reserve otherwise there is conflict with the Suttas the Abhidhamma and the Commentary as well as contradiction of natural law 
Bhikkhus I see no other one thing that is so quickly transformed as the mind here it is material states that are referred to by the word other because they do not pass quickly
And in the Abhidhamma only matter is called prenascence condition and only consciousness postnascence condition
And wherever states arise there they dissolve
There is no transmigration to an adjacent location  nor does the individual essence become other
For it is not possible to effect any alteration of the characteristics of dhammas by force of the roads to power But it is possible to effect alteration of the mode in which they are present 
This should be regarded as implying that there is no sex or life faculty in it either
With the consciousness belonging to the particular concentration that constitutes the preliminary work The meaning is by means of consciousness concentrated with the momentary concentration that occurs in the form of the preliminary work for knowledge of the divine ear element
The occasion of access for the divine ear element is called preliminarywork consciousness
but that as stated refers to multiple advertings
The sound sign is the sound itself since it is the cause for the arising of the knowledge Or the grosssubtle aspect acquired in the way stated is the sound sign
This is momentaryconcentration consciousness which owing to the fact that the preliminary work contingent upon the sound has been performed occurs in one who has attained the basic jhāna and emerged for the purpose of arousing the divine ear element
Becomes merged is amalgamated with the divine ear element He is called an obtainer of divineear knowledge as soon as the absorption consciousness has arisen The meaning is that there is now no further need of development for the purpose
But the heartbasis occurs with this blood as its support
The matter of the heart is not the heartbasis but rather it is the heart as the piece of flesh
described as resembling a lotus bud in shape outside and like a kosātakī fruit inside  For the blood mentioned here is to be found with that as its support
Of one who has not done any interpreting reckoned as study for directknowledge
The ordinary sun is the suns divine palace that arose before the emergence of the aeon
But like the other sensesphere deities at the time of the emergence of the aeon the sun deity too produces jhāna and reappears in the Brahmāworld But the actual suns disk becomes brighter and more fiery
Others say that it disappears and another appears in its place
The five are the Ganges Yamunā  Sarabhu Sarassatī and Mahī
Haṃsapātana is another name for Maṇḍākinī
At the place where the Yāma Deities are established
The places where the Cātumahārājika and Tāvatiṃsa heavens become established do not reappear at first because they are connected with the earth
He cannot see them with the divine eyewith the knowledge of the divine eye because of the extreme brevity and extreme subtlety of the material moment in anyone
Moreover it is present materiality that is the object of the divine eye and that is by prenascence condition And there is no occurrence of exalted consciousness without adverting and preliminary work Nor is materiality that is only arising able to serve as object condition nor that which is dissolving
Therefore it is rightly said that he cannot see with the divine eye materiality at the moments of death and reappearance
If the knowledge of the divine eye has only materiality as its object then why is it said that he sees beings
It is said in this way since it is mainly concerned with instances of materiality in a beings continuity
or because that materiality is a reason for apprehending beings Some say that this is said according to conventional usage
Although with the words These perfumes etc he apprehends present perfumes etc nevertheless the object of his resolving consciousness is actually their future materiality that is to be associated with the distinction of not drying up This is because the resolve concerns the future 
Cream of curd when resolving his object is the future appearance of curd
Some however explain the meaning in this way It is as long as when one has stepped on the dry bank with a wet foot the water line on the foot does not disappear
The residents of the Abhayagiri Monastery in Anurādhapura
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
Bhikkhus Sariputta is wise Sariputta has great wisdom Sariputta has wide wisdom Sariputta has joyous wisdom Sariputta has quick wisdom Sariputta has keen wisdom Sariputta has penetrative wisdom During half a month bhikkhus Sariputta had insight into states one by one as they occurred
And the states in the first jhana  the applied thought the sustained thought the rapture the pleasure and the unification of mind the contact feeling perception volition and mind the zeal decision energy mindfulness equanimity and attention these states were defined by him one by one as they occurred
He understood thus So indeed these states not having been come into being having been they vanish
Regarding those states he abided unattracted unrepelled independent detached free dissociated with a mind rid of barriers
Again bhikkhus with the stilling of applied and sustained thought Sariputta entered and abided in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentration
And the states in the second jhana  the selfconfidence the rapture the pleasure and the unification of mind the contact feeling perception volition and mind the zeal decision energy mindfulness equanimity and attention  these states were defined by him one by one as they occurred
and with the cultivation of that attainment he confirmed that there is
Again bhikkhus with the fading away as well of rapture Sariputta abided in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body he entered upon and abided in the third jhana
And the states in the third jhana  the equanimity the pleasure the mindfulness the full awareness and the unification of mind the contact feeling perception volition and mind the zeal decision energy mindfulness equanimity and attention these states were defined by him one by one as they occurred known to him those states arose known they were present known they disappeared
He understood thus
Again bhikkhus with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief Sariputta entered upon and abided in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
And the states in the fourth jhana  the equanimity the neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling the mental unconcern due to tranquillity the purity of mindfulness and the unification of mind the contact feeling perception volition and mind the zeal decision energy mindfulness equanimity and attention these states were defined by him one by one as they occurred known to him those states arose known they were present known they disappeared
He understood thus
Again bhikkhus with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite Sariputta entered upon and abided in the base of infinite space
known to him those states arose known they were present known they disappeared
He understood thus
Again bhikkhus by completely surmounting the base of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite Sariputta entered upon and abided in the base of infinite consciousness
And the states in the base of infinite consciousness  the perception of the base of infinite consciousness and the unification of mind the contact feeling perception volition and mind the zeal decision energy mindfulness equanimity and attention  these states were defined by him one by one as they occurred
He understood thus
Again bhikkhus by completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing Sariputta entered upon and abided in the base of nothingness
And the states in the base of nothingness  the perception of the base of nothingness and the unification of mind the contact feeling perception volition and mind the zeal decision energy mindfulness equanimity and attention  these states were defined by him one by one as they occurred
He understood thus
Again bhikkhus by completely surmounting the base of nothingness Sariputta entered upon and abided in the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception
He emerged mindful from that attainment
Having done so he contemplated the past states which had ceased and changed thus So indeed these states not having been come into being having been they vanish 
Regarding those states he abided unattracted unrepelled independent detached free dissociated with a mind rid of barriers
He understood There is an escape beyond
Again bhikkhus by completely surmounting the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception Sariputta entered upon and abided in the cessation of perception and feeling
And his taints were destroyed by his seeing with wisdom
Having done so he recalled the past states which had ceased and changed thus So indeed these states not having been come into being having been they vanish
Regarding those states he abided unattracted unrepelled independent detached free dissociated with a mind rid of barriers
He understood There is no escape beyond
Bhikkhus rightly speaking were it to be said of anyone He is the son of the Blessed One born of his breast born of his mouth born of the Dhamma created by the Dhamma an heir in the Dhamma not an heir in material things it is of Sariputta indeed that rightly speaking this should be said
Bhikkhus the matchless Wheel of the Dhamma set rolling by the Tathagata is kept rolling rightly by Sariputta
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Now Sariputtas insight into states one by one as they occurred was this
Here bhikkhus quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states Sariputta entered upon and abided in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
known to him those states arose known they were present known they disappeared
He understood There is an escape beyond
and with the cultivation of that attainment he confirmed that there is
He understood thus 
known to him those states arose known they were present known they disappeared
on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful
and with the cultivation of that attainment he confirmed that there is
and with the cultivation of that attainment he confirmed that there is
And the states in the base of infinite space  the perception of the base of infinite space and the unification of mind the contact feeling perception volition and mind the zeal decision energy mindfulness equanimity and attention  these states were defined by him one by one as they occurred
and with the cultivation of that attainment he confirmed that there is
known to him those states arose known they were present known they disappeared
and with the cultivation of that attainment he confirmed that there is
known to him those states arose known they were present known they disappeared
and with the cultivation of that attainment he confirmed that there is
and with the cultivation of that attainment he confirmed that there is
He emerged mindful from that attainment
Bhikkhus rightly speaking were it to be said of anyone He has attained mastery and perfection in noble virtue attained mastery and perfection in noble concentration attained mastery and perfection in noble wisdom attained mastery and perfection in noble deliverance it is of Sariputta indeed that rightly speaking this should be said
and with the cultivation of that attainment he confirmed that there is not
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena are there any formations that are produced without a becoming
Sire there are no formations that are produced without a becoming
What do you think about this sire Was this house where you are sitting produced without a becoming
There is nothing here revered sir that has been produced without a becoming These pieces of wood were in the forest and the clay was in the ground and it is through proper effort on the part of women and men that this house is existing
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena is it possible having again and again analysed these mental states the nature of which it is to arise together to point to a difference between them saying This is contact this is feeling this perception this volition this consciousness this applied thought this sustained thought
It is not possible sire
It is not possible to do so sire though all these tastes are present each with its own distinguishing mark
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena are these five sense bases produced from different kammas or from one kamma
They are produced from different kammas sire not from one kamma
What do you think of this sire If five kinds of seed were sown in one field would different fruits be produced from these different seeds
Yes revered sir they would be so produced
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena what is the reason that people are not all the same some being shortlived some longlived some weakly others healthy some ugly some beautiful some of few wishes others of many wishes some poor others rich some belonging to low families others to high families and some being weak in wisdom others having wisdom
But why sire are trees not all the same some being acidic some salty some bitter some sharp some astringent others sweet
I think revered sir that is because of a difference in seeds
And this sire was also said by the Blessed One Young man beings are owners of their own kamma they are heirs to their kamma kamma is the womb from which they are born their kamma is their friend kamma is their refuge kamma divides beings that is to say into low and lofty 
King Milinda said You told me revered sir that the purpose of your going forth was so that this suffering might cease and another suffering might not arise
Was it because there had been previous effort Should one not endeavour at the present time
Present endeavour is concerned with what still remains to be done Previous effort has accomplished what it had to do
What do you think of this sire If you were to become thirsty would you then have a well dug and say I will drink water
No revered sir
Even so sire present endeavour is concerned with what still remains to be done Previous effort has accomplished what it had to do
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena does everyone obtain Nibbāna
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena is cessation Nibbāna
Yes sire cessation is Nibbāna
All those foolish worldlings sire who rejoice in the inner and outer sense bases approve of them and cleave to them are carried away by that stream they are not utterly free from birth old age and death from sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair they are not I say utterly free from suffering
But sire the instructed noble disciple does not rejoice in the inner and outer sense bases does not approve of them or cleave to them For him not rejoicing in them not approving of them or cleaving to them craving ceases from the cessation of craving is the cessation of clinging from the cessation of clinging is the cessation of becoming from the cessation of becoming is the cessation of birth from the cessation of birth old age and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair cease Thus is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering In this way sire cessation is Nibbāna
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Not everyone sire obtains Nibbāna but he obtains Nibbāna who practising rightly knows directly the things that should be directly known comprehends the things that should be comprehended abandons the things that should be abandoned develops the things that should be developed and realizes the things that should be realized

And Dhamma is explained leading out calming tending toward total Nibbāna going to self  awakening declared by one who has gone the good way
Purifying the way leading out of delusion calming and directing to perfect peace and leading to enlightenmentthis Way he has made known
Having heard the Dhamma we know this
Having heard the Teaching we know this
Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful
Birth is dukkha Ageing is dukkha And death is dukkha
sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful
Sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are dukkha
association with things disliked is stressful separation from things liked is stressful
Association with the disliked is dukkha Separation from the liked is dukkha
not getting what one wants is stressful
Not attaining ones wishes is dukkha
In short the five clingingaggregates are stressful
In brief the five focuses of the grasping mind are dukkha
namely  the form clingingaggregate the feeling clingingaggregate the perception clingingaggregate the fabrication clingingaggregate the consciousness clingingaggregate
These are as follows Identification with the body Identification with feeling Identification with perception Identification with mental formations Identification with consciousness
So that they might fully understand this the Blessed One while still alive
For the complete understanding of this The Blessed One in his lifetime
often instructed his listeners in this way
Frequently instructed his disciples in just this way
did he emphasize this part of his admonition
In addition
Many times
he further instructed
Form is inconstant Feeling is inconstant Perception is inconstant Fabrications are inconstant Consciousness is inconstant
The body is impermanent Feeling is impermanent Perception is impermanent Mental formations are impermanent Consciousness is impermanent
Form is notself Feeling is notself Perception is notself Fabrications are notself Consciousness is notself
The body is notself Feeling is notself Perception is notself Mental formations are notself Consciousness is notself
All fabrications are inconstant All phenomena are notself
All conditions are impermanent There is no self in the created or the uncreated

All of us Are bound by birth ageing and death

You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Yes that is so
Make a simile
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Having thus protected these six quarters he inhabits a house For just as a bee without spoiling the colour and fragrance of flowers with its mouth and wings takes in their pollen and gradually makes a honeycomb the size of a wheel just so those riches must be gathered gradually lawfully and justly without oppressing oneself or anybody else 
Ones riches being thus gathered it is desirable that ones income be four times the expenditure at least For otherwise the expenditure could not continue endlessly and a settled life would not be possible Therefore one should divide ones riches into four parts and enjoy them using one part With two parts one should promote ones job agriculture commerce and so on But the fourth part should be stored and kept aside for emergencies For when the king fire water thieves and other misfortunes destroy ones riches one is thus able to dig them up out of the ground and establish once again a domestic life
And here the Buddha has not mentioned a separate part to be spent for good actions For if he had said so A good action should be done only with this amount of ones wealth the Blessed One would have introduced a restriction and in this case even people eager to do pure action would consider doing even it with no more than that amount of their wealth Let alone less committed people They could even preach what follows more or less that the Blessed One himself when he was a future Buddha did not know of a limit for a religious gift but gave everything to supplicants without sparing anything for himself that he was asked for one eye but he tore out both his eyes squeezing out even his blood like a bundle of sugarcane in a small mill or else that he entered a fire and offered his whole body to them that now being the omniscient Buddha he makes a restriction to the effect that a pure action must be done with this amount of wealth and no more that the offering of a religious gift is very praiseworthy but he approves neither of the largeness of an offer made to others or to himself nor of the acquisition of omniscience that requires generosity to the highest degree
Therefore the Blessed One in his wish that pure actions no matter if done with one or four parts of ones income be proportionate to ones wealth and reflect ones faith did not allocate a separate part for that purpose but divided wealth into four parts It should be understood thus
And yet according to the masters of the commentaries it is out of the part allocated for food  they say  that one must make gifts both to monks and to poor men travellers wayfarers and the like
But one should understand this view as aimed at introducing a beginner to the practice of giving
For after being thus introduced he would gradually become capable of giving even his own flesh and blood as the Blessed One did in his past lives
This should be understood thus A wife out of compassion for her husband rises first from her bed charges the servants with their tasks has the front yard swept milks a cow etc makes it so that her husbands heart is elated and after asking her husband with pleasant words she prepares bathing water and the rest and in the evening she has food given to all who eat in the house and prepares food also for those who have no food She asks about the cows whether they have or have not arrived in the pen has arrangements made for the protection the storeroom and the rest asks for the keyrings and if any goods are placed in an unguarded spot she has them placed in a guarded one After rehearsing what should be done on the following day at dawn she goes to bed
She honours and respects both her husband and his parents as well as ascetics and brahmins whenever they come she has a seat prepared for them has their feet washed and food given to them Skilled in spinning thread and in other tasks due to her husband she herself performs them without laziness as they are imparted to her and orders her servants to do what they should do She knows that among my husbands female and male servants these work the whole day these in the mornings these in the evenings And she knows when they are sick how they are and provides them with medical preparations and the like She duly guards and stores the wealth and food accumulated by her husband for she is not a cheat a thief a woman addicted to liquor She is established in the refuges and the precepts Being unstingy she likes giving and sharing  Possessed of these characteristics  such a woman is reborn among the gods of Pleasant Forms
Therefore the Blessed One said to the elder Anuruddha Anuruddha women endowed with These eight qualities after the collapse of the body after death are reborn as companions of the gods of Pleasant Forms and so on
The gods of Pleasant Forms are gods who whatever colours flavours and pleasures they wish in the world of the gods who Delight in Creating
Moreover if she does not grow angry she becomes beautiful in another life If she makes gifts she becomes wealthy If she doss not indulge in jealousy and contempt she becomes possessed of majesty and respect How so Once upon a time Queen Mallika went to the Jeta Grove revered the Perfectly Awakened One sat at one side and asked four questions Venerable sir in this world some women are ugly poor and weak
some are unsightly wealthy rich and powerful
some are beautiful poor and weak some are beautiful rich and powerful Whet is the cause for their condition 
Having heard this the Blessed One said Mallika if in this world a woman being often angry does not assist ascetics and brahmins with food water gifts etc and is jealous and contemptuous of others goods and honours after death if she obtains a human condition she is ugly poor and weak If she is often angry makes gifts and does not indulge in jealousy and contempt then wherever she is reborn she is ugly wealthy and powerful
If she does not grow angry makes no gifts does not indulge in jealousy and contempt then wherever she is reborn she is beautiful poor and weak If she does not grow angry assists ascetics and brahmins with food water etc and is not jealous and contemptuous of others goods and honours then wherever she is reborn she is beautiful rich and powerful
Having heard this Queen Mallika said Venerable sir in a Past life I must have often been angry for now I have become ugly I must have assisted ascetics and brahmins with food water etc therfore I have become very wealthy I must have not been jealous and contemptous of others goods and honours for now I have become powerful Therefore in this royal court out of all the daughters of warriors brahmins and landlords I enjoy supremacy and primacy Venerable sir from today I shall not grow angry I shall assist ascetics and brahmins with food water etc and I shall not be jealous and contemptuous of others goods and honours She paid her respects to the Buddha and went for refuge
Therefore those who are not angry become beautiful those who make gifts become rich and very wealthy those who are not jealous and contemptuous enjoy majesty and respect
Thus one should understand the fulfilment of right livelihood through this method of the Way to the Conquest of Both Worlds or through another one unobjectionable to the Buddha
How revered sir is cessation Nibbāna
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
But how revered Nāgasena does anyone without obtaining Nibbāna know that Nibbāna is happiness
How would they know
In the same way sire anyone who has heard those who have seen Nibbāna knows that Nibbāna is happiness
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Then have your teachers seen the Buddha
Well then revered Nāgasena there is no Buddha
But have you seen sire the river Uhā in the Himalayas
Then has your father seen it
Well then sire there is no river Uhā
In the same way sire though neither my teachers nor I have seen the Blessed One nevertheless there is the Blessed One
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
But revered Nāgasena how do you know that the Buddha is unsurpassed when you have never seen him
In the same way sire having seen the great disciples who had attained final Nibbāna I know that the Blessed One is unsurpassed
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
How revered Nāgasena is it that one does not transmigrate and yet is reborn Make a simile
In the same way sire one does not transmigrate and yet is reborn
Make a further simile
Do you remember sire when you were a boy learning some verse from a teacher
But sir did that verse pass over from the teacher
In the same way sire one does not transmigrate and yet is reborn
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
If revered Nāgasena there is no one transmigrating from this body to another body is not one freed from evil deeds
Make a simile
Suppose sire some man were to steal another mans mangoes would he deserve punishment
But if those mangoes he stole sire were not those that had been planted why would he deserve punishment
In the same way sire it is through the deed one does with this mindandmatter be it good or bad that one takes rebirth in another mindandmatter and therefore one is not utterly freed from evil deeds
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Is it possible to point to those deeds revered sir and say that they remain either here or there
Make a simile
In the same way sire so long as the life continuum is not cut off it is not possible to point to those deeds and say that they remain either here or there
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
At what time and for what reason did the Venerable nanda approach the Exalted One
He approached in the evening for the purpose of asking a question about the principle of conditionality
It is said that on that day the Venerable nanda in order to benefit families walked for alms in the village of Kammsadhamma as if depositing a bundle of a thousand gold pieces at the door ofeach house because by accepting their almsfood he enabled them to generate a great mass of merit When he returned from his almsround he did his duties to the Teacher When the Teacher entered the Fragrant Cottage he venerated him went to his own dayquarters and did his duties to his own pupils After they departed he swept his quarters prepared his leather mat cooled off his hands and feet with water from the waterpot and sitting down crosslegged he attained to the attainment of the fruit of streamentry
Emerging from the attainment at the predetermined time he immersed his mind in the principle of conditionality
He explored the twelvefactored principle of conditionality three times first starting from the beginning thus With ignorance as condition volitional formations come to be and working down to the end then working from the end back to the beginning and then working from both ends to the middle and from themiddle to both ends
As he explored it the principle of conditionality became transparent to him and it appeared as clear as clear can be
Thereupon he considered The Buddhas all say that the principle of conditionality is deep and appears deep yet to myself a disciple with limited knowledge it appears cleartransparent and evident Does it appear so only to myself or to others as well
 Then he thought Let me take this question Great Discourse on Causationto the Exalted One For surely the Exalted One will treat this question of mine as an opportunity for teaching and as if lifting up Mount Sineru along with its surroundings he will elucidate the matter by explaining a discourse
For there are four areas where the thundering of the Buddhas becomes great their knowledge enters its proper field the greatness of the Buddhaknowledge is discerned and their teaching becomes deep stamped with the three characteristicsconnected with emptiness namely the promulgation of the Vinaya the classification of the diversity of planes the exposition of the principle of conditionality and the classification of the diversity of tenets
Though the Venerable nanda ordinarily approached the Exalted One a hundred or a thousand times a day he never approached without a cause or reason So that day he rose up from his dayquarters shook out his leather mat and taking it along in the evening he approached the Buddha with his question in mind thinking I will confront the elephantlike Buddha and hear his trumpeting cry of knowledge I will confront the lionlike Buddha and hear his lions roar of knowledge I will confront the stallionlike Buddha and see his stride of knowledge
Thus it was said above He approached in the evening for the purpose of asking a question about the principle of conditionality
Being deep it appears deep For something might be shallow yet appear deep like stagnant water having a dark colour because of rotting leaves etc
this might be only kneedeep yet appear to be a hundred fathoms
Another body of water might be deep yet appear shallow like the serene water of the Jewel River
which is a hundred fathoms deep yet seems to be kneedeep
Other water might be shallow and appear shallow like the water in a pot etc
And still other water might be deep and appear deep like the water in the ocean at the foot of Mount Sineru
Thus water can be described in four ways
But this is not so in regard to dependent arising
This can be described in only one way it is deep and appears deep
But though this is so the Venerable nanda says To myself it seems as clear as clear can be How wonderful and marvellous venerable sir
Thus revealing his own astonishment he asked a question sat down and became silent
Hearing his statement the Exalted One thought to himself nanda says that a matter which belongs to the domain of the Buddhas is clear to himself This is like stretching out ones hand to take hold of the highest plane of existence like trying to cut through Mount Sineru and remove its core like wanting to cross the ocean without a ship or like turning over the earth and trying to take its nutritive essence
Let me point out its depth to him Then he said Do not say so nanda
The Exalted One says Do not say so nanda both to extol the Venerable nanda and to restrain him
Extolling himhe implies nanda you have great wisdom and lucid knowledge Thus dependent arising though deep seems clear to you
But for others it cannot be characterized as clear ratherit is deep and it appears deep
A welltrained champion wrestler it is said who had been nourished with nutritious food for six months and had exercised with a wrestlers stone was going to the fighting arena during a carnival when they showed him a wrestlers stone along the way He asked What is that
  A wrestlers stone
 We cannot lift it they said Then he went over to it himself Saying What is so heavy with this  he lifted two such stones with two hands threw them away like balls and continued on his way
Though the stone was light for the wrestler it could not be called light for the others
As the wrestler had been nourished with nutritious food for six months so the Venerable nanda had been endowed with the aspiration for  aeons As for the wrestler with his great strength the stone was light but not for others so for the Elder nanda with his great wisdom dependent arising was clear but it could not be called clear for others
But when it plays about in the watershaking both fins striking the water with its tail ducking its head in and outit churns up the water in an area of  or yojanas until it becomes just like water boiling in a pot on the stove Even water in a region  yojanas deep cannot cover its back
This fish might say They are always saying that the ocean is deep How can it be deep I cant even find enough water to cover my back
For the Timirapingala with its vast body the ocean might be shallow but it cannot be called shallow for the smaller fish Similarly for the Elder nanda with his vast knowledge dependent arising might be clear but it cannot be called clear for others
The royal Supaa bird is  yojanas long his right and left wings fifty yojanas his tail sixty yojanas his neck thirty yojanas his beak nine yojanas and his feet twelve yojanas
When he starts to stir up a wind even an area  or yojanas is not enough
He might say They are always saying that space is infinite How can it be infinite I cant even find enough room to stretch out my wings and stir up a wind
For the royal Supaa bird with his vast body space might be limited but it cannot be called limited for smaller birds Similarly for the Elder nanda with his vast knowledge
Rhu the lord of the titans is  yojanas tall
His armspan is  yojanas
Each segment of his fingers is fifty yojanas as is the distance between his eyebrows
His brow is  yojanas
When he enters the ocean the deepest water comes only up to his knees
He might say They are always saying that the ocean is deep How can it be deep I cant even find water deep enough to cover my knees
For Rhu with his vast body the ocean might be shallow but it cannot be called shallow for others Similarly for the Elder nanda with his vast knowledge
Dependent arising though deep appeared clear to the Elder nanda for four reasons
Four similes are given to illustrate this
 Bring it here
When it shakes its right fin it is said it stirs up the water in an area of  yojanas
In the ocean there is a fish called the Timirapingala yojanas long
similarly for its left fin
its tail and its head
his body  yojanas thick
his palms and soles  yojanas so too his mouth
and his head  yojanas
because he was endowed with decisive supporting conditions from the past because of his dwelling at fords  because he was a streamenterer and because he was highly learned
Dependent arising is deep in four respects because of its depth of meaning because of its depth of phenomena because of its depth of teaching and because of its depth of penetration
Its depth of phenomena the deep meaning of ignorance being a condition for volitional formations  the deep meaning of birth being a condition for aging and death
Its depth of teaching thus In some places in the suttas dependent arising is taught in forward order in some in reverse order in some in both forward and reverse order in some beginning from the middle in forward order or in reverse order or in both In some places three connections and four groups are taught in some two connections and three groups in some one connection and two groups
Its depth of penetration  Deep is the meaning of ignorance as not knowing not seeing and nonpenetration of the truths Deep is the meaning of volitional formations as volitionally forming accumulating lustfulness and lustlessness the meaning of consciousness as emptiness absence of an agent and manifestation of rebirthlinking without transmigration the meaning of mentalitymateriality as simultaneous arising separableness inseparableness bending and deformation the meaning of thesix sense bases as predominants the world doors fields and possession of objective domains the meaning of contact as contacting striking conjunction and encounter the meaning of feeling as the experiencing of the objects taste as being either pleasant painful or neutral as being soulless and as being felt the meaning of craving as seeking enjoymentattachment as being a stream a creeper a river and an oceanand as being insatiable the meaning of clinging as takinggrasping adherence misapprehension and being difficult to overcome the meaning of existence as accumulating volitionally forming and throwing beings into the different modes of origin destinations stations and abodes the meaning of birth as taking birth being born conceptiongeneration and manifestation and the meaning of aging and death as destruction falling away breakup and change
The intrinsic natures of these states such as ignoranceetc by the penetration of which these states themselves are penetrated through their essential characteristicsthose intrinsic natures are deep In this way the depth of penetration should be understood
All this the entire depth of dependent arising whichis briefly fourfold but in detail with numerous divisions appeared clear to the Elder nanda because he was endowed with the four factors mentioned above
Thus the Exalted Oneextolling him said Do not say so nanda
This is the purport nanda you have great wisdom and lucid knowledge Thus dependent arising though deep seems clear to you Therefore do not say Does it appear clear only to myself or to others as well 
Its depth of meaning the deep meaning of aging and death being originated and sustained with birth as condition  the deep meaning of volitional formations being originated and sustained with ignorance as condition
It was said  The Exalted One says Do not say sonanda   to restrain the Venerable nanda This is the purport nanda do not say to myself it seems as clear as clear can be
nanda if only nibbna is deep and the principle of conditionality is clear to you then why havent you uprooted four defilements the two gross fetters of sensual lust and aversion and the two gross underlying tendencies of sensual lust and aversion  and realized the fruit of a oncereturner
Why havent you uprooted eight defilements  the five subtle fetters of desire for finematerial and immaterial existence conceit restlessness and ignorance along with the underlying tendencies of desire for existence conceit and ignoranceand realized arahatship
Why didnt you fulfil the perfections for one incalculable period and  aeons and penetrate the knowledge of a chief disciple like Sriputta and Moggallna
Why didnt you fulfil the perfections for two incalculable periods and  aeons and penetrate the knowledge of a paccekabuddhas enlightenment
If this appears so completely clear to you then why didnt you fulfil the perfections for four eight or sixteen incalculable periods and  aeons and realize the omniscient knowledge like the Buddhas
Dont you have any use for these distinguished achievements See your mistake You a disciple possessing limited knowledge say of this extremely deep principle of conditionality It appears clear to me This statement of yours goes contrary to the explanation of the Buddhas It is not right for such a bhikkhu to say something going contrary to the explanation of the Buddhas
 nanda didnt I spend four incalculable periods and  aeons striving to penetrate this principle of conditionality
There is no gift that I did not give no perfection that I did not fulfil to penetrate the principle of conditionality
Resolved upon penetrating the principle of conditionality I dispersed the army of Mra as though it were powerless but even then the great earth did not move an inch It did not move in the first watch of the night when I recollected my past lives or in the middle watch of the night when I attained the divine eye
But in the last watch of the night at dawn as soon as I saw Ignorance is a condition for volitional formations through nine modes this ten thousandfold worldsystem sounding like a brass gong beaten by an iron rod let loose a hundred roars a thousand roars and it shook like a drop of water on a lotus leaf struck by the wind
So deep nanda is this dependent arising and so deep its appearance
This Dhamma is the Dhamma of conditions
 not penetrating  because of not penetrating it by way of the full understanding by scrutinization and the full understanding by abandoning
When weavers yarn which has been badly kept and gnawed by mice becomes tangled all over it is difficult to distinguish its beginning and end and to straighten it out from beginning to end Similarly beings have stumbled over the principle of conditionality they have become tangled and bewildered and are unable to straighten it out
However it is possible for a person to straighten out a tangled skein by relying on his own personal ability But except for the two kinds of bodhisattas those who will become paccekabuddhas and perfect Buddhas other beings are incapable of straightening out the principle of conditionality on their ownwithout the instructions of another
And as a tangled skein moistened with grease and worked over with a comb becomes clustered and knotted all over in the same way these beings who have stumbled over conditions and cannot set them straight become confused and bound up in knots over the sixtytwo views
For all those who rely on views are unable to straighten out the principle of conditionality
A knotted ball of thread is greased weavers thread
Both of these are tangled and difficult to straighten out from beginning to end The meaning may be interpreted by the method of the previous simile
like matted rushes and reeds These grasses are beaten and made into a rope
If one takes that rope when it has become old and has fallen somewhere it is difficult to distinguish the beginning and end of those grasses and to straighten them out from beginning to end
However it is possible for a person to straighten them out by relying on his own personal ability But except for the two kinds of bodhisattas other beings are incapable of straightening out the principle of conditionality on their own
Thus this generation being unable to straighten out the principle of conditionality has become like a ball of thread and does not pass beyond sasra with its plane of miseryunfortunate destinations and lower realms
All these are called the plane of misery because of the absence of the joy consisting in progress
Regarding sasra it is said
This generation does not pass beyond all that does not overcome it
But rather  it goes from death to rebirth and from rebirth to death Passing away and taking rebirthlinking over and over like a ship on the ocean driven by a storm or like an ox yoked to a millwheel it only revolves in the three realms of existence the four modes of origin the five destinations the seven stations of consciousness and the nine abodes of beings
If it seems as clear as clear can be to you then why didnt you become a streamenterer on your own instead of penetrating the path of streamentry only in dependence on the method given by me
Why havent you uprooted those same four defilements in their residual form and realized the fruit of anonreturner
 Because of not understanding  because of not understanding it by way of the full understanding of the known
Because of not understanding and not penetrating this Dhamma 
Become like a tangled skein 
Some say that the term signifies a birds nest
The plane of misery includes the hells the animal realmthe realm of afflicted spirits and the host of titans
the unfortunate destinations because they have gone to suffering
and the lower realmsbecause they have fallen from the heights of happiness
The succession of aggregates Elements and sense bases
Continuing uninterruptedThat is called sasra
The Exalted One it should be understood said all this to restrain the Venerable nanda
Now this sutta is bound together by two phrases This dependent arising nanda is deep and This generation has become like a tangled skein Therefore in order to show the depth of the principle of conditionality firstas the sequel to the phrase This dependent arising nandais deep the Buddha begins the teaching by saying nanda if one is asked Are aging and death due to a specific condition 
This is the meaning nanda if a wise person is asked Are aging and death due to a specific condition That is is there a condition for aging and death through which aging and death come to be  he should not remain silent or say This has not been explained by the Tathgata as he would if were asked a question to be set aside such as Are the soul and the body the same He should say unequivocallyThey are just as if he were asked whether the eye is eternal or noneternal he would say unequivocally It is noneternal
If he is further asked Through what condition is there aging and death What is that condition through which aging and death come to be  he should say With birth as condition there is aging and death
The same method applies to all the remaining cases 
With mentalitymateriality as condition there is contact When it is said  With the six sense bases as condition there is contact inclusion is made of only the six kinds of resultant contact that is eyecontact etc But here the Buddha wishes to show the distinct conditionally arisen whether or not they are included by the phrase With the six sense bases as condition there is contact and he also wishes to show a distinctive condition for contact different from the six sense bases Therefore he says With mentalitymateriality as condition there is contact
What has the Exalted One explained in this section of the sutta
He has explained the source of the conditions
Now to show the real undelusive invariable conditioning nature of the various conditions the Exalted One saysIt was said with birth as condition there is aging and death etc
Gods  gods by rebirth
Celestials deities dwelling in roots treetrunks etc
Demons  whatever beings are generated
All these words are synonyms for the reason 
For the reason is called cause because it comes forth in order to produce its effect the source 
Birth is a condition for aging and death under the heading of decisive support 
Therein sensesphere existence includes everything between the Avci hell as the lower limit and the gods who control the creations of others as the upper limit
But here existence should be interpreted as kammaexistence
Here clinging to sense pleasures is a condition for the three kinds of kammaexistence and also for the three kinds of rebirthexistence so too the remaining kinds of clinging Thus twentyfour kinds of existence have clinging as condition
But literally the twelve kinds of kammaexistence obtain here
The clingings are a condition for these under the heading of decisive support as well as under the heading of conascence 
Craving is a condition for clinging under the heading of conascence as well as under the heading of decisive support
Here resultant feeling is a condition for craving under the heading of decisive support the other in the other way too 
To this extent the Exalted One has shown the previous craving that becomes the root of the round Now as if striking someone on the back or grabbing him by the hair and pulling him away while he wails the Exalted One pulls the teaching down from its usual sequenceand speaks the present passage to show by way of nine terms obsessional craving 
Within that craving there are two kinds of craving acquisitive craving and possessive craving 
Acquisitive craving is the craving because of which one travels along rough and rugged paths seeking wealth
Possessive craving is the craving for those things which have been sought after and obtained
Both of these are designations for obsessional craving
Therefore this twofold craving arises in dependence upon feeling
Pursuit is the pursuit of objects such as visibleforms etc
Decisionmaking is fourfold by way of knowledge craving views and thought
Therein decisionmaking as knowledge is referred to in the passageOne should know how to decide on happiness Knowing how to decide on happiness one should be devoted to inner happiness 
Decisionmaking as views is the sixtytwo views
Since it is said Desire lord of gods has its source in thought  in this sutta here decisionmaking is intended as thought
For having gained something one thinks of it asdesirable or undesirable beautiful or ugly and then decidesThis much will be for visible forms this much for sounds etc This is for me this for others This I will use this I will keep
Thus it is said In dependence upon gain there is decisionmaking
Stinginess is unwillingness to share with others
Safeguarding is guarding well by locking ones door keeping things in a safe etc
the taking up of weapons is taking up a sword etc
Insulting speech is disrespectful speech
Now to show obsessional craving in reverse order in these sections the Buddha traces the teaching back
Therein  craving for sense pleasures is craving for visible forms etc which arises as lust for the five strands of sense pleasure
Craving for existence is desire accompanied by the eternalist view
These two phenomena being a duality converge into a unity in feeling These two phenomena craving which is a root of the round and obsessional craving
Being a duality though unified by their characteristic of craving they form two sections insofar as craving is both a root of the round and an obsession and through these they converge into a unity in feeling The meaning is they have a single condition in that they both occur with feeling as condition
Convergence is threefold convergence by descentconvergence by conascence and convergence by condition
with contact as condition there is feeling Eyecontact etc are all resultant contacts only
The mutually dissimilar intrinsic natures of feelingperception mental formations and consciousness are calledqualities 
They are also called traits becausewhen carefully looked at they betray the concealed meanings
This is the meaning here nanda when there are present those qualities traits signs and indicators through which there is a description of the mental body the mental group that is when there is present feelings quality trait and sign of being what is felt and its indicator feeling when there is present perceptions quality trait and sign of perceivingand its indicator perception when there is present the mental formations quality trait and sign of volition and their indicator volition when there is present consciousnesss quality trait and sign of cognizing and its indicator consciousnessthen there is a description of the mental body thus This is the mental body
But when the causes for the description of the mental bodythe quality etc of feelingetcare all absent would designationcontact be discerned in the material body
Designationcontact is synonymous with mindcontact  which arises in the minddoor taking as its basis the four mental aggregates Would that be discerned in the material body Would it arise taking as its basis one or another of the fivekinds of sensitive matter
 The Venerable nanda replies Certainly not venerable sir rejecting the arising of from the material body  just as one would the arising of a mango fruit from a roseapple tree when mango trees are absent
In this second question the terms qualities etcshould be understood to mean the quality trait and sign of deformation and the indicator material form
This third question is stated in terms of both
The Elder replies Certainly not venerable sir rejecting the arising of either of the two kinds of contact in the absence of mentalitymateriality just as one would the arising of mangoes and roseapples in space
Having shown the conditions for the two kinds of contact separately now the Exalted One poses the fourth question in order to show without making distinctions that mentalitymateriality is the condition for the two kinds of contact
This is the cause  and condition for contact namelymentalitymateriality The meaning is The mentalitymateriality occurring in the six doors this is the cause this is the condition for the two kinds of contact
For in the eyedoor the eye and visible form objects are materiality and the aggregates associatedwith contact are mentality the same holds with appropriate changes in regard to the other physical sense doors Thus this fivefold contact by way of eyecontact etc is still contact with mentalitymateriality as condition
In the minddoor too the heartbasis and any material object are materiality
the phenomena associated with contact and any immaterial object are mentality
Thus mindcontact too iscontact with mentalitymateriality as condition
if consciousness were not to descend into themothers womb  If after having entered it were not to occur by way of rebirthlinking
would mentalitymateriality take shape in the womb If there were no rebirthlinking consciousness would the remaining bare mentalitymateriality occur in the mothers womb taking shape by developing through the various embryonic stages
If after descending into the womb consciousness were to depart  If after descending by way of rebirthlinking it were to perish by way of death that is if it were to cease
This cessation does not come about through the ceasing of the rebirthlinking consciousness itself nor through the subsequent ceasing of the second and third 
For thirty kammaborn material phenomena are produced originating along with the rebirthlinking consciousness
While they endure sixteen moments of lifecontinuum consciousness arise and cease
This is called the period of safety
But if they cannot provide a condition the course of existence does not occur and the current does not continue This is called departing
and it was in reference to this that the Buddha said If after descending consciousness were to depart
This present state of being  the state of the complete five aggregates
If the consciousness of a young boy or girl were to be cut off would mentalitymateriality grow up develop and reach maturity The meaning is If consciousness were to be cut off would bare mentalitymateriality survive and grow up in the first period of life develop through the middle period and reach maturity in the last period
Would it grow up developand reach maturity through ten twenty a hundred or a thousand years
Therefore nanda this is the cause  and condition for mentalitymateriality namely consciousness Since consciousness itself is the condition when rebirthlinking takes place in the mothers womb during the stay in the womb at the time of leaving the womb and for tenyears and more during the course of existence therefore this is the cause this is the condition for mentalitymateriality namely consciousness
For consciousness is a condition for mentalitymateriality in the way a king restraining his retinuemight say Who was it that made you viceroy and you general Didnt I do so For if you could become a viceroy or general by yourself without my making you such then we would know your power
In the same way as it wereconsciousness might say to mentalitymateriality Who is it that made you mentality you materiality you mentalitymateriality Didnt I do so For if you could become mentality materiality or mentalitymateriality without myself having become a forerunner and taken rebirthlinking in the mothers womb then we would know your power
Consciousness is a condition for mentalitymateriality in many ways
Therefore nanda this is the cause  and condition for consciousness namely mentalitymateriality
 in the way a kings officers restraining the king might say Who was it that made you king Didnt we do so If you could become king alone without one of us occupying the position of viceroy another the position of general then we would see what kind of king you are In the same way as it were mentalitymateriality might say to consciousness Who is it that made you the rebirthlinking consciousness Didnt we do so If you could become a rebirthlinking consciousness without the support of the other three mental aggregates and the heartbasis then we would see what kind of rebirthlinking consciousness you are
Mentalitymateriality is a condition for consciousness in many ways
When consciousness is a condition for mentalitymateriality when mentalitymateriality is a condition for consciousness when the two occur as conditions for one another it is by this much that one can be born  pass away and rearise that birth etc or repeated death and rebirthlinking can be discerned
To this extent that there is a pathway for designation etc A pathway for designation  a pathway for an expression used through the application of a mere word regardless of meaning as in the case of names such as Sirivahaka Dhanavahaka etc
A pathway for language  a pathway for an expression used with reference to a reason thus one is called mindful because one has mindfulness or clearly comprehending because one clearly comprehends
A pathway for description  a pathway for an expression used to communicate through diverse aspects thus wise clever intelligent subtle proficient etc
A sphere for wisdom  that which is to be encompassed by wisdom that which can be known
The round turns the round of sasra turns
This present state of being this is a name for the five aggregates
For describing for the sake of describing by names
That is when there is mentalitymateriality together with consciousness what is meant is to the extent that mentalitymateriality and consciousness occur as conditions for one another
For this sutta is called The Great Discourse on Causation because it is explained to disentagle and unravel conditions
Spirits nonhuman beings
because it brings forth its effect as if commanding come and take it
theorigin  because the effect originates from it and the condition  because the effect occurs in dependence upon it
That is the method of interpretation in regard to rebirthexistence
for this is a condition for birth under the heading of decisive support
Gain is the obtaining of such objects for that occurs when there is pursuit
Decisionmaking as craving is the hundred and eight reflections due to craving 
Desire and lust because of unwholesome thoughtsweak and strong lust arises towards the object thought aboutThis here is craving
Desire is a weak form of lust
Attachment is strong conviction of Iand mine
Possessiveness is taking possession by way of craving and views
The taking up of clubs is taking up a club to restrain others
Conflicts may be bodily or verbal
quarrels come first
and disputes afterwards
craving for nonexistence desire accompanied by the annihilationist view
Convergence by descent is referred to in the passage All these converge upon sense pleasures 
convergence by conascence in the passage These phenomena friend arerooted in desire originate from contact and converge upon feeling 
convergence by condition in the present passage being a duality converge into a unity in feeling
Excepting the four supramundane resultant contacts the remainder number thirtytwo
Herein contact is a condition for feeling in many ways
signs  because they are causes forperceiving particular things
and indicators because they are to be indicated in particular ways
Impingementcontact is the contact which arises taking as its basis the impingent aggregate of material form
Here the Elder nanda replies Certainly not venerable sir rejecting the arising of from the mental body just as one would the arising of a roseapple fruit from a mango tree when roseapple trees are absent
Mentalitymateriality is a condition for this contact in many ways
During this timeduring these sixteen moments of consciousness there is no obstacle to the child who has taken rebirthlinking or to the mother
If the material phenomena originating along with the rebirthlinking consciousness can provide a condition for the seventeenth lifecontinuum consciousness the course of existence occurs and the current continues
These three terms refer to the aggregates which become the basis for designationlanguage and description
for the description by the names feeling perception etc The meaning is the five aggregates too are discerned to this extent
This statement refers back 
 the Exalted One has shown the sequel to the phrase This dependent arising nanda is deep and appears deep He now undertakes the present teaching beginning with the ways of describing self in order to show the sequel to the phrase This generation has become like a tangled skein
One who gains different kasias sometimes describes it as blue sometimes as yellow etc
Therein nanda among these four theorists
This is said by way of annihilationism
There in the future  there in the world beyond in the future as everexistent and imperishable
This is said by way of eternalism
The eternalist toothinks The self which the annihilationist posits as noneternal is not thus I will convert him to the way it really is eternal I will make him understand his annihilationism and cause him to accept eternalism
This being so in the case of one describing self as having material form and limited
A settled view as having material form and limited underlies this this view does not underlie this like a vine or creeper
To this extent sixteen kinds of theorists have been shown four who gain meditative attainments their respective disciples four rationalists and their respective disciples
Therein one who apprehends the unextended kasia sign as self describes self as having material form and as limited
One who apprehends the extended kasia sign as self describes self as having material form and as infinite
he describes self as infinite and immaterial
One who removes the unextended kasia sign and apprehends as self either the area that had been covered by the sign or the four mental aggregates occurring there or from among these mere consciousness
In the present  now only not afterwards
The third position shows their dispute
For the annihilationist thinks The self which the eternalist posits as not subject to annihilation is not thus I will convert him to the way it really is subject to annihilation I will make him understand his eternalism and cause him to accept annihilationism
it underlies this in the sense that it has not been abandoned
Having thus shown those who describe self the Buddha speaks the present section to show those who do not describe self
Who do not describe self
All noble individuals firstly do not describe self
Then those who are highly learned  one who is a master of three Pitakas two Pitakas one Pitaka or even the studious expounder of the Dhamma who has thoroughly discriminated one Nikya as well as one who has undertaken insightthey do not describe self
They know that the counterpart sign of the kasia is only a counterpart sign
and that the immaterial aggregates are only immaterial aggregates
Now those who describe self describe it after considering it by way of views and their consideration comes about because they have not abandoned personality view with its twenty cases Therefore the Exalted One speaks the present section to show personality view with its twenty cases
 Considers Feeling as Self  By this personality view based on the aggregate of feeling is explained
My self is without experience of feeling This is personality view based on the aggregate of material form
My self feels for my self is subject to feeling This is personality view based on the aggregates of perception mental formations and consciousness
For these aggregates feel because they are associated with feeling
The phenomenon of feeling belongs to them and cannot be dissociated from them
Now the Exalted One shows the errors therein in the three theorists
On the occasion when one experiences a pleasant feelingetc The passage beginning with these words is stated in order to show the error  For whatever feeling one considers as self it follows that self is sometimes present and sometimes absent
Pleasant feeling is impermanent  subject to destructionetc Impermanent because of not existing after having been
Conditioned made by several causes which have joined together which have come together
Dependently arisen arisen rightly only through a cause in dependence on several conditions
Destruction etc all these terms are synonyms for dissolution
For whatever breaks up also is destroyed falls away fades out and ceases
My Self has disappeared The meaning is My self has departed my self has ceased
Query Can one and the same person think at three different times This is my self Reply Why not
For the theorist is not consistent but wavers like a stump planted in a heap of chaff Like a monkey in the forest he lets go of one thing and takes hold of another
Impermanent a mixture of pleasure and pain and subject to arising and falling away If he makes a distinction and considers a particular kind of feeling to be self he considers as self something which is impermanent and pleasant painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant If he considers feeling in general to be self without making distinctions he considers as self something which is a mixture and subject to arising and falling away
For feeling is threefold and subject to arising and falling away and the theorist considers that threefold feeling taken collectively to be self
Thus he commits the error of accepting an impermanent self and the arising of many feelings at a single moment
But an impermanent self is not allowed and there is no arising of many feelings at a single moment
It is in reference to this that the Exalted One says Therefore nanda because of this it is not acceptable to considerFeeling is my self
Where there is nothing at all that is felt in the bare aggregate of material form
The meaning is Can the egoconception I am arise in that which is devoid of feeling such as a palmleaf fan or a window panel
 Since the bare aggregate of material form does not rise up and say I am it is not acceptable 
could I am this occur there The meaning is Among those three aggregates subject to feeling would there be even one phenomenon which could be spoken of thus I am this
 Or else When through the cessation of feeling those three aggregates have ceased along with feelingcould I am or I am this arise
 The Venerable nanda rejecting this like the sharpness of a hares horn says Certainly not venerable sir
What has been explained so far
The round of existence has been explained
For the Exalted One sometimes explains the round under the heading of ignorance sometimes under the heading of craving and sometimes under the heading of views
Therein in the passage Bhikkhus no first point of ignorance is discerned  Before this there was no ignorance afterwards it came into being
In the passage Bhikkhus no first point of the craving for existence is discerned Before this there was no craving for existence afterwards it came into being
In the passageBhikkhus no first point of the view of existence is discernedof which it could be said Before this there was no view of existence afterwards it came into being
For the theorist having taken pleasant feeling etc to be self misapprehends them through egoconceptions and conceptions of mine because of this passing away and rearising from one state to another in all the realms of existencemodes of origin destinations stations for consciousness and abodes of beings he continually and constantly revolves like a ship on the ocean driven by a storm unable to lift his head out from the round
nanda when a Bhikkhu does not consider feeling as self etc Having so far explained the round in terms of the theorist who is confused about the principle of conditionalityin this section the Exalted One explains the ending of the round
To explain the ending of the round he does not refer to a distracted person who has dropped his meditation subject because of some new work project etc rather through his skilfulness in teaching he undertakes the exposition by way of a practitioner dwelling in the foundations of mindfulness Thus he says When a bhikkhu does not consider feeling as self etc
Such a bhikkhu does not consider feeling or anything else as self because he has proceeded among all phenomena by means of exploration knowledge in the way described thus Whatever material form there ispastpresent or future internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or nearhe defines all material form as impermanent this is one exploration
He defines it as suffering this is one exploration
He defines it as nonself this is one exploration etc  Not considering in such a way he does not cling toa nything in the world that is among the phenomena such as material form etc belonging to the world of the aggregatesetc he does not cling to even one thing as self or as belonging to self
Not clinging he is not agitated He is not agitated by the agitations of craving views or conceit
He personally attains nibbna he himself attains nibbna through the extinguishing of the defilements
Destroyed is birth etc this is said to show the reviewing knowledge that occurs to one who has attained nibbna
nanda if anyone should say of a bhikkhu whose mind has been thus liberated  that would not be proper
for what reason
 someone might say of him The arahat does not know anything But it would not be correct to say of an arahat who is liberated through knowledge that he does not know anything
Thus at the end of the four alternatives it is said For what reason etc
Because the bhikkhu is liberated by directly knowing thisetc The extent of designation designation is a term for expression 
The extent of the pathway for designation as far as there are aggregates sense bases or elements
This method applies to the other cases 
The sphere for wisdom the five aggregates which are to be encompassed by wisdom
What has been shown so far by the Exalted One
The sequel to the phrase like a tangled skein has been shown
Nevertheless ignorance has a specific condition the round is explained under the heading of ignorance
of which it could be said 
Nevertheless the craving for existence has as pecific condition the round is explained under the heading of craving
of which it could be said 
Nevertheless the view of existence has a specific condition the round is explained under the heading of views
Here too the round is explained under the heading of views
Now the person spoken of as not describing self as he goes along eventually becomes one liberated in both ways
There are nanda Seven stations for consciousness and two bases Seven is stated by way of rebirthlinking
Station for consciousness this is a foothold for consciousness
Two bases two dwelling places
Why is all this included
In order to exhaustively survey the round of existence
For the round is not exhaustively surveyed either by the stations for consciousness alone or by the bases alone as it is by way of the realms of existence modes of origin destinations and abodes of beings Therefore all this is included
To analyze the meaning in order he asks What are the seven 
Human beings are mentioned as an example
For among the countless human beings in countless world systems there are not even two who are exactly the same incomplexion figure etc
For these may have bodies that are blue yellow etc
Some beings in the lower realms such beings as the female spirits Uttaramt Piyakaramt PhussamittDhammagutt etc and other spirits who live in places outside the four planes of misery
For their bodies are of diverse colours shapes and sizes and like humans their perception may be doublerooted triplerooted or rootless
But unlike the gods they are not powerful they are powerless like lowclass humans They have trouble finding food and clothing and live oppressed by pain
Some are afflicted during the dark fortnight and happy during the bright fortnight Therefore because they have fallen from the heights of happiness they are called beings in the lower realms
Those among them who are triplerooted can achieve comprehension of the Dhamma Thus one time at daybreakthe female spirit Piyakaramt heard the Elder Anuruddhareciting the Dhamma and said 
Do not make a sound Piyakara This bhikkhu is reciting passages of Dhamma
Perhaps we can learn those passages And practise for our true welfare
We should refrain from harming beings And should not tell conscious lies
We should train ourselves in virtue To be freed from the goblin realm 
Uttaramt became a streamenterer after hearing the Dhamma from the Exalted One
Beings who are diverse in body but identical in perceptionsuch as the gods of the Brahmorder who are generated through the first  The gods of the Brahmorder the gods of Brahms retinue the gods of Brahms ministryand the great Brahms
All these are generated through the first jhna
Among these the gods of Brahms retinue are generated through a limited  their lifespan is a third of an aeon
The gods of Brahms ministry are generated through a middling  their lifespan is half an aeon and their bodies are more pervasive than the gods of Brahms retinue
The great Brahms are generated through a superior  their lifespan is an aeon and their bodies are extremely pervasive
Thus since their bodies are diverse but their perceptions identical by way of the first jhna they are described as beings who are diverse in body but identical in perception
The beings in the four planes of misery are similar
Yet for all the perception is a rootless unwholesome resultant
Thus the beings in the planes of misery are also reckoned as diverse in body but identical in perception
Beings who are identical in body but diverse in perceptionsuch as the gods of streaming radiance The gods of streaming radiance their radiance streams forth from their bodies flying out after flickering again and again like the flame of a torch
Those who are reborn as a result of developing the second and third jhnas of the fivefold system to a limited extent become gods of limited radiance  their lifespan is two aeons
Those who are reborn as a result of developing to a superior extent become gods of streaming radiance their lifespan is eight aeons
By mentioning the most excellent  all three are included here
For all these gods have bodies that are identical in pervasion but their perception is diverse in that some have without applied thought but with sustained thought while some have without either applied thought or sustained thought
beings who are identical in body and identical in perception such as the gods of refulgent beauty The gods of refulgent beauty they are a single mass of beauty the beauty of their bodily aura
Unlike the gods of streaming radiance their aura is emitted without flickering
The gods of limited beauty of immeasurable beauty  and of refulgent beauty are generated into these states by developing the fourth jhna of the fivefold system to a limited middlingand superior extent respectively their respective lifespans are sixteen thirtytwo and sixtyfour aeons
Thus they areidentical in body and also through the perception pertaining to the fourth jhna  identical in perception
The nonpercipient beings not having consciousness are not included here but they are included among the abodes of beings
The gods of the pure abodes pertaining to the ending of the round do not always exist They do not arise in the world when it is devoid of Buddhas even for  aeons or for an incalculable period
They arise only when Buddhas have arisen during a period of  aeons These planes are like a special campground of the Exalted One after he has set in motion the wheel of Dhamma
The meaning of the other stations is explained in the Visuddhimagga
Therein nanda if one understands the first station for consciousness etcCY Its origin one understands its origin by the method through the origination of ignorance material form originates etc
This method of interpretation should be applied to all the other stations for consciousness
But where there is no material form the origin should be interpreted by way of the four mental aggregates only and where there is no consciousness it should be interpreted by way of the one aggregate
nanda when a bhikkhu  is liberated through nonclinging then he is called a bhikkhu liberated by wisdom He is liberated by not grasping anything through the four kinds of clinging
Liberated by wisdom
This type is fivefold the dryinsight meditator and those who attain arahatship after having become established in one or another of the four jhnas
It is said Who is the individual liberated by wisdom
Herein some individual does not dwell suffusing the eight emancipations with the body but having seen with wisdom his cankers are destroyed This individual is calledone liberated by wisdom  
And the person spoken of as not considering self as he goes along eventually becomes one liberated by wisdom
To show the outcomes and names for these two bhikkhus the Exalted One undertakes the sections beginning with the one on the seven stations for consciousness
for the word base here means a dwelling place
Some gods the gods of the six sensesphere heavens
The rebirthlinking perception of humans may be triplerooteddoublerooted or rootless therefore they are said to bediverse in perception
Therefore human beings are said to be diverse in body
Sometimes twins might have the same complexion or figure but they can still be distinguished by the way they look ahead look aside speak smile walk stand etc
and their perception may be triplerooted or doublerooted though not rootless
Having spoken thus to her little son she attained the fruit of streamentry that same day
For these beings are of varying sizes and appearances
Those who are reborn as a result of developing to a middling extent become gods of immeasurable radiance  their lifespan is four aeons
The gods of abundant fruit are also assigned to the fourth station for consciousness
thus they are not assigned to either the stations for consciousness or the abodes of beings
The base of neither perception nor nonperception is included among the bases but not among the stations for consciousness for like perception this consciousness is so subtle that it is called neither consciousness nor nonconsciousness
Its passing away one understands its passing away by the method through the cessation ofignorance material form ceases etc 
Its satisfaction one understands its satisfaction thusThe pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on material form  consciousness this is the satisfaction in consciousness
Its unsatisfactoriness one understands its unsatisfactoriness thus That material form  consciousness is impermanent suffering and subject to change this is the unsatisfactoriness in consciousness
The escape from it one understands the escape from it thus The removal and abandoning of desire and lust for material form consciousness this is the escape from consciousness 
But is it possible revered Nāgasena to point to the Buddha and say that he is either here or there
Thus here the passage should be interpreted with the phrases through the origination of nutriment and through the cessation of nutriment
Make a simile
having brought about the future nonoccurrence of the mental body and the material body he is liberated solely by the power of wisdom without realizing the eight emancipations
for Dhamma sire was taught by the Blessed One
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
is it proper for one to seek enjoyment in it Is it right for that bhikkhu to seek enjoyment in that station for consciousness as I or mine by way of cravingconceit or views
Having thus shown the outcome and name for the first bhikkhu the Exalted One explains the eight emancipations in order to show the outcome and name for the other one
In what sense are they emancipations
In the sense of releasing 
And in what sense are they releasing
In the sense of freeing thoroughly from the adverse phenomena and in the sense of freeing thoroughly by way of delight in the object What is meant is occurrence on the object without constraint free from apprehensionsimilar to the way a little boy sleeps in his fathers lap his body completely relaxed
But the latter meaning applies only to the first seven emancipations not to the last one
Here the material form is the finematerialsphere jhna aroused through a blue kasia etcusing as the blue kasia etc something internal such as the hairs of the head etc One having that material form is one possessing material form 
 sees material forms with the eye of jhna one also sees material forms such as the blue kasia etc externally
One not perceiving material forms internally sees material forms externally This means that he does not arouse the finematerialsphere jhnas on his own head hairs etc
By this the finematerialsphere jhnas are shown for someone who does the preparatory work externally and arouses jhnas only externally
One is released upon the idea of the beautiful By this are shown the jhnas attained through very pure colour kasias
In the meditative absorption itself there is no concern with the idea of the beautiful But because one who dwells in meditation taking as his object a pure and beautiful kasia can be described as released upon the idea of the beautiful the teaching is expounded in those words
In the Paisambhidmagga however it is said  One is released upon the idea of the beautifulhow is this an emancipation
Herein a bhikkhu dwells pervading one direction etc with a mind endowed with lovingkindnessthrough the development of lovingkindness beings are not repulsive to him
So too for compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity
Such is the emancipation One is released upon the idea of the beautiful  
Everything that has to be said about the immaterial emancipations has already been said in the Visuddhimagga 
The eighth emancipation is the highest emancipation since it is completely purified and liberated from the four aggregates
In forward order from the beginning to the end
In reverse order from the end back to the beginning
In both forward and reverse order this is said with reference to his cruising back and forth through the attainments without stopping  a result of his great proficiency
Whenever he wants signifies place in whatever place he wishes
In whatever way he wants signifies the attainment whichever attainmen the wishes
As long as he wants signifies the length of time for as long a period of time as he wishes
Liberated in both ways  liberated through two portions and liberated from two portions Through the immaterial attainments he is liberated from the material body and through the path he is liberated from the mental body
It is said
The one liberated in both ways is five fold those who attain arahatship after emerging from one or another of the immaterial attainments and the one who having been anonreturner attains arahatship after emerging from cessation
Some say Since the fourth finematerialsphere jhna has two factors and is associated with equanimity it is just like an immaterial jhna
Therefore one who attains arahatship after emerging from the fourth finematerialsphere jhna is also liberated in both ways
This question of the one liberated in both ways was raised in the Bronze Palace and a decision was reached after a long time in reliance upon the explanation of the Elder Tipiaka Ca Sumana
In the Giri Vihra it is said a pupil of the Elder heard the question from the mouth of an almswandering monk and said Friend before our teacher explained this matter in the Bronze Palace no one knew the answer
 He said that even though the fourth jhna of the finematerialsphere has two factors is accompanied by equanimity and suppresses the defilements it still operates in proximate range to the defilements in the field for their growth
For in fiveconstituent existence the defilements assail the mind with the decisive support of a object such as the colour blue etc and the finematerialsphere jhna does not surmount such objects
Having said this he quoted the sutta Who is the individual liberated in both ways
Herein some individual dwells suffusing the eight emancipations with the body and having seen with wisdom his cankers are destroyed This individual is called one liberated in both ways 
By this the four finematerialsphere jhnas are shown for a person who arouses jhna through the kasias based on internal objects
As a flame struck by a gust of wind 
Reaches its end and can be reckoned no more
So the sage liberated from the mental body
Reaches his end and can be reckoned no more 
What did the Elder say venerable sir
Therefore liberated in both ways signifies one who attains arahatship after completely turning away from material form and suppressing the defilements by means of an immaterial jhna
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Exalted One was living among the Kurus where there was a town of the Kurus named Kammāsadhamma
Then the Venerable nanda approached the Exalted One paid homage to him and sat down to one side
Seated he said to the Exalted One It is wonderful and marvellous venerable sir
how this dependent arising is so deep and appears so deep yet to myself it seems as clear as clear can be
Do not say so nanda Do not say so nanda
This dependent arising nanda is deep and it appears deep
Because of not understanding and not penetrating this Dhamma nanda this generation has become like a tangled skein like a knotted ball of thread like matted rushes and reeds and does not pass beyond saṃsāra with its plane of misery unfortunate destinations and lower realms
nanda if one is asked Are aging and death due to a specific condition  one should say They are
If one is asked Through what condition is there aging and death  one should say With birth as condition there is aging and death
nanda if one is asked Is birth due to a specific condition  one should say It is
If one is asked Through what condition is there birth one should say With existence as condition there is birth
nanda if one is asked Is existence due to a specific condition  one should say It is
If one is asked Through what condition is there existence  one should say With clinging as condition there is existence
nanda if one is asked Is clinging due to a specific condition  one should say It is
If one is asked Through what condition is there clinging  one should say With craving as condition there is clinging
nanda if one is asked Is craving due to a specific condition  one should say It is
If one is asked Through what condition is there craving  one should say With feeling as condition there is craving
nanda if one is asked Is feeling due to a specific condition  one should say It is
If one is asked Through what condition is there feeling  one should say With contact as condition there is feeling
nanda if one is asked Is contact due to a specific condition  one should say It is
If one is asked Through what condition is there contact  one should say With mentalitymateriality as condition there is contact
nanda if one is asked Is mentalitymateriality due to a specific condition  one should say It is
If one is asked Through what condition is there mentalitymateriality  one should say With consciousness as condition there is mentalitymateriality
nanda if one is asked Is consciousness due to a specific condition  one should say It is
If one is asked Through what condition is there consciousness one should say With mentalitymateriality as condition there is consciousness
Thus nanda with mentalitymateriality as condition there is consciousness with consciousness as condition there is mentalitymateriality with mentalitymateriality as condition there is contact with contact as condition there is feeling with feeling as condition there is craving with craving as condition there is clinging with clinging as condition there is existence with existence as condition there is birth and with birth as condition aging and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair come to be
Such is the origin of this entire mass of suffering
It was said With birth as condition there is aging and death How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If there were absolutely and utterly no birth of any kind anywherethat is of gods into the state of gods of celestials into the state of celestials of spirits demons human beings quadrupeds winged creatures and reptiles each into their own stateif there were no birth of beings of any sort into any state
then in the complete absence of birth with the cessation of birth would aging and death be discerned
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for aging and death namely birth
It was said With existence as condition there is birth How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If there were absolutely and utterly no existence of any kind anywherethat is no sensesphere existence finematerial existence or immaterial existencethen in the complete absence of existence with the cessation of existence would birth be discerned
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for birth namely existence
It was said With clinging as condition there is existence How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If there were absolutely and utterly no clinging of any kind anywherethat is no clinging to sense pleasures clinging to views clinging to precepts and observances or clinging to a doctrine of selfthen in the complete absence of clinging with the cessation of clinging would existence be discerned
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for existence namely clinging
It was said With craving as condition there is clinging How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If there were absolutely and utterly no craving of any kind anywherethat is no craving for visible forms craving for sounds craving for smells craving for tastes craving for tangibles or craving for mental objectsthen in the complete absence of craving with the cessation of craving would clinging be discerned
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for clinging namely craving
It was said With feeling as condition there is craving How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If there were absolutely and utterly no feeling of any kind anywherethat is no feeling born of eyecontact feeling born of earcontact feeling born of nosecontact feeling born of tonguecontact feeling born of bodycontact or feeling born of mindcontactthen in the complete absence of feeling with the cessation of feeling would craving be discerned
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for craving namely feeling
Thus nanda in dependence upon feeling there is craving in dependence upon craving there is pursuit in dependence upon pursuit there is gain in dependence upon gain there is decisionmaking in dependence upon decisionmaking there is desire and lust in dependence upon desire and lust there is attachment in dependence upon attachment there is possessiveness in dependence upon possessiveness there is stinginess in dependence upon stinginess there is safeguarding
It was said Because of safeguarding various evil unwholesome phenomena originatethe taking up of clubs and weapons conflicts quarrels and disputes insulting speech slander and falsehoods How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If there were absolutely and utterly no safeguarding of any kind anywhere then in the complete absence of safeguarding with the cessation of safeguarding would those various evil unwholesome phenomena originate
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for those various evil unwholesome phenomena namely safeguarding
It was said In dependence upon stinginess there is safeguarding How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If there were absolutely and utterly no stinginess of any kind anywhere then in the complete absence of stinginess with the cessation of stinginess would safeguarding be discerned
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for safeguarding namely stinginess
It was said In dependence upon possessiveness there is stinginess How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If there were absolutely and utterly no possessiveness of any kind anywhere then in the complete absence of possessiveness with the cessation of possessiveness would stinginess be discerned
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for stinginess namely possessiveness
It was said In dependence upon attachment there is possessiveness How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If there were absolutely and utterly no attachment of any kind anywhere then in the complete absence of attachment with the cessation of attachment would possessiveness be discerned
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for possessiveness namely attachment
It was said In dependence upon desire and lust there is attachment How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If there were absolutely and utterly no desire and lust of any kind anywhere then in the complete absence of desire and lust with the cessation of desire and lust would attachment be discerned
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for attachment namely desire and lust
It was said In dependence upon decisionmaking there is desire and lust How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If there were absolutely and utterly no decisionmaking of any kind anywhere then in the complete absence of decisionmaking with the cessation of decisionmaking would desire and lust be discerned
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for desire and lust namely decisionmaking
It was said In dependence upon gain there is decisionmaking How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If there were absolutely and utterly no gain of any kind anywhere then in the complete absence of gain with the cessation of gain would decisionmaking be discerned
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for decisionmaking namely gain
It was said In dependence upon pursuit there is gain How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If there were absolutely and utterly no pursuit of any kind anywhere then in the complete absence of pursuit with the cessation of pursuit would gain be discerned
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for gain namely pursuit
It was said In dependence upon craving there is pursuit How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If there were absolutely and utterly no craving of any kind anywherethat is no craving for sense pleasures craving for existence or craving for nonexistencethen in the complete absence of craving with the cessation of craving would pursuit be discerned
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for pursuit namely craving
Thus nanda these two phenomena being a duality converge into a unity in feeling
It was said With contact as condition there is feeling How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If there were absolutely and utterly no contact of any kind anywherethat is no eyecontact earcontact nosecontact tonguecontact bodycontact or mindcontactthen in the complete absence of contact with the cessation of contact would feeling be discerned
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for feeling namely contact
It was said With mentalitymateriality as condition there is contact How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
If those qualities traits signs and indicators through which there is a description of the mental body were all absent would designationcontact be discerned in the material body
Certainly not venerable sir
If those qualities traits signs and indicators through which there is a description of the material body were all absent would impingementcontact be discerned in the mental body 
Certainly not venerable sir
If those qualities traits signs and indicators through which there is a description of the mental body and the material body were all absent would either designationcontact or impingementcontact be discerned 
Certainly not venerable sir
If those qualities traits signs and indicators through which there is a description of mentalitymateriality were all absent would contact be discerned 
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for contact namely mentalitymateriality
It was said With consciousness as condition there is mentalitymateriality
How that is so nanda should be understood in this way If consciousness were not to descend into the mothers womb would mentalitymateriality take shape in the womb
 Certainly not venerable sir
If after descending into the womb consciousness were to depart would mentalitymateriality be generated into this present state of being 
Certainly not venerable sir
If the consciousness of a young boy or girl were to be cut off would mentalitymateriality grow up develop and reach maturity 
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for mentalitymateriality namely consciousness
It was said With mentalitymateriality as condition there is consciousness How that is so nanda should be understood in this way
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda this is the cause source origin and condition for consciousness namely mentalitymateriality
It is to this extent nanda that one can be born age and die pass away and rearise
Certainly not venerable sir
and because of safeguarding various evil unwholesome phenomena originatethe taking up of clubs and weapons conflicts quarrels and disputes insulting speech slander and falsehoods
If consciousness were not to gain a footing in mentalitymateriality would an origination of the mass of sufferingof future birth aging and deathbe discerned 
to this extent that there is a pathway for designation to this extent that there is a pathway for language to this extent that there is a pathway for description to this extent that there is a sphere for wisdom to this extent that the round turns for describing this state of being that is when there is mentalitymateriality together with consciousness
In what ways nanda does one describing self describe it
Describing self as having material form and as limited one describes it thus My self has material form and is limited
Therein nanda one who describes self as having material form and as limited
either describes such a self in the present or he describes such a self there in the future or he thinks That which is not thus I will convert towards the state of being thus
either describes such a self in the present or he describes such a self there in the future or he thinks That which is not thus I will convert towards the state of being thus
One who describes self as immaterial and infinite
It is in these ways nanda that one describing self describes it
Or describing self as having material form and as infinite one describes it thus My self has material form and is infinite
Or describing self as immaterial and limited one describes it thus My self is immaterial and limited
Or describing self as immaterial and infinite one describes it thus My self is immaterial and infinite
either describes such a self in the present or he describes such a self there in the future or he thinks That which is not thus I will convert towards the state of being thus
This being so it can aptly be said that a settled view as having material form and as limited underlies this
One who describes self as having material form and as infinite
This being so it can aptly be said that a settled view as having material form and as infinite underlies this
One who describes self as immaterial and limited
This being so it can aptly be said that a settled view as immaterial and limited underlies this

This being so it can aptly be said that a settled view as immaterial and infinite underlies this
In what ways nanda does one not describing self not describe it
Not describing self as having material form and as limited one does not describe it thus My self has material form and is limited
Therein nanda one who does not describe self as having material form and as limited
One who does not describe self as having material form and as infinite
One who does not describe self as immaterial and limited
One who describes self as immaterial and infinite
It is in these ways nanda that one not describing self does not describe it
Or not describing self as having material form and as infinite one does not describe it thus My self has material form and is infinite
Or not describing self as immaterial and limited one does not describe it thus My self is immaterial and limited
Or not describing self as immaterial and infinite one does not describe it thus My self is immaterial and infinite
does not describe such a self in the present nor does he describe such a self there in the future nor does he think That which is not thus I will convert towards the state of being thus
This being so it can aptly be said that a settled view as having material form and as limited does not underlie this
does not describe such a self in the present nor does he describe such a self there in the future nor does he think That which is not thus I will convert towards the state of being thus
This being so it can aptly be said that a settled view as having material form and as infinite does not underlie this
does not describe such a self in the present nor does he describe such a self there in the future nor does he think That which is not thus I will convert towards the state of being thus
This being so it can aptly be said that a settled view as immaterial and limited does not underlie this
does not describe such a self in the present nor does he describe such a self there in the future nor does he think That which is not thus I will convert towards the state of being thus
This being so it can aptly be said that a settled view as immaterial and infinite does not underlie this
In what ways nanda does one considering self consider it
One considering self either considers feeling as self saying Feeling is my self
Or he considers Feeling is not my self but my self is not without experience of feeling My self feels for my self is subject to feeling
Therein nanda the one who says Feeling is my self should be asked Friend there are these three kinds of feelingpleasant feeling painful feeling and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
Of these three kinds of feeling which do you consider as self 
nanda on the occasion when one experiences a pleasant feeling one does not on that same occasion experience a painful feeling or a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling on that occasion one experiences only a pleasant feeling
On the occasion when one experiences a painful feeling one does not on that same occasion experience a pleasant feeling or a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling on that occasion one experiences only a painful feeling
On the occasion when one experiences a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling one does not on that same occasion experience a pleasant feeling or a painful feeling on that occasion one experiences only a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
nanda pleasant feeling is impermanent conditioned dependently arisen subject to destruction falling away fading out and ceasing
Painful feeling is impermanent conditioned dependently arisen subject to destruction falling away fading out and ceasing
Neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling is impermanent conditioned dependently arisen subject to destruction falling away fading out and ceasing
If when experiencing a pleasant feeling one thinks This is my self
Thus one who says Feeling is my self considers as self something which even here and now is impermanent a mixture of pleasure and pain and subject to arising and falling away
Therefore nanda because of this it is not acceptable to consider Feeling is my self
nanda the one who says Feeling is not my self my self is without experience of feelinghe should be asked Friend where there is nothing at all that is felt could the idea I am occur there 
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda because of this it is not acceptable to consider Feeling is not my self my self is without experience of feeling
nanda the one who says Feeling is not my self but my self is not without experience of feeling My self feels for my self is subject to feeling
he should be asked Friend if feeling were to cease absolutely and utterly without remainder
Certainly not venerable sir
Therefore nanda because of this it is not acceptable to consider Feeling is not my self but my self is not without experience of feeling My self feels for my self is subject to feeling
nanda when a bhikkhu does not consider feeling as self and does not consider self as without experience of feeling and does not consider My self feels for my self is subject to feeling
then being without such considerations he does not cling to anything in the world Not clinging he is not agitated Not being agitated he personally attains nibbāna He understands Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no returning to this state of being
or that he holds the view A Tathāgata does not exist after deaththat would not be proper
For what reason
Because that bhikkhu is liberated by directly knowing this the extent of designation and the extent of the pathway for designation the extent of language and the extent of the pathway for language the extent of description and the extent of the pathway for description the extent of wisdom and the extent of the sphere for wisdom the extent of the round and the extent to which the round turns To say of a bhikkhu who is liberated by directly knowing this that he holds the view One does not know and does not seethat would not be proper
Or he considers Feeling is not my self my self is without experience of feeling
then with the ceasing of that pleasant feeling one thinks My self has disappeared
If when experiencing a painful feeling one thinks This is my self
then with the ceasing of that painful feeling one thinks My self has disappeared
If when experiencing a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling one thinks This is my self
then with the ceasing of that neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling one thinks My self has disappeared
then in the complete absence of feeling with the cessation of feeling could I am this occur there 
nanda if anyone should say of a bhikkhu whose mind has been thus liberated that he holds the view A Tathāgata exists after deaththat would not be proper
or that he holds the view A Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after deaththat would not be proper
or that he holds the view A Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after deaththat would not be proper
nanda there are these seven stations for consciousness and two bases
What are the seven
There are nanda beings who are diverse in body and diverse in perception such as human beings some gods and some beings in the lower realms
There are beings who are diverse in body but identical in perception such as the gods of the Brahmaorder who are generated through the first 
This is the second station for consciousness
There are beings who are identical in body but diverse in perception such as the gods of streaming radiance
This is the third station for consciousness
There are beings who are identical in body and identical in perception such as the gods of refulgent beauty
This is the fourth station for consciousness
There are beings who through the complete surmounting of perceptions of material form the passing away of perceptions of impingement and nonattention to perceptions of diversity Space is infinite arrive at the base of the infinity of space
This is the fifth station for consciousness
There are beings who having completely surmounted the base of the infinity of space Consciousness is infinite arrive at the base of the infinity of consciousness
This is the sixth station for consciousness
There are beings who having completely surmounted the base of the infinity of consciousness There is nothing arrive at the base of nothingness
This is the seventh station for consciousness
The base of nonpercipient beings and second the base of neither perception nor nonperception
Therein nanda the first station for consciousness that of beings who are diverse in body and diverse in perception
if one understands and if one understands its origin its passing away its satisfaction its unsatisfactoriness and the escape from it is it proper for one to seek enjoyment in it
Certainly not venerable sir  If one understands the remaining stations for consciousness  the base of nonpercipient beings
 the base of neither perception nor nonperception
and if one understands its origin its passing away its satisfaction its unsatisfactoriness and the escape from it is it proper for one to seek enjoyment in it
Certainly not venerable sir
nanda when a bhikkhuhaving understood as they really are the origin passing away satisfaction unsatisfactoriness and escape in regard to these seven stations for consciousness and two basesis liberated through nonclinging then he is called a bhikkhu liberated by wisdom
This is the first station for consciousness
nanda there are these eight emancipations
What are the eight
One possessing material form sees material forms This is the first emancipation
One not perceiving material forms internally sees material forms externally This is the second emancipation
One is released upon the idea of the beautiful This is the third emancipation
Through the complete surmounting of perceptions of material form the passing away of perceptions of impingement and nonattention to perceptions of diversity Space is infinite one enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space This is the fourth emancipation
Having completely surmounted the base of the infinity of space Consciousness is infinite one enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of consciousness This is the fifth emancipation
Having completely surmounted the base of the infinity of consciousness There is nothing one enters and dwells in the base of nothingness This is the sixth emancipation
Having completely surmounted the base of nothingness one enters and dwells in the base of neither perception nor nonperception This is the seventh emancipation
Having completely surmounted the base of neither perception nor nonperception one enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling This is the eighth emancipation
nanda when a bhikkhu attains these eight emancipations in forward order in reverse order and in both forward order and reverse order when he attains them and emerges from them wherever he wants in whatever way he wants and for as long as he wants
And nanda there is no other liberation in both ways higher or more sublime than this one
Thus spoke the Exalted One
The Venerable nanda being pleased rejoiced in the Exalted Ones words
Here ends the Mahānidāna Sutta
and when through the destruction of the cankers he here and now enters and dwells in the cankerless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom having realized it for himself with direct knowledge then he is called a bhikkhu who is liberated in both ways

Reverend Sirs this is the time for hearing the safeguard
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena is the body dear to those who have gone forth
Sire the body is not dear to those who have gone forth
But when you have gone into battle sire have you been wounded by an arrow from time to time
Yes I have revered sir
Yes revered sir it was
That wound was not dear to me revered sir and it was only anointed with ointment smeared with oil and bandaged with a soft cloth so that the flesh might heal
Moreover sire the body was likened to a sore by the Blessed One and in consequence those who have gone forth and are without cleaving look after the body as they would a sore
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena was the Buddha allknowing allseeing
Yes sire the Blessed One was allknowing allseeing
But sire have you any physician who knows all the medicines on this earth
Yes revered sir I have
He makes the invalid drink the medicine sir at the time when he is ill not at the time when he is not ill
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena what is the difference between one who has lust and one who is without lust
Sire one cleaves to things the other does not cleave
The one is desirous sire the other is not desirous
Sire he who is not without lust eats his food experiencing the taste and experiencing lust for the taste But he who is without lust eats his food experiencing the taste but not experiencing lust for the taste
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena where does wisdom dwell
Nowhere sire
Nowhere revered sir
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena as to that which you mentioned saṃsāra what is this saṃsāra
Sire what is born here dies here having died here it is reborn elsewhere being reborn there there it dies having died there it is reborn elsewhere Such sire is this saṃsāra
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena by what does one remember what was done long ago in the past
By mindfulness sire
Have you not sire had personal experience of some business you have done but have forgotten
Yes revered sir
No revered sir But there was no mindfulness at that time 
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena in how many ways does mindfulness arise
In sixteen ways sire
That is to say
By some outside influence
By the impression made by the greatness of some occasion
From consciousness of welfare
From consciousness of woe
From a similar appearance
From a dissimilar appearance
From understanding due to speech
From a distinguishing mark
From being urged to recollect
From calculation
By learning by heart
From mental development
By reference to a book
From association of ideas
From what was experienced
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena are you striving to abandon past suffering
No sire
No sire
No sire
So that this suffering should cease and no other suffering ariseI am striving for that
There is not sire You are very clever revered Nāgasena to strive for removal of that which does not exist
Yes revered sir there are
No revered sir that had been attended to already
No revered sir I had trained in those matters already
For the sake of warding off future perils revered sir
There is not revered sir
What do you think about this sire If you were to become thirsty is it then that you would have a well dug a tank dug a reservoir dug saying We will drink water
No revered sir that has been attended to already
It has been attended to revered sir for the sake of warding off thirst in the future
There is not revered sir
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena how far is the Brahmaworld from here
The Brahmaworld is far from here sire If a boulder the size of a gabled house fell from it falling day and night for  yojanas it would take four months to reach the earth
The Elder said Now where is the district sire where you were born
There is an island named Alasanda sir I was born there
Two hundred yojanas revered sir
Do you recall sire some business you did there Do you remember
Yes revered sir I remember
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena if someone died here and was reborn in the Brahmaworld and if someone died here and was reborn in Kashmir which would take longer  which would be quicker
They are equal sire
There is a village named Kalasi revered sir I was born there
Two hundred yojanas revered sir
Twelve yojanas revered sir
They were equal revered sir
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena how many factors of enlightenment are there
There are seven factors of enlightenment sire
By one factor of enlightenment sire the factor of investigation of phenomena
What do you think about this sire If a sword has been put into a sheath and not taken in the hand is it able to cut anything you wanted to cut with it
No revered sir
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena which is the greater merit or demerit
Merit sire is the greater demerit is a trifle
Sire someone doing demerit is remorseful and says An evil deed was done by me Therefore evil does not increase
But someone doing merit is not remorseful From absence of remorse rapture is born joy is born of rapture The body of one who is joyful is tranquil When the body is tranquil he experiences happiness The mind of one who is happy is concentrated and he who is concentrated comprehends as it really is In this way merit increases
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena for whom is the greater demerit he who does an evil deed knowingly or he who does an evil deed unknowingly
His is the greater demerit sire who does an evil deed unknowingly
What do you think about this sire If a man should unknowingly take hold of a redhot ball of iron glowing with heat and another should take hold of it knowingly which would be more severely burnt
He who took hold of it unknowingly sire would be more severely burnt
The Elder said What is difficult to do sire was done by the Blessed One
He pointed out the arrangement of these incorporeal mental states that are mental factors in consciousness and occur in one objective support saying This is contact this is feeling this is perception this is volition this is consciousness
Supposing sire some man had gone to the great sea in a boat and had taken some water in the hollow of his hand and tasted it with his tongue Would he know sire that that was water from the Ganges that water from the Jumnā that water from the Aciravatī that water from the Sarabhū and that water from the Mahī
It would be difficult to know that revered sir
The Elder Nāgasena said Do you know sire what time it is now  Yes revered sir I know
The first watch of the night is now passed the middle watch is in progress the torches are glowing four flags are raised royal offerings will go out from the treasury
Yes sirs the Elder is clever Should there be a teacher such as he is and a pupil such as I am a clever person would soon learn the Dhamma
How do you protect yourself Against the censure of other people who may come saying that though Nāgasena pleased King Milinda yet he received nothing That is how you protect yourself
How do you protect me Against the censure of other people who may come saying that though King Milinda is pleased he gives no sign of being pleased This is how you protect me
But if I revered sir were to go forth from home to homelessness I would not live long so many are my enemies
Not long after Venerable Nāgasena had departed it occurred to King Milinda What did I ask What did the revered sir reply
Then it occurred to King Milinda Everything was properly asked by me everything was properly answered by the revered sir
This also occurred to Venerable Nāgasena when he arrived at the residence for the members of the Order What did King Milinda ask What did I reply
Then it occurred to Venerable Nāgasena Everything was properly asked by King Milinda everything was properly answered by me
King Milinda greeted him sat at a respectable distance and said
Instead I was debating with myself as to whether I had questioned you properly and I had been answered properly and I concluded that I had
Instead I too was thinking over what had been said by us both and I came to the conclusion that you had questioned me properly and I had answered properly Thus did these two great men applaud what the other had said so well
THUS HAVE I HEARD  On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country at a town of the Kurus named Kammasadhamma
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
Bhikkhus this is the direct path  for the purification of beings  for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation for the disappearance of pain and grief for the attainment of the true way for the realisation of Nibbana  namely the four foundations of mindfulness 
What are the four
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu  abides contemplating the body as a body ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world  He abides contemplating feelings as feelings ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world He abides contemplating mind as mind ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world He abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world
And how bhikkhus does a bhikkhu abide contemplating the body as a body
Here a bhikkhu gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut sits down having folded his legs crosswise set his body erect and established mindfulness in front of him
ever mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
Breathing in long he understand wreathe in long or breathing out long he understands I breathe out long
Breathing in short he understands I breathe in short or breathing out short he understands I breathe out short
He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body of breath he trains thus I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body of breath
He trains thus I shall breathe in tranquillizing the bodily formation he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquillizing the bodily formation
Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice when making a long turn understands I make a long turn or when making a short turn understands I make a short turn so too breathing in long
a bhikkhu understands I breathe in long
he trains thus I shall breathe out tranquillizing the bodily formation
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally or he abides contemplating the body as a body externally or he abides contemplating the body as a body both internally and externally  Or else he abides contemplating in the body its arising factors or he abides contemplating in the body its vanishing factors or he abides contemplating in the body both its arising and vanishing factors
Or else mindfulness that there is a body is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Again bhikkhus when walking a bhikkhu understands I am walking when standing he understands I am standing when sitting he understands I am sitting when lying down he understands I am lying down
or he understands accordingly however his body is disposed
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally externally and both internally and externally
And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu is one who acts in full awareness when going forward and returning  who acts in full aware ness when looking ahead and looking away who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs who acts in full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl who acts in full awareness when eating drink ing consuming food and tasting who acts in full awareness when defecating and urinating who acts in full awareness when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and keeping silent
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally externally and both internally and externally  
And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu reviews this same body up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair bounded by skin as full of many kinds of impurity thus
In this body there are headhairs bodyhairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bonemarrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease spittle snot oil of the joints and urine
Just as though there were a bag with an opening at both ends full of many sorts of grain such as hill rice red rice beans peas millet and white rice and a man with good eyes were to open it and review it thus This is hill rice this is red rice these are beans these are peas this is millet this is white rice
so too a bhikkhu reviews this same bodyas full of many kinds of impurity thus
In this body there are headhairsand urine
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally externally and both internally and externally 
And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu reviews this same body how ever it is placed however disposed as consisting of elements thus In this body there are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element
Just as though a skilled butcher or his apprentice had killed a cow and was seated at the crossroads with it cut up into pieces
so too a bhikkhu reviews this same bodyas consisting of elements thus In this body there are the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally externally and both internally and externally 
And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Againbhikkhus as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground one two or three days dead bloated livid and oozing matter
a bhikkhu compares this same body with it thus This body too is of the same nature it will be like that it is not exempt from that fate
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally externally and both internally and externally 
And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
Again as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground being devoured by crows hawks vultures dogs jackals or various kinds of worms
Again as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground a skeleton with flesh and blood held together with sinews
a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood held together with sinews
a skeleton without flesh and blood held together with sinews
disconnected bones scattered in all directions  here a handbone there a footbone here a shinbone there a thighbone here a hipbone there a backbone here a ribbone there a breastbone here an armbone there a shoulderbone here a neckbone there a jawbone here a tooth there the skull
Again as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground bones bleached white the colour of shells
bones heaped up more than a year old
bones rotted and crumbled to dust 
a bhikkhu compares this same body with it thus This body too is of the same nature it will be like that it is not exempt from that fate
In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally or he abides contemplating the body as a body externally or he abides contemplating the body as a body both internally and externally Or else he abides contemplating in the body its arising factors or he abides contemplating in the body its vanishing factors or he abides contemplating in the body both its arising and vanishing factors
Or else mindfulness that there is a body is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body
And how bhikkhus does a bhikkhu abide contemplating feelings as feelings
Here when feeling a pleasant feeling a bhikkhu understands I feel a pleasant feeling when feeling a painful feeling he understands I feel a painful feeling when feeling a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling he understands I feel a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
When feeling a worldly pleasant feeling he understands I feel a worldly pleasant feeling when feeling an unworldly pleasant feeling he understands I feel an unworldly pleasant feeling

when feeling a worldly neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling he understands I feel a worldly neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling when feeling an unworldly neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling he understands I feel an unworldly neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
In this way he abides contemplating feelings as feelings inter nally or he abides contemplating feelings as feelings externally or he abides contemplating feelings as feelings both internally and externally Or else he abides contemplating in feelings their arising factors or he abides contemplating in feelings their van ishing factors or he abides contemplating in feelings both their arising and vanishing factors
Or else mindfulness that there is feeling is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world

Here a bhikkhu abides con templating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the five hindrances
And how does a bhikkhu abide contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the five hindrances
Here there being sensual desire in him a bhikkhu understands There is sensual desire in me or there being no sensual desire in him he understands There is no sensual desire in me
and he also understands how there comes to be the arising of unarisen sensual desire and how there comes to be the abandoning of arisen sensual desire and how there comes to be the future nonarising of abandoned sensual desire
There being ill will in him
There being sloth and torpor in him
There being restlessness and remorse in him
There being doubt in him a bhikkhu understands There is doubt in me or there being no doubt in him he understands There is no doubt in me
and he understands how there comes to be the arising of unarisen doubt and how there comes to be the abandoning of arisen doubt and how there comes to be the future nonarising of abandoned doubt
In this way he abides contemplating mindobjects as mind objects internally or he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects externally or he abides contemplating mind objects as mindobjects both internally and externally Or else he abides contemplating in mindobjects their arising factors or he abides contemplating in mindobjects their vanishing factors or he abides contemplating in mindobjects both their arising and vanishing factors

That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the five hindrances
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the five aggregates affected by clinging
And how does a bhikkhu abide contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the five aggregates affected by clinging
Here a bhikkhu understands Such is material form such its origin such its disappearance such is feeling such its origin such its disappearance such is perception such its origifi such its disappearance such are the formations such their origin such their disappearance such is consciousness such its origin such its disappearance
In this way he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects internally externally and both internally and externally

That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the five aggregates affected by clinging
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu abides contemplating mind objects as mindobjects in terms of the six internal and external bases
And how does a bhikkhu abide contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the six internal and external bases
Here a bhikkhu understands the eye he under stands forms and he understands the fetter that arises dependent on both and he also understands how there comes to be the arising of the unarisen fetter and how there comes to be the abandoning of the arisen fetter and how there comes to be the future nonarising of the abandoned fetter

That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the seven enlightenment factors
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu abides contemplating mind objects as mindobjects in terms of the Four Noble Truths
And how does a bhikkhu abide contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the Four Noble Truths
Here a bhikkhu understands as it actually is This is suffering he understands as it actually is This is the origin of suffering he understands as it actually is This is the cessation of suffering he under stands as it actually is This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering
In this way he abides contemplating mindobjects as mind objects internally or he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects externally or he abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects both internally and externally Or else he abides contemplating in mindobjects their arising factors or he abides contemplating in mindobjects their vanishing factors or he abides contemplating in mindobjects both their arising and vanishing factors
Or else mindfulness that there are mindobjects is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness And he abides independent not clinging to anything in the world
That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects in terms of the Four Noble Truths
Bhikkhus if anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way for seven years one of two fruits could be expected for him either final knowledge here and now or if there is a trace of clinging left nonreturn
Let alone seven years bhikkhus
Let alone six years bhikkhus
Let alone five years bhikkhus
Let alone four years bhikkhus
Let alone one year bhikkhus
Let alone half a month bhikkhus
If anyone should develop these four foundations of mindfulness in such a way for seven days one of two fruits could be expected for him either final knowledge here and now or if there is a trace of clinging left nonreturn
Bhikkhus this is the direct path for the purification of beings for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation for the disappearance of pain and grief for the attainment of the true way for the realisation of Nibbana  namely the four foundations of mindfulness
So it was with reference to this that it was said
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Then why revered sir do you treasure and foster it
Then was not the wound anointed with ointment smeared with oil and bandaged with a soft cloth
But was that wound dear to you sire that it was anointed with ointment smeared with oil and bandaged with a soft cloth
Similarly sire the body is not dear to those who have gone forth but those who have gone forth and are without cleaving look after the body for the sake of faring the holy life
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Then how is it revered Nāgasena that he laid down the rules of training for disciples only gradually
Well sire does that physician make the invalid drink the medicine at the time when he is ill or at the time when he is not ill
Even so sire the Blessed One allknowing allseeing did not lay down a rule of training for disciples at the wrong time but when the proper time came he laid down a rule of training for disciples not to be transgressed as long as they lived
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
But what does this mean revered sir cleaves and does not cleave
As I see it revered sir whoever has lust and whoever is without lust both of them alike want good solid or soft food they want nothing that is bad
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Well then revered Nāgasena there is no wisdom
Where does the wind dwell sire
Well then sire there is no wind
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena

Just as venerable Gotama one might set upright what has been overturned or uncover that which has been covered or point out the way to one who had gone astray or bring an oillamp into the darkness so that those with eyes might see shapes in the same way the doctrine has been declared by the venerable Gotama in manifold ways
I go to the venerable Gotama as a refuge and to the Doctrine and to the Order of bhikkhus
May the venerable Gotama accept me as a layfollower who has taken refuge from this day forth as long as life lasts
Just as O Venerable Gotama a man were to set upright what had been overturned or were to reveal what had been hidden or were to point the way to one who had gone astray or were to hold an oil lamp in the dark so that those with eyes may see things even so in many ways has the Venerable Gotama expounded the Dhamma the doctrine
I take refuge in the Venerable Gotama the Dhamma and the Sangha the Order
May the Venerable Gotama accept me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from this day onwards while life lasts
This is the fourth sextet
The six classes of contact should be known  Thus was it said And in reference to this was it said
Dependent on the ear  sounds there arises consciousness at the ear The meeting of the three is contact
Dependent on the nose  aromas there arises consciousness at the nose The meeting of the three is contact
Dependent on the tongue  flavors there arises consciousness at the tongue The meeting of the three is contact
Dependent on the body  tactile sensations there arises consciousness at the body The meeting of the three is contact
Dependent on the intellect  ideas there arises consciousness at the intellect The meeting of the three is contact

If when touched by a feeling of pain one sorrows grieves  laments beats ones breast becomes distraught
then ones passionobsession gets obsessed
If when touched by a feeling of pleasure one relishes it welcomes it or remains fastened to it
Dependent on the intellect  ideas there arises consciousness at the intellect The meeting of the three is contact With contact as a requisite condition there arises what is felt either as pleasure pain or neither pleasure nor pain
Dependent on the nose  aromas 
Dependent on the tongue  flavors 
Dependent on the body  tactile sensations 
He grows disenchanted with the nose
He grows disenchanted with the tongue
He grows disenchanted with the body
Make a simile
Suppose sire some man having eaten a ripe mango should plant the stone and a large mango tree would grow from it and yield fruit and that the man having eaten a ripe mango from it too should plant the stone and a large mango tree should grow from it too and yield fruit In this way no end to those trees can be seen Even so sire what is born here dies here having died here it is reborn elsewhere being reborn there there it dies having died there it is reborn elsewhere Such sire is saṃsāra
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Revered Nāgasena does not one remember by mind not by mindfulness
But at that time sire were you without a mind
Then how can you sire say that one remembers by mind not by mindfulness
By personal experience as when the Venerable nanda and the woman lay devotee Khujjuttarā or any others who had that power called to mind their previous births
as when others continue to remind one who is by nature forgetful
as when kings remember their coronation or when one remembers the attainment of the fruit of streamentry
as when one remembers when one was happy
as when one remembers when one was afflicted
as on seeing one like them we remember the mother or father or sister or brother or on seeing a camel or an ox or a donkey we remember others like them
as when we remember that such and such a colour sound smell taste or touch belongs to such and such a thing
as when one who is by nature forgetful is reminded by others and then himself remembers
as when one remembers a ploughox by its branding
as when one who is by nature forgetful is told by another again and again Try to think of it
From reckoning
as when one who knows by training he has received in writing that such and such a letter ought to follow such and such a one
as when with training in calculation accountants do big sums by their knowledge of figures
like the repeaters of scriptures
as when a monk remembers his former lives with their modes and details
as when kings calling to mind a previous regulation say Bring the book here and remind themselves out of that
as at the sight of goods deposited one remembers the circumstances under which they were deposited
as when one remembers a thing because one has seen it or a sound because one has heard it or a smell because one has smelt it or a taste because one has tasted it or a touch because one has touched it or a mental state because one has cognized it
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Then are you striving to abandon future suffering
Then are you striving to abandon present suffering
If you are not striving to abandon either past future or present suffering then what are you striving for
But revered Nāgasena is there a future suffering now
But are there sire any hostile kings adversaries or opponents who have risen up against you
Was it then sire that you had a moat dug a rampart raised a city gateway built and the grain brought in
Was it then that you sire trained yourself in elephant craft in horsemanship in chariot craft in archery in swordsmanship
For the sake of what
So there is a future peril now sire
You are very clever sire in that you prepare for the warding off of future perils
Make a simile
For the sake of what
So there is a future thirst now sire
You are very clever sire in that you prepare for the warding off of future thirst
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Revered Nāgasena you speak thus As a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm or bend back his outstretched arm even so a monk who has psychic power and has attained to mastery over his mind may disappear from India and become manifest in the Brahmaworld I do not believe these words for how could he go so many hundreds of yojanas so quickly
How far is Alasanda from here
Quickly have you gone those two hundred yojanas sire
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Make a simile
Where is the town sire where you were born
How far is the village of Kalasi from here sire
How far is Kashmir from here sire
Please think of the village of Kalasi sire
I have thought of it revered sir
Please think of Kashmir sire
I have thought of it revered sir
Now which thought took longer sire which was quicker
In the same way sire one who dies here and is reborn in the Brahmaworld and one who dies here and is reborn in Kashmir both take exactly the same amount of time to be reborn
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
By how many factors of enlightenment does one become enlightened sir
Then why are seven factors mentioned revered sir
Even so sire without the other six factors of enlightenment one does not become enlightened by the factor of investigation of phenomena
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
In what way
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
Well then revered sir do we doubly punish any of our family or our court who does an evil deed unknowingly
Even so sire the greater demerit is his who does an evil deed unknowingly
You are dexterous revered Nāgasena
What was that revered sir
Make a simile
What is more difficult to do than this sire was done by the Blessed One when he pointed out the arrangement of these incorporeal mental states that are mental factors in consciousness and occur in one objective support saying This is contact this is feeling this is perception this is volition this is consciousness
King Milinda was much pleased and said Well done revered sir
The Bactrian Greeks said You are dexterous sire and the monk is clever
As King Milinda was pleased with the answers to his questions he presented Venerable Nāgasena with a woollen blanket worth a hundred thousand coins saying Revered sir from this day forth I will have your daily meal prepared for eight hundred days and give you the choice of anything in the palace that is lawful for you to take
No sire I have enough to live on
I know revered Nāgasena that you have enough to live on yet you must protect yourself and protect me
Let it so be sire
As revered sir a lion the king of beasts when put into a cage though it were made of gold would turn its face longingly to the outside even so do I revered sir though I live as master in the house turn my thoughts longingly to the higher life of you recluses
Venerable Nāgasena having answered King Milindas questions rose from his seat and went to the residence for the members of the Order
As the night was waning Venerable Nāgasena having dressed early took his bowl and robe and went to King Milindas palace and sat on a seat prepared for him
Do not think revered sir that I was awake for the rest of the night rejoicing in the thought of having questioned you
The Elder too spoke thus Do not think sire that I spent the rest of the night rejoicing at having answered all you asked
But in the description of the origin the expression yāyaṃ taṇhā  yā ayaṃ taṇhā
As regards the expression produces further becoming it is a making become again thus it is becoming again  becoming again is its habit thus it produces further becoming 
The expression nandirāgasahagatā  nandirāgena sahagatā what is meant is that it is identical in meaning with delight and greed
Concerned with this and that wherever personality is generated there is concern with that
The expression that is to say is a particle its meaning is which is that
Craving for sense desires craving for becoming craving for non becoming will be explained in the Description of Dependent Origination 
Although this is threefold it should nevertheless be understood as the noble truth of the origin of suffering taking it as one in the sense of its generating the truth of suffering
Living in the shadow of Venerable Nāgasena
Pondering thoroughly the scriptures in seclusion during the night
He thought that if these dilemmas were not cleared there
Being quite pleased with the way Venerable Nāgasena had answered his questions he decided that he would take up these dilemmas with the Elder
At dawn King Milinda bathed his head and stretched his joined palms to his forehead in salutation When he had recollected the Perfectly Enlightened Buddhas of the past the future and the present he undertook eight items of good practice
He first removed his usual clothes and put on saffroncoloured garments He vowed that for the next seven days he would give no advice on royal affairs he would not harbour any state of mind accompanied by lust or by hatred or by delusion he would speak unassumingly to his subordinates guard himself as to body and speech guard the six sense bases completely and direct his mind to the development of loving kindness
He passed seven days without deviating from any of these eight good practices At daybreak on the eighth day he had an early breakfast and then he approached Venerable Nāgasena He honoured the Elders feet with his head and standing at a respectful distance spoke thus
King Milinda and Venerable Nāgasena then entered a secluded wood
King Milinda then fell at the Elders feet and stretched his joined palms to his forehead in salutation King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena leaders of other sects say thus If the Buddha accepts homage then the Buddha has not attained final Nibbāna he is still fettered to the world is within the world a sharer in the world therefore service rendered to him becomes barren and fruitless
But if he has attained final Nibbāna he is released from the world he has escaped from all becomings homage for him does not arise one who has attained final Nibbāna does not accept anything service rendered to one who does not accept becomes barren and fruitless This is a doublepronged question this is not the sphere of those who have not attained perfection this is the very sphere for great men Tear asunder this net of wrong views set it to one side this question is put to you Give insight to the future sons of the Conqueror for the refutation of those holding other tenets
The Elder said Sire the Blessed One has attained final Nibbāna and the Blessed One does not accept homage At the root of the Bodhi Tree itself acceptance was abandoned by the Tathāgata all the more then now when he has attained final Nibbāna in the element of Nibbāna that has no substrate remaining for further existence
This sire was spoken by the Elder Sāriputta the General of the Dhamma 
They accept it not refuse it not Through the ages all Buddhas were so So will they ever be
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena a son may speak in praise of his father or a father may speak in praise of his son but this is not a reason for the refutation of those holding other tenets it is only an expression of their own satisfaction Please tell me fully about the reason for establishing your own tenets and disentangling the net of false views
Sire the Blessed One has attained final Nibbāna and the Blessed One does not accept homage If devas and humans after making a site for the jewel of the relics of the Tathāgata practise the right procedure with the objective support of the Tathāgatas jewel of knowledge they achieve three attainments
If sire an enormous mass of fire having blazed up should go out would it then again accept any supply of grass and sticks
Even as it burned revered sir it did not accept another supply of grass and sticks so why should it accept one when it has gone out is allayed and insensate
But sire when this mass of fire had ceased and was allayed would the world be empty of fire
No revered sir Sticks are the foundation and fuel for fire and anyone who desires a fire can by exertion of his own strength and energy produce a fire by twirling the firestick and do any work that is to be done by a fire
As sire that fire went out even so did the Blessed One attain final Nibbāna in the element of Nibbāna that has no substrate remaining for further existence
As sire the mass of fire that went out did not accept another supply of grass and sticks even so for the welfare of the world has his acceptance of goods ceased
As sire when a fire has gone out anyone who desires a fire can by exertion of his own strength and energy produce a fire by twirling a firestick even so devas and humans after making a site for the jewel of the relics of the Tathāgata practise the right procedure with the objective support of the Tathāgatas jewel of knowledge and consequently attain three attainments It is in this way sire that service rendered to the Tathāgata who has attained final Nibbāna and does not accept becomes not barren but fruitful
And moreover sire listen to this further way in which a service rendered to the Tathāgata who has attained final Nibbāna and does not accept becomes not barren but fruitful
Now sire does this great earth accept  thinking Let all seeds germinate on me
No revered sir
Although revered sir the great earth is not one that accepts  it is the foundation for these seeds it gives the condition for their growth these seeds depending on that foundation and germinating because of that condition are established with a strong tangle of roots a trunk pith and spreading branches and bear flowers and fruits
As sire the great earth accepts nothing so the Tathāgata accepts nothing
As sire those seeds depending on the great earth and germinating are established with a strong tangle of roots a trunk pith and spreading branches and bear flowers and fruits even so devas and humans depending on the relics and the jewel of knowledge of the Tathāgata who has attained final Nibbāna and does not accept are established with a strong root of the wholesome trunk of concentration pith of the Dhamma the branches of morality and they bear the flowers of emancipation and the fruits of recluseship It is in this way too sire that a service rendered to the Tathāgata who has attained final Nibbāna and does not accept becomes not barren but fruitful
Revered Nāgasena was the Buddha omniscient
Yes sire the Blessed One was omniscient but knowledge and vision were not constantly and continuously present to the Blessed One The Blessed Ones omniscient knowledge was dependent on his adverting his mind When he adverted it he knew whatever it pleased him to know
Now these seven kinds of mentality occur the mentality sire of those who have lust who have hatred who have delusion who have defilements whose body is not developed  whose morality is not developed whose mentality is not developed and whose wisdom is not developed The mentality of these arises with difficulty and proceeds sluggishly
As sire difficult and sluggish is the movement of bamboocanes when they are dragged along with their branches entwined and entangled
The second kind of mentality is distinguished thus The mentality sire of those streamenterers for whom the sorrowful ways are shut off who have attained right view and who have understood the Teachers instructions uprises buoyantly proceeds buoyantly as far as the lower three stages are concerned
For what reason Because of utter purification in the three lower stages and because of not having got rid of the defilements to be got rid of in the higher planes
The third kind of mentality is distinguished thus The mentality sire of those oncereturners who have reduced lust hatred and delusion to the minimum arises buoyantly proceeds  buoyantly in the lower five stages but as regards the higher planes it arises with difficulty proceeds sluggishly
As sire bamboocanes that have clean stalks as far as the fifth knot move buoyantly when dragged along but because the branches above are entangled there is resistance there even so the mentality of the oncereturners proceeds buoyantly as far as the five lower stages are concerned but in regard to the higher planes it arises with difficulty proceeds sluggishly
For what reason Because of utter purification of mentality in the five lower stages and because of not having got rid of the defilements to be got rid of in the higher planes
The fourth kind of mentality is distinguished thus The mentality sire of those nonreturners who have got rid of the five fetters binding to this lower shore arises buoyantly proceeds buoyantly as far as the ten stages are concerned but as regards the higher planes it arises with difficulty proceeds sluggishly
As sire bamboocanes that have clean stalks as far as the tenth knot move buoyantly when dragged along but because the branches above are entangled there is resistance there even so the mentality of the nonreturners who have got rid of the five fetters binding to this lower shore arises buoyantly proceeds buoyantly as far as the ten stages are concerned but as regards the higher planes it arises with difficulty proceeds sluggishly
For what reason Because of utter purification of mentality in the ten stages and because of not having got rid of the defilements to be got rid of in the higher planes
The fifth kind of mentality is distinguished thus The mentality sire of those arahats whose cankers are destroyed whose stains are washed away whose defilements have been left behind who have lived the life done what was to be done  laid down the burden attained their own welfare utterly destroyed the fetters of becoming won the analytical knowledges and are utterly purified in the disciples planes arises buoyantly proceeds buoyantly in regard to the disciples range but arises with difficulty proceeds sluggishly in the planes of a paccekabuddha
For what reason
Because of utter purification in the disciples range and because of lack of purification in the range of a paccekabuddha
The sixth kind of mentality is distinguished thus The mentality sire of those who are paccekabuddhas selfdependent without a teacher faring alone like the horn of a rhinoceros their minds utterly purified and spotless in their own range arises buoyantly proceeds buoyantly in regard to their own range but arises with difficulty proceeds sluggishly
As sire a man might cross a small river in his own locality without fear during the day or night as he desired but later if he saw the great sea deep extensive unfathomable and no shore beyond he would be afraid hesitant and would not venture to cross even so the mentality of those who are paccekabuddhas arises buoyantly proceeds buoyantly in regard to their own range but arises with difficulty proceeds sluggishly as regards the planes of an omniscient Buddha
For what reason
Because of utter purification in their own range and because of the greatness of the range of an omniscient Buddha
The seventh kind of mentality is distinguished thus The mentality of those Perfect Buddhas who are omniscient the bearers of the ten powers confident with the four confidences possessed of the eighteen Buddha qualities conquerors of the infinite and whose knowledge is unobstructed arises buoyantly and proceeds buoyantly everywhere For what reason
Because it is everywhere utterly purified
If sire a wellcleaned arrow without a blemish or notch straight and with a fine edge was fitted to a sturdy bow and shot by a strong man into a fine linen or silken garment would there be any sluggishness or retardation in the movement of the arrow
No revered sir For what reason It is due to the fineness of the garments the clean state of the arrow and the strength of the shot
Even so sire the mentality of the Perfect Buddhas who are omniscient  and whose knowledge is unobstructed arises buoyantly and proceeds buoyantly everywhere For what reason
Because it is everywhere utterly purified
Because sire the Blessed Ones mentality
For those miracles that derive from the mentality of the omniscient Buddhas there is no further reason that can be alleged Dependent on his adverting sire was the Blessed Ones omniscient knowledge
As sire a man could put into one hand anything that had been in the other could swallow food that was in his mouth could open and shut his eyes and could stretch and bend his arms sooner than this sire the Blessed Ones omniscient knowledge could function faster than this could he advert his mind when it was necessary When he had adverted it he knew whatever it pleased him to know
Therefore revered Nāgasena adverting is done for the purpose of seeking that which is not clear when the adverting begins Convince me in this matter by some reason
As sire a wealthy man might have abundant possessions of gold and silver paddy rice and other kinds of grains ghee oil butter milk curds and honey all put away in storerooms in jars and pots and pans A guest worthy of hospitality arrives expecting to be entertained All the food that was cooked had been finished so the provisions are taken out and a meal is prepared Would that wealthy man merely by deficiency of cooked food at that particular time be rightly called poor or needy
No revered sir Even in the palace of a mighty king there might be no food ready out of time so why not in the house of an ordinary man
Even so sire the omniscient knowledge of a Tathāgata may lack the smallest degree of adverting but when he has adverted his mind he knows whatever it pleases him to know
Strong is the reasoning revered Nāgasena The Buddha was omniscient I accept it that the Buddha was omniscient
Revered Nāgasena it has been said by the Blessed One nanda the true Dhamma will last now for only five hundred years
This too is a doublepronged question thicker than a thicket more powerful than a strong man more knotty than a knot It is now put to you Show the power of your knowledge like a seamonster in the midst of the ocean
But they are different one from the other both in the spirit and in the letter The one deals with the duration of the Dispensation the other illustrates the practice of the religious lifetwo things widely distinct
But though that be so yet lest your enquiry be in vain I will expound the matter further in its essential connection
When the Blessed One said that the true Dhamma will last for only five hundred years then while illustrating its destruction he delimited the remainder of its existence saying nanda the true Dhamma would last for a thousand years if nuns had not gone forth
But nanda the true Dhamma will last now for only five hundred years
No revered sir
Suppose sire a man whose property had been diminished might announce publicly making sure of what remained
On the other hand when he told Subhadda If these monks Subhadda were to live rightly the world might not be empty of arahats the Blessed One was giving an illustration of the practice of the Teaching You have confounded the limitation of the Teaching with the practice of the Teaching
If you wish I will tell you about the real connection between the two Listen carefully pay attention with a trustful mind
Suppose sire there is a reservoir full of fresh clean water overflowing at the brim bounded by an embankment If the water in that reservoir had not dried up and a great cloud above should pour down heavy and continuous rain would the water in that reservoir be exhausted and dried up
No revered sir
Revered sir because of the continuous downpour of rain from that cloud
so would this reservoir of the excellent true Dhamma in the Conquerors Teaching last for a very long time and the world would not be empty of arahats This was the meaning of the Blessed Ones words when he said And if these monks Subhadda were to live rightly the world might not be empty of arahats
No revered sir more and more would that mass of fire burn more and more would it blaze forth
If the sons of the Buddha endowed with the five factors of striving and constantly diligent should strive still more and if with desire aroused they should train themselves in the three trainings and should fulfil completely the moral precepts both in acting and avoiding so would the excellent Teaching of the Conqueror last to a still higher degree for a very long time and the world might not be empty of arahats This was the meaning of the Blessed Ones words when he said And if the monks Subhadda were to live rightly the world might not be empty of arahats
No revered sir On the contrary it would become even more stainless than before
Even so sire stainless by nature is the excellent Teaching of the Conqueror Dispelled are the dust and the dirt and the stain of the defilements If the sons of the Buddha were to be submissive to the excellent Teaching of the Conqueror by means of good behaviour morality special qualities right custom and practice and the special quality of submissiveness and austerity so would this excellent Teaching of the Conqueror last a long time and the world would not be empty of arahats This was the meaning of the Blessed Ones words when he said And if the monks Subhadda were to live rightly the world might not be empty of arahats
Grounded on practice sire is the Dispensation of the Teacher in practice is its essence It will last so long as practice does not disappear
There are sire these three modes of disappearance of the Teaching
There is
the disappearance of spiritual realization the disappearance of its practice and the disappearance of its outward sign When spiritual realization disappears there is no understanding of the Dhamma even for one who is faring along properly when practice disappears the promulgation of the rules of training disappears only the outward sign remains when the outward sign disappears there is a break in the tradition These sire are the three modes of disappearance
Revered Nāgasena the profound question that was properly formulated has been made clear the knot is severed destroyed are the tenets of others shattered and without splendour You have come to be the foremost among teachers of schools
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena when the Tathāgata attained omniscience did he do so after burning up all that is unwholesome or not
Sire the Blessed One attained omniscience after burning up all that is unwholesome There was no residue of the unwholesome in the Blessed One
Yes sire At Rājagaha his foot was wounded by a stone splint he was afflicted by dysentery once his humours were disturbed and the physician Jīvaka prepared a purgative for him he once had a wind ailment and his attendant the Elder looked for hot water
But if he was really afflicted by these ailments then the statement that he attained omniscience after burning up all that is unwholesome must be false
For there is no feeling without kamma All that is felt is rooted in kamma one experiences it only through kamma This too is a doublepronged question it is put to you it is for you to solve
Feelings arise sire through eight causes and many beings experience feelings by reason of these eight causes
What are the eight
Some feelings arise here on account of wind some on account of bile some on account of phlegm some through a combination of these three some through a change in the weather some through reckless conduct some through external agency and some feelings arise that are born as the result of kamma
Therein those people who say Kamma oppresses beings excluding the seven causes
Revered Nāgasena the feelings due to wind bile phlegm and the other causes all originate from kamma alone It is actually through kamma that they arise
Yet when the wind is disturbed this happens because of ten things cold heat hunger thirst overeating standing too long overexertion excessive walking an external agency and as the result of kamma
The first nine factors operatenot in the past or in the futurebut in this present existence Therefore it cannot be said that all feelings originate from kamma
When the bile is disturbed this happens because of three things cold heat and unsuitable food
When the phlegm is disturbed this happens because of three things cold heat and foodanddrink
When the wind and the bile and the phlegm become disturbed together and combine each brings along its respective feeling
Feeling born of a change in the weather arises through a change in the weather
Feeling born of reckless conduct arises from reckless conduct
As to the feeling due to external agency there is mere action there is the result of kamma The feeling born as the result of kamma arises from a kamma done in the past
Fools go too far when in regard to this they say All is born as the result of kamma alone
Now when the Blessed Ones foot sire was cut by the stone splint that feeling did not originate from any of the other causes nor was it born as the result of kamma It was due only to an external agency
For Devadatta had borne malice towards the Tathāgata for many hundreds of thousands of births Because of his malice he took a large heavy boulder and hurled it at the Master thinking it would fall upon his head But then two other rocks came together and intercepted the boulder before it reached the Tathāgata through the collision a chip split off struck the Blessed Ones foot and drew blood That feeling of the Blessed One sire was produced either as the result of kamma or from mere action there is no other kind of feeling beyond that
As sire when a seed does not sprout this is due either to bad soil or to a bad seed
But while the Blessed One never experienced feelings born as kamma result or from reckless conduct he did experience feelings arisen from the other six causes But that feeling could not deprive the Blessed One of life
Feelings that are desirable and undesirable pleasant and unpleasant assail this physical body
Just as a clod of soil thrown into the air would fall upon the great earth but not as a consequence of some deed previously done by the earth
It is the same with the other bodily ailments that afflicted the Blessed One none were produced by kamma They were produced by one or another of the six other causes So sire it is not the case that all feelings are born as the result of kamma The Blessed One sire attained omniscience after burning up all that is unwholesome
It is good revered Nāgasena That is so and I accept what you say
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena you say Whatever was to be done by the Tathāgata was all accomplished at the root of the Bodhi Tree there was then nothing further he had to do nothing he had to add to what he had already done But then there is also talk of three months solitary meditation
If the first statement is correct then the second must be false
For there is no need for solitary meditation for one who has done what was to be done Solitary meditation is for one who still has something to be done It is the sick man who has need for medicine not the healthy
This too is a doublepronged question it is put to you it is for you to solve it
Both statements sire are true Solitary meditation has many special qualities All Tathāgatas when they have attained omniscience have meditated in solitude It is while they are recollecting these special qualities of what was well done that they practise solitary meditation
As sire when a man has gained a boon in the presence of a king and obtained property then on recollecting the special quality of what was well done he remains constantly in attendance on that king or as sire a man who was gravely ill when he has frequented a physician and achieved a cure constantly frequents that physician
It is while they are recollecting these special qualities of what was well done that they practise solitary meditation
It is on beholding twentyeight special qualities in solitary meditation sire that Tathāgatas practise solitary meditation
What are the twentyeight
Solitary meditation protects him who meditates it increases the lifespan it gives strength cleanses him from faults removes him from a bad reputation conduces to fame dispels discontent furnishes content removes fear makes for selfconfidence removes indolence generates energy removes lust removes hatred removes delusion humbles pride breaks down all doubt makes the mind onepointed makes the mind pliable produces joy makes him serious gains him much advantage it makes him worthy of reverence brings rapture it fills him with delight shows the true nature of formations uproots becoming and rebirth and yields complete recluseship
Moreover sire for four reasons Tathāgatas practise solitary meditation
For what four
So that they may dwell at ease for an abundance of the faultless good qualities on account of it being the road to all noble things and because it has been praised lauded and exalted by all Buddhas
It is for these four reasons that Tathāgatas practise solitary meditation
It is good revered Nāgasena That is so and I accept what you say
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena this too was said by the Blessed One nanda the Tathāgatas four bases of psychic power have been developed increased made a vehicle made a ground maintained consolidated and well undertaken nanda if the Tathāgata so desired he might remain for a kappa or for what was left of it
If the second statement was true then the first must have been false
There is no thundering of the Tathāgatas about what is causally impossible
The Blessed Buddhas speak no misleading words they utter the truth and speak sincerely
This too is a doublepronged question profound very abstruse hard to understand it is put to you Burst asunder this net of false views set it aside burst asunder the tenets of others
Both these statements sire were made by the Blessed One
Kappa in that connection means the full lifespan The Blessed One sire was not exalting his own power when he said so He was proclaiming the potency of psychic power
As sire a kings thoroughbred horse might be as swift as the speed of the wind and the king in declaring its power and speed in the presence of all his court would say If he wished this noble steed of mine could cross the earth to its ocean boundary and be back here again in a moment Now though the king would not show that horses speed in the presence of the court yet it had that speed
Even so sire when the Blessed One was proclaiming his own potency of psychic power he spoke thus and by that potency he was able to remain for a kappa or for what was left of it
But the Blessed One did not show that potency to his audience As far as all becomings are concerned sire the Blessed One was without desire and all becomings were condemned by the Tathāgata
Sire it has been said by the Blessed One As monks even a small quantity of excrement is of evil smell
No revered sir
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena this too was said by the Blessed One I teach the Dhamma monks from superknowledge not without superknowledge
If the first statement had been true the second would have been wrong
If the second statement was really made then the first was false
This too is a doublepronged question delicate subtle very abstruse deep very profound hard to understand It is put to you Show in regard to it your pervading power of knowledge
In both cases sire the Blessed One said as you have declared But in the second case it was to test the monks that he said it to try whether if leave were granted them they would after his passing abolish the lesser and minor rules of training or still adhere to them
As sire a king of kings might say to his sons This great country my children reaches to the sea on every side It is hard to maintain it much longer with the forces we have at our disposal So my children when I am gone you had better abandon the outlying districts along the border
No revered sir kings are greedier than that The princes in their lust for power might subjugate a country twice or thrice the size of what they had but they would never give up what they already possessed
Revered Nāgasena when the Blessed One referred to the lesser and minor rules of trainingpeople are confused about them bewildered undecided fallen into doubt
Sire a lesser rule of training refers to an offence of wrongdoing a minor rule of training to one of wrong speech These two together make up the lesser and minor rules of training The great Elders of old sire were also in doubt about this matter and failed to reach unanimity when this question was raised at the council for fixing the Blessed Ones Doctrine
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena this was said by the Blessed One In regard to the Tathāgatas teachings nanda there is no such thing as the closed fist of a teacher On the other hand when the Elder Mālunkyaputta asked the Blessed One a question he did not answer it
This problem revered Nāgasena will have two ends on one of which it must rest either that of not knowing or that of keeping something secret
If the first statement is true it must have been out of ignorance that he did not answer the Elder Malunkyaputta
But if he knew and still did not reply then the first statement must be false
This too is a doublepronged question it is put to you it is for you to solve
The Blessed One sire made that first statement to nanda and he did not reply to Malunkyaputtas question But that was neither out of ignorance nor for the sake of concealing anything
Sire there are four ways of answering questions
What four
There is the question to be answered with a definite reply there is the question to be answered with an analysis there is the question to be answered with a counterquestion there is the question to be set aside
Now what is the type of question to be answered with a definite reply
It is such as this Is material form impermanent Are feeling perception mental formations and consciousness impermanent 
What is the type of question to be answered with an analysis
It is such as this But is the impermanent material form  Is the impermanent feeling  perception  mental formations  consciousness 
What is the type of question to be answered with a counterquestion
It is such as this What then is everything discriminated by the eye 
What is the type of question to be set aside
It is such as this Is the world eternal  not eternal 
both 
Is the soul the same as the body
Is the soul one thing and the body another
Does the Tathāgata exist after death
or does he both exist and not exist after death
or does he neither exist nor not exist after death 
Because sire that question of the Elder Malunkyaputta was one to be set aside the Blessed One did not answer it
Why should such a question be put aside
Because there is no reason or ground for answering it
There is no utterance or speech of the Buddhas the Blessed Ones that is without reason without ground
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is therefore I accept it
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena this too was said by the Blessed One All beings tremble at punishment all fear death But again he said An arahat has passed beyond all fear
How then revered Nāgasena does an arahat tremble with fear at punishment Or are the beings who are being burnt and scorched in hell afraid of that death which would release them from that awful place of woe
If the Blessed One said that all beings tremble at punishment and all are afraid of death then the statement that the arahat has passed beyond all fear must be false
But if the last statement was really spoken by him then the other must be false
This too is a doublepronged question it is put to you it is for you to solve
It was with regard to those beings sire who still have defilements and who are still infatuated with the view of self and who are lifted up and cast down by pleasures and pains that the Blessed One made that statement
All bourns have been cut off by the arahat all modes of arising extinguished rebirth destroyed the snares abolished delight in all becomings has been rooted out all formations have been extirpated the wholesome and the unwholesome have been ended ignorance has been demolished consciousness has been made seedless all the defilements have been burnt up and worldly things have been conquered by him Therefore an arahat does not tremble at any fear
Suppose sire a king had four chief ministers faithful famous trustworthy and placed in positions of high authority
No revered sir
Because the king has placed them in the highest positions taxation does not affect them they are beyond taxation When the king commanded everyone to pay him a tax he was referring to the rest of his subjects
Let it be revered Nāgasena I accept it as you say
The arahat is an exception to this statement all other beings are full of fear But those beings who are suffering painful sharp and severe agonies in hell who are tormented with burnings all over their bodies and limbs who are full of lamentation and cries for pity who find no protection or refuge or help who are afflicted beyond measure who in the worst and lowest conditions are still destined to further pain can these poor burning wretches be afraid of death
Yes they can
But revered Nāgasena is not hell a place of certain pain So why should beings in hell be afraid of death which would release them from that certain pain What Are they fond of hell
No indeed They do not like it They long to be released from it
That sire is the power of death because of which terror arises in them
This I do not believe revered Nāgasena that terror of death arises in those who want to be released They must rejoice at the prospect of the very condition they long for Convince me by a reason
Whoever fears
This sire is the majesty of the essential nature of death because of which all beings who still have defilements tremble at death and fear it
It is in this sense that even beings in hell who long to be released from it are afraid of death
It is good revered Nāgasena thus it is and I accept it as you say
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena this too was said by the Blessed One
On the other hand protective recitals were promulgated by the Blessed One
But if by protective recitals one can find an escape from death then the statement in the verse I quoted is false
This too is a doublepronged question more knotty than a knot It is now put to you and you have to solve it
The Blessed One sire said the verse you have quoted and protective recitals were promulgated by him But that is for those who still have some term of life remaining who are of full age and who are free from an obstruction due to kamma There is no ceremony or means to prolong the life of one whose span of existence is coming to an end
Sire even if a thousand jars of water were poured over a dead and dried up tree sapless moistureless and lifeless that tree will never become fresh again and put forth sprouts and leaves
Even so sire there is no ceremony or means no medicine and no protective recital to prolong the life of one whose span of existence is coming to an end
But sire protective recitals are a protection and assistance to those who have a period yet to live who are full of life and are free from an obstruction due to kamma
As sire a farmer guards the grain when it is ripe and ready for harvesting by preventing water from entering among the corn but makes it grow by giving it water when the corn is young and full of life
Yes revered sir several hundred times
Have you sire ever seen anyone bitten by a snake having the poison sucked back by that snake by means of an incantation
Yes revered sir even today that practice exists in the world
That is they are not bound to die due to a kamma so powerful that it must eventuate in death Well then sire to say that protective recitals are useless is a false statement
When a protective recital has been said a snake ready to bite will not bite but close its jaws the club which robbers hold aloft to strike will never strike an enraged elephant rushing up will suddenly stop a great blazing mass of fire that is surging towards one will die out a deadly poison one has eaten turns into an antidote or serves as food assassins who have come to kill will turn into slaves the trap into which one has trodden will not hold him
They protect some sire some they do not protect
It preserves some revered sir some it does not preserve
There are two reasons revered Nāgasena why food destroys life because too much is eaten or because of bad digestion Even lifegiving food can destroy life because of a bad digestion
There are three reasons sire why a protective recital does not protect because of an obstruction due to kamma because of an obstruction due to the defilements because of lack of faith
A protective recital sire that is a protection to beings may lose its protecting power because of acts done by those beings themselves It is sire as a mother nourishes the child in her womb brings it forth with gentle care and having brought it forth and cleansed it of its impurities stains and mucus then anoints it with the best and most beautiful perfumes and if others abuse it or strike it
then she strikes him with her fists or a stick Now would his mother sire get seized and be dragged along and made to appear before her husband
No revered sir
Because it was the childs own fault revered sir
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena this too was said by the Blessed One nanda it does not occur to a Tathāgata thus I will lead the Order of monks or the Order of monks is dependent on me
If the second statement is right the first must be false This too is a doublepronged question it is put to you it is for you to solve
In this question one meaning is incomplete one meaning complete
The Tathāgata sire does not conform to the assembly but the assembly conforms to the Tathāgata
This sire is conventional parlance I mine this is not an ultimate meaning Absent sire is affection in a Tathāgata absent is clinging and for a Tathāgata there is no seizing hold of anything as mine But there is help for others by cleaving to him
As sire the earth is the support of beings who are based on the ground and is their home yet the great earth has no longings such as These are mine even so the Tathāgata is the support of all beings and is their home yet the Tathāgata has no longings such as These are mine Or as a massive raincloud that is raining heavily gives growth to grass trees cattle and men and maintains their continuity and though they all subsist by rain yet the great cloud has no longings such as These are mine even so sire the Tathāgata generates and maintains wholesome mental states for all beings and though all these beings subsist by the Teacher yet the Tathāgata has no longings such as These are mine
What is the reason for this
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena it was said by the Blessed One For it is the Dhamma O Vāseṭṭha which is the best in the world as regards both what we see now and what is yet to come
This too is a doublepronged question it is put to you it is for you to solve
But there is a reason for that rule and that is this
There are these twenty personal qualities making up true recluseship and two outward signs by reason of which the recluse is worthy of salutation of respect and of reverence
What are they
The best form of selfrestraint the highest kind of selfcontrol right conduct calm manners mastery over his deeds and words subjugation of his senses patience docility faring in solitude delight in solitude meditation in solitude conscienceandshame energy diligence undertaking the training recitation of the rules interrogation by his teacher or preceptor delight in morality freedom from attachment to worldly things fulfilment of the rules of training wearing of the saffron robe and being shaven
By being deficient in none of them by being perfect in all accomplished in all endowed with all of them he reaches forward to the condition of arahatship to the condition of those who have nothing else to learn to the best stage of existence It is because he is thought of as close to arahatship that it is proper for a lay devotee who is a streamenterer to salute and rise for a monk even though he is a worldling
It is because he sees him to be in the company of those in whom all evil has been destroyed and because he feels that he is not in such a society that the lay devotee who is a streamenterer thinks it proper for him to salute and rise for a monk even though he is a worldling
It is because he knows he has joined the noblest brotherhood and that he himself has reached no such state that the lay devotee who is a streamenterer thinks it proper for him to salute and rise for a monk even though he is a worldling
It is because he listens to the recitation of the disciplinary code while he himself cannot 
Moreover sire it is because he knows that not only are all these twenty personal qualities which go to make a recluse and the two outward signs found in the monk but he also carries them on and trains others in them that the lay devotee who is a streamenterer realizing that he has no part in that tradition in the maintenance of the faith thinks it proper for him to salute and rise for a monk even though he is a worldling
Sire it is like a prince who has studied various kinds of lore with the family priest and trained in the duties of a warrior after a time when he has been anointed king he still salutes his teacher and rises for him thinking He was my teacher Even so sire it is proper for a lay devotee who is a streamenterer to salute and rise for a monk even though he is a worldling thinking He is a teacher one who upholds the succession of teachers
For sire that going forth is immovable great and lofty that is to say the condition of being a monk
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena it was said by the Elder Sāriputta the General of the Dhamma In the conduct of speech the Tathāgata is quite pure The Tathāgata brethren has no wrong conduct of speech that he should guard thinking Let not another think this of me
Now if the first statement is correct the allegation that the Tathāgata called the Elder Sudinna a foolish fellow must be false
But if that be true then the first statement must be false
This too is a doublepronged question it is put to you it is for you to solve
What the Elder Sāriputta said is true sire
and the Blessed One did call the Elder Sudinna a foolish fellow But that was not said out of rudeness of disposition it was said without anger it was merely pointing out the real nature of his conduct in a way that would do him no harm
If any man sire in this birth does not understand the Four Noble Truths then his being born as a man is in vain If while doing one thing he acts in a different way he is called a foolish fellow
Therefore the Blessed One addressed the Elder Sudinna with words of truth and not with words apart from the facts
But revered Nāgasena if someone should abuse another even though he speaks the truth we would inflict a small fine on him For he is guilty of an offence inasmuch as he although for something real used abusive words that might lead to a breach of the peace
No revered sir whatever kind of wrongdoer he be he merits censure they cut off his head or torture him or imprison him or deprive him of his goods
Properly revered Nāgasena When they hear of it the world of men and gods will be ashamed and consciencestricken more so when they see a wrongdoer and most of all when they approach one to pay him honour
No revered sir wishing to put an end to the disease he would give sharp and scarifying drugs
Even so sire the Tathāgata gives instructions for the allayment of all the diseases of the defilements The words of the Tathāgata even when harsh soften beings and make them pliable
As sire hot water softens anything that can be softened and makes it pliable even so sire the Tathāgatas words even when harsh are full of benefit and compassion
Sire just as the drinking of nasty smelling decoctions and the swallowing of highly concentrated drugs remove illnesses from beings even so sire the Tathāgatas words even though harsh are full of benefit and compassion
As sire a ball of cotton even though large falling on a man causes him no pain even so sire the Tathāgatas words even though harsh give rise to anguish in no one
In many a way revered Nāgasena has this question been well analysed It is good so it is therefore do I accept it
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena it was said by the Elders who were holding a Recital of the Dhamma
But again it was said by the Blessed One These two alms offerings nanda equal of equal fruit and of equal advantage are of much greater fruit and of much greater advantage than any other alms offering
But if that is right then the first must be wrong
How could that alms offering be of great fruit when it turned to poison gave rise to disease put an end to his lifespan and took away his life
Tell me a reason for this for the refutation of those holding other tenets People are bewildered about this thinking that the dysentery came from his eating too much out of greediness
This too is a double pronged question it is put to you it is for you to solve
The devas sire uplifted and pleased in mind and thinking This is the last meal the Tathāgata will take sprinkled a devalike nutritive essence over those truffles
Indeed they were well and lightly cooked pleasant juicy and beneficial for digestion
It was not from that source sire that any sickness fell upon the Blessed One but it was because of extreme weakness of his body and because of the waning of his lifespan that the disease arose in him and grew worse and worse
As sire when a fire is burning in a normal way if fresh fuel is supplied it will blaze up much more or as when a stream is flowing along in a normal way
or as the stomach when full in a normal way would stretch if more food is eaten even so sire it was because of the extreme weakness of his body and because of the waning of his lifespan that the disease arose in his body and grew worse and worse There was no defect sire in that alms offering and you cannot impute any harm to it
Because of the attainment of the exalted conditions which resulted from them
Of the attainment of nine successive abidings sire in forward order and in reverse order 
Yes sire
It is wonderful and marvellous
how great are those nine successive abidings in that because of them those gifts are made of greater fruit and  There is no certainty about the sūkaramaddava which constituted the Buddhas last meal It could have been mushrooms tender sprouts of bamboo or tender pork The nine successive abidings are the four finematerial jhānas the four immaterial attainments and the cessation of perception and feeling Forward order is from the lowest to the highest reverse order from the highest to the lowest greater advantage than any others
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is therefore do I accept it
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena this too was said by the Tathāgata Do not nanda be occupied with honouring the Tathāgatas bodily remains
Both the passages you quoted sire were spoken by the Blessed One This too is a doublepronged question it is put to you it is for you to solve
Both the passages you quoted sire were spoken by the Blessed One But it was not to everyone it was to the Conquerors sons that it was said Do not nanda be occupied with honouring the Tathāgatas bodily remains
Veneration is not work for the Conquerors sons but rather this is to be done by the Conquerors sons the thorough comprehension of formations proper attention contemplation of the four foundations of mindfulness fixing the mind on the object of meditation fighting the defilements and intentness on their own goal These are the things the sons of the Conqueror ought to do leaving veneration to others whether devas or humans
That is so sire just as it is the business of the princes of the earth to learn all about elephants horses chariots bows swords documents the law of property the policy of statecraft hearing cases gaining intelligence fighting and recruiting while husbandry merchandise and the care of cattle are the business of ordinary merchants and workers
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena the Blessed One said If monks others should speak in praise of me or of the Dhamma or of the Order you should not thereupon indulge in joy or delight or exultation of the mind On the other hand the Tathāgata was so delighted and pleased and exultant at the deserved praise bestowed by Sela the brahmin that he still further magnified his own goodness in that he said
I roll the Wheel by Dhamma The Wheel that cannot be rolled back
Now if the passage first quoted is right then the second must be wrong
This too is a doublepronged question it is put to you it is for you to solve
Both your quotations sire are correct But the first passage was spoken by the Blessed One when he was illustrating correctly exactly truthfully and as it is the distinguishing mark of the Dhamma with its essence and its flavour
The second passage was not spoken for the sake of gain or fame or for the sake of winning adherents or because he was yearning for pupils But out of sympathy compassion and desiring their welfare conscious that thereby There will be understanding of Dhamma by this one and by three hundred brahmin youths he said A king am I Sela an incomparable king under Dhamma
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena this too was said by the Blessed One I am without wrath gone is barrenness of mind On the other hand the Tathāgata dismissed the Elders Sāriputta and Moggallāna together with their company of disciples Now revered Nāgasena did the Tathāgata dismiss the company when he was angry or did he dismiss it when he was pleased
Please explain this to me If revered Nāgasena he dismissed the company when he was angry well then wrath was not subdued in the Tathāgata If he dismissed it when he was pleased well then it was dismissed without ground and in ignorance
This too is a doublepronged question it is put to you it is for you to solve
Sire the Blessed One did say I am without wrath gone is barrenness of mind and he did dismiss the Elders Sāriputta and Moggallāna with their company of disciples But that was not through illtemper Suppose sire some man stumbled over a root or a stake or a stone or a potsherd or on uneven ground and fell Would it be that the great earth angry with him made him fall
No revered sir The great earth feels neither anger against any man nor delight It is altogether free from ill will neither does it need to fawn on anyone He stumbled and fell because of his carelessness
Even so sire there is no illtemper or satisfaction in the Tathāgatas The Tathāgatas Arahats Perfect Buddhas are free from approval and repugnance So the company was dismissed on account of what it itself had done through its own fault
As to this sire the great ocean does not endure association with a corpse Any corpse there may be in it that does it promptly cast up on the shore
Now sire is the great ocean angry that it casts up that corpse
No revered sir there is no illtemper or satisfaction in the great ocean the great ocean is free from approval and repugnance
Even so sire there is no illtemper or satisfaction in the Tathāgatas The Tathāgatas Arahats Perfect Buddhas are free from approval and repugnance So the company was dismissed on account of what it itself had done through its own fault
As sire one who has stumbled on the earth is fallen down so one who has stumbled in the Conquerors excellent teaching is dismissed
As a corpse is cast up by the great ocean so one who has stumbled in the Conquerors excellent teaching is dismissed
But though the Tathāgata sire dismissed those monks he desired their welfare he desired their weal he desired their happiness he desired their purification He dismissed them thinking Thus will these be released from birth old age disease and death
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena this too was said by the Blessed One A monk should not attempt suicide Whosoever does so should be dealt with according to the rule
But on the other hand you say On whatsoever subject the Blessed One was addressing the disciples he always and with various similes taught the Dhamma in order to bring about the destruction of birth ageing disease and death and whoever had passed beyond birth ageing disease and death him did he praise with the highest praise
This too is a doublepronged question it is put to you it is for you to solve
The regulation you quote sire was laid down by the Blessed One
One who is moral sire possessed of morality is like an antidote for destroying the poison of the defilements in beings He is like a healing balm for allaying the sickness of the defilements like water for carrying off the dust and dirt of the defilements like a ship for beings to go beyond the four floods like a caravan leader for taking beings across the desert of births like the wind for extinguishing the three fierce fires in beings like a great raincloud for filling beings with purposeful thought like a teacher for making beings train themselves in what is wholesome and he is like a good guide for pointing out to beings the path of security
It was in order that one who was moral like that might not perish sire who was of many special qualities of various special qualities of immeasurable special qualities a mass of special qualities a heap of special qualities and bringing welfare to all beings that the Blessed One sire out of compassion for all beings laid down this rule of training A monk should not attempt suicide Whosoever does so should be dealt with according to the rule
Birth sire is suffering so is ageing disease and death Sorrow is suffering so is lamentation pain grief and despair Association with the unpleasant is suffering so is separation from the pleasant Death of a mother is suffering so is death of a father brother sister child wife or of a relation Misfortune concerning ones relations is suffering so is misfortune concerning ones health wealth moral habit or ones views Fear produced by despots is suffering so is fear produced by robbers enemies famine fire flood waves crocodiles whirlpools and fierce fishes Fear of selfreproach is suffering so is fear of others reproach punishment or misfortune What is fearful in an assembly is suffering so is fear for ones livelihood the foreboding of death and the various punishments inflicted on criminals
As sire when it has rained down on the slopes of the Himalayas the water flows in its course along the Ganges through and over rocks and pebbles and gravel whirlpools and eddies and rapids and the stumps and branches of trees which obstruct and oppose its passage even so sire each being caught in the succession of births and rebirths has to endure such and such manifold and various sufferings
Occurrence sire is suffering nonoccurrence is bliss Illustrating the special quality of nonoccurrence and the peril there is in occurrence the Blessed One sire for the realization of nonoccurrence roused disciples to pass beyond birth ageing disease and death
This was the reason sire why the Blessed One roused disciples
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena this has been said by the Blessed One The Tathāgata monks the Arahat the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha is the discoverer of a way that was unknown
But if the way he saw was an ancient way then the statement that it was unknown must be wrong
This too is a doublepronged question it is put to you it is for you to solve
Both the quotations you make sire are accurate and both the statements so made are correct When the previous Tathāgatas sire had disappeared then there being no teacher left their way too disappeared And it was that waythough then broken up crumbled away gone to ruin closed in no longer passable quite lost to viewthat the Tathāgata having gained thorough knowledge of it saw by the eye of his wisdom and knew that that was the way the Perfect Buddhas of the past had followed Therefore he said I monks saw the ancient way the ancient path that had been followed by the Perfect Buddhas of the past
It is sire as when a mother brings forth from her womb the child that is already there and the saying is that the mother has given birth to the child
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena this too was said by the Blessed One I monks am a brahmin one to ask a favour of
But if he were a king then he must have spoken falsely when he said he was a brahmin
He must have been either a noble warrior or a brahmin since no one is of two castes in one birth This too is a doublepronged question it is put to you it is for you to solve
Both quotations you have made sire are correct But there is a good reason why the Tathāgata should have been both a brahmin and a king
Sire because all evil unwholesome states were put away by the Tathāgata because they were got rid of removed dispelled annihilated destroyed exhausted extinguished and allayed the Tathāgata is called a brahmin
A brahmin sire is one who has passed beyond hesitation perplexity and doubt The Tathāgata too has done this so he is called a brahmin
A brahmin sire has escaped from every sort and class of becoming is entirely free from evil and from stain and is without a peer The Tathāgata is all of these things so he is called a brahmin
A brahmin sire is one who cultivates within himself the highest and best of the excellent and supreme conditions of the heart The Tathāgata too does this so he is called a brahmin
A brahmin is one who sustains the ancient instruction custom and tradition of learning by heart teaching accepting of gifts taming control and restraint The Tathāgata carries on the line of the tradition of the ancient instruction custom and tradition enjoined by the Conquerors regarding all these things so he is called a brahmin
A brahmin engages in meditation an abiding in immense ease The Tathāgata too does this so he is called a brahmin
A brahmin knows what has happened in all his becomings and bourns The Tathāgata too knows this so he is called a brahmin
The appellation brahmin was not given to the Blessed One by his mother or father nor by relatives or kinsmen nor was it given by recluses and brahmins nor by devas This appellation signifying final release that is to say brahmin is a true description of the Buddhas of Blessed Ones who at the root of the Bodhi Tree have together with their attainment of omniscient knowledge routed Māras armies and put away all evil unwholesome states whether past future or present This is a true description of what was attained what appeared and what came aboutFor this reason the Tathāgata is called a brahmin
But for what reason revered Nāgasena is the Tathāgata called a king
A king sire is anyone who reigns and governs the people The Blessed One too reigns through Dhamma in the tenthousandfold worldsystem he governs people together with the devas the world with Māras and Brahmās with recluses and brahmins so he is called a king
A king sire is one who surpassing all people and men bringing joy to his relatives and grief to his opponents raises aloft the pure white sunshade of sovereignty the renowned symbol of great fame and splendour adorned with a full hundred ribs and its handle made of solid hardwood The Blessed One too bringing grief to Māras army that was faring along wrongly and joy to devas and humans who were faring along rightly raised aloft in the tenthousandfold worldsystem the pure white sunshade of sovereignty pure and stainless in the whiteness of emancipation the renowned symbol of great fame and splendour adorned with a full hundred ribs of knowledge and its handle made of solid hardwood of forbearance For this reason too the Blessed One is called a king
A king is one to be much honoured by the multitudes of people who approach him and come to his presence The Blessed One too sire is one to be much honoured by the multitudes of devas and humans who approach him and come to his presence For this reason too the Blessed One is called a king
A king sire when pleased with a strenuous servant gladdens his heart by bestowing at his own good pleasure a gift the servant has chosen The Blessed One too sire when pleased with anyone who has been strenuous in word or deed or thought gladdens his heart by bestowing upon him as a  The Questions of King Milinda selected gift the supreme deliverance from all sorrow For this reason too the Blessed One is called a king
A king is one who severely rebukes brings to ruin or destroys someone who has transgressed a royal command Sire a shameless man who transgressing a command in the noble teaching of the Blessed One and being degraded looked down upon and found fault with for his moral weakness is shut out from the Conquerors noble teaching For this reason too the Blessed One is called a king
A king is one who in his turn proclaiming laws and regulations according to the instructions laid down in succession by righteous kings of ancient times and thus carrying on his rule in righteousness becomes beloved and dear to the people desired in the world and by the force of his righteousness establishes his dynasty long in the land The Blessed One sire proclaiming in his turn laws and regulations according to the instructions laid down in succession by the Buddhas of ancient times and thus in righteousness being teacher of the world is beloved and dear to both gods and humans desired by them and by the force of his righteousness makes his teaching last long in the land For this reason too the Blessed One is called a king
Thus sire so manifold are the reasons why the Blessed One should be both brahmin and king that a very subtle monk could not enumerate them even in an aeon What is the good then of speaking of them any further So accept what I have said here in brief
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena you say The Tathāgata through four incalculables and a hundred thousand aeons brought his omniscient knowledge to perfection for the sake of pulling out great masses of people from saṃsāra
Now revered Nāgasena was it because of fear that the Tathāgata hesitated or was it because of unclarity or was it from weakness or was it because he had not after all attained to omniscience What was the reason for that Please tell me the reason so as to remove my doubts
For if for so long a time he had perfected his knowledge for the sake of pulling out great masses of people from saṃsāra then the statement that he hesitated to teach Dhamma must be wrong
But if that is true the other statement must be false
This too is a doublepronged question deep difficult to penetrate it is put to you it is for you to solve
The statements in both the passages you quote sire are correct But when the Tathāgata attained to omniscience his mind inclined to little effort and not to teach the Dhamma
because he saw how difficult it was for beings who were delighting in sensual pleasures and tightly grasping the false view of self to penetrate the Dhamma that is deep subtle difficult to see difficult to understand and exquisite So he wavered at the thought Whom shall I teach What shall I teach  Precisely his intention was that the Dhamma should be penetrated by beings
As sire a physician on approaching a man who is suffering from all kinds of diseases considers thus By what means or by what medicine can I allay his disease  even so sire the Tathāgata having seen people suffering from all the diseases of the defilements and how difficult it was for them to penetrate the Dhamma that is deep subtle difficult to see difficult to understand and exquisite wavered at the thought Whom shall I teach What shall I teach  Precisely his intention was that the Dhamma should be penetrated by beings
Moreover sire this is an inherent necessity in all Tathāgatas that they should teach the Dhamma at the request of Brahmā
What is the reason for this
At that time all these peopleascetics and wanderers recluses and brahminswere worshippers of Brahmā reverencing him and relying on him Therefore at the thought The world with the devas will bow down to the Dhamma feel confidence and faith in it because that one who is so powerful famed well known renowned high and lofty bows down to it Tathāgatas teach Dhamma at the request of Brahmā
As sire that which some king or kings chief minister bows down to or reverences that will the rest of the people bow down to and reverence because one who is very powerful has bowed down to it even so sire as Brahmā bows down to Tathāgatas so will the world and devas bow down to them The world sire honours what is honoured Therefore Brahmā requests all Tathāgatas to teach Dhamma and for this reason Tathāgatas teach Dhamma at the request of Brahmā
It is good revered Nāgasena well unravelled is the question the explanation was very learned So it is therefore do I accept it
But on the other hand he said I monks saw the ancient way the ancient path that had been followed by the Perfect Buddhas of the past
If revered Nāgasena the Tathāgata is the discoverer of a way previously unknown then it must be wrong that it was an ancient way that he saw an ancient path that had been followed by the Perfect Buddhas of the past
And it was a way which there being no teacher left through the disappearance of previous Tathāgatas had become broken up crumbled away gone to ruin closed in no longer passable and quite lost to view that the Tathāgata made passable again Therefore did he say The Tathāgata monks the Arahat the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha is the discoverer of a way that was unknown
or sire as when some man sees something that had been lost people declare That article was produced by him
or sire as when a man who is clearing a wood carries away some soil people declare That is his soil but though that soil was not produced by him he is called the owner of the soil because he had done some work on it even so sire did the Tathāgata having gained a thorough knowledge of it by the eye of his wisdom bring back to life and make passable again a way that was already there though then broken up crumbled away gone to ruin closed in no longer passable and quite lost to view Therefore he said The Tathāgata monks the Arahat the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha is the discoverer of a way that was unknown
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is therefore do I accept it
And again it was said A king am I Sela
If revered Nāgasena the Blessed One was a brahmin then he must have spoken falsely when he said he was a king
What is this reason revered Nāgasena
Now if the Blessed One forbade suicide that saying of yours must be wrong
but if not then the prohibition must be wrong
and yet our saying you refer to is true There is a reason for this a reason for which the Blessed One objected to a person destroying himself and yet also aroused him to do so
What revered Nāgasena may that reason be
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is therefore do I accept it
Knowledge established by overcoming doubt about the three divisions of time by means of discerning the conditions of that same mentalitymateriality is called purification by overcoming doubt
WAYS OF DISCERNING CAUSE AND CONDITION  The bhikkhu who wants to accomplish this  just as when a skilled physician encounters a disease he seeks its origin
or just as when a compassionate man sees a tender little child lying on its back in the road he wonders who its parents are  sets about seeking the cause and condition for that mentalitymateriality
NEITHER CREATED BY A CREATOR NOR CAUSELESS  To begin with he considers thus Firstly this mentalitymateriality is not causeless because if that were so it would follow that having no causes to differentiate it it would be identical everywhere always and for all It has no Overlord etc because of the nonexistence of any Overlord etc  over and above mentalitymateriality
And because if people then argue that mentality materiality itself is its Overlord etc then it follows that their mentalitymateriality which they call the Overlord etc would itself be causeless
Consequently there must be a cause and a condition for it What are they 
Having thus directed his attention to mentalitymaterialitys cause and condition he first discerns the cause and condition for the material body in this way When this body is born it is not born inside a blue red or white lotus or waterlily etc or inside a store of jewels or pearls etc on the contrary like a worm in rotting flesh in a rotting corpse in rotting dough in a drain in a cesspool etc it is born in between the receptacle for undigested food and the receptacle for digested food behind the belly lining in front of the backbone surrounded by the bowel and the entrails in a place that is stinking disgusting repulsive and extremely cramped being itself stinking disgusting and repulsive
When it is born thus its causes are the four things namely ignorance craving clinging and kamma since it is they that bring about its birth and nutriment is its condition since it is that that consolidates it So five things constitute its cause and condition
And of these the three beginning with ignorance are the decisivesupport for this body as the mother is for her infant
and kamma begets it as the father does the child
ITS OCCURANCE IS ALWAYS DUE TO CONDITIONS After discerning the material bodys conditions in this way he again discerns the mental body in the way beginning Due to eye and to visible object eye consciousness arises 
When he has thus seen that the occurrence of mentalitymateriality is due to conditions then he sees that as now so in the past too its occurrence was due to conditions and in the future too its occurrence will be due to conditions
When he sees it in this way all his uncertainty is abandoned that is to say the five kinds of uncertainty about the past stated thus Was I in the past Was I not in the past What was I in the past How was I in the past Having been what what was I in the past   and also the five kinds of uncertainty about the future stated thus Shall I be in the future Shall I not be in the future What shall I be in the future How shall I be in the future Having been what what shall I be in the future   and also the six kinds of uncertainty about the present stated thus Am I Am I not What am I How am I Whence will this being have come Whither will it be bound  
GENERAL AND PARTICULAR CONDITIONS Another sees the conditions for mentality as twofold according to what is common to all and to what is not common to all and that for materiality as fourfold according to kamma and so on
The condition for mentality is twofold as that which is common to all and that which is not common to all
Herein the six doors beginning with the eye and the six objects beginning with visible data are a conditioncommontoall for mentality because the occurrence of all kinds of mentality classified as profitable etc is due to that condition
But attention etc are not common to all
Kamma consciousness temperature and nutriment constitute this fourfold condition for materiality beginning with kamma
Herein it is only when it is past that kamma is a condition for kammaoriginated materiality
Temperature and nutriment are conditions at the instant of their presence for temperatureoriginated and nutrimentoriginated materiality
This is how one man discerns the conditions for mentalitymateriality
When he has seen that the occurrence of mentalitymateriality is due to conditions in this way he sees also that as now so too in the past its occurrence was due to conditions and in the future its occurrence will be due to conditions
When he sees it in this way his uncertainty about the three periods of time is abandoned in the way already stated
DEPENDENT ORIGINATION IN REVERSE ORDER Another when he has seen that the formations called mentalitymateriality arrive at aging and that those that have aged dissolve discerns mentalitymaterialitys conditions by means of dependent origination in reverse order in this way This is called aginganddeath of formations it comes to be when there is birth and birth when there is becoming and becoming when there is clinging and clinging when there is craving and craving when there is feeling and feeling when there is contact and contact when there is the sixfold base and the sixfold base when there is mentalitymateriality and mentalitymateriality when there is consciousness and consciousness when there are formations and formations when there is ignorance
DEPENDENT ORIGINATION IN DIRECT ORDER Another discerns mentalitymaterialitys conditions by means of dependent origination in direct order as already shown in detail doing so in this way So with ignorance as condition there are formations 
Then his uncertainty is abandoned in the way already stated
KAMMA AND KAMMARESULT Another discerns mentalitymaterialitys conditions by means of the round of kamma and the round of kammaresult in this way In the previous kammaprocess becoming there is delusion which is ignorance there is accumulation which is formations there is attachment which is craving there is embracing which is clinging there is volition which is becoming thus these five things in the previous kammaprocess becoming are conditions for rebirthlinking here in the present becoming
Here in the present becoming there is rebirthlinking which is consciousness there is descent into the womb which is mentalitymateriality there is sensitivity which is sense base there is what is touched which is contact there is what is felt which is feeling thus these five things here in the present rebirthprocess becoming have their conditions in kamma done in the past Here in the present becoming with the maturing of the bases there is delusion which is ignorance there is accumulation which is formations there is attachment which is craving there is embracing which is clinging there is volition which is becoming thus these five things here in the present kamma process becoming are conditions for rebirthlinking in the future In the future there is rebirthlinking which is consciousness there is descent into the womb which is mentalitymateriality there is sensitivity which is sense base there is what is touched which is contact there is what is felt which is feeling thus these five things in the future rebirthprocess becoming have their conditions in kamma done here in the present becoming 
Herein kamma is fourfold to be experienced here and now to be experienced on rebirth to be experienced in some subsequent becoming and lapsed kamma
Of these the volition either profitable or unprofitable of the first of the seven impulsion consciousnesses in a single cognitive series of impulsions is called kamma to be experienced here and now
But if it cannot do so it is called lapsed kamma  according to the triad described thus There has been kamma there has been no kammaresult there will be no kammaresult 
 The volition of the seventh impulsion that accomplishes its purpose is called kamma to be experienced on rebirth
If it cannot do so it is called lapsed kamma in the way already described
 The volition of the five impulsions between these two is called kamma to be experienced in some subsequent becoming
Another fourfold classification of kamma is this weighty habitual death threshold and kamma stored up by being performed
Herein when there is weighty and unweighty kamma the weightier whether profitable or unprofitable whether kamma consisting in matricide or kamma of the exalted spheres takes precedence in ripening
 Likewise when there is habitual and unhabitual kamma the more habitual whether consisting in good or bad conduct takes precedence in ripening
 Deaththreshold kamma is that remembered at the time of death
 Kamma not included in the foregoing three kinds that has been often repeated is called kamma stored up by being performed This brings about rebirthlinking if other kinds fail
Another fourfold classification of kamma is this productive consolidating frustrating and supplanting
Herein what is called productive is both profitable and unprofitable
It produces the material and immaterial aggregates both at rebirthlinking and during the course of an existence
 Consolidating kamma cannot produce result but when result has already been produced in the provision of rebirth linking by other kamma it consolidates the pleasure or pain that arises and makes it last
 And when result has already been produced in the provision of rebirthlinking by other kamma frustrating kamma frustrates and obstructs the pleasure or pain that arises and does not allow it to last
 Supplanting kamma is itself both profitable and unprofitable and it supplants other weaker kamma prevents its resulting and usurps that kammas opportunity in order to cause its own result
But when the opportunity has thus been furnished by the other kamma it is that supplanting kammas result that is called arisen
The succession of kamma and its result in the twelve classes of kamma is clear in its true nature only to the Buddhas knowledge of kamma and its result which knowledge is not shared by disciples
That is why this explanation of difference in kamma shows only the mere headings
This is how one man discerns mentalitymateriality by means of the round of kamma and the round of kammaresult applying this twelvefold kamma classification to the round of kamma
When he has thus seen by means of the round of kamma and the round of kammaresult how mentalitymaterialitys occurrence is due to a condition he sees that as now so in the past its occurrence was due to a condition by means of the round of kamma and the round of kammaresult and that in the future its occurrence will be due to a condition by means of the round of kamma and the round of kammaresult
This is kamma and kammaresult the round of kamma and the round of kammaresult the occurrence of kamma and the occurrence of kammaresult the continuity of kamma and the continuity of kammaresult action and the fruit of action
Kammaresult proceeds from kamma Result has kamma for its source
Future becoming springs from kamma And this is how the world goes round
When he sees thus he abandons all his uncertainty that is to say the sixteen kinds described in the way beginning Was I in the past  see 
NO DOER APART FROM KAMMA AND RESULT In all kinds of becoming generation destiny station and abode there appears only mentalitymateriality which occurs by means of linking of cause with fruit
He sees no doer over and above the doing no experiencer of the result over and above the occurrence of the result
But he sees clearly with right understanding that the wise say doer when there is doing and experiencer when there is experiencing simply as a mode of common usage
Hence the Ancients said
There is no doer of a deed Or one who reaps the deeds result
Phenomena alone flow on No other view than this is right
And so while kamma and result Thus causally maintain their round
As seed and tree succeed in turn No first beginning can be shown
Nor in the future round of births Can they be shown not to occur
Sectarians not knowing this Have failed to gain selfmastery
They assume a being see it as Eternal or annihilated
Adopt the sixtytwo wrong views Each contradicting one another
The stream of craving bears them on Caught in the meshes of their views
And as the stream thus bears them on They are not freed from suffering
A monk disciple of the Buddha With direct knowledge of this fact
Can penetrate this deep and subtle Void conditionality
There is no kamma in result Nor does result exist in kamma
Though they are void of one another There is no fruit without the kamma
As fire does not exist inside The sun a gem cowdung nor yet
Outside them but is brought to be By means of its component parts
So neither can result be found Within the kamma nor without
Nor does the kamma still persist In the result it has produced
The kamma of its fruit is void No fruit exists yet in the kamma
And still the fruit is born from it Wholly depending on the kamma
For here there is no Brahmā God Creator of the round of births
Phenomena alone flow on Cause and component their condition
FULLUNDERSTANDING OF THE KNOWN When he has discerned the conditions of mentalitymateriality in this way by means of the round of kamma and the round of kammaresult and has abandoned uncertainty about the three periods of time then all past future and present states are understood by him in accordance with death and rebirth linking This is his fullunderstanding of the known 
He understands thus Aggregates produced in the past with kamma as condition ceased there too But other aggregates are produced in this becoming with past kamma as their condition although there is no single thing that has come over from the past becoming to this becoming And aggregates produced in this becoming with kamma as their condition will cease And in the future becoming other aggregates will be produced although no single thing will go over from this becoming to the future becoming
Furthermore just as while the recitation from the teachers mouth does not enter into the pupils mouth yet recitation does not because of that fail to take place in the pupils mouthand while the potion drunk by the proxy does not enter the sick mans stomach yet the sickness does not because of that fail to be curedand while the arrangement of the ornaments on the face does not pass over to the reflection of the face in the looking glass yet the arrangement of the ornaments does not because of that fail to appearand while the flame of a lamp does not move over from one wick to another yet the flame does not because of that fail to be producedso too while nothing whatever moves over from the past becoming to this becoming or from this to the future becoming yet aggregates bases and elements do not fail to be produced here with aggregates bases and elements in the past becoming as their condition or in the future becoming with aggregates bases and elements here as their condition
Just as eyeconsciousness comes next Following on mind element
Which though it does not come from that Yet fails not next to be produced
So too in rebirthlinking conscious Continuity takes place
The prior consciousness breaks up The subsequent is born from that
They have no interval between Nor gap that separates the two
While naught whatever passes over Still rebirthlinking comes about
When all states are understood by him thus in accordance with death and rebirthlinking his knowledge of discerning the conditions of mentality materiality is sound in all its aspects and the sixteen kinds of doubt are more effectively abandoned
And not only that but the eight kinds of doubt that occur in the way beginning thus He is doubtful about the Master are abandoned too and the sixtytwo kinds of views are suppressed 
The knowledge that has been established by the overcoming of doubt about the three periods of time by discerning the conditions of mentalitymateriality according to the various methods should be understood as purification by overcoming doubt
For this is said
When he brings to mind as impermanent what states does he correctly know and see How is there right seeing How by inference from that are all formations clearly seen as impermanent Wherein is doubt abandoned
When he brings to mind as painful  When he brings to mind as notself what states does he correctly know and see  Wherein is doubt abandoned
When he brings to mind as impermanent he correctly knows and sees the sign Hence right seeing is said
Thus by inference from that all formations are clearly seen as impermanent
Herein doubt is abandoned
When he brings to mind as painful he correctly knows and sees occurrence Hence  When he brings to mind as notself he correctly knows and sees the sign and occurrence Hence right seeing is said
Thus by inference from that all states are clearly seen as notself
Herein doubt is abandoned
Correct knowledge and right seeing and overcoming of doubt are these things different in meaning and different in the letter or are they one in meaning and only the letter is different
Correct knowledge and right seeing and overcoming of doubtthese things are one in meaning and only the letter is different 
When a man practicing insight has become possessed of this knowledge he has found comfort in the Buddhas Dispensation he has found a foothold he is certain of his destiny he is called a lesser streamenterer
So would a bhikkhu overcome His doubts then ever mindfully
Let him discern conditions both Of mind and matter thoroughly
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
in the Treatise on the Development of Understanding
and nutriment sustains it as the wetnurse does the infant
for wise attention hearing the Good Dhamma etc are a condition only for the profitable while the opposite kinds are a condition for the unprofitable Kamma etc are a condition for the resultant mentality and the lifecontinuum etc are a condition for the functional
consciousness is a condition when it is arising for consciousnessoriginated materiality
Then his uncertainty is abandoned in the way already stated
it gives its result in this same selfhood
it gives its result in the next selfhood
it gives its result in the future when it gets the opportunity
and however long the round of rebirths continues it never becomes lapsed kamma
for when a man near death can remember kamma he is born according to that
But the succession of kamma and its result can be known in part by one practicing insight
Other terms for it are knowledge of the relations of states and correct knowledge and right vision
Ignorance is a condition formations are conditionally arisen
and both these states are conditionally arisen  understanding of discernment of conditions thus is knowledge of the causal relationship of states  And
The nineteenth chapter
called The Description of Purification by Overcoming Doubt
But since materiality has efficient power at the instant of its presence with the acquisition of a postnascence condition etc it is therefore said that temperature and nutriment are conditions at the instant of their presence for temperatureoriginated and nutrimentoriginated materiality Temperature and nutriment give rise to materiality at the instant of their own presence by acquiring outside temperature and nutriment as their condition is the meaning
For this is said Because profitable sense sphere kamma has been performed stored up there comes to be eyeconsciousness 
For when the fruit arises from kamma that is actually past it does so because of kamma having been performed and because of storage
 Certainly it has not been shown where the connectedness of material things is broken off But the simile does not apply because there is connectedness of immaterial things here
For in the world kamma has never been shown to give fruit while it is actually being effected nor is there any text to that effect
But is it not also the fact that no fruit has ever been shown to come from a vanished cause either Or even a cock to crow because of that
If the fruit were to arise from present kamma the fruit would have arisen in the same moment in which the kamma was being accumulated and that is not seen nor is it desirable
Since consciousness has efficient power only at the instant of its arising with the acquisition of a proximity condition etc it therefore only gives rise to materiality while it is arising
To be experienced here and now means kamma whose fruit is to be experienced in this present selfhood
To be experienced on rebirth means kamma whose fruit is to be experienced in the becoming next to the present becoming
To be experienced in some subsequent existence means kamma whose fruit is to be experienced in some successive selfhood other than either that here and now or next to that here and now
Lapsed kamma is kamma of which it has to be said There has been kamma but there has not been is not and will not be kammaresult
The volition of the first impulsion which has efficient power by not being prevented by opposition and by having acquired the distinction of a condition and which has definitely occurred as a prior kammaformation of the appropriate kind giving its fruit in this same selfhood is called to be experienced here and now
For while that first impulsion volition being effective in the way stated is helpful to what is associated with its special qualities in the impulsion continuity yet because it wields little power over aspects and because it has little result owing to lack of repetition it is not like the other two kinds kamma that looks beyond the occurring continuity and looks to obtain an opportunity it gives its fruit here only as mere result during the course of becoming like a mere flower
But if it cannot do so kammas giving of result comes about only through the due concurrence of conditions consisting of essentials of becoming means etc failing which it is unable to give its result in that selfhood
That accomplishes its purpose that fulfils its purpose consisting in giving etc and in killing etc
For the seventh impulsion to which this refers
is the final impulsion in the series and when it has acquired distinction in the way already stated and has acquired the service of repetition by the previous impulsions it gives its result in the next selfhood and is called to be experienced on rebirth 
Weighty kamma is very reprehensible unprofitable kamma and very powerful profitable kamma
Habitual kamma is what is habitually continually done and repeated
Deaththreshold kamma is what is remembered with great vividness at the time next before death
what is meant is that there is no question about what is done at the time of death
That has been often repeated he draws a distinction between this kind of kamma as stated and the habitual kind
and he likewise excludes kamma to be experienced here and now from it because the bringing on of rebirthlinking is admitted
for the tetrad beginning with the weighty is stated as productive of rebirthlinking
Herein the weighty ripens first of all
And the last three when produced can be strong or weak 
When weighty kamma is lacking what has been much done ripens When that is lacking deaththreshold kamma ripens When that too is lacking then kamma done in previous births which is called kamma stored up by being performed ripens
and that is why it is so called
This is the province of the Tathāgatas Knowledge of the Great Exposition of Kamma in other words the mastery of the order of ripening of such and such kamma for such and such reasons
Productive kamma is what produces resultant continuity by providing rebirth linking and so on
Consolidating kamma prolongs the occurrence of the continuity of pleasure or pain or the endurance of materiality
Frustrating kamma slowly diminishes the endurance of pleasure or pain when they occur
Supplanting kamma however cuts off weak kamma and makes its own result arise This is their difference 
It cuts off the result of other kamma without giving any result of its own
Another method is this when some kamma has been done and there is either in rebirthlinking or in the course of an existence the arising of material instances due to the result of kamma performed that kamma is productive
When some kamma has been performed and the desirable or undesirable fruit generated by other kamma has its production facilitated and its endurance aided and lengthened by the suppression of conditions that would interfere with it and by the arousing of conditions that would strengthen it that kamma is supporting
When some kamma has been performed and profitable fruit or unprofitable fruit generated by productive kamma is obstructed by it respectively in the form of sickness or of disquieting of elements that is frustrating kamma
But when some kamma has been done by which the fruit of other kamma is ruined and cut off by being supplanted by what cuts it off although it was fit for longer endurance because of the efficacy of the kamma that was producing it that kamma is supplanting 
Because it is a speciality of the Buddha and because it is the province of the knowledge that is not shared by disciples  it is called not shared by disciples
That is why only a part can be known it cannot all be known because it is not the province of such knowledge 
But on the other hand you say Just after he attained to omniscience his mind inclined to little effort and not to teach the Dhamma
As revered Nāgasena an archer or his pupil who had trained for many days in practice for the sake of fighting might hesitate when the day of the great battle had come
or as a wrestler or his pupil who had trained for many days in wrestling might hesitate when the day of the wrestling match had come even so the Tathāgata through four incalculables and a hundred thousand aeons brought his omniscient knowledge to perfection for the sake of pulling out great masses of people from saṃsāra yet when he had attained to omniscience he hesitated to teach the Dhamma
One assumes about forms 
One assumes about consciousness at the eye 
One assumes about contact at the eye 
One assumes about feeling 
One assumes about craving that This is me this is my self this is what I am 
He grows disenchanted with the intellect disenchanted with ideas disenchanted with consciousness at the intellect disenchanted with contact at the intellect disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with craving
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion he is released
With release there is the knowledge Released
He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for this world
That a personwithout abandoning passionobsession with regard to a feeling of pleasure without abolishing resistanceobsession with regard to a feeling of pain without uprooting ignoranceobsession with regard to a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain without abandoning ignorance and giving rise to clear knowingwould put an end to suffering  stress in the here  now Such a thing isnt possible
If when touched by a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain one does not discern as it has come to be the origination passing away allure drawback or escape from that feeling
then ones ignoranceobsession gets obsessed
then ones resistanceobsession gets obsessed
One assumes about the intellect that This is not me this is not my self this is not what I am
One assumes about ideas
One assumes about consciousness at the intellect
One assumes about contact at the intellect
One assumes about feeling
One assumes about craving that This is not me this is not my self this is not what I am
One assumes about the body
One assumes about the tongue
One assumes about the nose
One assumes about the ear
Now this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentification One assumes about the eye that This is not me this is not my self this is not what I am
One assumes about forms
One assumes about consciousness at the eye
One assumes about contact at the eye
One assumes about feeling
One assumes about craving that This is not me this is not my self this is not what I am
One assumes about the intellect that This is me this is my self this is what I am
One assumes about ideas
One assumes about consciousness at the intellect
One assumes about contact at the intellect
One assumes about feeling
One assumes about craving that This is me this is my self this is what I am
One assumes about the ear
One assumes about the nose
One assumes about the tongue
One assumes about the body
Furthermore sire this was said by the Elder Kumāra Kassapa a versatile talker when he was illustrating the world beyond to the chieftain Pāyāsi For as long a time chieftain as recluses and brahmins who are moral and of lovely character stand fast for so long do they fare along for the welfare of the great masses of people for the good and gain and weal of gods and men
But what is the reason for which the Blessed One aroused his disciples to bring about the destruction of birth ageing disease and death
It is good revered Nāgasena the question is well unravelled the explanation reasonably spoken so it is thus do I accept it
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Exalted One was travelling along the highway between Rājagaha and Nālandā together with a great company of bhikkhus with about five hundred bhikkhus
 Thus have I heard  Once the Lord was travelling along the main road between Rajagaha and Nalanda with a large company of some five hundred monks
At the same time the wanderer Suppiya was also travelling along the highway between Rājagaha and Nālandā together with his pupil the youth Brahmadatta
Along the way the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha But his pupil the youth Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
Thus these two teacher and pupil followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus making assertions in direct contradiction to each other
Then the Exalted One together with the company of bhikkhus entered the royal resthouse in the Ambalaṭṭhika garden in order to pass the night
The wanderer Suppiya together with his pupil the youth Brahmadatta also entered the royal resthouse in the Ambalaṭṭhika garden in order to pass the night
There too the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha while his pupil Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in their praise
Thus these two teacher and pupil dwelt together making assertions in direct contradiction to each other
When dawn broke a number of bhikkhus after rising assembled in the pavilion As they sat together the following conversation sprang up among them It is wonderful and marvellous friends how the Exalted One he who knows and sees the Worthy One the perfectly enlightened Buddha has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beings
For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha while his own pupil the youth Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in their praise
These two teacher and pupil followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus making assertions in direct contradiction to each other
Then the Exalted One realizing the turn their discussion had taken entered the pavilion sat down on the prepared seat
and addressed the bhikkhus What kind of discussion were you holding just now bhikkhus What was the subject of your conversation
The bhikkhus replied When dawn had broken Lord after rising we assembled in the pavilion As we sat here the following conversation sprang up among us It is wonderful and marvellous friends how the Exalted One he who knows and sees the Worthy One the perfectly enlightened Buddha has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beings
For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha while his own pupil the youth Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in their praise
These two teacher and pupil followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus making assertions in direct contradiction to each other
 This Lord was the conversation we were having when the Exalted One arrived
If bhikkhus others speak in dispraise of me or in dispraise of the Dhamma or in dispraise of the Sangha you should not give way to resentment displeasure or animosity against them in your heart
For if you were to become angry or upset in such a situation you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves
If you were to become angry or upset when others speak in dispraise of us would you be able to recognize whether their statements are rightly or wrongly spoken
Certainly not Lord
If bhikkhus others speak in dispraise of me or in dispraise of the Dhamma or in dispraise of the Sangha you should unravel what is false and point it out as false saying For such and such a reason this is false this is untrue there is no such thing in us this is not found among us
And if bhikkhus others speak in praise of me or in praise of the Dhamma or in praise of the Sangha you should not give way to jubilation joy and exultation in your heart
For if you were to become jubilant joyful and exultant in such a situation you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves
If others speak in praise of me or in praise of the Dhamma or in praise of the Sangha you should acknowledge what is fact as fact saying For such and such a reason this is a fact this is true there is such a thing in us this is found among us
And the wanderer Suppiya was also travelling on that road with his pupil the youth Brahmadatta
And Suppiya was finding fault in all sorts of ways with the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha whereas his pupil Brahmadatta was speaking in various ways in their praise
And so these two teacher and pupil directly opposing each others arguments followed close behind the Lord and his order of monks
 Then the Lord stopped for one night with his monks at the royal park of Ambalatthika
And Suppiya too stopped there for the night with his pupil Brahmadatta
And Suppiya went on abusing the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha while his pupil Brahmadatta defended them
And thus disputing they followed close behind the Buddha and his order of monks
 Now in the early morning a number of monks having got up gathered together and sat in the Round Pavilion and this was the trend of their talk It is wonderful friends it is marvellous how the Blessed Lord the Arahant the fully enlightened Buddha knows sees and clearly distinguishes the different inclinations of beings
For here is the wanderer Suppiya finding fault in all sorts of ways with the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha while his pupil Brahmadatta in various ways defends them
And still disputing they follow closely behind the Blessed Lord and his order of monks
 Then the Lord being aware of what those monks were saying went to the Round Pavilion and sat down on the prepared seat
Then he said Monks what was the subject of your conversation just now What talk have I interrupted
And they told him
 Monks if anyone should speak in disparagement of me of the Dhamma or of the Sangha you should not be angry resentful or upset on that account
If you were to be angry or displeased at such disparagement that would only be a hindrance to you
For if others disparage me the Dhamma or the Sangha and you are angry or displeased can you recognise whether what they say is right or not
No Lord
If others disparage me the Dhamma or the Sangha then you must explain what is incorrect as being incorrect saying That is incorrect that is false that is not our way that is not found among us
 But monks if others should speak in praise of me of the Dhamma or of the Sangha you should not on that account be pleased happy or elated
If you were to be pleased happy or elated at such praise that would only be a hindrance to you
If others praise me the Dhamma or the Sangha you should acknowledge the truth of what is true saying That is correct that is right that is our way that is found among us
Unequalled ones though homage is being paid them By men and devas unlike them all Heed neither a gift nor worship
Well then sire false is the statement of members of other sects who say A service rendered to one who does not accept becomes barren and fruitless
As sire the enormous mass of fire blazed even so did the Blessed One blaze with a Buddhas splendour in the tenthousandfold world system
But why is it sire that the seeds though not being accepted by the great earth yet germinate and established with a strong tangle of roots a trunk pith and spreading branches bear flowers and fruits
Well then sire members of other sects are confounded by their own utterances they are defeated and obstructed if they say A service done to one who does not accept is barren and fruitless
As sire is the great earth so is the Tathāgata
Revered Nāgasena the deep question that was properly formulated has been made clear that which was hidden has been made manifest the knots have been severed the thicket cleared destroyed are those holding other tenets shattered are wrong beliefs without splendour are members of other sects you have come to be the most excellent teacher of a host of followers
Well then revered Nāgasena the Buddha was not omniscient if his omniscient knowledge was due to searching
If there were a hundred cartloads sire and each cart had seven and a half measures of a certain capacity of rice and two measures of another capacity could anyone tell in one moment the number of grains of rice in the whole
so does the mentality of these types just mentioned arise with difficulty and proceed sluggishly
because they are entwined and entangled with the defilements
Then in the morning a number of bhikkhus dressed and taking their bowls and robes entered Savatthī for alms  as in  down to  The Blessed One said
Bhikkhus when wanderers of other sects speak thus they should be asked Friends when the mind becomes sluggish which factors of enlightenment is it untimely to develop on that occasion and which factors of enlightenment is it timely to develop on that occasion
Then friends when the mind becomes excited which factors of enlightenment is it untimely to develop on that occasion and which factors of enlightenment is it timely to develop on that occasion
Being asked thus those wanderers would not be able to reply and further they would meet with vexation
For what reason
Because that would not be within their domain
I do not see anyone bhikkhus in this world with its devas Mara and Brahma in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins its devas and humans who could satisfy the mind with an answer to these questions except the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata or one who has heard it from them
On an occasion bhikkhus when the mind becomes sluggish it is untimely to develop the enlightenment factor of tranquillity the enlightenment factor of concentration and the enlightenment factor of equanimity
For what reason
Because the mind is sluggish bhikkhus and it is difficult to arouse it with those things
Suppose bhikkhus a man wants to make a small fire flare up
If he throws wet grass wet cowdung and wet timber into it sprays it with water and scatters soil over it would he be able to make that small fire flare up 
No venerable sir
So too bhikkhus on an occasion when the mind becomes sluggish it is untimely to develop the enlightenment factor of tranquillity the enlightenment factor of concentration and the enlightenment factor of equanimity
For what reason
Because the mind is sluggish bhikkhus and it is difficult to arouse it with those things
On an occasion bhikkhus when the mind becomes sluggish it is timely to develop the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states the enlightenment factor of energy and the enlightenment factor of rapture
For what reason
Because the mind is sluggish bhikkhus and it is easy to arouse it with those things
Suppose bhikkhus a man wants to make a small fire flare up
If he throws dry grass dry cowdung and dry timber into it blows on it and does not scatter soil over it would he be able to make that small fire flare up 
Yes venerable sir
So too bhikkhus on an occasion when the mind becomes sluggish it is timely to develop the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states the enlightenment factor of energy and the enlightenment factor of rapture
For what reason
Because the mind is sluggish bhikkhus and it is easy to arouse it with those things
On an occasion bhikkhus when the mind becomes excited it is untimely to develop the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states the enlightenment factor of energy and the enlightenment factor of rapture
For what reason
Because the mind is excited bhikkhus and it is difficult to calm it down with those things
Suppose bhikkhus a man wants to extinguish a great bonfire
If he throws dry grass dry cowdung and dry timber into it blows on it and does not scatter soil over it would he be able to extinguish that great bonfire 
No venerable sir
So too bhikkhus on an occasion when the mind becomes excited it is untimely to develop the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states the enlightenment factor of energy and the enlightenment factor of rapture
For what reason
Because the mind is excited bhikkhus and it is difficult to calm it down with those things
On an occasion bhikkhus when the mind becomes excited it is timely to develop the enlightenment factor of tranquillity the enlightenment factor of concentration and the enlightenment factor of equanimity
For what reason
Because the mind is excited bhikkhus and it is easy to calm it down with those things
Suppose bhikkhus a man wants to extinguish a great bonfire
If he throws wet grass wet cowdung and wet timber into it sprays it with water and scatters soil over it would he be able to extinguish that great bonfire 
Yes venerable sir
So too bhikkhus on an occasion when the mind becomes excited it is timely to develop the enlightenment factor of tranquillity the enlightenment factor of concentration and the enlightenment factor of equanimity
For what reason
Because the mind is excited bhikkhus and it is easy to calm it down with those things
But mindfulness bhikkhus I say is always useful
If anyone were to say Contact at the intellect is the self that wouldnt be tenable
If anyone were to say Consciousness at the intellect is the self that wouldnt be tenable
Thus the intellect is notself and ideas are notself
 So the intellect is notself
 Thats why it wouldnt be tenable if anyone were to say The intellect is the self
And when its arising  falling away are discerned it would follow that My self arises  falls away
The arising  falling away of the intellect are discerned
If anyone were to say The intellect is the self that wouldnt be tenable
If anyone were to say The body is the self that wouldnt be tenable
If anyone were to say The tongue is the self that wouldnt be tenable
If anyone were to say The nose is the self that wouldnt be tenable
but as regards the higher planes it arises with difficulty and proceeds sluggishly
As sire bamboocanes that have clean stalks as far as the third knot move buoyantly when dragged along
but because the branches above are entangled there is resistance there
even so the mentality of the streamenterers uprises buoyantly proceeds buoyantly as far as the three lower stages are concerned but as regards the higher planes it arises with difficulty proceeds sluggishly
because of lack of obstructions on the bamboo
even so the mentality of the arahats arises buoyantly proceeds buoyantly in regard to the disciples range but arises with difficulty proceeds sluggishly in the planes of a paccekabuddha
as regards the planes of an omniscient Buddha
And how householders son does the Ariyan disciple protect the six directions
And how young man does the noble disciple protect the six directions
These six directions should be known
mother and father as the east teachers as the south spouse and family as the west friends and colleagues as the north workers and servants as the lower direction and ascetics and Brahmans as the upper direction

In this way the upper direction is protected and made peaceful and secure
That is what the Buddha said
Summing up in verse the sublime teacher said
Mother and father as the east Teachers as the south
Spouse and family as the west Friends and colleagues as the north
Servants and workers below Brahmans and ascetics above
These directions a person should honor In order to be truly good
Wise and virtuous Gentle and eloquent
Humble and accommodating Such a person attains glory
Energetic not lazy Not shaken in misfortune
Flawless in conduct and intelligent Such a person attains glory
A compassionate maker of friends Approachable free from stinginess
A leader a teacher and diplomat Such a person attains glory
Generosity and kind words Conduct for others welfare
Impartiality in all things These are suitable everywhere
These kind dispositions hold the world together Like the linchpin of a moving chariot
And should these kind dispositions not exist Then the mother would not receive
Respect or honor from her child Neither would a father
Upon these things The wise reflect
They obtain greatness And are sources of praise
When all was said the young householder Sigalaka exclaimed to the Buddha Wonderful dear sir
Wonderful
It is as though you have set upright what was overturned or uncovered what was concealed or shown the path to one gone astray or brought an oillamp into the darkness such that those with eyes could see
So too has the Buddha made clear the Dhamma by various ways
I go for refuge to the Buddha and to the Dhamma and to the monastic community
May the exalted one accept me as a layfollower gone for refuge from henceforth for as long as I live
These six things are to be regarded as the six directions
The east denotes mother and father The south denotes teachers The west denotes wife and children The north denotes friends and companions The nadir denotes servants workers and helpers The zenith denotes ascetics and Brahmins
There are five ways in which a son should minister to his mother and father as the eastern direction He should think Having been supported by them I will support them I will perform their duties for them I will keep up the family tradition I will be worthy of my heritage After my parents deaths I will distribute gifts on their behalf 
And there are five ways in which the parents so ministered to by their son as the eastern direction will reciprocate
they will restrain him from evil support him in doing good teach him some skill find him a suitable wife and in due time hand over his inheritance to him
In this way the eastern direction is covered making it at peace and free from fear
There are five ways in which pupils should minister to their teachers as the southern direction by rising to greet them by waiting on them by being attentive by serving them by mastering the skills they teach
And there are five ways in which their teachers thus ministered to by their pupils as the southern direction will reciprocate they will give thorough instruction make sure they have grasped what they should have duly grasped give them a thorough grounding in all skills recommend them to their friends and colleagues and provide them with security in all directions
In this way the southern direction is covered making it at peace and free from fear
There are five ways in which a husband should minister to his wife as the western direction by honouring her by not disparaging her by not being unfaithful to her by giving authority to her by providing her with adornments
And there are five ways in which a wife thus ministered to by her husband as the western direction will reciprocate by properly organising her work by being kind to the servants by not being unfaithful by protecting stores and by being skilful and diligent in all she has to do
In this way the western direction is covered making it at peace and free from fear
There are five ways in which a man should minister to his friends and companions as the northern direction by gifts by kindly words by looking after their welfare by treating them like himself and by keeping his word
And there are five ways ih which friends and companions thus ministered to by a man as the northern direction will reciprocate by looking after him when he is inattentive by looking after his property when he is inattentive by being a refuge when he is afraid by not deserting him when he is in trouble and by showing concern for his children
In this way the northern direction is covered making it at peace and free from fear
There are five ways in which a master should minister to his servants and workpeople as the nadir by arranging their work according to their strength by supplying them with food and wages by looking after them when they are ill by sharing special delicacies with them and by letting them off work at the right time
And there are five ways in which servants and workpeople thus ministered to by their master as the nadir will reciprocate they will get up before him go to bed after him take only what they are given do their work properly and be bearers of his praise and good repute
In this way the nadir is covered making it at peace and free from fear
There are five ways in which a man should minister to ascetics and Brahmins as the zenith by kindness in bodily deed speech and thought by keeping open house for them by supplying their bodily needs

In this way the zenith is covered making it at peace and free from fear
Thus the Lord spoke
And the WellFarer having spoken the Teacher added
Mother father are the east Teachers are the southward point
Wife and children are the west Friends and colleagues are the north
Servants and workers are below Ascetics Brahmins are above
These directions all should be Honoured by a clansman true
He whos wise and disciplined Kindly and intelligent
Humble free from pride Such a one may honour gain
Early rising scorning sloth Unshaken by adversity
Of faultless conduct ready wit Such a one may honour gain
Making friends and keeping them Welcoming no stingy host
A guide philosopher and friend Such a one may honour gain
Giving gifts and kindly speech A life wellspent for others good
Evenhanded in all things Impartial as each case demands
These things make the world go round Like the chariots axlepin
If such things did not exist No mother from her son
would get Any honour and respect Nor father either as their due
But since these qualities are held By the wise in high esteem
They are given prominence And are rightly praised by all
At these words Sigalaka said to the Lord Excellent Reverend Gotama excellent It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down or to point out the way to one who had got lost or to bring an oillamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there
Just so the Reverend Gotama has expounded the Dhamma in various ways
May the Reverend Gotama accept me as a layfollower from this day forth as long as life shall last 
was utterly pure and buoyant he showed forth the twinmiracle
As sire bamboocanes that are clear of all knots move buoyantly when dragged along
Tangible data are omitted from this list because not being derived matter they are included in the primaries
Here it may be asked Is the arising of the faculties of the eye etc due to kamma that is one or to kamma that is different
Now the Ancients say In both ways
Herein firstly in the case of the arising of an eye etc due to kamma that is different there is nothing to be explained since the cause is divided up
But when their arising is due to kamma that is one how does there come to be differentiation among them
It is due to dividedness in the cause too
For it is craving in the form of longing for this or that kind of becoming that itself having specific forms owing to hankering after the sensebases included in some kind of becoming or other contrives acting as decisive support the specific divisions in the kamma that generates such a kind of becoming
As soon as the kamma has acquired the differentiation induced by that hankering it generates through effort consisting in appropriate ability a multiple fruit with differentiated individual essences as though it had itself taken on a multiple form
And the ability here need not be understood as anything other than the able state for it is simply the effort of producing fruit that is differentiated by the differentiation due to the differentiation in its cause
And the fact of this differentiating effort on the part of kamma that is one being the cause of the multiple faculties will be dealt with below as to logic and texts 
Besides it is told how one kind of consciousness only is the cause of the generation of the sixteen kinds of resultant consciousness and so on
and in the world it is also found that a single paddy seed is the cause of the generation of the ripe the unripe the husked and the unhusked fruit But what is the use of logical thinking
For the eye etc are the fruit of kamma and kammaresult is exclusively the province of a Buddhas knowledge 
The same method applies to the ear and so on
and that the second is stated as the seeing that is due to the particular division of its own cause the sensitivities cause as the state of kamma being taken as a generality or as a unity
The second is according to the specialized kamma generated thus Let my eye be thus This is what they say
Here the firstmentioned characteristic of the eye is described according to the kamma that produces a selfhood and is common to all of it and this without touching on differentiation is the cause
But it can be taken that the firstmentioned characteristic is stated as sensitivitys interest in lighting up its own objective fields the five senses state of sensitivity being taken as a generality
Some are certain Mahāsaṅghikas
for among these Vasudhamma says this In the eye fire is in excess in the ear air in the nose earth in the tongue water in the body all are equal 
As qualities of fire and so on aided by visible data as the illuminating quality of heat which is called lighting up by sound as a quality of air by odour as a quality of earth by flavour as a quality of the water called spittleso according to the first theory that of some and it can be suitably adjusted to accord with the second that of others because they need to be assisted by such and such qualities of primaries what is meant is that they have to be helped in apprehending visible data and so on
This theory holds that the quality is the ability of the eye etc to light up respectively visible data etc only when associated with the reasons that are their accessories consisting of light etc and apertures state of decisive support for earconsciousness
Aperture is taken in due order as are fire etc since it is absence of primaries
Or alternatively when others intend that aperture is a quality of primaries as visible data etc are then the qualities of primaries are construable in their order thus aided by visible data and light as a quality of fire by sound as a quality of aperture called space by odour as a quality of air by flavour as a quality of water by tangible data as a quality of earth 
otherwise their inseparability would be illogical
Excess is in capability not in quantity
From finding visibility etc respectively in a state of excess from finding them associated with these differences namely the bright visible datum in fire sound audible through its individual essence in air the odour beginning with surabhi perfume in earth and the sweet taste in water thus visible data etc are the respective qualities of these
This is according to the first theory and he has stated the conclusion that follows beginning with we might assume in terms of that
The second is confuted in the same way
Or alternatively Then they may say etc can be taken as said emphasizing in order to confute it the theory of Kaṇāda which asserts that the eye etc are respectively made by fire space earth water and air that have visible data etc as their respective qualities 
If there is no differentiation according to primaries what then is the reason for the differentiation of the eye and so on
Though the kamma that is produced by the longing for a selfhood with five sensebases is one only still it should be taken as called not common to them all and difference of kamma because it is the cause of the differentiation of the eye and so on
For it is not a condition for the ear through the same particular difference through which it is a condition for the eye since if it were it would then follow that there was no distinction between the faculties
Because of the words At the moment of rebirthlinking exalted volition is a condition as kamma condition for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed it must be recognized that a single volition is kamma condition for all the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed that come into existence at the moment of rebirthlinking
For if the volition were different then when there came to be the arising of the faculties it would follow that the materiality due to kamma performed was generated by limited and exalted kamma
And rebirthlinking that is one is not generated by a plurality of kinds of kamma Thus it is established that the arising of the plurality of the faculties is due to a single kamma 
There is another method the eye and the ear have noncontiguous objective fields because arising of consciousness is caused while their objective fields are separated by an interval and apart 
Some say that the ear has a contiguous objective field
If it did then sound born of consciousness would not be the object of earconsciousness
And in the texts sound as object is spoken of as being the object of earconsciousness without making any distinction
for there is no arising externally of what is consciousnessoriginated
Besides there would be no defining the direction and position of the sound because it would then have to be apprehended in the place occupied by the possessor of the objective field as happens in the case of an odour
Consequently it remains in the same place where it arose if it comes into focus in the ear avenue 
Are not the sounds of washermen beating their washing on stones heard later by those who stand at a distance
No because there is a difference in the way of apprehending a sound according to the ways in which it becomes evident to one nearby and to one at a distance
For just as because of difference in the way of apprehending the sound of words according to the ways in which it becomes evident to one at a distance and to one nearby there comes to be respectively not apprehending and apprehending of the differences in the syllables so also when the sound of washermen becomes an occurrence that is evident throughout from beginning to end to one who is nearby and becomes an occurrence that is evident in compressed form in the end or in the middle to one who is at a distance it is because there is a difference in the apprehending and definition which occur later in the cognitive series of ear consciousness that there comes to be the assumption Heard faintly is heard later
The sound though it remains at a distance is a condition for the arising of an echo and for the vibration of vessels etc elsewhere as a magnet is for the movement of iron 
If there is absolutely no successive becoming of sound how does an echo arise
But that sound comes into the ears focus at the moment of its own existence and in dependence on the place where it arises 
As regards the mark of the female etc too its facultiness is stated as predominance in other words as a state of cause because the conditions for the modal matter consisting of the mark of the female etc in a continuity accompanied by faculties do not arise otherwise and because these kinds of materiality are a condition for apprehending the female
Though these things that is to say the mark  of the female etc arise each due to its own condition consisting in kamma etc they mostly only do so as modes in a continuity accompanied by the femininity faculty And so it is manifested as the reason for the mark etc is said making the femininity faculty their cause
But because the femininity faculty does not generate even the material instances in its own group or maintain or consolidate them and because it does not so act for the material instances of other groups it is therefore not called in the text faculty presence and nondisappearance conditions as the life faculty is for the material instances of its group and as nutriment is for the material instances in succeeding groups
And it is because the mark etc are dependent on other conditions that wherever they have predominance its shape is encountered even in dead and sculptured matter that resembles it
And so too with the masculinity faculty
And since these two do not occur together in a single continuity because of the words Does the masculinity faculty arise in one in whom the femininity faculty arises
No  etc therefore even in a hermaphrodite there is only one of them at a given moment  
Since the life faculty is itself entirely kammaborn it is established by taking them as conascent that the things to be protected by it are kammaborn too this is why there is no inclusion of the term kammaborn
It maintains as if it were its own that kammaborn matter by being the cause of its occurrence even though only lasting for a moment that is why it has the characteristic of maintaining conascent kinds of matter
For kamma alone is not competent to be the cause of kammaborn things presence as nutriment etc are of the nutrimentborn
Why
Because it is no longer existent at that moment
For it is the life faculty that distinguishes matter that is bound up with faculties from dead matter and kammaborn matter and what is bound up with that from matter that is temperature originated and so on And the life faculty must be regarded as the reason not only for presence during a moment but also for noninterruption of connection otherwise death as the termination of a life span would be illogical 
Because it does accomplish each of those functions it does so because it is a condition for distinguishing what is living
The heartbasis  the support for the mindelement and for the mind consciousnesselement how is that to be known
 From scriptures and from logical reasoning
The scripture is this The materiality dependent on which the mindelement and mindconsciousnesselement occur is a condition as a support condition for the mindelement and the mindconsciousnesselement and what is associated therewith 
If that is so why is it not mentioned in the Rūpakaṇḍa of the Dhammasaṅgaṇi 
Its not being mentioned there is for another reason
What is that
Noninconsistency of the teaching
For while eye consciousness etc have the eye etc as their respective supports absolutely mindconsciousness does not in the same way have the heartbasis as its support absolutely
And the teaching in the physicalbasis dyad is given by way of the material support thus There is matter that is the physical basis of eyeconsciousness there is matter that is not the physical basis of eyeconsciousness and so on
and if the dyads were stated by way of what had the heartbasis absolutely as its support thus There is matter that is the physical basis of mindconsciousness and so on then the object dyads do not fall into line
for one cannot say There is matter that is the object of mindconsciousness there is matter that is not the object of mind consciousness So the physicalbasis dyads and object dyads being thus made inconsistent the teaching would lack unity
That is why the heartbasis is not mentioned not because it is unapprehendable
and the Masters wish was to give the teaching here in a form that has unity
 But the logical reasoning should be understood in this way In the five constituent becoming that is in the sense sphere and finematerial sphere these two elements have as their support produced derived matter
Herein since the visible data base etc and nutritive essence are found to occur apart from what is bound up with faculties to make them the support would be illogical And since these two elements are found in a continuity that is devoid of the femininity and masculinity faculties ie in the Brahmāworld to make them the support would be illogical too And in the case of the life faculty that would have to have another function so to make it the support would be illogical too So it is the heartbasis that remains to be recognized as their support
For it is possible to say that these two elements have as their support produced derived matter since existence is bound up with matter in the fiveconstituent becoming
Whatever has its existence bound up with matter is found to have as its support produced derived matter as the eyeconsciousnesselement does
And the distinction in the fiveconstituent becoming is made on account of the mind consciousnesselement
in the fourconstituent becoming that is the immaterial sphere there is no mindelement
Does there not follow contradiction of the middle term because of establishing faculties as their support
No because that is disproved by what is seen
For these two elements are not as in the case of eye consciousness controlled by the slackness and keenness etc of their physical basis and accordingly it is not said in the texts that they have the faculties as their condition
in other words their being controlled by them is disproved
Hence their having faculties as their support
Granted that these two elements have as their support the derived matter consisting of the heartbasis how is it to be known that it is kammaoriginated has an invariable function and is to be found located in the heart
It may be said to be kammaoriginated because like the eye it is the materiality of a physical basis and because of that it has an invariable function because it is the materiality of a physical basis and because it is a support for consciousness is the meaning
It is known that its location is there because of the hearts exhaustion in one who thinks of anything bringing it to mind intently and directing his whole mind to it 
For they say accordingly
Also it is known by inference that the apprehension of the alteration is next to the apprehension of the appearance thus The intimator intimates the meaning to be intimated only when it is apprehended as a cause not merely as present
Therefore there is a certain kind of alteration that is separate from the appearance of motion and it is known as the intimator of the intention
For no apprehension of intention such as He is getting this done it seems is met with in the case of trees movements etc which are devoid of intention But it is met with in the case of hand movements and so on
And the apprehension of the former is next to the apprehension of the latter How is that to be known By the apprehension of intention
It is the mode and the alteration of what
Of consciousnessoriginated primary elements that have the airelement in excess of capability
What is that capability
It is the state of being consciousnessborn and the state of being derived matter
Or alternatively it can be taken as the mode alteration of the air element
If that is so then intimation is illogical as derived matter
for there is no derived matter with a single primary as its support
since matter derived from the four great primaries is said That is not wrong Alteration of one of the four is that of all four as with wealth shared among four
And excess of air element in a material group does not contradict the words of the air element
According to some it is that of the air element only
In their opinion the state of derived matter is inapplicable to intimation
since the alteration of one is not that of all
But this air element is apprehended by minddoor impulsion that is next to the nonintimating apprehension that is next to the apprehension of the appearance of motion in the movement of the hands and so on
There is a certain kind of alteration that is separate from the appearance of motion
And also beings merely recognized As such communicate no meanings either
If just the apprehension of the alteration is the reason for the apprehension of the intention why is there no apprehension of intention in unapprehended communication 
It is not only just the apprehension of the alteration that is the reason for the apprehension of the intention but rather it should be taken that the apprehension of the previouslyestablished connection is the decisive support for this
The stiffening upholding and movement are due to the airelement associated with the alteration belonging to the intimation is what is said
What is it all the airelement that does all those things
It is not like that
For it is the air element given rise to by the seventh impulsion that by acquiring as its reinforcing conditions the air elements given rise to by the preceding impulsions moves consciousnessoriginated matter by acting as cause for its successive arisings in adjacent locations not the others
The others however help it by doing the stiffening and upholding the successive arising in adjacent locations being itself the movement
So the instrumentality should be taken as attributed when there is the sign of movement
otherwise there would not be uninterestedness and momentariness of dhammas
And here the cart to be drawn by seven yokes is given as simile in the Commentary
But when consciousnessborn matter moves the kinds of matter born of temperature kamma and nutriment move too because they are bound up with it like a piece of dry cowdung thrown into a rivers current Since it has been said that the apprehension of intimation is next to the apprehension of the appearance of motion
how then is the air element itself as the maker of the movement accompanied by the alteration consisting in the intimation
It is not like that It is the air elements given rise to by the first impulsion etc and which are unable to cause movement in that way and perform only the stiffening and upholding that should be taken as only accompanied by the alteration belonging to intimation
because of giving rise to alteration in whatever direction it wishes to cause the occurrence of moving forward and so on
Taking it in this way it is perfectly logical to say that the origination of intimation belongs to minddoor adverting
 For it is the alteration coexistent with the intention that is the intimation
Since the intention possessed of the aforesaid alteration is intimated through the apprehension of that alteration it is said that Its function is to display intention
The air element being the cause of the motion of the bodily intimation is figuratively said as a state of alteration to be manifested as the cause of bodily motion
Its proximate cause is the consciousnessoriginated airelement is said since the air elements excessive function
is the cause of intimating intention by movement of the body  Cf Dhsa f
The function of the vocal apparatus 
The question It is the mode and the alteration of what should be handled in the same way as for bodily intimation
with this difference for next to the apprehension of the appearance of movement substitute next to the hearing of an audible sound
And here because of the absence of stiffening etc the argument beginning For it is the air element given rise to by the seventh impulsion does not apply
for the sound arises together with the knocking together
and the knocking together only applies in the case of the first impulsion and so on
The knocking together is the arising of groups of primaries in proximity to each other due to conditions
The movement is the progression of the successive arising in adjacent locations This is the difference
The earth elements knocking together is parallel to the air elements moving as regards function 
Some are the inmates of the Abhayagiri Monastery at Anurādhapura
Sensed  means apprehendable by sensing  by reaching
hence he said because they are the objective fields of faculties that take contiguous objective fields 
But what is it that is called a tangible datum
It is the three elements earth heat and air
But why is the water element not included here Is not cold apprehended by touching and that is the water element
Certainly it is apprehended but it is not the water element
What is it then
It is just the fire element
For there is the sensation of cold when heat is sluggish
There is no quality that is called cold there is only the assumption of coldness due to the sluggishness of the state of heat
How is that to be known
Because of the unreliability of the sensation of cold like beyond and not beyond
For in hot weather while those who stand in the sun and go into the shade have the sensation of cold yet those who go to the same place from an underground cave have the sensation of heat
And if coldness were the water element it would be found in a single group along with heat but it is not so found
That is why it may be known that coldness is not the water element
And that is conclusive for those who agree to the inseparable existence of the primary elements and it is conclusive too even for those who do not agree because it is disproved by associate existence through seeing the functions of the four primaries in a single group
It is conclusive too for those who say that coldness is the characteristic of the air element
for if coldness were the air element coldness would be found in a single group along with heat and it is not so found
That is why it may be known that coldness is not the air element either
But those who hold the opinion that fluidity is the water element and that that is apprehended by touching
should be told That fluidity touched is merely the venerable ones assumption as is the case with shape
For this is said by the Ancients
Three elements coexisting with fluidity Together form what constitutes a tangible
That I succeed in touching this fluidity Is a common misconception in the world
And as a man who touches elements And apprehends a shape then with his mind
Fancies I really have been touching shape So too fluidity is recognized 
The sound base only here some say The consciousnessborn is always intimative 
The Ancients say There is sound due to the intervention of applied thought that does not intimate
While depending on the word of the Great Commentary that puts it thus Intimatable through the ear by means of the sound due to applied thoughts intervention still there is also need of the arising of consciousnessoriginated sound without intimation 
Others however do not reject the Great Commentarys statement and they comment on its intention
How
They say that the nonintimation through the ear of the sound activated due to applied thoughts intervention is stated in the Suttas with this intention He tells by hearing with the divine ear the subtle sound that is conascent with the intimation originated by applied thought and consisting in movement of the tongue and palate and so on  and that in the Paṭṭhāna the state of object condition for earconsciousness is stated with reference to gross sound 
And that theory is rejected by Saṅghakaras who imagine that it is selfcontradictory to say that there is sound not intimatable through the ear
for because of the words For the intimation is not due to intimating speech  it arises together with sound not intimatable through the ear That being so there would have to be a consciousnessborn soundennead
Has the characteristic of being felt means that it has as its characteristic what is felt what is experienced as the taste  of the object
Characteristic of perceiving means that it has as its characteristic the perceiving of an object classed as blue etc and the knowing the apprehending of it by arousing the perception of it as blue yellow long short and so on
Forming is accumulating or it is contriving by becoming interested And it is because volition is basic in both of these ways that the formations aggregate is said thus to have the characteristic of forming
For in expounding the formations aggregate in the SuttantaBhājaniya of the Vibhaṅga volition was expounded by the Blessed One thus Eyecontactborn volition and so on
Has the characteristic of cognizing means that it has as its characteristic that kind of knowing called apprehension of an object in a mode in which the objective field is apprehended differently from the mode of perceiving 
But on the other hand the Blessed One declared just before he passed away in response to a question put by the recluse Subhadda If these monks were to live rightly the world might not be empty of arahats
If the first of these statements is correct the second is misleading
if the second is right the first must be false
The Blessed One sire did make both statements you have quoted
as far removed one from the other as the zenith is from the surface of the earth as heaven is from hell as good is from evil and as pleasure is from pain
Yet sire while the Blessed One was speaking thus did he speak of the disappearance of the true Dhamma or did he pour scorn on the understanding of it
Declaring and illustrating what was lost he delimited the remainder of its existence
So much property have I lost so much is still left even so sire the Blessed One illustrating what was lost spoke to devas and mankind of what remained saying nanda the true Dhamma will last now for only five hundred years
This refers to a timelimit for the Teaching
For what reason sire
Even so sire the reservoir of the excellent true Dhamma in the Conquerors Teaching is full of the fresh and stainless waters of good behaviour morality special qualities right custom and practice and overflowing it endures having surpassed the acme of becoming
If the sons of the Buddha were to make the rain of the cloud of good behaviour morality special qualities and right custom and practice pour down heavily and continuously
If sire people were to continually supply a mighty mass of fire with dry cowdung dry sticks and dry grass would that mass of fire go out
Even so sire the excellent Teaching of the Conqueror blazes forth in the tenthousand world system through good behaviour morality special qualities right custom and practice
If sire people were to continually polish with fine soft red powder a stainless mirror that was already bright and shining well polished smooth and glossy would dirt and dust and mud arise on its surface
Revered Nāgasena when you speak of the disappearance of the true Dhamma what is this disappearance of the true Dhamma
Let alone three years bhikkhus
Let alone two years bhikkhus
Let alone one month bhikkhus
Let alone two months bhikkhus
Let alone three months bhikkhus
Let alone four months bhikkhus
Let alone five months bhikkhus
Let alone six months bhikkhus
Let alone seven months bhikkhus
But revered sir didnt painful feelings arise in the Tathāgatas body
If revered Nāgasena the Tathāgata attained omniscience after burning up all that is unwholesome then the statement that he was afflicted by these ailments must be false
It is not the case sire that all that is felt is rooted in kamma
that statement of theirs is false
Sire if all ailments originate from kamma alone there would not be any characteristics to distinguish them into types
Thus sire those feelings born as the result of kamma are few the others are many
But it is not possible without the knowledge of a Buddha to make an analysis of that kamma
and when food does not digest properly this is due either to a bad stomach or to bad foodso that feeling of the Blessed One was produced either as the result of kamma or from mere action there is no other kind of feeling beyond that
so too that stone splint struck the Tathāgatas foot but not as a consequence of some deed previously done by him
If the second is right then the first must be wrong
the hungry man who has need for food not the man whose hunger has been quenched
even so sire all the Tathāgatas when they have attained omniscience have meditated in solitude
it is not because they still have something further to be done or because there is something to be added to what has been done Tathāgatas practise solitary meditation because of their realization of the divers advantages of its special qualities
And again it was said Three months from now the Tathāgata will attain final Nibbāna 
If the first of these statements was true then the limit of three months must have been false
so I do not praise becoming even for a trifling time not even for the time of a finger snap Now would the Blessed One sire who had seen in all becomings a resemblance to excrement harbour desire for and attachment to becomings with the support of the potency of psychic power
Well then sire it was when the Blessed One was proclaiming the potency of psychic power that he roared the lions roar of a Buddha such as was this
It is good revered Nāgasena thus it is and I accept it
So too the eye is the eye base form is the form baseseeing is the mind base the associated phenomena such as feelingetc are the mindobject base
The bases are the twelve bases that is to say the eye base visibledata base ear base sound base nose base odour base tongue base flavour base body base tangibledata base mind base mentaldata base
Herein
Meaning character just so much Order and in brief and detail
Likewise as to how to be seen Thus should be known the exposition
Herein as to meaning firstly individually It relishes  thus it is an eye  the meaning is that it enjoys a visible datum and turns it to account
It makes visible  thus it is a visible datum  the meaning is that by undergoing an alteration in appearance it evidences what state is in the mind 
It hears  thus it is an ear 
It is emitted  thus it is sound  the meaning is that it is uttered
It smells  thus it is a nose 
It is smelt thus it is odour 
It evokes life  thus it is a tongue 
Living beings taste it thus it is flavour  the meaning is that they enjoy it
It is the origin of vile states subject to cankers thus it is a body 
origin being the place of arising
It is touched  thus it is a tangible datum 
It measures  thus it is a mind 
They cause their own characteristic to be borne  thus they are mental data 
As to meaning in general however base should be understood as such because of its actuating  because of being the range of the origins  and because of leading on what is actuated 
Now the various states of consciousness and its concomitants belonging to such and such a doorcumobject among those consisting of the eyecumvisible datum etc are actuated  each by means of its individual function of experiencing etc they are active strive and endeavour in these is what is meant
And these doorscumobjects provide the range for those states that are origins  they give them scope is what is meant And as long as this suffering of the round of rebirths which has gone on occurring throughout the beginningless round of rebirths and so is enormously actuated  does not recede so long they lead on  they cause occurrence is what is meant
So all these things are called bases because they actuate because they are the range of the origins and because they lead on what is actuated
Furthermore base should be understood in the sense of place of abode store  meeting place locality of birth and cause
For accordingly in the world in such phrases as the lords sphere and Vāsudevas sphere  it is a place of abode that is called base
and in such phrases as The southern land is the realm of cattle it is the locality of birth
and in such passages as He acquires the ability to be a witness of it  whenever there is an occasion for it  it is a cause
And these various states of consciousness and its concomitants dwell in the eye etc because they exist in dependence on them so the eye etc are their place of abode
And they frequent the eye etc because they have them respectively as their material support and as their object so the eye etc are their store
And the eye etc are their meeting place because they meet together in one or other of them using them as physical basis door and object
And the eye etc are the locality of their birth because they arise just there having them as their respective supports and objects
And the eye etc are their reason because they are absent when the eye etc are absent
So for these reasons too these things are called bases in the sense of place of abode store meeting place locality of birth and reason
Consequently in the sense already stated it is an eye and that is a base thus it is the eye base  They are mental data and those are a base thus they are the mentaldata base This is how the exposition should be known here as to meaning
 Character Here too the exposition should be known as to the characteristic of the eye and so on
But their characteristics should be understood in the way given above in the Description of the Aggregates 
 As to just so much as just so many
It is for the sake of defining doorcumobject for the arising of the six consciousness groups And here they are stated as twelve since this is how they are classed when so defined For only the eye base is the door of arising and only the visibledata base is the object of the consciousness group comprised in a cognitive series containing eyeconsciousness Likewise the others for the others
But only one part of the mind base in other words the lifecontinuum mind is the door of arising and only the mentaldata base not common to all is the object of the sixth consciousness group
So they are called the twelve because they define doorcumobject for the arising of the six consciousness groups This is how the exposition should be known here as to just so much
For the eye is taught first among the internal bases since it is obvious because it has as its objective field what is visible with resistance  After that the ear base etc which have as their objective fields what is invisible with resistance
Or alternatively the eye base and ear base are taught first among the internal bases because of their great helpfulness as respective causes for the incomparable of seeing and the incomparable of hearing  Next the three beginning with the nose base And the mind base is taught last because it has as its resort the objective fields of the other five  But among the external bases the visibledata base etc are taught each one next to its corresponding internal base because they are the respective resorts of the eye base and so on
Furthermore their order may be understood as that in which the reasons for consciousnesss arising are defined
and it is said Due to eye and to visible objects eyeconsciousness arises  due to mind and mental objects mind consciousness arises 
In brief and in detail in brief the twelve bases are simply mentality materiality because the mind base and one part of the mentaldata base are included in mentality and the rest of the bases in materiality
But in detail firstly as regards the internal bases the eye base is as to kind simply eye sensitivity but when it is classified according to condition destiny order of beings and person it is of infinite variety
Likewise the four beginning with the ear base
And the mind base when classified according to profitable unprofitable resultant and functional consciousness is of eightynine kinds or of one hundred and twentyone kinds
but it is of infinite variety when classified according to physical basis progress and so on
The mentaldata base is of many kinds when classified according to the several individual essences of feeling perception formations subtle matter and Nibbāna 
This is how the exposition should be known in brief and in detail
As to how to be seen here all formed bases should be regarded as having no provenance and no destination
For they do not come from anywhere prior to their rise nor do they go anywhere after their fall On the contrary before their rise they had no individual essence and after their fall their individual essences are completely dissolved And they occur without mastery being exercisable over them since they exist in dependence on conditions and in between the past and the future
Hence they should be regarded as having no provenance and no destination
Likewise they should be regarded as incurious and uninterested
For it does not occur to the eye and the visible datum etc Ah that consciousness might arise from our concurrence And as door physical basis and object they have no curiosity about or interest in arousing consciousness On the contrary it is the absolute rule that eyeconsciousness etc come into being with the union of eye with visible datum and so on
So they should be regarded as incurious and uninterested
Furthermore the internal bases should be regarded as an empty village because they are devoid of lastingness pleasure and self
And this is said Bhikkhus the eye is harassed by agreeable and disagreeable visible objects 
Furthermore the internal ones should be regarded as like the six creatures and the external ones as like their resorts
This is how the exposition should be known here as to how to be seen
This firstly is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the bases
the meaning is that it betrays its own physical basis
But in the Dispensation in such passages as And so in the delightful realm Those flying in the air attend him  it is a meeting place
and in such phrases as the sphere of gold and the sphere of silver it is a store that is called base
What is meant is this The eye etc are mental data too that being so why is twelve bases said instead of simply mentaldata base
As to order here too from among order of arising etc mentioned above  only order of teaching is appropriate
This is how the exposition should be known here as to order
The visibledata sound odour and flavour bases are of infinite variety when classified according to dissimilarity condition and so on
The tangibledata base is of three kinds as consisting of earth element fire element and air element
but when classified according to condition etc it is of many kinds
and the external ones as villageraiding robbers because they raid the internal ones
the meaning is that by means of its own conditions it is emitted  is made cognizable by the ear
As to sound only the sound of words would be covered by the meaning is uttered  and here sound is not only the sound of words but rather all that can be cognized by the ear is what is emitted 
Rūpayati is a derivative of the word rūpa that expresses appearance  while ruppati is a derivative that expresses the materiality aggregate
Or the word rūpa can be regarded as evidencing of elements too since it has many meanings
Or the word rūpa means demonstration and that is the same as evidencing
When a visible form undergoes like the visible aspect of a chameleon an alteration in appearance at times when the mind is dyed with greed or corrupted with hate etc it makes visible what state is prevalent in the heart and makes that evident as though it were an actual visible object the meaning is that it demonstrates it by giving it as it were a graspable entity 
It evokes life  owing to appetite for tastes in food  which is the cause of life  since the act of swallowing is rooted in approval of tastes This is the linguistic characteristic of the word jivhā 
Because of the absence of anything whatever not included in the twelve bases there is no arguing that they are more than twelve
In other words the lifecontinuum mind that which occurs twice in disturbance 
Only when there has been the occurrence of the lifecontinuum in a state of disturbance is there the arising of adverting not otherwise Taking it thus as the reason for adverting what is called lifecontinuum mind is a door of arising
Not common to all means not common to eyeconsciousness and the rest
Condition is kamma etc
destiny is from hell upwards
order of beings refers to such species as elephants horses etc or to the castes of the khattiyas  and so on
person refers to any given living beings continuity 
Physical basis is that consisting of the eye etc
according to that Progress is a painful progress and the other three
And so on refers to jhāna predominance plane object and so on
Blue is similar to blue it is dissimilar to any other colour
Condition is kamma and so on
The elements next to that are the eighteen elements that is to say eye element visibledata element eyeconsciousness element ear element sound element earconsciousness element nose element odour element nose consciousness element tongue element flavour element tongueconsciousness element body element tangibledata element bodyconsciousness element mind element mentaldata element mindconsciousness element
Herein
As to meaning characteristic et cetera Order just so much and reckoning
Then condition and how to be seen Thus should be known the exposition
Herein as to meaning It relishes  thus it is an eye 
As to meaning in general it sorts out  it assorts well  a sorting out  it is sorted out by means of that or it causes to be sorted here thus it is a sort 
 The mundane sorts  when defined according to their instrumentality sort out the suffering of the round of rebirths which is of many kinds just as the sorts of gold and silver etc do gold and silver and so on
 They assort well with living beings as a burden does with burden bearers they are borne  is the meaning
 And they are only mere sortings out of suffering because no mastery is exercisable over them
 And by means of them as instruments the suffering of the round of rebirths is continually being sorted out by living beings
 And that suffering being sorted out in this way is caused to be sorted into those sorts  it is caused to be placed in them is the meaning
So each thing among those beginning with the eye is called a sort in the meaning just stated beginning It sorts out it assorts well
Furthermore while the self of the sectarians does not exist with an individual essence not so these These on the contrary are elements since they cause a states own individual essence to be borne 
And just as in the world the variouslycoloured constituents of marble such as malachite cinnabar etc are called elements so too these beginning with the eye are elements like those
Or just as the general term elements is used for juices blood etc which are constituents of the collection called the carcass when they are distinguished from each other by dissimilarity of characteristic so too the general term elements should be understood as used for the constituents of the selfhood called the pentad of aggregates
Furthermore element is a term for what is soulless
it is an eye and that is an element thus it is the eyeelement  It is mind consciousness and that is an element thus it is mindconsciousness element
As to characteristic et cetera here too the exposition should be understood as to the characteristic etc of the eye and so on
And that should be understood in the way given above in the Description of the Aggregates 
As to order here too from among order of arising etc mentioned above  only order of teaching is appropriate
It is set forth according to successive definition of cause and fruit
So in each case
As to just so much as just so many
What is meant is this in various places in the Suttas and Abhidhamma the following as well as other elements are met withthe illumination element beauty element baseconsistingof boundlessspace element baseconsistingofboundlessconsciousness element baseconsistingofnothingness element baseconsistingofneitherperception nornonperception element cessationofperceptionandfeeling element  sensedesire element illwill element cruelty element renunciation element nonillwill element noncruelty element  bodilypleasure element bodilypain element joy element grief element equanimity element ignorance element  initiative element launching element persistence element  inferior element medium element superior element  earth element water element fire element air element space element consciousness element  formed element unformed element  the world of many elements of various elements 
that being so why is the classification only made according to these eighteen instead of making it according to all of them
Because as far as individual essence is concerned all existing elements are included in that classification
The visible dataelement itself is the illumination element The beauty element is bound up with visibledata and so on
Why Because it is the sign of the beautiful
The sign of the beautiful is the beauty element
Or since the visible data etc that are objects consisting of profitable kammaresult are themselves the beauty element that is thus merely visible data and so on
As regards the baseconsistingof boundlessspace element etc the consciousness is mindconsciousness element only while the remaining states are the mentaldata element
But the cessation ofperceptionandfeeling element does not exist as an individual essence
The sensedesire element is either merely the mentaldata element
It is the thought applied thought  wrong thinking that is associated with sense desires 
or it is the eighteen elements
The renunciation element is the mentaldata element also because of the passage Also all profitable states are the renunciation element  it is the mindconsciousness element too
The elements of illwill cruelty nonill will noncruelty bodily pleasure bodily pain joy grief equanimity ignorance initiative launching and persistence are the mentaldata element too
The inferior medium and superior elements are the eighteen elements themselves
But literally speaking the unprofitable mentaldata element and mindconsciousness element are the inferior element both these elements when mundane profitable or mundane indeterminate and the eye element etc are the medium element but the supramundane mentaldata element and mindconsciousness element are the superior element
The earth fire and air elements are the tangibledata element the water element and the space element are the mentaldata element only
Seventeen elements and one part of the mentaldata element are the formed element but the unformed element is one part of the mentaldata element only
The world of many elements of various elements is merely what is divided up into the eighteen elements
So they are given as eighteen because as to individual essence all existing elements are included in that classification
Furthermore they are stated as eighteen for the purpose of eliminating the kind of perception to be found in those who perceive a soul in consciousness the individual essence of which is cognizing
for there are beings who perceive a soul in consciousness the individual essence of which is cognizing And so the Blessed One who was desirous of eliminating the longinherent perception of a soul has expounded the eighteen elements thus making evident to them not only consciousnesss multiplicity when classed as eye ear nose tongue and bodyconsciousness elements and mind and mindconsciousness elements but also its impermanence which is due to its existing in dependence on eye cumvisibledata etc as conditions
What is more the inclinations of those who are teachable in this way have to be considered
For By methods terse and long as need may be
He taught the Dhamma so that from beings hearts
Melting in the Good Dhammas brilliancy
If they have wit to learn the dark departs
This is how the exposition should be understood here as to just so much
As to reckoning the eyeelement firstly is reckoned as one thing according to kind namely eye sensitivity Likewise the ear nose tongue body visible data sound odour and flavour elements are reckoned as ear sensitivity and so on  But the tangibledata element is reckoned as three things namely earth fire and air
The eyeconsciousness element is reckoned as two things namely profitable and unprofitable kammaresult and likewise the conscious ness elements of the ear nose tongue and body
The mind element is reckoned as three things namely fivedoor adverting  and profitable and unprofitable resultant receiving
The mentaldata element as twenty things namely three immaterial aggregates sixteen kinds of subtle matter and the unformed element 
This is how the exposition should be understood as to reckoning
Condition the eye element firstly is a condition in six ways namely dissociation prenascence presence nondisappearance support and faculty for the eyeconsciousness element The visibledata element is a condition in four ways namely prenascence presence nondisappearance and object for the eyeconsciousness element
Similarly with the earelement and the sound element for the earconsciousness element and so on
The adverting mind element is a condition as the five conditions namely proximity contiguity absence disappearance and proximitydecisive support for these five beginning with the eyeconsciousness element And these five are so too for the receiving mind element 
And so is the receiving mind element for the investigating mindconsciousness element  And so is that too for the determining mindconsciousness element  And so is the determining mindconsciousness element for impulsion mind consciousness element
But the impulsion mindconsciousness element is a condition as the six conditions namely as the five already stated and as repetition condition for the immediately following impulsion mindconsciousness element
This firstly is the way in the case of the five doors
In the case of the mind door however the lifecontinuum mind consciousness element is a condition for the adverting mindconsciousness element
as the previouslystated five conditions And the adverting mind consciousness element is so for the impulsion mindconsciousness element
The mentaldata element is a condition in many ways as conascence mutuality support association presence nondisappearance etc for the seven consciousness elements
The eye element etc and some of the mentaldata element are conditions as object condition etc for some of the mind consciousness element
And not only are the eye and visible data etc conditions for the eye consciousness element etc respectively but also light etc are too
Hence the former teachers said
Earconsciousness arises due to ear sound aperture and attention
Noseconsciousness arises due to nose odour air and attention
Tongueconsciousness arises due to tongue flavour water and attention
Body consciousness arises due to body tangible datum earth and attention
Mind consciousness arises due to lifecontinuummind mental datum and attention
This is in brief
But the kinds of conditions will be explained in detail in the Description of Dependent Origination 
This is how the exposition should be understood here as to condition
How to be seen the meaning is that here too the exposition should be understood as to how they are to be regarded For all formed elements are to be regarded as secluded from the past and future as void of any lastingness beauty pleasure or self and as existing in dependence on conditions
Individually however the eye element should be regarded as the surface of a drum the visibledata element as the drumstick and the eyeconsciousness element as the sound
Likewise the eye element should be regarded as the surface of a lookingglass the visibledata element as the face and the eyeconsciousness element as the image of the face
Or else the eyeelement should be regarded as sugarcane or sesame the visibledata element as the sugarcane mill or the sesame wheel rod and the eyeconsciousness element as the sugarcane juice or the sesame oil
Likewise the eyeelement should be regarded as the lower fire stick the visibledata element as the upper firestick and the eyeconsciousness element as the fire
So too in the case of the ear and so on
The mind element however should be regarded as the forerunner and follower of eyeconsciousness etc as that arises
As to the mentaldata element the feeling aggregate should be regarded as a dart and as a stake the perception and formations aggregates as a disease owing to their connection with the dart and stake of feeling
Or the ordinary mans perception should be regarded as an empty fist because it produces pain through disappointed desire
And the formations aggregate should be regarded as men who throw one into a pit of hot coals because they throw one into rebirthlinking
And materiality should be regarded as a razorwheel  because it is the sign of various kinds of dangers
The unformed element however should be regarded as deathless as peace as safety
Why
Because it is the opposite of all ill
The mindconsciousness element should be regarded as a forest monkey because it does not stay still on its object or as a wild horse because it is difficult to tame or as a stick flung into the air because it falls anyhow or as a stage dancer because it adopts the guise of the various defilements such as greed and hate
in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose of gladdening good people
in the Treatise on the Development of Understanding
it makes visible  thus it is a visible datum
and the consciousness of the eye is eyeconsciousness  first the exposition of eye etc should be known individually as to meaning in the way beginning 
for they are the variouslycoloured constituents of knowledge and the knowable
for these things beginning with the eye are distinguished from each other by dissimilarity of characteristic
and for the purpose of abolishing the perception of soul the Blessed One accordingly taught the elements in such passages as Bhikkhu this man has six elements 
Therefore the exposition should be understood here firstly as to meaning thus 
For the pair eye element and visible data element are the cause and eyeconsciousness element is the fruit
and that does not exist apart from visible data and so on
for that is merely the cessation of two elements
according as it is said Herein what is the sensedesire element
according as it is said Making the Avīci hell the lower limit and making the Paranimmitavasavatti deities the upper limit the aggregates elements bases materiality feeling perception formations and consciousness that are in this interval that belong here are included here these are called the sense desire element 
for inferior eyes etc are the inferior element and medium and superior eyes etc are the medium and superior elements
consciousness element is a term summarizing the seven consciousness elements beginning with eyeconsciousness
and in order to suit the inclinations of beings who are teachable by a teaching that is neither too brief nor too long eighteen are expounded
Mindconsciousness element is reckoned as seventysix things namely the remaining profitable unprofitable and indeterminate consciousnesses
Eyeconsciousness arises due to eye visible datum light and attention
or as a forest deer with a scarecrow because it apprehends the sign incorrectly
or as thieves pursued by the kings men because they are pursued by the pains of birth
or as the seeds of a poisontree because they are the rootcause of the aggregates continuity which brings all kinds of harm
The fifteenth chapter
called The Description of the Bases and Elements
There are five meanings stated since the word dhātu has its form established here by the transitive  the intransitive  the abstract noun  the instrumental case  and the causative voice 
Supramundane elements do not sort out the suffering of the round of rebirths on the contrary they destroy it That is why mundane is specified
Are elements since they cause a states own individual essence to be borne here while the establishment of the words form should be understood as dadhātī ti dhātu  still taking the word dhā to share the meanings of both dadhāti and dhāreti 
The causing of the bearing of mere individual essences without any permanent living being is a basic meaning of the word dhātu  and so it is stated separately
there is also the meaning of the active voice different from the first because the meanings of vidhāna and dhāraṇa are unconnected
Are elements like those elements here just as the word lion  which is properly applicable to the bearer of a mane is used of a man so too the word element which is properly applicable to the constituents of marble is used of the eye and so on
Successive definition of cause and fruit is just the state of cause and fruit
It is the mere cessation of the mindconsciousness element and mentaldata element because it is the ceasedness of thoughtarisings in the fourth immaterial state
Here the word etc stands for the mindconsciousness elements states where suitable as rootcause predominance kamma kammaresult nutriment faculty jhāna and path conditions
Ie subtle materiality and Nibbāna
Lifecontinuum mind is the lifecontinuum consciousness occurring twice in disturbance
Formed elements are secluded in both instances because their individual essences are unapprehendable then
Now it was said earlier that he should first fortify his knowledge by learning and questioning about those things that are the soil after he has perfected the two purificationspurification of virtue and purification of consciousnessthat are the roots
Now of those purification of virtue is the quite purified fourfold virtue beginning with Pātimokkha restraint and that has already been dealt with in detail in the Description of Virtue 
and the purification of consciousness namely the eight attainments together with access concentration has also been dealt with in detail in all its aspects in the Description of Concentration stated under the heading of consciousness in the introductory verse
So those two purifications should be understood in detail as given there
But it was said above that The five purifications purification of view purification by overcoming doubt purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path purification by knowledge and vision of the way and purification by knowledge and vision are the trunk  Herein purification of view is the correct seeing of mentalitymateriality
One who wants to accomplish this if firstly his vehicle is serenity should emerge from any finematerial or immaterial jhāna except the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception and he should discern according to characteristic function etc the jhāna factors consisting of applied thought etc and the states associated with them that is feeling perception and so on
When he has done so all that should be defined as mentality in the sense of bending  because of its bending on to the object
Then just as a man by following a snake that he has seen in his house finds its abode so too this meditator scrutinizes that mentality he seeks to find out what its occurrence is supported by and he sees that it is supported by the matter of the heart
After that he discerns as materiality the primary elements which are the hearts support and the remaining derived kinds of materiality that have the elements as their support
He defines all that as materiality because it is molested by cold etc
After that he defines in brief as mentalitymateriality the mentality that has the characteristic of bending and the materiality that has the characteristic of being molested
But one whose vehicle is pure insight or that same aforesaid one whose vehicle is serenity discerns the four elements in brief or in detail in one of the various ways given in the chapter on the definition of the four elements 
Then when the elements have become clear in their correct essential characteristics firstly in the case of head hair originated by kamma there become plain ten instances of materiality with the body decad thus the four elements colour odour flavour nutritive essence and life and body sensitivity And because the sex decad is present there too there are another ten that is the same nine with sex instead of body sensitivity And since the octadwithnutritiveessenceaseighth that is the four elements and colour odour flavour and nutritive essence originated by nutriment and that originated by temperature and that originated by consciousness are present there too there are another twentyfour So there is a total of fortyfour instances of materiality in the case of each of the twentyfour bodily parts of fourfold origination But in the case of the four namely sweat tears spittle and snot which are originated by temperature and by consciousness there are sixteen instances of materiality with the two octadswithnutritiveessenceaseighth in each In the case of the four namely gorge dung pus and urine which are originated by temperature eight instances of materiality become plain in each with the octadwithnutritiveessence aseighth in what is originated only by temperature
This in the first place is the method in the case of the thirtytwo bodily aspects
But there are ten more aspects that become clear when those thirtytwo aspects have become clear
And as regards these firstly nine instances of materiality that is the octadwithnutritiveessenceaseighth plus life become plain in the case of the kammaborn part of heat that digests what is eaten etc and likewise nine instances of materiality that is the octadwithnutritive essenceaseighth plus sound in the case of the consciousnessborn part of air consisting of inbreaths and outbreaths and thirtythree instances of materiality that is the kammaborn lifeennead and the three octadswithnutritiveessence aseighth in the case of each of the remaining eight parts that are of fourfold origination
And when these instances of materiality derived by clinging from the primaries have thus become plain in detail in the case of these fortytwo aspects that is thirtytwo parts of the body four modes of fire and six modes of air another sixty instances of materiality become plain with the physical heart basis and the five sense doors that is with the heartbasis decad and the five decads beginning with the eye decad
Taking all these together under the characteristic of being molested he sees them as materiality
When he has discerned materiality thus the immaterial states become plain to him in accordance with the sense doors
The supramundane kinds of consciousness however are not discernible either by one who is practicing pure insight or by one whose vehicle is serenity because they are out of their reach
Taking all these immaterial states together under the characteristic of bending he sees them as mentality
This is how one meditator defines mentalitymateriality in detail through the method of defining the four elements
Another does it by means of the eighteen elements
How
Here a bhikkhu considers the elements thus There are in this person the eye element  the mindconsciousness element Instead of taking the piece of flesh variegated with white and black circles having length and breath and fastened in the eye socket with a string of sinew which the world terms an eye he defines as eye element the eye sensitivity of the kind described among the kinds of derived materiality in the Description of the Aggregates 
But he does not define as eye element the remaining instances of materiality which total fiftythree that is the nine conascent instances of materiality consisting of the four primary elements which are its support the four concomitant instances of materiality namely colour odour flavour and nutritive essence and the sustaining life faculty and also the twenty kamma born instances of materiality that are there too consisting of the body decad and sex decad and the twentyfour unclungto instances of materiality consisting of the three octadswithnutritiveessenceaseighth which are originated by nutriment and so on
The same method applies to the ear element and the rest
But in the case of the body element the remaining instances of materiality total fortythree
So these five sensitivities and their five respective objective fields that is visible data sounds odours flavours and tangible data make ten instances of materiality which are ten of the eighteen elements
The remaining instances of materiality are the mentaldata element only
The consciousness that occurs with the eye as its support and contingent upon a visible datum is called eyeconsciousness element and likewise with the ear and so on
In this way the two sets of five consciousnesses are the five consciousness elements The three kinds of consciousness consisting of mind element are the single mind element The sixtyeight kinds of mindconsciousness element are the mindconsciousness element So all the eightyone kinds of mundane consciousness make up seven kinds of consciousness element
and the contact etc associated therewith are the mental data element So tenandahalf elements are materiality and sevenandahalf elements are mentality This is how one meditator defines mentalitymateriality by means of the eighteen elements
Another does it by means of the twelve bases
How
He defines as eye base the sensitivity only leaving out the fiftythree remaining instances of materiality in the way described for the eye element
And in the way described there he also defines the elements of the ear nose tongue and body as ear base nose base tongue base body base He defines five states that are their respective objective fields as visibledata base sound base odour base flavour base tangibledata base He defines the seven mundane consciousness elements as mind base He defines the contact etc associated there with and also the remaining instances of materiality as mentaldata base So here tenanda half bases are materiality and oneandahalf bases are mentality This is how one meditator defines mentalitymateriality by means of the twelve bases
Another defines it more briefly than that by means of the aggregates
How
Here a bhikkhu defines as the materiality aggregate all the following twenty seven instances of materiality that is the seventeen instances of materiality consisting of the four primaries of fourfold origination in this body and dependent colour odour flavour and nutritive essence and the five sensitivities beginning with the eye sensitivity and the materiality of the physical heart basis sex life faculty and sound of twofold origination which seventeen instances of materiality are suitable for comprehension since they are produced and are instances of concrete materiality
So he defines all these twentyseven instances of materiality as the the materiality aggregate He defines the feeling that arises together with the eightyone kinds of mundane consciousness as the feeling aggregate the perception associated therewith as the perception aggregate the formations associated therewith as the formations aggregate and the consciousness as the consciousness aggregate
Another discerns materiality in his person briefly thus Any kind of materiality whatever all consists of the four primary elements and the materiality derived from the four primary elements  and he likewise discerns the mind base and a part of the mental data base as mentality Then he defines mentalitymateriality in brief thus This mentality and this materiality are called mentalitymateriality  
But if he has discerned materiality in one of these ways and while he is trying to discern the immaterial it does not become evident to him owing to its subtlety then he should not give up but should again and again comprehend give attention to discern and define materiality only
For in proportion as materiality becomes quite definite disentangled and quite clear to him so the immaterial states that have that materiality as their object become plain of themselves too
Just as when a man with eyes looks for the reflection of his face in a dirty lookingglass and sees no reflection he does not throw the lookingglass away because the reflection does not appear on the contrary he polishes it again and again
and the immaterial states that have that materiality as their object become plain of themselves too
And this meaning can also be explained in this way by other analogies such as the pressing of sugarcane the beating of criminals to make them confess the taming of an ox the churning of curds to produce butter and the cooking of fish
that is to say the eightyone kinds of mundane consciousness consisting of the two sets of five consciousnesses  the three kinds of mind element and the sixtyeight kinds of mindconsciousness element and then seven consciousnessconcomitants that is contact feeling perception volition life steadiness of consciousness and attention which are invariably conascent with all these consciousnesses
though some say fortyfive by adding sound and making nine each for the temperatureborn and consciousnessborn sound
and then the ten instances of materiality that is bodily intimation verbal intimation the space element and the lightness malleability wieldiness growth continuity aging and impermanence of materiality which ten instances of materiality are however not suitable for comprehension since they are merely the modealteration and the limitationof interval they are not produced and are not concrete materiality
but they are reckoned as materiality because they are modealterations and limitationof interval of various instances of materiality
So by defining the materiality aggregate as materiality and the four immaterial aggregates as mentality he defines mentalitymateriality by means of the five aggregates
For in proportion as materiality becomes quite definite disentangled and quite clear to him so the defilements that are opposing him subside his consciousness becomes clear like the water above the precipitated mud
and then the reflection becomes plain of itself when the lookingglass is cleanand just as
when a man needing oil puts sesame flour in a basin and wets it with water and no oil comes out with only one or two pressings he does not throw the sesame flour away but on the contrary he wets it again and again with hot water and squeezes and presses it
and as he does so clear sesame oil comes out
or just as when a man wanting to clarify water has taken a katuka nut and put his hand inside the pot and rubbed it once or twice but the water does not come clear he does not throw the katuka nut away on the contrary he rubs it again and again
and as he does so the fine mud subsides
and the water becomes transparent and clear so too the bhikkhu should not give up but he should again and again comprehend give attention to discern and define materiality only
Mentality should be taken here as the four aggregates beginning with feeling and belonging to the three planes not omitting consciousness as in the case of With consciousness as condition mentalitymateriality and not including the supramundane aggregates associated with Nibbāna
One who is beginning this work has difficulty in discerning the highest form of becoming that is the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception
Bending in the direction of the object means that there is no occurrence without an object it is in the sense of that sort of bending or it is in the sense of bestowing a name 
On the other hand he said of the regulations of the Vinaya When I am gone nanda let the Order if it should so desire abolish the lesser and minor rules of training
Now revered Nāgasena were these lesser and minor rules of training wrongly laid down without ground and in ignorance since the Blessed One allowed them to be abolished after his passing
Because sweat etc arise owing to heat fatigue etc and owing to mental perturbation they are called originated by temperature and by consciousness
Now sire would the princes on the death of their father give up those outlying districts already in their power
Even so sire the Tathāgata spoke thus testing the monks When I am gone nanda let the Order if it should so desire abolish the lesser and minor rules of training
Sire the sons of the Buddha for complete freedom from suffering and in their desire for Dhamma would preserve even more than another hundred and fifty rules of traininghow then should they let go of the rules of training that had been laid down originally
as to which are the lesser rules of training and which the minor
This secret of the Conquerors hidden for long revered Nāgasena is today at the present time disclosed and made clear in the world
The exalted consciousness of the finematerial and immaterial spheres is only quite plain to one who has attained the attainments
As well as by means of the elements etc materiality can also be discerned through the faculties the truths and the dependent origination
How
Firstly through the faculties These seven namely the five beginning with the eye plus femininity and masculinity are materiality the eleven consisting of the mind faculty the five feeling faculties and the five beginning with faith are mentality the life faculty is both mentality and materiality The last three being supramundane are not intended here
The truth of suffering is both mentality and materiality the truth of origin is mentality the other two are not intended here because they are supramundane
In the structure of conditions the first three members are mentality the fourth and fifth are mentality and materiality the sixth seventh eighth and ninth are mentality the tenth is both mentality and materiality the last two are each mentality and materiality
The kinds of states that ought to be abandoned  also the act of their abandoning now which states are to be abandoned by which kind of knowledge among these four should be understood and also the act of abandoning them
For they each and severally bring about the act of abandoning of the states called fetters defilements wrongnesses worldly states kinds of avarice perversions ties bad ways cankers floods bonds hindrances adherences clingings inherent tendencies stains unprofitable courses of action and unprofitable thought arisings
Herein the fetters are the ten states beginning with greed for the fine material so called because they fetter aggregates in this life to aggregates of the next or kamma to its fruit or beings to suffering
For as long as those exist there is no cessation of the others
And of these fetters greed for the fine material greed for the immaterial conceit  agitation and ignorance are called the five higher fetters because they fetter beings to aggregates etc produced in higher forms of becoming
The worldly states are the eight namely gain loss fame disgrace pleasure pain blame and praise They are so called because they continually succeed each other as long as the world persists
But when the worldly states are included then by the metaphorical use of the causes name for its fruit the approval that has the gain etc as its object and the resentment that has the loss etc as its object should also be understood as included
The kinds of avarice are the five namely avarice about dwellings families gain Dhamma and praise which occur as inability to bear sharing with others any of these things beginning with dwellings
The perversions are the three namely perversions of perception of consciousness and of view which occur apprehending objects that are impermanent painful notself and foul  as permanent pleasant self and beautiful
The ties are the four beginning with covetousness so called because they tie the mental body and the material body
They are described as the bodily tie of covetousness the bodily tie of ill will the bodily tie of adherence to rules and vows and the bodily tie of insisting that This only is the truth 
Bad ways is a term for doing what ought not to be done and not doing what ought to be done out of zeal  hate delusion and fear
They are called bad ways because they are ways not to be travelled by Noble Ones
Cankers  as far as changeoflineage in the case of states of consciousness and as far as the acme of becoming in the case of the kinds of becoming that is to say the fourth immaterial state there are exudations owing to the formed nature of the object This is a term for greed for sense desires greed for becoming wrong view and ignorance because of the exuding of these defilements from unguarded sensedoors like water from cracks in a pot in the sense of constant trickling or because of their producing the suffering of the round of rebirths
The floods are so called in the sense of sweeping away into the ocean of becoming and in the sense of being hard to cross The bonds are so called because they do not allow disengagement from an object and disengagement from suffering Both floods and bonds are terms for the cankers already mentioned
The hindrances are the five namely lust ill will stiffness and torpor agitation and worry and uncertainty in the sense of obstructing and hindering and concealing reality from consciousness 
Adherence is a term for wrong view because it occurs in the aspect of missing the individual essence of a given state and apprehending elsewhere an unactual individual essence
The clingings are the four beginning with sensedesire clinging described in all their aspects in the Description of the Dependent Origination 
The inherent tendencies are the seven namely greed for sense desires etc in the sense of the inveterateness stated thus the inherent tendency to greed for sense desires the inherent tendency to resentment conceit  false view uncertainty greed for becoming and ignorance
For it is owing to their inveteracy that they are called inherent tendencies since they inhere as cause for the arising of greed for sense desires etc again and again
The stains are the three namely greed hate and delusion They are so called because they are themselves dirty like oil black and mud and because they dirty other things
The unprofitable courses of action are the ten namely killing living things taking what is not given sexual misconduct false speech malicious speech harsh speech gossip covetousness ill will and wrong view They are so called since they are both unprofitable action and courses that lead to unhappy destinies
The unprofitable thoughtarisings are the twelve consisting of the eight rooted in greed the two rooted in hate and the two rooted in delusion 
So these four kinds of knowledge each and severally abandon these states beginning with the fetters
How
The five states eliminated by the first knowledge in the case of the fetters firstly are false view of personality doubt adherence to rules and vows and then greed for sense desires and resentment that are strong enough to lead to states of loss The remaining gross greed for sense desires and resentment are eliminated by the second knowledge Subtle greed for sense desires and resentment are eliminated by the third knowledge The five beginning with greed for the fine material are only actually eliminated by the fourth knowledge
In what follows we shall not in every instance specify the fact with the expression only actually
In the case of the wrongnesses wrong view false speech wrong action and wrong livelihood are eliminated by the first knowledge Wrong thinking malicious speech and harsh speech are eliminated by the third knowledge And here only volition is to be understood as speech
Gossip wrong effort wrong mindfulness wrong concentration wrong deliverance and wrong knowledge are eliminated by the fourth knowledge
In the case of the worldly states resentment is eliminated by the third knowledge and approval is eliminated by the fourth knowledge Some say that approval of fame and praise is eliminated by the fourth knowledge
The kinds of avarice are eliminated by the first knowledge only
In the case of the perversions the perversions of perception consciousness and view which find permanence in the impermanent and self in the notself and the perversion of view finding pleasure in pain and beauty in the foul are eliminated by the first knowledge The perversions of perception and consciousness finding beauty in the foul are eliminated by the third path The perversions of perception and consciousness finding pleasure in the painful are eliminated by the fourth knowledge
In the case of ties the bodily ties of adherence to rules and vows and of the insistence that This is the truth are eliminated by the first knowledge The bodily tie of ill will is eliminated by the third knowledge The remaining one is eliminated by the fourth path
The bad ways are eliminated by the first knowledge only
In the case of the cankers the canker of view is eliminated by the first knowledge The canker of sense desire is eliminated by the third knowledge The other two are eliminated by the fourth knowledge
The same thing applies in the case of the floods and the bonds
In the case of the hindrances the hindrance of uncertainty is eliminated by the first knowledge The three namely lust ill will and worry are eliminated by the third knowledge Stiffness and torpor and agitation are eliminated by the fourth knowledge
Adherence is eliminated by the first knowledge only
In the case of the clingings since according to what is given in the texts all worldly states are sense desires that is sense desires as object  and so greed both for the fine material and the immaterial falls under sense desire clinging consequently that sensedesire clinging is eliminated by the fourth knowledge The rest are eliminated by the first knowledge
In the case of the inherent tendencies the inherent tendencies to false view and to uncertainty are eliminated by the first knowledge The inherent tendencies to greed for sense desires and to resentment are eliminated by the third knowledge The inherent tendencies to conceit  to greed for becoming and to ignorance are eliminated by the fourth knowledge
In the case of the stains the stain of hate is eliminated by the third knowledge the others are eliminated by the fourth knowledge
In the case of the unprofitable thoughtarisings the four associated with false view and that associated with uncertainty making five are eliminated by the first knowledge The two associated with resentment are eliminated by the third knowledge The rest are eliminated by the fourth knowledge
And what is eliminated by any one of them is abandoned by it
That is why it was said above So these four kinds of knowledge each and severally abandon these states beginning with the fetters
The act of the abandoning but how then Do these knowledges abandon these states when they are past or when they are future or when they are present
What is the position here For firstly if they are said to abandon them when past or future it follows that the effort is fruitless
Why
Because what has to be abandoned is nonexistent
Then if it is when they are present it is likewise fruitless because the things to be abandoned exist simultaneously with the effort and it follows that there is development of a path that has defilement or it follows that defilements are dissociated from consciousness though there is no such thing as a present defilement dissociated from consciousness
That is not an original argument
What is past which is nonexistent that he abandons But this is denied in this way He does not abandon past defilements
What is future which is nonexistent that he abandons But this is denied in this way He does not abandon future defilements
Suppose there were a young tree with unborn fruit and a man cut its root then the unborn fruits of the tree would remain unborn and not come to be born remain ungenerated and not come to be generated remain unarisen and not come to be arisen remain unmanifested and not come to be manifested So too arising is a cause arising is a condition for the generation of defilements Seeing danger in defilements consciousness enters into nonarising With consciousnesss entering into non arising the defilements that would be generated with arising as their condition remain unborn and do not come to be born  remain unmanifest and do not come to be manifested So with the cessation of the cause there is the cessation of suffering
Occurrence is a cause  The sign is a cause  Accumulation is a cause accumulation is a condition for the generation of defilements Seeing danger in accumulation consciousness enters into nonaccumulation With consciousnesss entering into nonaccumulation the defilements that would be generated with accumulation as their condition remain unborn and do not come to be born  remain unmanifest and do not come to be manifested So with the cessation of the cause there is cessation of suffering
So there is path development there is realization of fruition there is abandoning of defilements and there is penetrating to the Dhamma 
What does that show
It shows abandoning of defilements that have soil to grow in
But are defilements that have soil to grow in past future or present
They are simply those described as arisen by having soil to grow in
Now there are various meanings of arisen that is to say arisen as actually occurring arisen as been and gone arisen by opportunity and arisen by having soil to grow in
Herein all that is reckoned to possess the three moments of arising ageing that is presence and dissolution is called arisen as actually occurring
 Profitable and unprofitable kammaresult experienced as the stimulus of an object and ceasedreckoned as experienced and gone  and also anything formed when it has reached the three instants beginning with arising and has ceasedreckoned as been and gone  are called arisen as been and gone 
 Kamma described in the way beginning Deeds that he did in the past  even when actually past is called arisen by opportunity made because it reaches presence by inhibiting other ripening kamma and making that the opportunity for its own result And kammaresult that has its opportunity made in this way even when as yet unarisen is called arisen by opportunity made too because it is sure to arise when an opportunity for it has been made in this way
 While unprofitable kamma is still unabolished in any given soil  it is called arisen by having soil to grow in
And here the difference between the soil and what has soil should be understood
For soil means the five aggregates in the three planes of becoming which are the object of insight
Those defilements have that soil  That is why by having soil to grow in is said And that is not meant objectively
For defilements occupied with an object arise with respect to any aggregates including past or future ones as well as present and also with respect to the subjectively fullyunderstood aggregates in someone else whose cankers are destroyed like those that arose in the rich man Soreyya with respect to the aggregates in Mahā Kaccāna and in the brahman student Nanda with respect to Uppalavaṇṇā  and so on
And if that were what is called arisen by having soil to grow in no one could abandon the root of becoming because it would be unabandonable
But arisen by having soil to grow in should be understood subjectively with respect to the basis for them in oneself
And that is what should be understood as arisen by having the soil to grow in in the sense of its being unabandoned
Now when defilements are inherent in the sense of being unabandoned in someones aggregates it is only those aggregates of his that are the basis for those defilements not aggregates belonging to another
And only past aggregates not others are the basis for defilements that inhere unabandoned in past aggregates
Likewise in the case of future aggregates and so on
Similarly too only sensesphere aggregates not others are the basis for defilements that inhere unabandoned in sensesphere aggregates
Likewise in the case of the fine material and immaterial
But in the case of the streamenterer etc when a given defilement which is a root of the round has been abandoned by means of a given path in a given noble persons aggregates then his aggregates are no longer called soil for such defilement since they are no longer a basis for it
But in an ordinary man the defilements that are the root of the round are not abandoned at all and so whatever kamma he performs is always either profitable or unprofitable
So for him the round goes on revolving with kamma and defilements as its condition
But while it is thus the root of the round it cannot be said that it is only in his materiality aggregate and not in his other aggregates beginning with feeling 
Why
Because it is inherent in all five aggregates indiscriminately
How
Like the juice of humus etc in a tree
For when a great tree is growing on the earths surface supported by the essences of humus and water and with that as condition increases its roots trunks branches twigs shoots foliage flowers and fruit till it fills the sky and continues the trees lineage through the succession of the seed up till the end of the eon it cannot be said that the essence of humus etc are found only in its root and not in the trunk etc  that they are only in the fruit and not in the root etc
Because they spread indiscriminately through the whole of it from the root onwards
But some man who felt revulsion for that same trees flowers fruits etc might puncture it on four sides with the poison thorn called maṇḍūka thorn and then the tree being poisoned would be no more able to prolong its continuity since it would have become barren with the contamination of the essences of humus and water So too the clansman who feels revulsion for the occurrence of the aggregates undertakes to develop the four paths in his own continuity which is like the mans application of poison to the tree on all four sides
Then the continuity of his aggregates is rendered incapable of prolonging the continuity to a subsequent becoming It is now unproductive of future becoming since all kinds of kamma beginning with bodily kamma are now merely functional for the effect of the four paths poison has entirely exterminated the defilements that are the root of the round
Being without clinging he inevitably attains with the cessation of the last consciousness the complete extinction of Nibbāna like a fire with no more fuel This is how the difference between the soil and what has soil should be understood
Besides these there are four other ways of classing arisen namely arisen as happening arisen with apprehension of an object arisen through nonsuppression arisen through nonabolition
Herein arisen as happening is the same as arisen as actually occurring
 When an object has at some previous time come into focus in the eye etc and defilement did not arise then but arose in full force later on simply because the object had been apprehended then that defilement is called arisen with apprehension of an object Like the defilement that arose in the Elder MahāTissa after seeing the form of a person of the opposite sex while wandering for alms in the village of Kalyāna 
 As long as a defilement is not suppressed by either serenity or insight though it may not have actually entered the conscious continuity it is nevertheless called arisen through nonsuppression because there is no cause to prevent its arising if suitable conditions combine
 But even when they are suppressed by serenity or insight they are still called arisen through nonabolition because the necessity for their arising has not been transcended unless they have been cut off by the path Like the elder who had obtained the eight attainments and the defilements that arose in him while he was going through the air on his hearing the sound of a woman singing with a sweet voice as she was gathering flowers in a grove of blossoming trees
And the three kinds namely arisen with apprehension of an object arisen through nonsuppression and arisen through nonabolition should be understood as included by arisen by having soil to grow in
So as regard the kinds of arisen stated the four kinds namely as actually occurring as been and gone by opportunity made and as happening cannot be abandoned by any of these four kinds of knowledge because they cannot be eliminated by the paths
But the four kinds of arisen namely by having soil to grow in with apprehension of an object through nonsuppression and through nonabolition can all be abandoned because a given mundane or supramundane knowledge when it arises nullifies a given one of these modes of being arisen
So here the kinds of states that ought to be abandoned also the act of their abandoning should be known in this way
which with wrong knowledge and wrong deliverance come to ten
The wrongnesses are the eight states namely wrong view wrong thinking wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness wrong concentration 
The defilements are the ten states namely greed hate delusion conceit  false view uncertainty stiffness of mind agitation consciencelessness shamelessness They are so called because they are themselves defiled and because they defile their associated states
while false view of individuality uncertainty adherence to rules and vows greed for sense desires and resentment are called the five lower fetters because they fetter beings to aggregates etc produced in the lower forms of becoming
nevertheless whatever we shall say is eliminated by one of the three higher knowledges should be understood as only the residual state eliminated by the higher knowledge for that state will have already been rendered not conducive to states of loss by the preceding knowledge
In the case of the defilements false view and uncertainty are eliminated by the first knowledge Hate is eliminated by the third knowledge Greed delusion conceit  mental stiffness agitation consciencelessness and shameless ness are eliminated by the fourth knowledge
In the case of the unprofitable courses of action killing living things taking what is not given sexual misconduct false speech and wrong view are eliminated by the first knowledge The three namely malicious speech harsh speech and ill will are eliminated by the third knowledge Gossip and covetousness are eliminated by the fourth knowledge
for in the text first the question is put When a man abandons defilements does he abandon past defilements Does he abandon future defilements Does he abandon present defilements  Then the objection is put in this way If he abandons past defilements he destroys what has already been destroyed causes to cease what has already ceased causes to vanish what has already vanished causes to subside what has already subsided
Then the objection is put in this way If he abandons future defilements he abandons what has not been born he abandons what has not been generated he abandons what has not arisen he abandons what has not become manifest
Then the objection is put in this way If he abandons present defilements then though inflamed with greed he abandons greed
though corrupted with hate he abandons hate though deluded he abandons delusion though shackled he abandons conceit  though misconceiving he abandons false view though distracted he abandons agitation though not having made up his mind he abandons uncertainty though not having inveterate habits he abandons inherent tendency
dark and bright states occur coupled together
and there is development of a path that has defilement But this is all denied in this way He does not abandon past defilements he does not abandon future defilements he does not abandon present defilements Finally it is asked Then there is no path development there is no realization of fruition there is no abandoning of defilements there is no penetration to the Dhamma   Then it is claimed There is path development  there is penetration to the Dhamma  And when it is asked In what way this is said
What has soil is an expression for defilements capable of arising with respect to those aggregates
For the defilements that are the root of the round are inherent in ones own aggregates not fully understood by insight from the instant those aggregates arise
that it is only in his consciousness aggregate and not in his other aggregates beginning with materiality
Why
Inherent tendencies continually in here  they occur in a living beings continuity This is the name for those defilements that have become firmly implanted and are ready to arise when there is a reason
Wrong deliverance is the wrong notion of liberation that assumes liberation to take place in a World Apex  and so on 
Wrong knowledge which is wrong because it does not occur rightly ie in conformity with the truth and is wrong and mistaken owing to misinterpretations etc is just delusion
Exudations because of occurring due to
savanato is because of flowing out as filth of defilement
Savanato the second time is because of giving out 
The intention is or it follows that there is dissociation of defilements from consciousness like that of formations according to those who assert that formations exist dissociated form consciousness
He said there is no such thing as a present defilement dissociated from consciousness in order to show that that is merely the opinion of those who make the assertion
For it is when immaterial states are actually occurring by their having a single basis and being included in the three instants that they are present so how could that be dissociated from consciousness Consequently there is no dissociation from consciousness here
Shackled one whose consciousness is shackled by conceit 
In any given plane means aggregates as objects of clinging reckoned as a human or divine person
By the words which are the object of insight he points out the nonfully understood state of the aggregates not merely the fact that they are the object of insight which is proved by his taking only the three planes
For it is notfully understood aggregates among the aggregates constituting the subjective basis that are intended as the soil of defilements
With respect to the basis for them in oneself means as the place of their arising
in that particular becoming or continuity
No one would be able to abandon the root of becoming if it were in anothers continuity
Now at that time there came to be a disturbance on the borderlands of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha commanded the generals the chief ministers saying Go good sirs search the borderlands
Very well sire the generals the chief ministers answered King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha in assent
Then it occurred to very distinguished warriors Because we delight in battle we do evil and we engender much demerit
Now by what means could we refrain from evil and do what is good
Then it occurred to these warriors These recluses sons of the Sakyans are dhammafarers evenfarers Brahmafarers they are truthspeakers of moral habit of good character
Now if we were to go forth among these recluses sons of the Sakyans thus might we refrain from evil and do what is good
The monks let them go forth they ordained them
The generals the chief ministers asked those in the Kings service How is it good sirs that the warriors so and so and so and so are not to be seen 
Sirs the warriors so and so and so and so have gone forth among the monks
The generals the chief ministers told this matter to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha asked the chief ministers of justice Good sirs what does he who lets one go forth who is in a kings service engender  
Sire a preceptors head should be cut off the tongue should be torn from the announcer of a proclamation half the ribs of a group should be broken
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha approached the Lord having approached having greeted the lord he sat down at a respectful distance
As he was sitting down at a respectful distance King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha spoke thus to the Lord There are Lord kings who are of no faith not believing
It were well Lord if the masters did not let one in a kings service go forth
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha gladdened  delighted by the Lord with talk on dhamma rising from his seat having greeted the Lord departed keeping his right side towards him
Then the Lord on this occasion in this connection having given reasoned talk addressed the monks saying Monks one in a kings service should not be let go forth
Whoever should let go forth there is an offence of wrongdoing
Then these warriors having approached monks asked for the going forth
The generals the chief ministers  spread it about saying How can these recluses sons of the Sakyans let one who is in the kings service go forth
these might harm monks even for a trifling matter
Then the Lord gladdened  delighted King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha with talk on dhamma
finite 
infinite 
neither
or does he not exist after death
Sire it was not with regard to arahats that the Blessed One spoke when he said All beings tremble at punishment all fear death
The arahat is an exception to this statement for all cause for fear has been removed from the arahat
and that when some business had arisen the king should have a command issued touching all the people in his realm to the effect Let everyone pay me a tax and do you my four chief ministers carry out that business
Now sire would any tremor due to the fear of taxation arise in those four chief ministers
For what reason sire
Even so sire the statement that all beings tremble at punishment all fear death
does not apply to the arahats
Death sire is a cause for fear for those who have not seen the Four Noble Truths
a black snake or an elephant or a lion or a hyena or a wild buffalo or fire or water
while fearing any of these is fearing death
Suppose sire a boil were to arise full of pus on a mans body
and he in pain from that disease and wanting to escape from the danger of it were to call in a surgeon
and the surgeon accepting the call were to have a lancet sharpened have sticks to be used as cauterisers put in the fire and have lye and salt ground together on a grindstone Would not fright arise in that afflicted man sire with the cutting of the sharp lancet the burning of the caustic sticks and the application of the lye and salt
If the sick man who wants to be free from his ailment can be afraid of pain
just so can beings in hell though they long to be released from it be afraid of death
Yes revered sir
Not in the sky not in the oceans midst
Not in the most secluded mountain cleft Not in the whole wide world is found the spot Where standing one can escape the snare of death
that is to say the Ratana Sutta the Khandha Paritta the Mora Paritta the Dhajagga Paritta the Atanatiya Paritta and the Angulimala Paritta
If revered Nāgasena one cannot escape death either in the sky or in the midocean or in a mountain cleft or anywhere in the whole wide world then protective recitals are useless
even so sire protective recitals should be put aside in the case of one whose span of existence is coming to an end but for those who have a period of life remaining and are in their prime protective recitals are like medicines and may be chanted with benefit
If revered Nāgasena one whose span of existence is coming to an end dies and if one who has a period of life yet remaining lives well then protective recitals are useless
Have you sire ever seen a disease being turned back by medicines
Well then sire to say that protective recitals are useless is a false statement
Revered Nāgasena I have seen doctors administer medicines by means of beverages and external applications as a result of which diseases have been assuaged
And sire when the sound of the protective recitals is heard all the illnesses abate at the recitation all calamities disappear though the tongue had been dry the heart beating but feebly and the throat sore
Revered Nāgasena do protective recitals protect everyone
Well then revered Nāgasena a protective recital is not always useful
Now sire does food preserve everyones life
Well then sire food does not preserve everyones life
In the same way sire a protective recital protects some some it does not protect
then dragging them along full of excitement she brings them before her husband but if her child is naughty or comes in late
Why not sire
Even so sire it is through his own fault that a person makes barren a protective recital that has protective power for beings
It is good revered Nāgasena the question has been well analysed the thicket made clear the darkness made light and the net of speculative views disentangled thanks to you a most excellent teacher
But on the other hand when he was extolling the virtues and nature of the Blessed One Metteyya he said He will lead an Order of monks numbering several thousands even as I now lead an Order of monks numbering several hundreds
If the first statement is right then the second is wrong
Sire you quote both passages correctly
It is due to his having got rid of wrong view of self
It is good revered Nāgasena the question has been well unravelled in a variety of ways what was profound has been made clear the knot is severed the thicket made open darkness made light shattered are the tenets of others vision has uprisen for the sons of the Conqueror
But on the other hand a lay devotee a householder who is a streamenterer for whom the possibility of rebirth in any place of woe has passed away who has attained to view and understood the Doctrine even such a one ought to salute and to rise from his seat for a monk even though a novice and a worldling
Now if the Dhamma be the best that rule of conduct is wrong
but if that be right then the first statement must be wrong
Sire the Blessed One said what you have quoted and you have rightly described the rule of conduct
A monk lives undertaking these special qualities
because he knows that he allows others to go forth and ordains them thus extending the teaching of the Conqueror which he himself is incapable of doing 
because he knows that he is one who carries out completely the slightest rules of training which he himself cannot observe 
because he knows that he wears the outward signs of recluseship and carries out the intention of the Buddha while he himself is far removed from that 
because he knows that though he has given up his hair and beard and is unanointed and wears no ornaments yet he is anointed with the perfume of righteousness while he himself is addicted to jewellery and fine apparel that the lay devotee who is a streamenterer thinks it proper for him to salute and rise for a monk even though he is a worldling
Moreover sire you may know by this fact the greatness and unequalled magnitude of the condition of a monk
If a lay devotee who is a streamenterer achieves arahatship one of two results must happen to himhe must either die on that very day or take upon himself the condition of a monk
Revered Nāgasena the question has been gone into with knowledge it is well unravelled by your powerful and great discretion it is a question that only one as full of discretion as you are is competent to disentangle thus
On the other hand when the Tathāgata was promulgating the first offence entailing Defeat as a result of the improbity of the Elder Sudinna Kalandakas son he addressed him with harsh words calling him a foolish fellow That Elder on being so called terrified of his teacher and overcome with remorse was unable to comprehend the noble path
Have you sire ever heard of anyone bowing down before rising up for showing reverence to or making an offering to a wrongdoer
Well then sire did the Blessed One act properly or not
Now sire would a physician administer pleasant things as medicine in a case where all the humours of the body were affected and the whole frame was disorganized and full of disease
as the words of a father would be to his children
in the Threefold Heaven Resplendent
Gopaka my name See me now
And led the life the Buddha taught
Who before had human birth
No higher than gandhabbas rank
And waited on them in our homes
Had they no ears that they thus blest
Still could not grasp the Buddhas law
taught by HimWhoSees And wellproclaimed
I serving you
Heard the Noble Ones good words
in the Threefold Heaven And resplendent
whereas you Though you served the Prince of Men
And led the matchless life he taught
And not attained your proper rank
A sony sight it is to see
Ones Dhammafellows sunk so low
But come to wait upon the gods
While as for me  I am transformed
From household life
Rejoicing in celestial bliss
Gopaka In sore distress they all replied
When thus rebuked by Disciple true of Gotama
And be no longer others slaves
And of the three two struggled hard
And bore in mind the Teachers word
Perceiving peril in desires
Those fetters of the evil one So hard to overcome
All restraining bonds they broke The fetters and the bonds of lust
 and thus The very gods the ThirtyThree
With Indra and Pajapati
These two heroes passions purged
Chief amidst that throng of gods Cried
Outstrip the gods the ThirtyThree
Then hearing of his rulers fears
called the Sakyan Sage Has gained the mastery of lust
Have now regained it with my help
And still among gandhabbas dwells
In deep absorption spurn the gods
Let no disciple ever doubt
Have passed beyond to greater eminence
In Realms of Brahmas Retinue
Those two have gained a higher place than this
To put our questions to the Blessed Lord
and if the Lord will give us leave
And we Have come O Lord
On what you ask Ill put your mind at rest
Must surely be enlightened Ill seek them
Long I wandered In quest of the Tathagata
but thus asked They could not tell me how to tread the path
they asked me why Id come to them
they Cried Its Vasava the Lord weve seen
my fears are allayed
And now to the Enlightened One I pay Homage due Mighty hero kinsman of the Sun
So likewise today we worship you
Whom none can equal in the human world Or in the heavens dwelling of the gods
The four divine abidings were mentioned next to the recollections as meditation subjects  They are lovingkindness compassion gladness and equanimity A meditator who wants to develop firstly lovingkindness among these if he is a beginner should sever the impediments and learn the meditation subject Then when he has done the work connected with the meal and got rid of any dizziness due to it he should seat himself comfortably on a wellprepared seat in a secluded place To start with he should review the danger in hate and the advantage in patience
Why
Because hate has to be abandoned and patience attained in the development of this meditation subject
and he cannot abandon unseen dangers and attain unknown advantages
Now the danger in hate should be seen in accordance with such suttas as this Friends when a man hates is a prey to hate and his mind is obsessed by hate he kills living things and  
No higher rule the Buddhas say than patience And no Nibbāna higher than forbearance 
Patience in force in strong array Tis him I call a brahman 
No greater thing exists than patience  And the advantage in patience should be understood according to such suttas as these 
Thereupon he should embark upon the development of lovingkindness for the purpose of secluding the mind from hate seen as a danger and introducing it to patience known as an advantage
But when he begins he must know that some persons are of the wrong sort at the very beginning and that lovingkindness should be developed towards certain kinds of persons and not towards certain other kinds at first
For lovingkindness should not be developed at first towards the following four kinds of persons an antipathetic person a very dearly loved friend a neutral person and a hostile person
Also it should not be developed specifically towards the opposite sex
or towards a dead person
What is the reason why it should not be developed at first towards an antipathetic person and the others
To put an antipathetic person in a dear ones place is fatiguing
To put a very dearly loved friend in a neutral persons place is fatiguing and if the slightest mischance befalls the friend he feels like weeping
To put a neutral person in a respected ones or a dear ones place is fatiguing
Anger springs up in him if he recollects a hostile person That is why it should not be developed at first towards an antipathetic person and the rest
Then if he develops it specifically towards the opposite sex lust inspired by that person springs up in him
An elder supported by a family was asked it seems by a friends son Venerable sir towards whom should lovingkindness be developed
The elder told him Towards a person one loves
He loved his own wife
Through developing lovingkindness towards her he was fighting against the wall all the night
That is why it should not be developed specifically towards the opposite sex
But if he develops it towards a dead person he reaches neither absorption nor access
A young bhikkhu it seems had started developing lovingkindness inspired by his teacher
His lovingkindness made no headway at all
He went to a senior elder and told him Venerable sir I am quite familiar with attaining jhāna through lovingkindness and yet I cannot attain it What is the matter
The elder said Seek the sign friend the object of your meditation
He did so Finding that his teacher had died he proceeded with developing lovingkindness inspired by another and attained absorption
That is why it should not be developed towards one who is dead
First of all it should be developed only towards oneself doing it repeatedly thus May I be happy and free from suffering or May I keep myself free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily
If that is so does it not conflict with what is said in the texts For there is no mention of any development of it towards oneself in what is said in the Vibhaṅga
And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart filled with lovingkindness
Just as he would feel lovingkindness on seeing a dearly loved person so he pervades all beings with lovingkindness 
and in the Paṭisambhidā
In what five ways is the minddeliverance of lovingkindness practiced with unspecified pervasion May all beings be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily
May all breathing things  all who are born  all persons  all those who have a personality be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily 
and in the Mettā Sutta
In joy and safety
may all beings be joyful at heart 
in what is said 
For there is no mention of any development of it towards oneself Does it not conflict with those texts
in what is said Does it not conflict with what is said in the texts
It does not conflict
Why not
Because that refers to absorption
But this initial development towards oneself refers to making oneself an example
For even if he developed lovingkindness for a hundred or a thousand years in this way I am happy and so on absorption would never arise
But if he develops it in this way I am happy Just as I want to be happy and dread pain as I want to live and not to die so do other beings too making himself the example then desire for other beings welfare and happiness arises in him
And by the Blessed Ones saying
I visited all quarters with my mind
Nor found I any dearer than myself
Self is likewise to every other dear
Who loves himself will never harm another 
this method is indicated 
But if he has no enemy or he is of the type of a great man who does not perceive another as an enemy even when the other does him harm he should not interest himself as follows Now that my consciousness of lovingkindness has become wieldy towards a neutral person I shall apply it to a hostile one
Rather it was about one who actually has an enemy that it was said above that he should develop lovingkindness towards a hostile person as neutral
The fate you reap will long deter All others from such deeds as this 
When his resentment towards that hostile person has been thus allayed then he can turn his mind with lovingkindness towards that person too just as towards the one who is dear the very dear friend and the neutral person
Then he should break down the barriers by practicing lovingkindness over and over again accomplishing mental impartiality towards the four persons that is to say himself the dear person the neutral person and the hostile person
The characteristic of it is this Suppose this person is sitting in a place with a dear a neutral and a hostile person himself being the fourth then bandits come to him and say Venerable sir give us a bhikkhu and on being asked why they answer So that we may kill him and use the blood of his throat as an offering then if that bhikkhu thinks Let them take this one or this one he has not broken down the barriers
Why
And also if he thinks Let them take me but not these three he has not broken down the barriers either
Because he seeks the harm of him whom he wishes to be taken and seeks the welfare of the other only
But it is when he does not see a single one among the four people to be given to the bandits and he directs his mind impartially towards himself and towards those three people that he has broken down the barriers
Hence the Ancients said
The four that is himself the dear The neutral and the hostile one
Then skilled is not the name he gets Nor having amity at will
When he discriminates between  But only kindly towards beings
Now when a bhikkhus barriers Have all the four been broken down
He treats with equal amity The whole world with its deities
Far more distinguished than the first Is he who knows no barriers
Thus the sign and access are obtained by this bhikkhu simultaneously with the breaking down of the barriers
But when breaking down of the barriers has been effected he reaches absorption in the way described under the earth kasiṇa without trouble by cultivating developing and repeatedly practicing that same sign
At this point he has attained the first jhāna which abandons five factors possesses five factors is good in three ways is endowed with ten characteristics and is accompanied by lovingkindness
And when that has been obtained then by cultivating developing and repeatedly practicing that same sign he successively reaches the second and third jhānas in the fourfold system and the second third and fourth in the fivefold system
Now it is by means of one of these jhānas beginning with the first that he Dwells pervading one direction with his heart endued with loving kindness
likewise the second direction likewise the third direction likewise the fourth direction
and so above below and around everywhere and equally he dwells pervading the entire world with his heart endued with loving kindness abundant exalted measureless free from enmity and free from affliction 
For this versatility comes about only in one whose consciousness has reached absorption in the first jhāna and the rest
And here endued with lovingkindness means possessing lovingkindness
With his heart  with his mind 
One direction this refers to anyone direction in which a being is first discerned and means pervasion of the beings included in that one direction
Pervading touching making his object
He dwells  he causes the occurrence of an abiding in postures that is devoted to the divine abidings 
Likewise the second just as he dwells pervading anyone direction among those beginning with the eastern one so he does with the next one and the third and the fourth is the meaning
So above in that same way in the upper direction is what is meant
Below around so too the lower direction and the direction all round
Herein below is underneath
and around is in the intermediate directions
So he sends his heart full of lovingkindness back and forth in all directions like a horse in a circus ground
Up to this point specified pervasion with lovingkindness is shown in the discernment of each direction separately
Everywhere etc is said for the purpose of showing unspecified pervasion
Herein everywhere means in all places
Equally  to all classed as inferior medium superior friendly hostile neutral etc just as to oneself 
equality with oneself without making the distinction This is another being is what is meant
Or alternatively equally is with the whole state of the mind not reserving even a little is what is meant
Entire  possessing all beings  associated with all beings is the meaning
World is the world of beings
Endued with lovingkindness is said again here in order to introduce the synonyms beginning with abundant
Or alternatively endued with lovingkindness is repeated because the word likewise or the word so is not repeated here as it was in the case of the preceding specified pervasion
Or alternatively it is said as a way of concluding
And abundant should be regarded here as abundance in pervading
But it is exalted in plane from the sensualsphere plane to the fine materialsphere plane measureless through familiarity and through having measureless beings as its object free from enmity through abandonment of ill will and hostility and free from affliction through abandonment of grief without suffering is what is meant
This is the meaning of the versatility described in the way beginning With his heart endued with lovingkindness
And just as this versatility is successful only in one whose mind has reached absorption so too that described in the Paṭisambhidā should be understood to be successful only in one whose mind has reached absorption that is to say The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with unspecified pervasion in five ways The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with specified pervasion in seven ways The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with directional pervasion in ten ways 
And herein the minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with unspecified pervasion in these five ways May all beings be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily May all breathing things  all creatures  all persons  all those who have a personality be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily 
The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with specified pervasion in these seven ways May all women be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily May all men  all Noble Ones  all not Noble Ones  all deities  all human beings  all in states of loss be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily 
May all beings in the eastern direction be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily
May all beings in the western direction  northern direction  southern direction  eastern intermediate direction  western intermediate direction  northern intermediate direction  southern intermediate direction  downward direction  upward direction be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily
May all breathing things in the eastern direction  May all creatures in the eastern direction  May all persons in the eastern direction  May all who have a personality in the eastern direction  etc  in the upward direction be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily
May all women in the eastern direction  May all men in the eastern direction  May all Noble Ones in the eastern direction  May all not Noble Ones in the eastern direction  May all deities in the eastern direction  May all human beings in the eastern direction  May all those in states of loss in the eastern direction  etc  be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily 
The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with directional pervasion in these ten ways 
Herein all signifies inclusion without exception
Beings  they are held  gripped by desire and greed for the aggregates beginning with materiality thus they are beings 
For this is said by the Blessed One
Any desire for matter Rādha any greed for it any delight in it any craving for it has held it has gripped it that is why a being is said 
But in ordinary speech this term of common usage is applied also to those who are without greed just as the term of common usage palm fan is used for different sorts of fans in general even if made of split bamboo
However in the world etymologists who do not consider meaning have it that it is a mere name
while those who do consider meaning have it that a being is so called with reference to the bright principle 
Breathing things  so called because of their state of breathing  the meaning is because their existence depends on inbreaths and outbreaths
Creatures  so called because of being  the meaning is because of their being fully become  because of their being generated 
puṃ is what hell is called
they fall into that is the meaning of persons 
Personality is what the physical body is called
or it is just the pentad of aggregates since it is actually only a concept derived from that pentad of aggregates
What is referred to is included in that personality thus it has a personality 
Included in is delimited by gone into is the meaning
And all the remaining terms should be understood as synonyms for all beings used in accordance with ordinary speech as in the case of the term beings
Of course there are other synonyms too for all beings such as all folks all souls etc still it is for claritys sake that The minddeliverance of lovingkindness is practiced with unspecified pervasion in five ways is said and that only these five are mentioned
Those who would have it that there is not only a mere verbal difference between beings breathing things etc but also an actual difference in meaning are contradicted by the mention of unspecified pervasion So instead of taking the meaning in that way the unspecified pervasion with loving kindness is done in any one of these five ways
And here may all beings be free from enmity is one absorption
free from affliction is one absorption
free from affliction is free from afflictedness 
free from anxiety is one absorption
free from anxiety is free from suffering
may they live happily is one absorption
Consequently he should do his pervading with lovingkindness according to whichever of these phrases is clear to him
So with the four kinds of absorption in each of the five ways there are twenty kinds of absorption in unspecified pervasion
In specified pervasion with the four kinds of absorption in each of the seven ways there are twentyeight kinds of absorption
And here woman and man are stated according to sex
Noble Ones and not Noble Ones according to Noble Ones and ordinary people
deities and human beings and those in states of loss according to the kind of rebirth
In directional pervasion with twenty kinds of absorption in each of the directions beginning with all beings in the eastern direction there are two hundred kinds of absorption and with twentyeight kinds in each of the directions beginning with all women in the eastern direction there are two hundred and eighty kinds so these make four hundred and eighty kinds of absorption
Consequently all the kinds of absorption mentioned in the Paṭisambhidā amount to five hundred and twentyeight
So when this meditator develops the minddeliverance of lovingkindness through any one of these kinds of absorption he obtains the eleven advantages described in the way beginning A man sleeps in comfort 
Herein sleeps in comfort means that instead of sleeping uncomfortably turning over and snoring as other people do he sleeps comfortably
he falls asleep as though entering upon an attainment
He wakes in comfort instead of waking uncomfortably groaning and yawning and turning over as others do he wakes comfortably without contortions like a lotus opening
He dreams no evil dreams when he sees dreams he sees only auspicious ones as though he were worshipping a shrine as though he were making an offering as though he were hearing the Dhamma
But he does not see evil dreams as others do as though being surrounded by bandits as though being threatened by wild beasts as though falling into chasms 
He is dear to human beings he is as dear to and beloved by human beings as a necklace worn to hang on the chest as a wreath adorning the head
He is dear to nonhuman beings he is just as dear to nonhuman beings as he is to human beings as in the Elder Visākhas case
He was a landowner it seems at Pāṭaliputta 
While he was living there he heard this The Island of Tambapaṇṇi  apparently is adorned with a diadem of shrines and gleams with the yellow cloth and there a man can sit or lie wherever he likes there the climate is favourable the abodes are favourable the people are favourable the Dhamma to be heard is favourable and all these favourable things are easily obtained there
He made over his fortune to his wife and children and left his home with only a single ducat sewn into the hem of his garment He stopped for one month on the sea coast in expectation of a ship
and meanwhile by his skill in trading he made a thousand during the month by buying goods here and selling them there in lawful enterprise
Eventually he came to the Great Monastery  at Anurādha pura and there he asked for the going forth into homelessness
When he was being conducted to the chapter house for the goingforth ceremony the purse containing the thousand pieces dropped out from under his belt
When asked What is that he replied It is a thousand ducats venerable sirs They told him Lay follower it is not possible to distribute them after the going forth Distribute them now Then he said Let none who have come to the scene of Visākhas going forth depart emptyhanded and opening the purse he strewed them over the chapter house yard after which he received the going forth and the full admission
When he had acquired five years seniority and had become familiar with the two Codes he celebrated the Pavāraṇā at the end of the Rains took a meditation subject that suited him and set out to wander living for four months in each monastery and doing the duties on a basis of equality with the residents
While he was wandering in this way
The elder halted in a wood To scan the tenor of his way
He thundered forth this roundelay Proclaiming that he found it good
So from your fulladmission day Till in this place you paused and stood
No stumbling mars your bhikkhuhood Be thankful for such grace I say
On his way to Cittalapabbata he came to a road fork and stood wondering which turn to take
Then a deity living in a rock held out a hand pointing out the road to him
He came to the Cittalapabbata Monastery After he had stayed there for four months he lay down thinking In the morning I depart
Then a deity living in a maṇila tree at the end of the walk sat down on a step of the stair and burst into tears
The elder asked Who is that
It is I Maṇiliyā venerable sir
What are you weeping for
Because you are going away
What good does my living here to you
Venerable sir as long as you live here non human beings treat each other kindly Now when you are gone they will start quarrels and loose talk
The elder said If my living here makes you live at peace that is good and so he stayed there another four months Then he again thought of leaving
but the deity wept as before
And so the elder lived on there and it was there that he attained Nibbāna This is how a bhikkhu who abides in lovingkindness is dear to nonhuman beings
Deities guard him deities guard him as a mother and father guard their child
Fire poison and weapons do not affect him they do not affect do not enter into the body of one who abides in lovingkindness like the fire in the case of the lay woman devotee Uttarā  like the poison in the case of the Saṃyutta reciter the Elder CūḷaSiva like the knife in the case of the novice Saṅkicca 
they do not disturb the body is what is meant
And they tell the story of the cow here too
A cow was giving milk to her calf it seems
A hunter thinking I shall shoot her flourished a longhandled spear in his hand and flung it
It struck her body and bounced off like a palm leafand that was owing neither to access nor to absorption but simply to the strength of her consciousness of love for her calf
So mightily powerful is loving kindness
His mind is easily concentrated the mind of one who abides in lovingkindness is quickly concentrated there is no sluggishness about it
The expression of his face is serene his face has a serene expression like a palmyra fruit loosed from its stem
He dies unconfused there is no dying deluded for one who abides in loving kindness He passes away undeluded as if falling asleep
If he penetrates no higher if he is unable to reach higher than the attainment of lovingkindness and attain Arahantship then when he falls from this life he reappears in the Brahmāworld as one who wakes up from sleep
This is the detailed explanation of the development of lovingkindness
Fighting against the wall having undertaken the precepts of virtue and sat down on a seat in his room with the door locked he was developing lovingkindness Blinded by lust arisen under cover of the lovingkindness he wanted to go to his wife and without noticing the door he beat on the wall in his desire to get out even by breaking the wall down 
The eight great hells beginning with that of Sañjīva 
At each of the four doors of the Great Unmitigated Hell there are the four beginning with the Ember Hell  which make up the sixteen prominent hells

When he had eaten Cundas meal The coppersmithsthus have I heard
The Buddha felt that sickness dire That sharp pain even unto death
Now revered Nāgasena if sharp sickness fell upon the Blessed One after he had partaken of Cundas alms and sharp pains arose in him even unto death then that other statement must be wrong
The Blessed One sire said that there were two alms offerings equal
of equal fruit and of equal advantage and of much greater fruit and much greater advantage than any other alms offering
What two
There is that alms offering which when a Tathāgata has eaten he attains supreme Enlightenment and that which when he has eaten he attains final Nibbāna in the Nibbānaelement that has no substrate remaining for further existence
But this alms offering is of great and special quality of manifold advantage
if heavy rain falls it will become a mighty river with a great gush of water
Revered Nāgasena why is it that those two alms offerings are of much greater fruit and of much greater result than any other alms offering
Of what conditions revered Nāgasena are you speaking
Revered Nāgasena was it only on two days that the Tathāgata entered in the highest degree those nine successive abidings in forward order and in reverse order
that of the great and glorious gifts in this Buddhafield none compares with these two alms offerings
It is wonderful revered Nāgasena it is marvellous
And again it was said
Venerate that relic of him who is to be venerated
By doing so you will go from here to heaven
Now if the first injunction was right the second must be wrong
and if the second is right the first must be wrong
or just as it is the business of brahmins and their sons to study the Vedas the significance of marks oral tradition ancient lore linguistics and other sciences while husbandry merchandise and the care of cattle are the business of ordinary merchants and workers even so sire veneration is not work for the Conquerors sons but rather this is to be done by the Conquerors sons the thorough comprehension of formations proper attention contemplation of the four foundations of mindfulness fixing the mind on the object of meditation fighting the defilements and intentness on their own goal These are the things the sons of the Conqueror ought to do leaving veneration to others whether devas or humans Therefore sire it was in the sense of Do not devote yourselves to such things as are not your business but to such things as are so that the Tathāgata said Do not nanda be occupied with honouring the Tathāgatas bodily remains
If the Tathāgata had not said this sire the monks would have been obsessed with his bowl and robe and through them would have paid veneration to the Buddha
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is therefore do I accept it
A king am I Sela An incomparable king under Dhamma
but if the second is right then the first is wrong
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is thus do I accept it
It is good revered Nāgasena thus it is so do I accept it
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena this too was said by the Blessed One This is impossible monks it cannot come to pass that in one worldsystem two Supremely Enlightened Buddhas should arise simultaneously this possibility does not exist
When they are teaching revered Nāgasena all Tathāgatas teach the thirtyseven requisites of enlightenment when they are talking they talk about the Four Noble Truths when they are making disciples train themselves they make them train themselves in the three trainings and when they are instructing they instruct in the practice of diligence
If revered Nāgasena the teaching is one the talk is one the training is one and the instruction is one of all Tathāgatas why should not two Tathāgatas arise at the same time
Already by the arising of only one Buddha this world is illumined if there were a second Buddha all the more would this world be illumined by the light of them both Furthermore when two Tathāgatas are exhorting they could exhort at ease and when instructing they could instruct at ease Tell me the reason for this so that I may be without perplexity
This tenthousandfold worldsystem sire is the sustainer of one Buddha it sustains the special qualities of one Tathāgata only If a second Tathāgata were to arise the world could not bear him it would shake and tremble it would bend this way and that it would disperse scatter into pieces dissolve be utterly destroyed
Just as a boat sire might be able to carry one passenger across Then when one man had got on board it would go along evenly
Suppose a second man were to come along similar to the first in age appearance stage of life size and lean and strong in all his limbs and he were to embark in the boat could that boat sustain both of them
No revered sir it would shake and tremble it would bend this way and that it would break into pieces be shattered dissolved and utterly destroyed it would sink into the waves
Besides that sire this is a natural characteristic of the Buddhas the Blessed Ones that one Buddha only should arise in the world
The broad earth is great and it is only one
The ocean is mighty and it is only one
Sineru the king of the mountains is great and it is only one
Space is mighty and it is only one
Sakka the king of the gods is great and he is only one
Māra the Evil One is great and he is only one
MahāBrahmā is mighty and he is only one
The Tathāgata Arahat Perfectly Enlightened Buddha is great and he is alone in the world
Where these uprise there is no occasion for a second Therefore sire only one Tathāgata Arahat Perfectly Enlightened Buddha arises in the world at one time
Even an unintelligent person on hearing this would be satisfied how much more then one of great wisdom like myself
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is therefore do I accept it
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena it was said by the Blessed One I monks praise right practice in a layman and in one who has gone forth If either a layman or one who has gone forth is practising rightly then because of his right practice he is successful in the method in Dhamma and in what is wholesome
If revered Nāgasena a laymanclad in white enjoying sense pleasures dwelling as master in a house crowded with wife and children accustomed to Benares sandalwood using garlands scents and unguents handling gold and silver his turban studded with a variety of jewels and goldis practising rightly he is successful in the method in Dhamma and in what is wholesome And if one who has gone forthhis head shaven wearing saffron robes obtaining alms from others perfectly fulfilling the four branches of morality and who undertaking them conducts himself according to the hundred and fifty rules of training and conducts himself according to the thirteen modes of ascetic practicesis practising rightly he is successful in the method in Dhamma and in what is wholesome
What then revered sir is the difference between the layman and one who has gone forth
Your austerity is fruitless your renunciation is useless
your watching over the rules of training is barren and your undertaking the ascetic practices is in vain What is the good of piling up suffering in these ways Is not happiness to be reached simply through happiness
The words you ascribe to the Blessed One sire are rightly quoted
Thus it is sire that one who is practising rightly is the best And sire if one who has gone forth thinks I am the one who has gone forth but should not be practising rightly then he is far from recluseship far from brahminhood
How much more then a layman clad in white Whether he be a layman sire or one who has gone forth if he is practising rightly he is successful in the method in Dhamma and in what is wholesome
Nevertheless sire it is the one who has gone forth who is chief and master in recluseship
Going forth sire has many special qualities innumerable and immeasurable special qualities and it is not possible to measure them
Whatever one who has gone forth may have to do that he accomplishes without delay
For what reason
One who has gone forth is of few wishes he is contented secluded detached from the world of stirred up energy without desire homeless complete in morality without guile and skilled in the practice of shaking off the defilements
It is like an arrow that goes properly when it is shot if it is without a notch even well cleaned and straight
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena this Dispensation of the Tathāgata is mighty essentially true precious excellent noble unrivalled pure stainless clear and faultless It is not right to let a layman go forth so long as he is a mere householder It is only when a householder has attained to the fruit of the first path and cannot revert to secular life that he should be allowed to go forth
For what reason
When people who are still evil go forth in this Dispensation they could give it up and revert to the secular life Because of their backsliding people may think Vain indeed must be this Dispensation of the recluse Gotama that these people have turned back from it This is the reason for what I say
Supposing sire there were a pond full of pure clear cold water Some man dirty covered with stains and mud should come there and without bathing in it should turn back again still dirty as before Whom would the people blame for that sire the dirty man or the pond
The people would blame the dirty man revered sir thinking He came to the pond but without washing turned back dirty as before How can a pond itself wash this person who does not want to wash What defect is there in the pond
Even so sire the Tathāgata constructed the pond of the noble true Dhamma which is full of the waters of the noble freedom thinking Those who have intelligence and discernment but are soiled with the stains of the defilements bathing here can be washed clean of all the defilements
If someone  The Questions of King Milinda going to that pond but without washing turns back from it and reverts to the secular life having defilements as before the people will blame him only saying Having gone forth in the Dispensation of the Conqueror but not getting a foothold there he has reverted to the secular life How can this Dispensation of the Conqueror itself cleanse this person who was not applying himself to it What defect is there in the Dispensation of the Conqueror
Or sire it is as if a man afflicted with a dire disease should visit a physician who is skilled in diagnosis and knows a lasting cure but he does not let himself be treated and turns back still an ill man Whom would the people blame for that the sick man or the physician
The people would blame the sick man revered sir How can the physician himself cure the man who does not allow himself to be treated What defect is there in the physician
Even so sire the Tathāgata placed in the casket of his Teaching the healing medicine of Deathlessness which wholly allays and calms illnesses due to all the defilements thinking When those who are oppressed by the illnesses of the defilements but have intelligence and discernment have drunk of this healing medicine of Deathlessness they will allay all the illnesses due to the defilements
If someone does not drink of that curing medicine of Deathlessness but turns and reverts to the secular life having defilements as before the people will blame him only saying Having gone forth in the Dispensation of the Conqueror but not getting a foothold there he has reverted to the secular life How can this Dispensation of the Conqueror itself cleanse this person who was not applying himself to it What defect is there in the Dispensation of the Conqueror
Or sire it is as if a famished man arriving at a mighty distribution of food for merit but not eating any of that food should turn back famished as before whom would the people blame for that the famished man or the food for merit
The people would blame the famished man revered sir How can a meal itself enter into the mouth of this man who did not eat What defect is there in the meal
Even so sire the Tathāgata has set in the casket of his Teaching the most precious peaceful auspicious excellent undying and utterly sweet meal of mindfulness connected with the body thinking May all those who are exhausted internally by the defilements their minds overcome by craving who have intelligence and discernment dispel by eating this meal all cravings for the three becomings of the sense sphere the finematerial sphere and the immaterial sphere
If someone not partaking of that meal turns back still clinging to craving as before and reverts to the secular life the people would blame only him thinking Having gone forth in the Dispensation of the Conqueror but not getting a foothold there he has reverted to the secular life But how can the Dispensation of the Conqueror itself cleanse this person who was not applying himself to it What defect is there in the Dispensation of the Conqueror
If sire the Tathāgata had allowed a householder to go forth only if he had attained the fruit of the first path then this going forth is not for getting rid of defilements nor is it for purification There is nothing to be gained by going forth
Supposing sire a man had had a pond dug out by several hundred workmen and were to announce to an assembly thus Let no one who is soiled good sirs go down into this pond let only those whose dust and dirt have been already washed away who are pure stainless and cleansed go down into this pond
Now sire would that pond be of any use to those whose dust and dirt had already been washed away who were pure stainless and cleansed
No revered sir they have carried out elsewhere the purpose for which they might have come to the pond So what is the good of that pond to them
Moreover sire those who revert to the secular life show forth five special qualities in the Teaching
What are the five
They show forth its mighty character as a plane they show forth its character of complete and stainless purity they show forth its character as one of not associating with evil things they show forth its character as one that is hard to pierce they show forth its character as one to be preserved by many controls
They show forth its mighty character as a plane
It is sire as a man poor of lowly birth undistinguished deficient in wisdom on acquiring a great and mighty kingdom soon comes to naught and to ruin decreases in fame and is not able to sustain authority
For what reason
The greatness of the authority
Even so sire those who are undistinguished have not done meritorious deeds and are deficient in wisdom but  The Questions of King Milinda have gone forth in the Dispensation of the Conqueror they are incapable of sustaining that noble and incomparable going forth and soon coming to naught and to ruin and decline they revert from the Dispensation of the Conqueror to the secular life
For what reason
The greatness of the state of the Dispensation of the Conqueror
They show forth its character
It is sire as water on a lotus leaf disperses scatters disappears and does not adhere to it
For what reason
The completely stainless purity of the lotus
Even so sire those who are treacherous deceitful shifty crooked and of discrepant views but have gone forth in the Dispensation of the Conqueror soon dispersing dissolving and scattering from the completely pure stainless uninimical bright noble and precious Dispensation and not remaining in it not adhering to it revert to the secular life
For what reason
The complete stainless purity of the Dispensation of the Conqueror
They show forth its character
As sire the great ocean does not associate with a dead body but whatever dead body there may be in the great ocean it quickly carries to the shore or pushes on to dry land
For what reason
Because the great ocean is the abode of great beings
Even so sire those who are evil inactive with energy exhausted rotten soiled and bad but have gone forth in the Dispensation of the Conqueror soon departing from the abode of the stainless arahats great beings whose cankers are destroyed not associating with them revert to the secular life
For what reason
Because the Dispensation of the Conqueror does not associate with evil things
They show forth its character
It is sire as those archers who are not clever untrained not learned in the craft and with their thoughts wandering are incapable of piercing the tip of a hair fall short of the target and depart
For what reason
Because the tip of a hair being delicate and fine is very difficult to pierce
Even so sire those who are weak in wisdom stupid dull confused and slothful if they go forth in the Dispensation of the Conqueror being incapable of piercing the Four Noble Truths that are of the utmost delicacy and fineness then falling short of the target and departing from the Dispensation of the Conqueror they soon revert to the secular life
For what reason
Because of the difficulty of piercing the Four Noble Truths which are of the utmost delicacy and fineness
They show forth its character
It is sire as a man who has arrived at the scene of a great and mighty battle and is surrounded on all sides by the opposing army on seeing the troops closing in on him with weapons in their hands is terrified hesitates turns tail and runs away
For what reason
For fear of not preserving his life in such a tumultuous battle
Even so sire if those foolish people evildoers uncontrolled without shame unwise impatient wavering unsteady unstable go forth in the Dispensation of the Conqueror but are incapable of preserving the many rules of training then turning tail and running away they soon revert to the secular life
For what reason
Because the character of the Dispensation of the Conqueror is one to be preserved by many controls
The flowers sire on even the best of shrubs growing on dry land the doublejasmine are sometimes eaten through by insects so that the shrivelled shoots among them come to naught But a doublejasmine shrub is not despised because these come to naught
The flowers that remain on it pervade every quarter with their true perfume
Even so sire those who revert to the secular life after they have gone forth in the Dispensation of the Conqueror are like the doublejasmine flowers that have been eaten by insects and deprived of their colour and perfume their morality being as it were colourless are not capable of maturing But the Dispensation of the Conqueror is not despised because of the reversion of these to the secular life
Those monks that remain there pervade the world with the devas with the lovely perfume of moral habit
It is good revered Nāgasena By one fitting simile after another by one appropriate reason after another you have made me understand the blameless Dispensation of the Conqueror and have illumined it with a character that is of the very best for even those reversions to the secular life illumine the character of the Dispensation of the Conqueror as of the very best
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena you say An arahat feels one kind of feeling the bodily not the mental
Now revered Nāgasena is it that an arahats mind proceeds in  The Questions of King Milinda dependence on the body but that the arahat is without authority powerless and not able to exercise mastery as to that body
Yes sire
That is not proper revered Nāgasena that while his body is proceeding he is without authority powerless and not able to exercise mastery over his own body Even a bird revered sir has authority power and exercises mastery in the nest in which it dwells
What are the ten
Cold and heat hunger and thirst the necessity for voiding excreta and urine fatigueandsleepiness old age disease and death
The arahat is without authority powerless and not able to exercise mastery in these respects
Revered Nāgasena for what reason does neither a command nor authority proceed to an arahats body Tell me the reason for this
It is sire as those beings who are dependent on the earth all move and live and order their conduct in dependence on it But sire does either a command of theirs or their authority proceed to the earth
No revered sir
It is because of the lack of development of his mind sire that an ordinary person feels a bodily and a mental feeling
As sire an ox trembling with starvation might be tied up with a weak fragile and tiny rope of grass or creepers but when that ox gets excited then it would make off with the fastenings
Even so sire a feeling that arises in one whose mind is undeveloped excites the mind when his mind is excited he bends his body contorts it and makes it roll about
But what is the reason revered sir that an arahat experiences the one feeling the bodily not the mental
The arahats mind sire is developed well developed it is tamed well tamed it is docile and obedient On his being assailed by a painful feeling he grasps it firmly thinking that it is not permanent He fastens his mind to the post of concentration and when his mind is fastened to the post of concentration it does not quiver or shake but is steadfast and composed although his body owing to the diffusion of the perturbation of the feeling bends contorts itself and rolls about
Revered Nāgasena this is indeed a wonder in the world that when the body is shaking the mind does not shake Tell me the reason for that
Suppose sire there were a great and mighty tree with a full complement of trunk branches and leaves Its branches shake when struck by the force of the wind But does its trunk shake too
No revered sir
Even so sire an arahat on being assailed by a painful feeling grasps it firmly thinking that it is not permanent he fastens his mind to the post of concentration and when his mind is fastened to the post of concentration it does not quiver or shake but is steadfast and composed although the body owing to the diffusion of the perturbation of the feeling bends contorts itself and rolls about But his mind does not quiver or shake It is like the trunk of the great tree
It is wonderful revered Nāgasena it is marvellous I have never before seen the lamp of the Dhamma burning like this for all time
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena you say There are two bourns not another for a householder who has attained arahatship either that very day he goes forth into homelessness or he attains final Nibbāna
That day is not able to pass without one or other of these events taking place
If revered Nāgasena he could not on that day procure a teacher or a preceptor or a bowl and a set of robes could he go forth of himself or could he let the day pass Or if some other arahat of psychic power arrived could he let him go forth Or would he attain final Nibbāna
An arahat sire could not go forth of himself On going forth of oneself one falls into theft Nor could he let the day pass Whether another arahat arrived or not he would attain final Nibbāna that very day
Well then revered Nāgasena the peaceful state of arahatship is given up if the life of him who attains it in this manner is carried away
This is not a defect in arahatship sire this is a defect in the householders attributes namely the weakness of the attributes
It is like food that guards the lifespan and protects the life of all beings yet carries away the life of him whose stomach is out of order because the food is not properly digested
This is not a defect in the food this is a defect in the stomach
Or sire as a man who is feeble and weak of lowly birth and of little meritcomes to naught and to ruin the moment he has acquired a great and mighty kingdom falters and is unable to sustain authority even so sire the householder who has attained arahatship is unable to sustain arahatship because of that attribute of weakness and for that reason he either goes forth or attains final Nibbāna on that very day
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena can an arahat be devoid of mindfulness
Arahats sire have put lack of mindfulness far from them They are never devoid of mindfulness
Yes sire
In the building of his hut in acting as a gobetween in imagining it is the right time for a meal when it is the wrong time in imagining that he has not been invited to a meal when he has been invited in imagining that the food that has not been left over has been left over
Now revered sir is the arahat disrespectful
No sire
Convince me then revered sir by a reason What is the reason for this
There are two kinds of defilements sire that which is a breach of the ordinary moral law and that which is a breach of the rules of the Order
What sire is a breach of the ordinary moral law
The ten ways of unwholesome action
Whatever in the world is unfitting and unbecoming for recluses but is not blameable in householders
The Blessed One laid down rules of training for his disciples not to be transgressed as long as their lives last
Eating at the wrong time
One whose cankers are destroyed is not capable of a breach of the ordinary moral law but
It is not within the range of every arahat to know everything sire indeed he has no power to know everything
The name and the clan of a woman or man sire may not be known to an arahat and he may not know about some road on the earth But every arahat sire would know about emancipation The arahat possessed of the six superknowledges would know about his own range Only an omniscient Tathāgata sire knows everything
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena tell me what there is that is not found in the world
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena things produced by kamma are seen in the world things produced by cause things produced by physical change are seen Tell me what there is in the world that is not born of kamma not born of cause not born of physical change
What two
Space and Nibbāna
Do not revered Nāgasena bring the Conquerors words into contempt do not answer the question ignorantly
Revered Nāgasena what you say about space is right
If revered Nāgasena there be a cause for the realization of Nibbāna well then one would require a cause also for the arising of Nibbāna
Inasmuch revered Nāgasena as there is a father of a child for that reason one would also require a father of the father
Even so revered Nāgasena if there is a cause for the realization of Nibbāna for that reason one would require a cause also for the arising of Nibbāna
Well then sire lend an attentive ear listen closely and I will tell you the reason for this Would a man sire with his natural strength go up from here to the Himalaya king of the mountains
Yes revered sir
No revered sir
For what reason Because it is unconditioned
Yes sire Nibbāna is unconditioned It is made by nothing One cannot say of Nibbāna that it has arisen or that it has not arisen or that it is arisable or that it is past or future or present or that it is cognizable by the eye or the ear or the nose or the tongue or the body
Well then revered sir you indicate Nibbāna as what is not
Nibbāna sire is Nibbāna is cognizable by the mind A noble disciple practising rightly with a mind that is purified lofty straight without obstructions without temporal desires sees Nibbāna
But revered sir what is this Nibbāna like Convince me by reasons how the fact of its existence can be illustrated by similes
Yes revered sir
It is not possible revered Nāgasena for the wind to be shown It does not lend itself to being grasped by the hands or to being touched But yet it exists all the same
It is good revered Nāgasena Well pointed out is the simile well expressed the argument Thus it is therefore do I accept it There is Nibbāna
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena these givers when they bestow their offerings devote specifically to former relatives now departed thinking May this gift benefit such and such Now do the dead derive any benefit from them
Some do sire and some do not
Those who have been reborn in hell sire do not nor those reborn in heaven nor those reborn as animals Of those four classes reborn as petas three classes do not those who feed on vomit those who are tormented by hunger and thirst and those who are consumed by craving The fourth class that lives on the gifts of others do derive benefit and those who remember them obtain it too
No sire the offerings are not wasted nor are they fruitless The givers themselves derive profit from them
Suppose sire some people after preparing fish meat strong drinks rice and other kinds of food go to a relations house If those relations were not to accept that present would it go to waste and be lost
No revered sir it would be for the owners themselves
Let that be revered Nāgasena that is so and I accept it as you say We will not dispute your reason
But if the offerings made by such givers benefit certain of the departed and they do reap the results of the gifts
No sire
This is really not a question you should ask sire Do not ask a foolish question thinking that an answer will be forthcoming You will be asking me next why space is boundless why the Ganges does not flow upstream why men and birds are bipeds and why beasts are quadrupeds
I do not ask this seeking to annoy you revered Nāgasena I ask for the sake of removing a doubt There are many people in the world who have gone astray and are spiritually blind I put that question to you thinking How can these not get an opportunity 
It is not possible sire to share an evil deed with one who has not done it not consented to it
As sire it is possible to light a lamp with oil yet is it possible to light a lamp with water
No revered sir
What is the reason revered Nāgasena that a good deed can be shared but not an evil one
Convince me by a reason I am not blind not without light When I have heard you I will know
An evil deed is slight sire a good deed is abundant Because of its slightness evil affects only the doer because of its abundance good spreads over the world of devas and men
No revered sir where that drop of water has fallen there only does it affect
Because of the slightness of the drop of water revered sir
But as sire a mighty and great cloud were to pour down rain satisfying the earths surface yet would the water from that great cloud spread out all round
Certainly revered sir
Because of the greatness of the cloud revered sir
As to this sire whoever gives a gift undertakes moral precepts carries out the formal acts of the Observances is happy cheerful pleased merry greatly delighted glad in mind and filled with joy rapture arises in him again and again to one who has a mind of rapture good increases more and more
As from one side sire water may enter a well that is already full and flow away from another yet even though it is flowing away water increases again and again in the well and it is not possible to exhaust it
And if for a hundred years sire a man were to advert to the good he had done then while he is repeatedly adverting to it the good increases more and more
and it is possible for him to share that good with whomever he likes This is a reason according to which sire good is abundant
But sire the person doing evil is remorseful later the mind of him who is remorseful retreats retracts recoils and is not stretched out he grieves is consumed by remorse wastes away is exhausted he does not prosper he is affected then and there
As sire a little drop of water falling on a dry river bed with its great sandbanks rising and falling in curves and twists wastes away and is exhausted
even so sire the mind of a person doing evil retreats retracts recoils and is not stretched out he grieves is consumed by remorse wastes away is exhausted he does not prosper he is affected then and there This is a reason according to which sire evil is slight 
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena men and women in this world see dreams pleasant and evil things they have seen before and things they have not seen before things they have done before and things they have not done before dreams peaceful and terrible dreams of matters near to them and distant from them full of many shapes and innumerable colours What is this that men call a dream and who is it who dreams it
This that is called a dream sire is a suggestion that comes into the focus of the mind
There are six kinds of people who see dreams the person who suffers from wind the bilious person the phlegmatic person the person possessed of a deva the person influenced by his own habits and the person who sees a dream as a portent Among these sire only the last kind is true the rest are false
It is not sire that his mind going along of its own accord seeks for that portent nor does anyone else come and tell him of it but that very portent comes into the focus of his mind
It is like a mirror that does not go anywhere to seek for a reflection nor does anyone else bringing a reflection put it on the mirror but from wherever the reflection comes it appears in the mirror
No sire that is not so When the portent has arisen he speaks to others about it and they then speak to him of its meaning
It is sire as the moles or boils or itches that arise on a mans body are to his gain or loss his repute or disrepute to his praise or blame to his happiness or sorrow But as these boils arise sire do they know We will bring about such and such an event
No revered sir But according to the place where these boils occur so do the fortunetellers seeing them there explain Such indeed will be the result
Even so sire the mind that sees the dream does not know Thus will be the result peaceful or frightening But when the portent has arisen he speaks to others about it and they then speak to him of its meaning
Neither the one sire nor yet the other
It is in the interval between being drowsy and not having yet reached the unconscious state that one sees a dream
When a man is drowsy his mind is entering the unconscious state a mind that is entering the unconscious state does not function a mind that is not functioning is not susceptible to happiness or suffering There is no dream for one who is not susceptible When the mind is functioning it sees a dream
As sire in dense darkness where there is no light no shadow can be seen on even a wellburnished mirror even so sire a mind that has entered the unconscious state is not functioning though it is in the physical frame A mind that is not functioning does not see a dream
As the mirror sire so should the physical frame be understood as the darkness sleep as the light the mind
In two circumstances sire the mind is not functioning though the physical frame exists when the mind has entered the unconscious state and when the mind has attained cessation  When a man is awake sire his mind is astir open natural untramelled A portent does not come into the focus of such a mind
As sire those desiring secrecy avoid the man who is open natural unwise and unreserved even so sire the devalike purpose of the portent does not come into focus for one who is awake
Or as sire the wholesome states that are helpful to enlightenment do not come into focus for a monk whose way of living is torn who indulges in bad habits is evil poor in morality idle and low in energy even so sire the devalike purpose of the portent does not come into focus for one who is awake Therefore he who is awake does not see a dream
Yes sire there is
The feeling of oppression and inability in the body sire of weakness slackness and inertnessthat is the beginning of sleep The light monkeysleep when one lies half awake half asleepthat is the middle of sleep When the mind has gone into the unconscious statethat is the end of sleep It is when one has reached the middle stage sire that one sees a dream
As sire someone living with selfrestraint composed in mind steadfast as to the mental object his discernment unshaken goes into a wood that is rid of tumult and noise and thinks over some subtle matter and without falling asleep but with the mind onepointed penetrates that subtle matter even so sire it is one who has entered the light monkeysleep that sees a dream
As sire the tumult and noise so should wakefulness be understood as the secluded wood so should the monkeysleep be understood and as that man who leaving behind the tumult and noise and avoiding sleep and being one of balanced mind penetrates that subtle matter even so the still watchful man not fallen into sleep but dozing in a monkey sleep sees a dream
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena is Nibbāna entirely blissful or is it mixed with suffering
Nibbāna is entirely blissful sire it is unmixed with suffering
Revered Nāgasena we do not believe this statement that Nibbāna is entirely blissful We thus take our stand on this revered Nāgasena that Nibbāna is mixed with suffering
Revered Nāgasena mortification and tormenting of body and mind is evident in those who are seeking Nibbāna whether it be in their standing pacing up and down sitting lying down abstention from food the checking of drowsiness the subjugation of the sense fields the getting rid of wealth and corn of dear relatives and friends
But all those who are happy and blissful in the world indulge in and devote themselves to the sense fields by means of the five strands of sense pleasures they indulge in and devote themselves to vision by means of all kinds of pleasant forms to hearing by means of all kinds of pleasant sounds to smelling by means of all kinds of pleasant scents to tasting by means of all kinds of pleasant tastes to the body by means of all kinds of pleasant touches and to the mind by means of attention to all kinds of pleasant thoughts
But you destroy and reduce cut off and interrupt stop and hinder this devoting of themselves to the eye ear nose tongue body and mind
Therefore the body is tormented and the mind is tormented too When the body is tormented one experiences a painful bodily feeling when the mind is tormented one experiences a painful mental feeling
Now did not the wanderer Māgandiya too when he was finding fault with the Blessed One speak thus A destroyer of beings is the recluse Gotama
This is the reason on account of which I say that Nibbāna is mixed with suffering
But when you said sire that Nibbāna is suffering this suffering is not called Nibbāna but is a preliminary stage for the realization of Nibbāna it is the quest for Nibbāna Nibbāna itself is entirely blissful sire it is not mixed with suffering
I shall tell you the reason for that
Is there sire what is called the bliss of sovereignty among kings
Yes revered Nāgasena
No revered sir
This revered Nāgasena is not called the bliss of sovereignty This is the preliminary stage in the quest for the bliss of sovereignty After kings have sought sovereignty with suffering revered Nāgasena they experience the bliss of sovereignty Thus revered Nāgasena the bliss of sovereignty is unmixed with suffering That bliss of sovereignty is one thing suffering is another
It is after those who seek for this Nibbāna have mortified their bodies and minds whether it be in their standing pacing up and down sitting lying down have abstained from food checked drowsiness subjugated the sense fields rejected their body and lifeprinciple and with suffering have sought Nibbāna that they experience Nibbāna which is entirely blissful as kings experience the bliss of sovereignty when their adversaries have been quelled
Thus sire Nibbāna is entirely blissful and is not mixed with suffering
Nibbāna is one thing suffering is another
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena you keep on talking about Nibbāna but is it possible by simile or argument or cause or method to point out the shape or configuration or age or size of this Nibbāna
Without a counterpart sire is Nibbāna and it is not possible by simile or argument or cause or method to point out the shape or configuration or age or size of Nibbāna
But revered Nāgasena I do not agree to this not laying down by simile or argument or cause or method the shape or configuration or age or size of Nibbāna which is a thing that exists Convince me by a reason
Is there sire what is called the great ocean
Yes revered sir there is this great ocean
No revered sir I would not be able to answer these questions and I would tell him My good man these are not questions to be asked by anyone They are to be put aside
But why would you sire make such a reply about the great ocean which is a reality Should you not having counted tell him that there is so much water and so many beings living in the great ocean
It is not possible revered sir This is a question beyond ones scope
In the same way sire it is not possible by simile or argument or cause or method to point out the shape or configuration or age or size of Nibbāna which is a reality Even if a man of psychic power sire one who had attained to mastery over his mind were to determine how much water was in the great ocean and how many beings live there even such a man sire will not be able by simile or argument or cause or method to point out the shape or configuration or age or size of Nibbāna
Let that be revered Nāgasena
There is nothing to be shown by what has shape sire but from a special quality it is possible to point out something that can be demonstrated by a simile
Good it is revered Nāgasena Speak quickly so that I may receive an illustration of even one mark of Nibbāna from a special quality Allay the fever of my heart dispel it by the sweet cool breezes of your words
One special quality of a lotus is present in Nibbāna as a lotus is unsoiled by water so is Nibbāna unsoiled by any defilement
Two special qualities of water are present in Nibbāna as water which is cool is the means of allaying fever so Nibbāna which is cool is the means of allaying all the defilements
and as water is the means of quenching thirst so Nibbāna is the means of quenching the thirst of craving
Five special qualities of food are present in Nibbāna as food is the sustainer of the lifespan of all beings so is Nibbāna when it is realized the sustainer of the lifespan by driving out old age and death
Ten special qualities of space are present in Nibbāna as space is not born does not age does not decease here does not arise elsewhere is hard to master cannot be carried off by thieves depends on nothing is the sphere of birds is without obstruction and is unending
Three special qualities of a precious gem are present in Nibbāna as a precious gem is the granter of desires so is Nibbāna the granter of desires
Three special qualities of red sandalwood are present in Nibbāna as red sandalwood is hard to obtain so is Nibbāna hard to obtain
Three special qualities of ghee are present in Nibbāna as the cream of ghee has colour so has Nibbāna the colour of special qualities
Five special qualities of a mountainpeak are present in Nibbāna as a mountainpeak is lofty so is Nibbāna lofty
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena you say Nibbāna is not past not future not present it has not arisen it has not notarisen it is not arisable
As to this revered Nāgasena when anyone who is practising rightly realizes Nibbāna does he realize it as it is arising or after he has made it arise
Whoever sire practising rightly realizes Nibbāna does not realize it as it is arising nor does he realize it after he has made it arise On the other hand sire there is this element of Nibbāna that he who is practising rightly realizes
Do not revered Nāgasena illumine this question by concealing it illumine it by making it open and obvious With ardour and zeal pour out all that you have learnt about it people are confused about it bewildered fallen into doubt Break this dart of inner defect
There is this element of Nibbāna sire peaceful happy excellent It is that which he who is practising rightly comprehending the formations in accordance with the instruction of the Conquerors realizes by means of wisdom
As a pupil sire in accordance with the instruction of his teacher realizes a science through wisdom even so sire he who is practising rightly in accordance with the instruction of the Conquerors realizes Nibbāna by means of wisdom
But how is Nibbāna to be understood
It is to be understood as being without adversity without accident without fear as secure peaceful happy joyful excellent pure cool
As if sire a man were burning in a blazing scorching fire heaped with many faggots but on getting free from there with effort and entering a place where there was no fire he would obtain the highest happiness thereeven so sire does he who is practising rightly realize by means of proper attention the highest happiness Nibbāna the torture of the threefold fire departed
As the fire sire so is the threefold fire to be understood As the man in the fire so is he who is practising rightly to be understood As the place where there is no fire so is Nibbāna to be understood
Or sire as if a man were on a filthy heap of corpses of snakes dogs and men and he were entangled in the matted hair of the corpses but on getting free from there with an effort and entering a place where there were no corpses he would obtain the highest happiness thereeven so sire does he who is practising rightly realize by means of proper attention the highest happiness Nibbāna the corpses of the defilements departed
As the corpses sire so are the five strands of sense pleasures to be understood As the man among the corpses so is he who is practising rightly to be understood As the place where there are no corpses so is Nibbāna to be understood
Or sire as if a man were afraid terrified and shaking and confused in mind but on getting free from there with effort and entering a steady firm and unmoving place he would obtain the highest happiness thereeven so sire does he who is practising rightly realize by means of proper attention the highest happiness Nibbāna fear and terror departed
As the fear sire so is the fear of repeated birth ageing disease and death to be considered As the man who is afraid so is he who is practising rightly to be understood As the place where there is no fear so is Nibbāna to be understood
Or sire as if a man had fallen in a place that was filthy and dirty with mud and slime but on getting rid of the mud and slime and going to an absolutely pure and stainless place he would obtain the highest happiness thereeven so sire does he who is practising rightly realize by means of proper attention the highest happiness Nibbāna the mud and slime of the defilements departed
As the mud sire so are gains honour fame to be understood As the man who is in the mud so is he who is practising rightly to be understood As the absolutely pure and stainless place so is Nibbāna to be understood
But if you should ask me how he who is practising rightly realizes that Nibbāna I should reply
It is like a man not finding a spot to take hold of either at one end or in the middle or at the other end on a glowing scorching red hot mass of iron Even so sire whoever comprehends the occurrence of formations sees birth ageing disease and death does not see anything there that is happiness or joy and he does not see anything in the beginning in the middle or in the end to be taken hold of there
Then discontent arises in his mind when he does not see anything to be taken hold of a fever descends on his body and being hopeless without a refuge or protection he becomes repelled by all states of existence
When he sees the danger in the occurrence of formations he thinks thus This occurrence of formations is aglow on fire ablaze of much suffering of much despair If only one could obtain the nonoccurrence of formationsthat is peace that the excellent that is to say the tranquillizing of all formations the casting out of all clinging the destruction of craving dispassion cessation Nibbāna
So his mind leaps forward to the nonoccurrence of formations finds satisfaction is exultant and joyous at the thought I have obtained the escape
It is like a man who chanced into unfamiliar territory and got lost on seeing a way leading out leaps forward feels satisfaction and is exultant and joyous thinking I have obtained a way leading out Even so sire when a man sees the danger in the occurrence of formations his mind leaps forward to their nonoccurrence finds satisfaction and is exultant and joyous at the thought I have obtained the escape
He cultivates seeks develops and makes much of the way for the nonoccurrence of formations his mindfulness moulds itself to that goal his energy moulds itself to that goal his rapture moulds itself to that goal by repeated attention his mind transcending the occurrence of formations enters on nonoccurrence If he attains the nonoccurrence of formations sire while he is practising rightly he is said to realize Nibbāna
King Milinda said Revered Nāgasena is there a spot to the east or the south or the west or the north above or below or across where Nibbāna is stored up
There is no spot sire to the east or the south or the west or the north above or below or across where Nibbāna is stored up
and false is the realization of those by whom this Nibbāna has been realized I will tell you a reason for this As there are revered Nāgasena on the earth fields producing crops flowers producing scents bushes producing flowers trees producing fruits mines producing gems so that whoever wishes for this or that on going there takes iteven so revered Nāgasena if there is Nibbāna there must be a place for producing Nibbāna But inasmuch revered Nāgasena as there is no place for producing Nibbāna therefore I say there is no Nibbāna and false is the realization of those by whom this Nibbāna is realized
It is sire as there is fire though there is no place for storing it up and a man rubbing two sticks together obtains fire
Even so sire there is Nibbāna though there is no place for storing it up and one practising rightly realizes Nibbāna by means of proper attention
Revered Nāgasena let be the place for the storing up of Nibbāna But is there that quality steadfast in which a man who is practising rightly realizes Nibbāna
Yes sire
Morality sire If he is established in morality and is giving proper attention then wherever he is if he is steadfast and is practising rightly he realizes Nibbāna
just as any man with vision wherever he is sees the sky
Then King Milinda approached the Venerable Nāgasena greeted him and sat down at a respectful distance King Milinda anxious to know anxious to hear anxious to remember anxious to see the light of knowledge anxious to break down the lack of knowledge anxious to find the light of knowledge anxious to expel the darkness of ignorance aroused extreme steadfastness and zeal and mindfulness and clear consciousness and spoke thus to the Venerable Nāgasena Revered Nāgasena have you ever seen the Buddha
No sire
No sire
Yes revered sir
Have you sire ever seen the former noble warriors
No revered sir
No revered sir
Revered Nāgasena articles of use enjoyed by the former noble warriors are to be seen
By these we can know and can believe that the former noble warriors existed
There is this reason according to which we may know and believe that there was this Blessed One
What is the reason
There are sire articles of use enjoyed by that Blessed One who knows and sees the Arahat the Perfectly Enlightened One
For this reason sire for this cause because of this method because of this inference it should be known that there was this Blessed One
As sire a cityarchitect when he wants to build a city first looks about for a district that is level not elevated not lowlying free from gravel and stone secure irreproachable and delightful and then when he has made level there what was not level and has had it cleared of stumps of trees and thorns he might build a city there It would be fine and regular well planned the moats and encircling walls dug deep the city gates the watchtowers and the ramparts strong the crossroads squares junctions and the places where three or four roads meet numerous the mainroads clean level and even the bazaar shops well laid out the city full of parks pleasances lakes lotus pools and wells adorned with a wide variety of shrines to devas the whole free from defects When that city was fully developed he might go away to another district Then after a time that city might become rich and prosperous well stocked with food secure successful happy without adversity without accident crowded with all kinds of people When these people had seen the city new well laid out without a defect irreproachable delightful they would know by inference Clever indeed is that cityarchitect who was the builder of the city

The King saw forestmonks ascetic in quality who had plunged into the forest
Again he saw householders stable in the fruit of nonreturn
As he considered both of these a great perplexity arose
To dispel his doubts he decided to inquire from the Venerable Nāgasena the best of teachers of the scriptures subtle in crushing the professions of outside teachers
Then King Milinda approached the Venerable Nāgasena having approached and greeted the Venerable Nāgasena he sat down at a respectable distance and spoke thus to him Revered Nāgasena is there any householder living in a house enjoying sense pleasures dwelling as master in a house crowded with wife and children accustomed to Benares sandalwood using garlands scents and unguents handling gold and silver his turban studded with a variety of jewels pearls and gold by whom the peaceful uttermost goal of Nibbāna has been realized
Not merely one hundred sire nor two hundred nor three four nor five hundred nor a thousand nor a hundred thousand nor a hundred myriads nor a thousand myriads nor a hundred thousand myriads Let be sire the understanding of the Truths by ten twenty a hundred a thousand householders In what manner shall I give you an explanation
Do you yourself tell it
In the city of Sāvatthī sire at least five myriads of the Blessed Ones ariyan disciples were men and women lay devotees Of these three hundred and fiftyseven thousand were established in the fruit of nonreturn
And in many other places there were many householders who realized the peaceful and uttermost goal of Nibbāna
If revered Nāgasena householders living in a house enjoying sense pleasures realize the peaceful and uttermost goal of Nibbāna then what purpose do these ascetic practices serve Because of this reason ascetic practices are useless
If revered Nāgasena illnesses abated without spells and medicinal herbs what is the reason for weakening the body with emetics and purgatives
Even so revered Nāgasena if householders living in a house enjoying sense pleasures realize the peaceful and uttermost goal of Nibbāna what is the good of undertaking the noble qualities of asceticism

Those who are very greedy constantly intent on hindering and killing
beings who after passing away go to darkness fall headfirst into hell This is a raw stench not the eating of meat
No fish  meat no fasting no nakedness no shaven head no tangled hair
no rough animal skins no performance of fire oblations or the many austerities to become an immortal in the world
no chants no oblations no performance of sacrifices at the proper season purify a mortal who hasnt crossed over doubt
One should go about guarded with regard to those things ones faculties understood standing firm in the Dhamma delighting in being straightforward  mild
Attachments past all suffering abandoned the enlightened one isnt smeared by whats heard or seen
Thus the Blessed One explained the meaning again  again The one who had mastered chants understood it
With variegated verses the sage free from raw stench unfettered indomitable proclaimed it
Hearing the Awakened Ones wellspoken word free from raw stench dispelling all stress
the one with lowered mind paid homage to the Tathāgata chose the Going Forth right there
And why By reason
of the greatness of the virtue of omniscient Buddhas
Of other things also whatever is mighty in the world is singular
The question has been well discussed revered Nāgasena with similes and reasons
Monks these two bright qualities guard the world
Which two
Shame  compunction
If these two bright qualities did not guard the world there would be no recognition of mother here no recognition of mothers sister uncles wife teachers wife or wives of those who deserve respect
The world would be immersed in promiscuity like rams with goats roosters with pigs or dogs with jackals
But because these two bright qualities guard the world there is recognition of mother mothers sister uncles wife teachers wife  wives of those who deserve respect 
just as it is not possible to count the number of waves in the great ocean
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is therefore do I accept it
of complete and stainless purity
as one of not associating with evil things
as one that is hard to pierce
as one to be preserved by many controls
These ten qualities sire accompanying the body follow it and keep on going with it from existence to existence
Even so sire the mind of an arahat proceeds in dependence on his body but neither the command of an arahat nor his authority proceeds to the body
Revered Nāgasena for what reason does an ordinary person feel a bodily and mental feeling
he then howls and yells and cries aloud in dread and distress
Unequal sire are the attributes of a householder The attributes being unequal it is owing to the weakness of his attributes that a householder who has attained arahatship either goes forth or attains final Nibbāna on that very day
But revered sir can an arahat fall into an offence
On what kind of matter
Revered Nāgasena you say that those who commit offences do so from one of two reasons out of disrespect or out of ignorance
Then revered sir the arahat must be capable of lack of mindfulness
The arahat sire is not capable of lack of mindfulness yet he may be guilty of offences
What is a breach of the rules of the Order
injuring trees and shrubs
sporting in the water and many other things of a similar kind are blameless in householders but are blameable in the Dispensation of the Conqueror
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is therefore do I accept it
Bhikkhus there are these six subjects of recollection
Here bhikkhus a noble disciple recollects the Tathagata thus The Blessed One is an arahant perfectly enlightened accomplished in true knowledge and conduct fortunate knower of the world unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed teacher of devas and humans the Enlightened One the Blessed One
Again a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma thus The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One directly visible immediate inviting one to come and see applicable to be personally experienced by the wise
When a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust hatred or delusion on that occasion his mind is simply straight He has departed from greed
some beings here are purified in such a way
Again a noble disciple recollects the Sangha thus The Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practicing the good way practicing the straight way practicing the true way practicing the proper way that is the four pairs of persons the eight types of individuals this Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation the unsurpassed field of merit for the world
When a noble disciple recollects the Sangha on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust hatred or delusion on that occasion his mind is simply straight He has departed from greed
some beings here are purified in such a way
Again a noble disciple recollects his own virtuous behavior as unbroken flawless unblemished unblotched freeing praised by the wise ungrasped leading to concentration
When a noble disciple recollects his virtuous behavior on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust hatred or delusion on that occasion his mind is simply straight He has departed from greed 
some beings here are purified in such a way
Again a noble disciple recollects his own generosity thus Tt is truly my good fortune and gain that in a population obsessed by the stain of miserliness I dwell with a mind devoid of the stain of miserliness freely generous openhanded delighting in relinquishment devoted to charity delighting in giving and sharing
Again a noble disciple recollects the deities thus There are devas ruled by the four great kings Tavatimsa devas Yama devas Tusita devas devas who delight in creation devas who control what is created by others devas of Brahmas company and devas still higher than these
I too have such faith as those deities possessed because of which when they passed away here they were reborn there
I too have such virtuous behaviorsuch learning such generositysuch wisdom as those deities possessed because of which when they passed away here they were reborn there
such wisdom as those deities possessed because of which when they passed away here they were reborn there When a noble disciple recollects the faith virtuous behavior learning generosity and wisdom in himself and in those deities on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust hatred or delusion on that occasion his mind is simply straight He has departed from greed freed himself from it emerged from it
Greed bhikkhus is a designation for the five objects of sensual pleasure
Having made this a basis too some beings here are purified in such a way
These bhikkhus are the six subjects of recollection
What six
When a noble disciple recollects the Tathagata on that occasion his mind is not obseissed by lust hatred or delusion on that occasion his mind is simply straight He has departed from greed freed himself from it emerged from it
Greed bhikkhus is a designation for the five objects of sensual pleasure
Having made this a basissome beings here are purified in such a way
When a noble disciple recollects his generosity on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust hatred or delusion on that occasion his mind is simply straight
Some beings here are purified in such a Way
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrel Sanctuary
without knowing it he may be guilty of an offence against the rules of the Order
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is therefore do I accept it
These three sire are not found in the world
What three
That which whether it is cognizant or incognizsant does not age and diethat is not found in the world There is no permanence of formations And in the ultimate sense there is no being to be found These three sire are not in the world
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is therefore do I accept it
Now on that occasion the Blessed One was honoured respected esteemed venerated and revered and he obtained robes almsfood lodgings and medicinal requisites
The Bhikkhu Sagha too was honoured respected esteemed venerated and revered and the bhikkhus too obtained robes almsfood lodgings and medicinal requisites
But the wanderers of other sects were not honoured respected esteemed venerated and revered and they did not obtain robes alrnsfood lodgings and medicinal requisites
Now on that occasion the wanderer Susima was residing in Rajagaha along with a large company of wanderers
Then his company said to the wanderer Susima Come friend Susima lead the holy life under the ascetic Gotama
Master his Dhamma and teach it to us
We will master his Dhamma preach it to the lay people
Thus we too will be honoured respected esteemed venerated and revered and we too will obtain robes almsfood lodgings and medicinal requisites
All right friends the wanderer Susima replied He then approached the Venerable Ananda and exchanged greetings  with him
When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk he sat down to one side
Then the Venerable Ananda took the wanderer Susima and approached the Blessed One He paid homage to the Blessed One and then he sat down to one side
and said to him Venerable sir this wanderer Susima says that he wishes to lead the holy life in this Dhamma and Discipline
Well then Anananda give him the going forth
The wanderer Susima then received the going forth and the higher ordination under the Blessed One
Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus had declared final knowledge in the presence of the Blessed One saying We understand Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of being
so he approached those bhikkhus
Yes friend
Then knowing and seeing thus do you venerable ones wield the various kinds of spiritual power such that having been one you become many having been many you become one you appear and vanish you go unhindered through a wall through a rampart through a mountain as though through space you dive in and out of the earth as though it were water you walk on water without sinking as though it were earth seated crosslegged you travel in space like a bird with your hand you touch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and mighty you exercise mastery with the body as far as the brahma world
No friend
Then knowing and seeing thus do you venerable ones with the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human hear both kinds of sounds the divine and human those that are far as well as near
No friend
Then knowing and seeing thus do you venerable ones understand the minds of other beings and persons having encompassed them with your own minds Do you understand a mind with lust as a mind with lust a mind without lust as a mind without lust a mind with hatred as a mind with hatred a mind without hatred as a mind without hatred a mind with delusion  as a mind with delusion a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted a surpassable mind as surpassable and an unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated
No friend
Then knowing and seeing thus do you venerable ones recollect your manifold past abodes that is one birth two births three births four births five births ten births twenty births tfurty births forty births fifty births a hundred births a thousand births a hundred thousand births many aeons of worldcontraction many aeons of worldexpansion many aeons of worldcontraction and expansion thus There I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my life span passing away from there I was reborn elsewhere and there too I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such my life span passing away from there I was reborn herer
Do you thus recollect your manifold past abodes with their modes and details
NO friend
Then knowing and seeing thus do you venerable ones with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human see beings passing away and being reborn inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and understand how beings fare on in accordance with their karnrna thus These beings who engaged in misconduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong view and undertook actions based on wrong view with the breakup of the body after death have been reborn in a state of misery in a bad destination in the nether world in hell but these beings who engaged in good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right view and undertook action based on right view with the breakup of the body after death have been reborn in a good destination in a heavenly world Thus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human do you see beings passing away and being reborn inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and understand how beings fare on in accordance with their kamma
No friend
Then knowing and seeing thus do you venerable ones dwell in those peaceful deliverances that transcend forms the formless attainments having touched them with the body
No friend
Here now venerable ones this answer and the non attainment of those states how could this be friends
We are liberated by wisdom friend Susima
I do not understand in detail friends the meaning of what has been stated in brief by the venerable ones
It would be good if the venerable ones would explain to me in such a way that I could understand in detail what has been stated in brief
Whether or not you understand friend Susima we are liberated by wisdom
Then the Venerable Susima rose from his seat and approached the Blessed One
Having approached he paid homage to the Blessed One sat down to one side and reported to the Blessed One the entire conversation he had had with those bhikkhus
The Blessed One said First Susima comes knowledge of the stability of the Dhamma afterwards knowledge of Nibbana
I do not understand in detail venerable sir the meaning of what was stated in brief by the Blessed One
It would be good if the Blessed One would explain to me in such a way that I could understand in detail what has been stated in brief
Whether or not you understand Susima first comes knowledge of the stability of the Dhamma afterwards knowledge Of Nibbana
What do you think Susima is form permanent or impermanent
 Impermanent venerable sir
 IS what is impermanent suffering or happiness
 Suffering venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self
 No venerable sir
Is feeling permanent or impermanent
 Is perception permanent or impermanent
 Are volitional formations permanent or impermanent
 Is consciousness permanent or impermanent
 Impermanent venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness
 Suffering venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self
 No venerable sir
Therefore Susima any kind of form whatsoever whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near all form should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
Any kind of feeling whatsoever Any lund of perception whatsoever Any kind of volitional formations whatsoever Any kind of consciousness whatsoever whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near all consciousness should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not ttus is not my self
Seeing thus Susima the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form revulsion towards feeling revulsion towards perception revulsion towards volitional formations revulsion towards consciousness
Experiencing revulsion he becomes dispassionate Through dispassion his mind is liberated When it is liberated there comes the knowledge Its liberated
He understands Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of being
Do you see Susima With birth as condition aginganddeath comes to be
Yes venerable sir
Do you see Susia With existence as condition birth
 With clinging as condition existence
 With craving as condition clinging
 With feeling as condition craving  With contact as condition feeling  With the six sense bases as condition contact  With nameandform as condition the six sense bases  With consciousness as condition nameandform  With volitional formations as condition consciousness  With ignorance as condition volitional formations come to be
Yes venerable sir
Do you see Susima With the cessation of birth comes cessation of aginganddeath
Yes venerable sir
Do you see Susia With the cessation of existence comes cessation of birth
 With the cessation of clinging comes cessation of existence  With the cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations
Yes venerable sir
Knowing and seeing thus Susima do you wield the various kinds of spiritual power such that having been one you become many  and exercise bodily mastery as far as the brahma world
No venerable sir
Then knowing and seeing thus Susima do you with the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human hear both kinds of sounds the divine and human those that are far as well as near
No venerable sir
Then knowing and seeing thus Susima do you understand the minds of other beings and persons having encompassed them with your own mind
No venerable sir
Then knowing and seeing thus Susima do you recollect your manifold past abodes with their modes and details
No venerable sir
Then knowing and seeing thus Susima do you with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human see beings passing away and being reborn and understand how beings fare on in accordance with their kamma
NO venerable sir
Then knowing and seeing thusSusima do you dwell in those peaceful deliverances that transcend forms the formless attainments having touched them with the body
 No venerable sir
Here now Susima this answer and the nonnattainment of those states how could this be Susima 
Then the Venerable Susmna prostrated himself with his head at the Blessed Ones feet and said Venerable sir I have committed a transgression in that I was so foolish so confused so inept that I went forth as a thief of the Dhamma in such a wellexpounded Dhamma and Discipline as this
Venerable sir may the Blessed One pardon me for my transgression seen as a transgression for the sake of future restraint
Surely Susima you have committed a transgression in that you were so foolish so confused so inept that you went forth as a thief of the Dhamma in such a wellexpounded Dhamma and Discipline as this
Suppose Susima they were to arrest a bandit a criminal and bring him before the king saying Sire this man is a bandit a criminal Impose on him whatever punishment you wish
The king would say to them Come men bind this mans arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope shave his head and lead him around from street to street and from square to square beating a drum
Then take him out through the southern gate and to the south of the city cut off his head
What do you think Susima would that man experience pain and displeasure on that account
Yes venerable sir
Although that man would experience pain and displeasure on that account
But since you see your transgression as a transgression and make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma we pardon you for it
For it is growth in the Noble Ones Discipline when one sees ones transgression as a transgression makes amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma and undertakes future restraint
and said to him Friend Ananda I wish to lead the holy life in this Dhamma and Discipline
The Venerable Susima heard about this
exchanged greetings with them and then sat down to one side and said to them Is it true that you venerable ones have declared final knowledge in the presence of the Blessed One saying We understand Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more for this state of being
going forth as a thief of the Dhamma in such a well expounded Dhamma and Discipline as this has results that are far more painful far more bitter and further it leads to the nether world
In the world these two sire are born neither of kamma nor of cause nor of physical change
But what have I said sire that you speak thus to me
But in many a hundred ways the Blessed One pointed out to disciples the way to the realization of Nibbāna and yet you say that Nibbāna is not born of cause
It is true sire that in many a hundred ways the Blessed One pointed out to disciples the way to the realization of Nibbāna but he did not point out a cause for the arising of Nibbāna
Here revered Nāgasena we are entering from darkness to greater darkness from a forest into a deeper forest from a thicket into a denser thicket inasmuch as there is indeed a cause for the realization of Nibbāna though there is no cause from which it can arise
inasmuch as there is a seed for a sprout for that reason one would require also a seed for the seed
Nibbāna sire is unarisable therefore a cause for the arising of Nibbāna has not been pointed out
Please revered Nāgasena give me a reason convince me by the reason so that I may know how it is that while there is a cause for the realization of Nibbāna there is no cause for the arising of Nibbāna
But would that man sire with his natural strength be able to bring the Himalaya king of the mountains here
Even so sire it is possible to point out the way for the realization of Nibbāna but impossible to show a cause for the arising of Nibbāna
Revered Nāgasena is Nibbāna unconditioned
Is there sire what is called wind
Please sire show the wind by its colour or configuration or whether it is thin or thick long or short
If it is not possible sire for the wind to be shown well then there cant be such a thing
I know revered Nāgasena that there is wind I am convinced of it but I am not able to point out the wind
Even so sire Nibbāna is though it is not possible to point out Nibbāna either by colour or configuration
Which then are they that do revered sir and which do not
Well then revered Nāgasena the offerings given by givers are wasted and are fruitless since those for whose benefit they are given receive no profit from them
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Now on that occasion the wanderer Uggahamana Samanamandikaputta was staying in Mallikas Park the singlehailed Tinduka plantation for philosophical debates together with a large following of wanderers with as many as three hundred wanderers
The carpenter Pancakanga went out from Savatthi at midday in order to see the Blessed One
Then he thought It is not the right time to see the Blessed One he is still in retreat
And it is not the right time to see bhikkhus worthy of esteem they are still in retreat
Suppose I went to Mallikas Park to the wanderer Uggahamana Samanamandikaputta
And he went to Mallikas Park
Now on that occasion the wanderer Uggahamana was seated with a large assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar loudly and noisily talking many kinds of pointless talk such as talk of kings whether things are so or are not so
The wanderer Uggahamana Samanamandikaputta saw the carpenter Pancakanga coming in the distance
Seeing him he quieted his own assembly thus Sirs be quiet sirs make no noise Here comes the carpenter Pancakanga a disciple of the recluse Gotama one of the recluse Gotamas whiteclothed lay disciples staying at Savatthi
These venerable ones like quiet they are disciplined in quiet they commend quiet
Perhaps if he finds our assembly a quiet one he will think to join us
Then the wanderers became silent
The carpenter Pancakanga went to the wanderer Uggahamana and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
The wanderer Uggahamana then said to him  Carpenter when a man possesses four qualities I describe him as accomplished in what is wholesome perfected in what is wholesome attained to the supreme attainment an ascetic invincible
What are the four
Here he does no evil bodily actions he utters no evil speech he has no evil intentions and he does not make his living by any evil livelihood When a man possesses these four qualities I describe him as accomplished in what is wholesome perfected in what is wholesome attained to the supreme attainment an ascetic invincible
Then the carpenter Pancakanga neither approved nor disapproved of the wanderer Uggahamanas words
Without doing either he rose from his seat and went away thinking I shall learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of the Blessed One
Then he went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him
Thereupon the Blessed One said  If that were so carpenter then a young tender infant lying prone is accomplished in what is wholesome perfected in what is wholesome attained to the supreme attainment an ascetic invincible according to the wanderer Uggahamanas statement
A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion speech so how should he utter evil speech beyond mere whining
A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion intention so how should he have evil intentions beyond mere sulking
A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion livelihood so how should he make his living by evil livelihood beyond being suckled at his mothers breast
If that were so carpenter then a young tender infant lying prone is accomplished in what is wholesomeaccording to the wanderer Uggahamanas statement
When a man possesses four qualities carpenter I describe him not as accomplished in what is wholesome or perfected in what is wholesome or attained to the supreme attainment or an ascetic invincible but as one who stands in the same category as the young tender infant lying prone
What are the four
Here he does no evil bodily actions he utters no evil speech he has no evil intentions and he does not make his living by any evil livelihood When a man possesses these four qualities I describe him not as accomplishedbut as one who stands in the same category as the young tender infant lying prone
When a man possesses ten qualities carpenter I describe him as accomplished in what is wholesome perfected in what is wholesome attained to the supreme attainment an ascetic invincible
But first of all I say it must be understood thus These are unwholesome habits
And I say it must be understood thus These are unwholesome intentions
And l say it must be understood thus These are wholesome intentions
What are unwholesome habits
They are unwholesome bodily actions unwholesome verbal actions and evil livelihood These are called unwholesome habits
And what do these unwholesome habits originate from
Their origin is stated
What mind
Though mind is multiple varied and of different aspects there is mind affected by lust by hate and by delusion
Unwholesome habits originate from this
And where do these unwholesome habits cease without remainder
Their cessation is stated
And how practising does he practise the way to the cessation of unwholesome habits
Here a bhikkhu awakens zeal for the nonarising of unarisen evil unwholesome states and he makes effort arouses energy exerts his mind and strives He awakens zeal for the abandoning of arisen evil unwholesome statesHe awakens zeal for the arising of unarisen wholesome statesHe awakens zeal for the continuance nondisappearance strengthening increase and fulfilment by development of arisen wholesome states and he makes effort arouses energy exerts his mind and strives
One so practising practises the way to the cessation of unwholesome habits
What are wholesome habits
They are wholesome bodily actions wholesome verbal actions and purification of livelihood
These are called wholesome habits
And what do these wholesome habits originate from
Their origin is stated
What mind
Though mind is multiple varied and of different aspects there is mind unaffected by lust by hate or by delusion
Wholesome habits originate from this
And where do these wholesome habits cease without remainder
Their cessation is stated
Here a bhikkhu awakens zeal for the nonarising of unarisen evil unwholesome statesfor the continuance nondisappearance strengthening increase and fulfilment by development of arisen wholesome states and he makes effort arouses energy exerts his mind and strives
One so practising practises the way to the cessation of wholesome habits
They are the intention of sensual desire the intention of ill will and the intention of cruelty
These are called unwholesome intentions
And what do these unwholesome intentions originate from
Their origin is stated they should be said to originate from perception
What perception
Though perception is multiple varied and of different aspects
there is perception of sensual desire perception of ill will and perception of cruelty Unwholesome intentions originate from this
And where do these unwholesome intentions cease without remainder
Their cessation is stated
And how practising does he practise the way to the cessation of unwholesome intentions
Here a bhikkhu awakens zeal for the nonarising of unarisen evil unwholesome statesfor the continuance nondisappearance strengthening increase and fulfilment by development of arisen wholesome states and he makes effort arouses energy exerts his mind and strives
One so practising practises the way to the cessation of unwholesome intentions
What are wholesome intentions
They are the intention of renunciation the intention of nonill will and the intention of noncruelty These are called wholesome intentions
And what do these wholesome intentions originate from
Their origin is stated
they should be said to originate from perception
What perception
Though perception is multiple varied and of different aspects
there is perception of renunciation perception of nonill will and perception of noncruelty Wholesome intentions originate from this
And where do these wholesome intentions cease without remainder
Their cessation is stated
And how practising does he practise the way to the cessation of wholesome intentions
Here a bhikkhu awakens zeal for the nonarising of unarisen evil unwholesome statesfor the continuance nondisappearance strengthening increase and fulfilment by development of arisen wholesome states and he makes effort arouses energy exerts his mind and strives
One so practising practises the way to the cessation of wholesome intentions
Now carpenter when a man possesses what ten qualities do I describe him as accomplished in what is wholesome perfected in what is wholesome attained to the supreme attainment an ascetic invincible
Here a bhikkhu possesses the right view of one beyond training the right intention of one beyond training the right speech of one beyond training the right action of one beyond training the right livelihood of one beyond training the right effort of one beyond training the right mindfulness of one beyond training the right concentration of one beyond framing the right knowledge of one beyond training and the right deliverance of one beyond training When a man possesses these ten qualities I describe him as accomplished in what is wholesome perfected in what is wholesome attained to the supreme attainment an ascetic invincible
That is what the Blessed One said
The carpenter Pancakanga was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
he sat down at one side and reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with the wanderer Uggahamana
For a young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion body so how should he do an evil action beyond mere wriggling
And I say it must be understood thus These are wholesome habits
and thus Unwholesome habits originate from this
and thus Unwholesome habits cease without remainder here
and thus One practising in this way is practising the way to the cessation of unwholesome habits
and thus Wholesome habits originate from this
and thus Wholesome habits cease without remainder here
and thus One practising in this way is practising the way to the cessation of wholesome habits
and thus Unwholesome intentions originate from this
and thus Unwholesome intentions cease without remainder here
and thus One practising in this way is practising the way to the cessation of unwholesome intentions
and thus Wholesome intentions originate from this
and thus Wholesome intentions cease without remainder here
and thus One practising in this way is practising the way to the cessation of wholesome intentions
they should be said to originate from mind
here a bhikkhu abandons bodily misconduct and develops good bodily conduct he abandons verbal misconduct and develops good verbal conduct he abandons mental misconduct and develops good mental conduct he abandons wrong livelihood and gains a living by right livelihood It is here that unwholesome habits cease without remainder
they should be said to originate from mind
here a bhikkhu is virtuous but he does not identify with his virtue and he understands as it actually is that deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom where these wholesome habits cease without remainder
And how practising does he practise the way to the cessation of wholesome habits
What are unwholesome intentions
here quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion It is here that unwholesome intentions cease without remainder
here with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentration It is here that these wholesome intentions cease without remainder
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha on Mount Vulture Peak
Now on that occasion the Venerable Sona w as dwelling at Rajagaha in the Cool Grove
Let me then give up the training and return to the lower life so that I can enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds
Then having known with his own mind the course of thought in the Venerable Sonas mind just as a strong man might extend his d rawnin arm or draw in his extended arm the Blessed One disappeared on Mount Vulture Peak and appeared in the Cool Grove in the presence of the Venerable Sona
The Blessed One sat down on the seat prepared for him
The Venerable Sona paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side
The Blessed One then said to him
Let me then give up the training and return to the lower life so that I can enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds
Yes Bhante
Tell me Sona in the past when you lived at home werent you skilled at the lute
Yes Bhante
What do you think Sona When its strings were too tight was your lute well tuned and easy to play
No Bhante
No Bhante
But Sona when its strings were neither too tight nor too loose but adjusted to a balanced pitch was your lute well tuned and easy to play
Yes Bhante
So too Sona if energy is aroused too forcefully this leads to restlessness and if energy is too lax this leads to laziness
Therefore Sona resolve on a balance of energy achieve evenness of the spiritual faculties and take up the object there
Yes Bhante the Venerable Sona replied
When the Blessed One had finished giving the Venerable Sona this exhortation just as a strong man might extend his drawnin arm or draw in his extended arm he disappeared in the Cool Grove and reappeared on Mount Vulture Peak
Then some time later the Venerable Sona resolved on a balance of energy achieved evenness of the spiritual faculties and took up the object there
Then dwelling alone withdrawn heedful ardent and resolute in no long time the Venerable Sona realized for himself with direct knowledge in this very life that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness and having entered upon it he dwelled in it
He directly knew Destroyed is birth the spiritual life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming back to any state of being
And the Venerable Sona became one of the arahants
Having attained arahantship the Venerable Sona thought Let me go to the Blessed One and declare final knowledge m his presence
Bhante when a bhikkhu is an arahant one whose taints are destroyed who has lived the spiritual life done whathad to be done laid down the burden reached his own goal utterly destroyed the fetters of existence and become completely liberated through final knowledge he is intent upon six things on renunciation on solitude on nonaffliction on the destruction of craving on the destruction of clinging and on nonconfusion
It may be Bhante that some venerable one here thinks Could it be that this venerable one is intent upon renunciation on account of mere faith
But it should not be seen in such a way
A bhikkhu with taints destroyed who has lived the spiritual life and done his task does not see in himself anything further to be done or any need to increase what has been doneHe is intent upon renunciation because he is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust because he is devoid of hatred through the destruction of hatred because he is devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion
It may be that some venerable one here thinks Could it be that this venerable one is intent upon solitude because he is hankering after gain honor and praise
But it should not be seen in such a way
A bhikkhu with taints destroyed who has lived the spiritual life and done his task does not see in himself anything further to be done or any need to increase what has been done He is intent upon solitude because he is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust because he is devoid of hatred through the destruction of hatred because he is devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion
It may be that some venerable one here thinks Could it be that this venerable one is intent upon nonaffliction because he has fallen back on the wrong grasp of behavior and observances as the essence
But it should not be seen in such a way
A bhikkhu with taints destroyed who has lived the spiritual life and done his task does not see in himself anything further to be done or any need to increase what has been done He is intent upon nonaffliction because he is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust because he is devoid of hatred through the destruction of hatred because he is devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion
 He is intent upon the destruction of craving because he is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust because he is devoid of hatred through the destruction of hatred because he is devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion
He is intent upon the destruction of clinging because he is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust because he is devoid of hatred through the d estruction of hatred because he is devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion
He is intent upon nonconfusion because lie is devoid of lust through the destruction of lust because he is devoid of hatred through the destruction of hatred because he is devoid of delusion through the destruction of delusion
Bhante when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye they do not obsess his mind his mind is not at all affected
It remains steady attained to imperturbability and he observes its vanishing
Even if powerful sounds cognizable by the ear come into range of the ear Even if powerful odors cognizable by the nose come into range of the nose Even if powerful tastes cognizable by the tongue come into rahge of the tongue Even if powerful tactile objects cognizable by the body come into range of the body Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind they do not obsess his mind his mind is not at all affected
It remains steady attained to imperturbability and he observes its vanishing
Suppose Bhante there were a stone m ountain without clefts or fissures one solid mass
If a violent rainstorm should come from the east it could not make it quake wobble and tremble if a violent rainstorm should come from the west from the north from the south it could not make it quake wobble and tremble
It remains steady attained to imperturbability and he observes its vanishing
Then while the Venerable Sona was alone in seclusion the following course of thought arose in his mind I am one of the Blessed Ones most energetic disciples
yet my mind has not been liberated from the taints by nonclinging Now there is wealth in my family and it is possible for me to enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds
Sona when you were alone in seclusion didnt the following course of thought arise in your mind I am one of the Blessed Ones most energetic disciples yet my mind has not been liberated from the taints by non clinging
Now there is wealth in my family and it is possible for me to enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds
When its strings were too loose was your lute well tuned and easy to play
Then he approached the Blessed One paid homage to him sat doWn to one side
and said
So too when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind they do not obsess his mind his mind is not at all affected
If one is intent on renunciation and solitude of mind
if one is intent on nonaffliction and the destruction of clinging
if one is intent on cravings destructior and nonconfusion of mind
when one sees the sense bases arising ones mind is completely liberated
For a bhikkhu of peaceful mind one completely liberated
theres nothing further to be done no need to increase what has been done
As a stone mountain one solid mass is not stirred by the wind
so no forms and tastes sounds odors and tactile objects
His mind is steady and freed and he observes its vanishing
and phenomena desirable or undesirable stir the stable ones mind
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Baranasi in the deer park a Isipatana
Now on that occasion after their meal on returning from their alms round a number of elder bhikkhus assembled and were sitting together in the pavilion hall when this conversation arose It was said friends by the Blessed One in the Parayana in The Questions of Metteyya
What friends is the first end What is the second end What is in the middle And what is the seamstress
When this was said a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus Contact friends is one end the arising of contact is the second end the cessation of contact is in the middle and craving is the seamstress For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence
It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known fully understands what should be fully understood and by doing so in this very life he makes an end of suffering
When this was said another bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus The past friends is one end the future is the second end the present is in the middle and craving is the seamstress For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence
It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly knownin this very life he makes an end of suffering
When this was said another bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus Pleasant feeling friends is one end painful feeling is the second end neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling is in the middle and craving is the seamstress For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence
It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly knownin this very life he makes an end of suffering
When this was said another bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus Name friends is one end form is the second end consciousness is in the middle and craving is the seamstress
For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly knownin this very life he makes an end of suffering
When this was said another bhikkhusaid to the elder bhikkhus The six internal bases friends are one end the six external bases are the second end consciousness is in the middle and craving is the seamstress
For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly knownin this very life he makes an end of suffering
When this was said another bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus Personal existence friends is one end the origin of personal existence is the second end the cessation of personal existence is in the middle and craving is the seamstress
For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence It is in this w ay that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known fully understands what should be fully understood and by doing so in this very life he makes an end of suffering
When this was said a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus Friends we have each explained according to our own inspiration
Come lets go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him
As the Blessed One explains it to us so should we retain it in mind
Yes friend those elder bhikkhus replied
Then the elder bhikkhus went to the Blessed One paid homage to him sat down to one side
Yes Bhante those bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this Contact bhikkhus is one end the arising of contact is the second end the cessation of contact is in the middle and craving is the seamstress
For craving sews one to the poduction of this or that state of existence
It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known fully understands what should be fully understood and by doing so in this very life he makes an end of suffering
Having understood both ends the wise one does not stick in the middle
I call him a great man he has here transcended the seamstress
Having understood both ends the wise one does not stiqk in the middle
I call him a great man he has here transcended the seamstress
The Blessed One said In a way bhikkhus you have all spoken well but listen and attend closely as I tell you w hat I intended when I said in the Parayana in The Questions of Metteyya
and reported to him the entire conversation that had taken place asking
Bhante which of us has spoken well
Well then revered sir convince me by a reason
Even so sire it is the givers themselves who experience the fruit of their gifts
then if a man who destroys living creatures is bloodyhanded and is of corrupt mind and purpose were after committing murder or any other dreadful act to dedicate it to the departed thinking May the result of this act of mine accrue to the departedwould it then be transferred to them
Revered Nāgasena what is the cause what is the reason that a good deed can accrue to them and not an evil one
Even so sire a good deed can be shared but not an evil one
Make a simile
It is as sire one small drop of water might fall on the earth yet would that drop of water sire spread out over ten or twelve leagues
For what reason sire
Even so sire an evil deed is slight because of its slightness it affects only the doer it is not possible to share it
For what reason sire
Even so sire a good deed is abundant because of its abundance one is able to share it even with devas and mankind
What is the reason revered sir that evil is slight and good is abundant
even so sire good increases more and more
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is therefore do I accept it
Revered Nāgasena in regard to him who sees a dream as a portent does his mind going along of its own accord seek for that portent or does that portent come into the focus of the mind or does anyone else come and tell him of it
Revered Nāgasena does the mind that sees a dream also know Thus will be the result peaceful or frightening
Please give me a simile to explain this revered Nāgasena
Revered Nāgasena does he who sees a dream see it when he is awake or asleep
Revered Nāgasena is there a beginning a middle and an end in sleep
Which then is the beginning which the middle and which the end
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is therefore do I accept it
and we have a reason for saying this
Nibbāna is not mixed with suffering sire Nibbāna is entirely blissful
Is this bliss of sovereignty mixed with suffering sire
Then why is it sire that in a border disturbance kings for the resubjugation of those living in the border districts set out on an expedition surrounded by their ministers advisers hirelings and armed forces and hard pressed by gnats and mosquitoes wind and sun march over even and uneven ground and engage in a great battle and jeopardize their lives
Even so sire Nibbāna is entirely blissful and is not mixed with suffering
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is therefore do I accept it
Let it be sire I will convince you of this by a reason
But if someone asked you sire how much water was in the great ocean or how many beings live in the great ocean would you sire on being questioned thus be able to answer him
The great ocean has not been analysed by natural scientists and it is not possible to estimate the amount of water in the great ocean or the number of beings living there Thus would I revered sir make reply to him
Is there any special quality of Nibbāna present in other things that can be demonstrated by a simile
Three special qualities of an antidote are present in Nibbāna as an antidote is the mainstay of beings afflicted by poisons so Nibbāna is the mainstay of beings afflicted by the poison of the defilements
and as an antidote makes an end of diseases so Nibbāna makes an end of all suffering
and as an antidote is nectar so is Nibbāna nectar
Four special qualities of the great ocean are present in Nibbāna as the great ocean is empty of all corpses so is Nibbāna empty of the corpses of all the defilements
and as the great ocean is great and unbounded and is not filled by all the rivers that flow into it so is Nibbāna great and unbounded and is not filled by all the beings who attain it
and as the great ocean is the abode of great beings so is Nibbāna the abode of arahats great beings who are stainless their cankers destroyed who have attained the powers and become masters over their minds
and as the great ocean is flowering with the unnumbered various and abundant flowers of the waves so is Nibbāna flowering with the unnumbered various abundant and quite pure flowers of knowledge and emancipation
and as food is the augmenter of the strength of all beings so is Nibbāna when it is realized the augmenter of the psychic power of all beings
and as food is the producer of beauty in all beings so is Nibbāna when it is realized the producer of special qualities in all beings
and as food is the calmer of distress in all beings so is Nibbāna when it is realized the calmer of the distress of all the defilements in all beings
and as food is the remover of the weakness of exhaustion in all beings so is Nibbāna when it is realized the remover of the weakness of exhaustion in all beings due to all their suffering
so Nibbāna is not born does not age does not decease does not arise is hard to master cannot be carried off by thieves depends on nothing is the sphere of noble ones is without obstruction and is unending
and as a precious gem causes delight so does Nibbāna cause delight
and as a precious gem is rich in lustre so is Nibbāna rich in lustre
and as red sandalwood is praised by good men so is Nibbāna praised by the noble ones
and as red sandalwood is unequalled for its lovely scent so is Nibbāna unequalled for its lovely scent
and as the cream of ghee has scent so has Nibbāna the scent of morality
and as the cream of ghee has flavour so has Nibbāna the flavour of deathlessness
and as a mountainpeak is immovable so is Nibbāna immovable
and as a mountainpeak is hard to scale so is Nibbāna hard to scale by all the defilements
and as no seeds can take root on a mountainpeak so no defilements can take root in Nibbāna
and as a mountainpeak is free from approval and repugnance so is Nibbāna free from approval and repugnance
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is therefore do I accept it
He who is practising rightly comprehends the occurrence of formations
on comprehending their occurrence he sees birth there he sees ageing he sees disease he sees death he does not see anything there that is happiness or joy he does not see anything in the beginning in the middle or at the end to be taken hold of there
It is good revered Nāgasena so it is therefore do I accept it
If revered Nāgasena there is no place for the storing up of Nibbāna well then there is no Nibbāna
There is no place for the storing up of Nibbāna sire but there is this Nibbāna and one practising rightly realizes Nibbāna by means of proper attention
What is that quality revered sir
It is good revered Nāgasena Nibbāna has been taught by you the realization of Nibbāna has been taught a special quality of morality has been adorned right practice has been shown raised aloft is the banner of Dhamma Dhamma as a guide has been established not barren is the right exertion of those who are wellintent Thus it is noble and distinguished teacher of a host of followers therefore do I accept it
inquiring again and again
King Milinda grew in discernment and learned the Tipiṭaka
he realized that there are questions that are dilemmas hard to solve along with refutations
would be contention about them in the future
and have him explain them for the benefit of posterity
Revered Nāgasena I have a certain matter to discuss with you and want no third person present
Revered Nāgasena if you have never seen the Buddha and if your teachers have never seen the Buddha well then revered Nāgasena there is no Buddha the Buddha is not manifested here
But sire did those former noble warriors exist who were the forerunners of your noble warrior dynasty
what doubt is there
But have those who have instructed you sirepriests generals judges chief councillorshave these ever seen the former noble warriors
But if you sire have not seen the former noble warriors and if your instructors have not seen the former noble warriors where are the former noble warriors
that is to say the white sunshade the turban the shoes the yaktail fan the treasure of the sword of state and the couches of great price
Even so sire we may also know and believe in this Blessed One
that is to say the four foundations of mindfulness the four right efforts the four bases of psychic power the five spiritual faculties the five powers the seven factors of enlightenment the Noble Eightfold Path By these the world with the devas knows and believes that there was this Blessed One
The King also insisted that nothing should be hidden or kept secret from him saying that he was fit to hear what is kept secret
After a preliminary conversation Venerable Nāgasena gave the King permission to question him
Revered Nāgasena make a simile
a flower shop a perfume shop a fruit shop an antidote shop a medicine shop a nectar shop a jewel shop and a general shop
Revered Nāgasena what is the flower shop of the Buddha the Blessed One
that is to say the perception of impermanence the perception of nonself the perception of the foul the perception of peril the perception of abandonment the perception of dispassion the perception of cessation the perception of not delighting in anything in the world the perception of the impermanence of all formations mindfulness of breathing the perception of a swollen corpse the perception of a discoloured corpse the perception of a decomposing corpse the perception of a fissured corpse the perception of a corpse gnawed by animals the perception of a corpse with bones scattered the perception of a corpse hacked up and scattered the perception of a corpse still bleeding the perception of a worminfested corpse the perception of a skeleton the perception of loving kindness the perception of compassion the perception of sympathetic joy the perception of equanimity mindfulness of death mindfulness occupied with the body
Whoever is anxious to get free from old age and death chooses one of these objective supports for meditation and with this objective support for meditation he is freed from lust freed from hatred freed from delusion freed from pride freed from false views he crosses over saṃsāra stems the stream of craving cleanses away the threefold stain and when he has slain all the defilements and has entered the City of Nibbāna that is stainless dustless pure fair birthless ageless deathless blissful cooled and without fear he sets free his mind in arahatship This sire is called the Blessed Ones flower shop
Revered Nāgasena what is the perfume shop of the Buddha the Blessed One
Revered Nāgasena what is the fruit shop of the Buddha the Blessed One
the fruit of streamentry the fruit of oncereturn the fruit of nonreturn the fruit of arahatship the attainment of the fruit of emptiness the attainment of the fruit of the signless the attainment of the fruit of the undirected
Whatever fruit anyone wishes for he giving the price of the transaction buys the fruit he prefers
Revered Nāgasena what is the antidote shop of the Buddha the Blessed One

THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
Out of compassion for you I have thought How shall my disciples be my heirs in Dhamma not my heirs in material things
If you are my heirs in material things not my heirs in Dhamma you will be reproached thus The Teachers disciples live as his heirs in material things not as heirs in Dhamma and I will be reproached thus The Teachers disciples live as his heirs in material things not as his heirs in Dhamma
If you are my heirs in Dhamma not my heirs in material things you will not be reproached as it will be said The Teachers disciples live as his heirs in Dhamma not as his heirs in material things and I will not be reproached as it will be said The Teachers disciples live as his heirs in Dhamma not as his heirs in material things
Therefore bhikkhus be my heirs in Dhamma not my heirs in material things
Out of compassion for you I have thought How shall my disciples be my heirs in Dhamma not my heirs in material things
Now bhikkhus suppose that I had eaten refused more food had my fill finished had enough had what I needed and some almsfood was left over to be thrown away
Then two bhikkhus arrived hungry and weak and I told them
Eat if you like if you do not eat then I shall throw it away where there is no greenery or drop it into water where there is no life
Then one bhikkhu thought The Blessed One has eatenhad what he needed but there is this almsfood of the Blessed One left over to be thrown away
Now this almsfood is one of the material things
Suppose that instead of eating this almsfood I pass the night and day hungry and weak
And instead of eating that almsfood he passed that night and day hungry and weak
Then the second bhikkhu thought The Blessed One has eatenhad what he needed but there is this almsfood of the Blessed One left over to be thrown away
Why is that
Because that will for long conduce to his fewness of wishes contentment effacement easy support and arousal of energy
Therefore bhikkhus be my heirs in Dhamma not my heirs in material things
Out of compassion for you I have thought How shall my disciples be my heirs in Dhamma not my heirs in material things
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said this the Sublime One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling
Soon after he had left the venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus Friends bhikkhus
 Friend they replied
The venerable Sariputta said this
Indeed friend we would come from far away to learn from the venerable Sariputta the meaning of this statement
It would be good if the venerable Sariputta would explain the meaning of this statement Having heard it from him the bhikkhus will remember it
Then friends listen and attend closely to what I shall say
Yes friend the bhikkhus replied
The venerable Sariputta said this
Here disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded do not train in seclusion they do not abandon what the Teacher tells them to abandon they are luxurious and careless leaders in backsliding neglectful of seclusion
In this the elder bhikkhus are to be blamed for three reasons
As disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded they do not train in seclusion they are to be blamed for this first reason
They do not abandon what the Teacher tells them to abandon they are to be blamed for this second reason
They are luxurious and careless leaders in backsliding neglectful of seclusion they are to be blamed for this third reason
The elder bhikkhus are to be blamed for these three reasons
In this the middle bhikkhus are to be blamed for three reasons As disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded they do not train in seclusion they are to be blamed for this first reason They do not abandon what the Teacher tells them to abandon they are to be blamed for this second reason They are luxurious and careless leaders in backsliding neglectful of seclusion they are to be blamed for this third reason The middle bhikkhus are to be blamed for these three reasons In this the new bhikkhus are to be blamed for three reasons
As disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded they do not train in seclusion they are to be blamed for this first reason
They do not abandon what the Teacher tells them to abandon they are to be blamed for this second reason
They are luxurious and careless leaders in backsliding neglectful of seclusion they are to be blamed for this third reason
The new bhikkhus are to be blamed for these three reasons
It is in this way that disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded do not train in seclusion
In what way friends do disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded train in seclusion
Here disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded train in seclusion they abandon what the Teacher tells them to abandon they are not luxurious and careless they are keen to avoid backsliding and are leaders in seclusion

That is what the venerable Sariputta said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the venerable Sariputtas words
Bhikkhus be my heirs in Dhamma not my heirs in material things
Bhikkhus I have eaten had what I needed but there is this almsfood of mine left over to be thrown away
if we do not eat it the Blessed One will throw it away
But this has been said by the Blessed One Bhikkhus be my heirs in Dhamma not my heirs in material things
Now although that bhikkhu by eating that almsfood passed the night and day neither hungry nor weak yet the first bhikkhu is more to be respected and commended by me
And after eating that almsfood he passed the night and day neither hungry nor weak
Suppose that I eat this almsfood and pass the night and day neither hungry nor weak
Friends in what way do disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded not train in seclusion And in what way do disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded train in seclusion

Friends the evil herein is greed and hate
Revered Nāgasena what is the medicine shop of the Buddha the Blessed One
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park  Then the brahmin Janussoni went to the Blessed One
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side and said Master Gotama when clansmen have gone forth from the home life into homelessness out of faith in Master Gotama do they have Master Gotama for their leader their helper and their guide And do these people follow the example of Master Gotama
That is so brahmin that is so
When clansmen have gone forth from the home life into homelessness out of faith in me they have me for their leader their helper and their guide And these people follow my example
But Master Gotama remote junglethicket resting places in the forest are hard to endure seclusion is hard to practise and it is hard to enjoy solitude One would think the jungles must rob a bhikkhu of his mind if he has no concentration
That is so brahmin that is so
Remote junglethicket resting places in the forest are hard to endure seclusion is hard to practise and it is hard to enjoy solitude One would think the jungles must rob a bhikkhu of his mind if he has no concentration
Before my enlightenment while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta I too considered thus Remote junglethicket resting places in the forest are hard to endurethe jungles must rob a bhikkhu of his mind if he has no concentration
I considered thus Whenever recluses or brahmins unpurified in bodily conduct resort to remote junglethicket resting places in the forest then owing to the defect of their unpurified bodily conduct these good recluses and brahmins evoke unwholesome fear and dread
But I do not resort to remote junglethicket resting places in the forest unpurified in bodily conduct I am purified in bodily conduct
I resort to remote junglethicket resting places in the forest as one of the noble ones with bodily conduct purified
Seeing in myself this purity of bodily conduct I found great solace in dwelling in the forest
I considered thus Whenever recluses or brahmins unpurified in verbal conductunpurified in mental conductunpurified in livelihood resort to remote junglethicket resting places in the forestthey evoke unwholesome fear and dread
But
I am purified in livelihood I resort to remote junglethicket resting places in the forest as one of the noble ones with livelihood purified
Seeing in myself this purity of livelihood I found great solace in dwelling in the forest
I considered thus Whenever recluses or brahmins who are covetous and full of lust
with a mind of ill will and intentions of hate
overcome by sloth and torpor
overcome with restless and unpeaceful mind
I have a peaceful mind
uncertain and doubting
 given to selfpraise and disparagement of others
I am not given to selfpraise and disparagement of others
subject to alarm and terror
desirous of gain honour and renown
I have few wishes
lazy and wanting in energy
 unmindful and not fully aware
I am established in mindfulness
unconcentrated and with straying minds
I am possessed of concentration
I considered thus Whenever recluses or brahmins devoid of wisdom drivellers resort to remote junglethicket resting places in the forest then owing to the defect of their being devoid of wisdom and drivellers these good recluses and brahmins evoke unwholesome fear and dread
But I do not resort to remote junglethicket resting places in the forest devoid of wisdom a drivellerI am possessed of wisdom
I resort to remote junglethicket resting places in the forest as one of the noble ones possessed of wisdom
Seeing in myself this possession of wisdom I found great solace in dwelling in the forest
I considered thus There are the specially auspicious nights of the fourteenth the fifteenth and the eighth of the fortnight Now what if on such nights as these I were to dwell in such aweinspiring horrifying abodes as orchard shrines woodland shrines and tree shrines Perhaps I might encounter that fear and dread
And later on such specially auspicious nights as the fourteenth the fifteenth and the eighth of the fortnight I dwelt in such aweinspiring horrifying abodes as orchard shrines woodland shrines and tree shrines
And while I dwelt there a wild animal would come up to me or a peacock would knock off a branch or the wind would rustle the leaves I thought What now if this is the fear and dread coming 
I thought Why do I dwell always expecting fear and dread
What if I subdue that fear and dread while keeping the same posture that I am in when it comes upon me
I neither stood nor sat nor lay down till I had subdued that fear and dread
While I stood the fear and dread came upon me
There are brahmin some recluses and brahmins who perceive day when it is night and night when it is day
I say that on their part this is an abiding in delusion
But I perceive night when it is night and day when it is day
Rightly speaking were it to be said of anyone A being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the welfare and happiness of many out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of gods and humans it is of me indeed that rightly speaking this should be said
Tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established my body was tranquil and untroubled my mind concentrated and unified
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states I entered upon and abided in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
With the stilling of applied and sustained thought I entered upon and abided in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentration
With the fading away as well of rapture I abided in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body I entered upon and abided in the third jhana on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful
With the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief I entered upon and abided in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
When my concentrated mind was thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability I directed it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives
I recollected my manifold past lives that is one birth two births three births four births five births ten births twenty births thirty births forty births fifty births a hundred births a thousand births a hundred thousand births many aeons of worldcontraction many aeons of worldexpansion many aeons of worldcontraction and expansion There I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my nutriment such my experience of pleasure and pain such my lifeterm and passing away from there I reappeared elsewhere and there too I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my nutriment such my experience of pleasure and pain such my lifeterm and passing away from there I reappeared here
When it was liberated there came the knowledge It is liberated
I directly knew Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
Now brahmin it might be that you think Perhaps the recluse Gotama is not free from lust hate and delusion even today which is why he still resorts to remote junglethicket resting places in the forest
But you should not think thus
It is because I see two benefits that I still resort to remote junglethicket resting places in the forest I see a pleasant abiding for myself here and now and I have compassion for future generations
Indeed it is because Master Gotama is an Accomplished One a Fully Enlightened One that he has compassion for future generations
Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent Master Gotama
Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms
I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
I am uncovetous
I have a mind of lovingkindness
I am without sloth and torpor
I have gone beyond doubt
I am free from trepidation
I am energetic
While I walked the fear and dread came upon me
I neither walked nor sat nor lay down till I had subdued that fear and dread
I neither walked nor stood nor sat down till I had subdued that fear and dread
While I lay down the fear and dread came upon me
I neither walked nor stood nor lay down till I had subdued that fear and dread
While I sat the fear and dread came upon me
Thus with their aspects and particulars I recollected my manifold past lives
This was the first true knowledge attained by me in the first watch of the night Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose darkness was banished and light arose as happens in one who abides diligent ardent and resolute
When my concentrated mind was thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability I directed it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings
With the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I saw beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate I understood how beings pass on according to their actions thus These worthy beings who were illconducted in body speech and mind revilers of noble ones wrong in their views giving effect to wrong view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a state of deprivation in a bad destination in perdition even in hell
but these worthy beings who were wellconducted in body speech and mind not revilers of noble ones right in their views giving effect to right view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a good destination even in the heavenly world
Thus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human I saw beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and I understood how beings pass on according to their actions
This was the second true knowledge attained by me in the second watch of the night Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose darkness was banished and light arose as happens in one who abides diligent ardent and resolute
When my concentrated mind was thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability I directed it to knowledge of the destruction of the taints
I directly knew as it actually is This is suffering I directly knew as it actually is This is the origin of suffering I directly knew as it actually is This is the cessation of suffering I directly knew as it actually is This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering
I directly knew as it actually is These are the taints I directly knew as it actually is This is the origin of the taints I directly knew as it actually is This is the cessation of the taints I directly knew as it actually is This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints
When I knew and saw thus my mind was liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignorance
This was the third true knowledge attained by me in the third watch of the night Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose darkness was banished and light arose as happens in one who abides diligent ardent and resolute
and exchanged greetings with him
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
There the venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus Friends bhikkhus
 Friend they replied
The venerable Sariputta said this
What four
Here some person with a blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus I have a blemish in myself
Here some person with a blemish understands it as it actually is thus I have a blemish in myself
Here some person with no blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus I have no blemish in myself
Here some person with no blemish understands it as it actually is thus I have no blemish in myself
Herein the person with a blemish who does not understand it as it actually is thus I have a blemish in myself is called the inferior of these two persons with a blemish
Herein the person with a blemish who understands it as it actually is thus I have a blemish in myself is called the superior of these two persons with a blemish
Herein the person with no blemish who does not understand it as it actually is thus I have no blemish is called the inferior of these two persons with no blemish
Herein the person with no blemish who understands it as it actually is thus I have no blemish is called the superior of these two persons with no blemish
When this was said the venerable Maha Moggallana asked the venerable Sariputta
What is the cause and reason why of these two persons with no blemish one is called the inferior man and one is called the superior man
Herein friend when a person with a blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus I have a blemish in myself it can be expected that he will not arouse zeal make effort or instigate energy to abandon that blemish and that he will die with lust hate and delusion with a blemish with mind defiled
Suppose a bronze dish were brought from a shop or a smithy covered with dirt and stains
 Yes friend
 So too friend when a person with a blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus I have a blemish in myself it can be expected that he will die with mind defiled
Herein when a person with a blemish understands it as it actually is thus I have a blemish in myself it can be expected that he will arouse zeal make effort and instigate energy to abandon that blemish and that he will die without lust hate and delusion without blemish with mind undefiled
Suppose a bronze dish were brought from a shop or a smithy covered with dirt and stains
and the owners had it cleaned and did not put it in a dusty corner
 Yes friend
 So too friend when a person with a blemish understands it as it actually is thus I have a blemish in myself it can be expected that he will die with mind undefiled
Herein when a person with no blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus I have no blemish in myself it can be expected that he will give attention to the sign of the beautiful that by his doing so lust will infect his mind and that he will die with lust hate and delusion with a blemish with mind defiled
Suppose a bronze dish were brought from a shop or smithy clean and bright
Would the bronze dish thus get more defiled and more stained later on
 Yes friend
 So too friend when a person with no blemish does not understand it as it actually is thus I have no blemish in myself it can be expected that he will die with mind defiled
Herein when a person with no blemish understands it as it actually is thus I have no blemish in myself it can be expected that he will not give attention to the sign of the beautiful that by his not doing so lust will not infect his mind and that he will die without lust hate and delusion without blemish with mind undefiled
Suppose a bronze dish were brought from a shop or smithy clean and bright
Would the bronze dish thus get cleaner and brighter later on
 Yes friend
 So too friend when a person with no blemish understands it as it actually is thus I have no blemish in myself it can be expected that he will die with mind undefiled
This is the cause and reason why of these two persons with a blemish one is called the inferior man and one is called the superior man
This is the cause and reason why of these two persons with no blemish one is called the inferior man and one is called the superior man
Blemish blemish is said friend
Blemish friend is a term for the spheres of evil unwholesome wishes
It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish If I commit an offence let the bhikkhus not know that I have committed an offence
And it is possible that the bhikkhus come to know that that bhikkhu has committed an offence
So he is angry and bitter thus The bhikkhus know I have committed an offence
The anger and bitterness are both a blemish
It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish I have committed an offence The bhikkhus should admonish me in private not in the midst of the Sangha
And it is possible that the bhikkhus admonish that bhikkhu in the midst of the Sangha not in private
So he is angry and bitter thus The bhikkhus admonish me in the midst of the Sangha not in private
The anger and bitterness are both a blemish
It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish I have committed an offence A person who is my equal should admonish me not a person who is not my equal
And it is possible that a person not his equal admonishes him not a person his equal
So he is angry and bitter thus A person not my equal admonishes me not a person my equal
The anger and bitterness are both a blemish
It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish Oh that the Teacher might teach the Dhamma to the bhikkhus by asking a series of questions of me not of some other bhikkhu
And it is possible that the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus by asking a series of questions of some other bhikkhu not of that bhikkhu
So he is angry and bitter thus The Teacher teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus by asking a series of questions of some other bhikkhu not of me
The anger and bitterness are both a blemish
It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish Oh that the bhikkhus might enter the village for alms putting me in the forefront not some other bhikkhu
And it is possible that the bhikkhus enter the village for alms putting some other bhikkhu in the forefront not that bhikkhu
So he is angry and bitter thus The bhikkhus enter the village for alms putting some other bhikkhu in the forefront not me
The anger and bitterness are both a blemish
It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish Oh that I might get the best seat the best water the best almsfood in the refectory not some other bhikkhu
And it is possible that some other bhikkhu gets the best seat
It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish Oh that I might give the blessing in the refectory after the meal not some other bhikkhu
And it is possible that some other bhikkhu gives the blessing
And it is possible that some other bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma
Why is that
Because the spheres of these evil unwholesome wishes are seen and heard to be unabandoned in that venerable one
Suppose a metal bowl were brought from a shop or a smithy clean and bright
Then raising the lid and uncovering it they looked in
So too if the spheres of these evil unwholesome wishes are seen and heard to be unabandoned in any bhikkhu then for all he may be a forest dweller unabandoned in that venerable one
If the spheres of these evil unwholesome wishes are seen and heard to be abandoned in any bhikkhu then for all he may be a village dweller an acceptor of invitations a wearer of robes given him by householders yet his fellows in the holy life honour respect revere and venerate him
Why is that
Because the spheres of these evil unwholesome wishes are seen and heard to be abandoned in that venerable one
Suppose a metal bowl were brought from a shop or a smithy clean and bright
Then raising the lid and uncovering it they looked in
So too friend if the spheres of these evil unwholesome wishes are seen and heard to be abandoned in any bhikkhu then for all he may be a village dweller abandoned in that venerable one
When this was said the venerable Maha Moggallana said to the venerable Sariputta A simile occurs to me friend Sariputta
 State it friend Moggallana
 On one occasion friend I was living at the Hill Fort at Rajagaha
Then when it was morning I dressed and taking my bowl and outer robe I went into Rajagaha for alms
Then this thought arose in the Ajlvaka Panduputtas mind Oh that this Samiti the cartwrights son might plane this bend this twist this fault out of the felloe so that it would be without bends twists or faults and come to consist purely of heartwood
And just as this thought came to pass in his mind so did Samiti the cartwrights son plane that bend that twist that fault out of the felloe
Then the Ajlvaka Panduputta son of a former cartwright was glad and he voiced his gladness thus He planes just as if he knew my heart with his heart
So too friend there are persons who are faithless and have gone forth from the home life into homelessness not out of faith but seeking a livelihood who are fraudulent deceitful treacherous haughty hollow personally vain roughtongued loosespoken unguarded in their sense faculties immoderate in eating undevoted to wakefulness unconcerned with recluseship not greatly respectful of training luxurious careless leaders in backsliding neglectful of seclusion lazy wanting in energy unmindful not fully aware unconcentrated with straying minds devoid of wisdom drivellers The venerable Sariputta with his discourse on the Dhamma planes out their faults just as if he knew my heart with his heart
But there are clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness who are not fraudulent deceitful treacherous haughty hollow personally vain roughtongued or loosespoken who are guarded in their sense faculties moderate in eating devoted to wakefulness concerned with recluseship greatly respectful of training not luxurious or careless who are keen to avoid backsliding leaders in seclusion energetic resolute established in mindfulness fully aware concentrated with unified minds possessing wisdom not drivellers These on hearing the venerable Sariputtas discourse on the Dhamma drink it in and eat it as it were by word and thought Good indeed it is that he makes his fellows in the holy life emerge from the unwholesome and establish themselves in the wholesome
Just as a woman  or a man  young youthful fond of adornments with head bathed having received a garland of lotuses jasmine or roses would take it with both hands and place it on the head so too there are clansmen who have gone forth out of faithnot drivellers These on hearing the venerable Sariputtas discourse on the Dhamma drink it in and eat it as it were by word and thought Good indeed it is that he makes his fellows in the holy life emerge from the unwholesome and establish themselves in the wholesome
Thus it was that these two great beings rejoiced in each others good words
Friends there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world
Friend Sariputta what is the cause and reason why of these two persons with a blemish one is called the inferior man and one is called the superior man
Would the bronze dish thus get more defiled and stained later on
and the owners neither used it nor had it cleaned but put it away in a dusty corner
Would the bronze dish thus get cleaner and brighter later on
and the owners neither used it nor had it cleaned but put it in a dusty corner
and the owners used it and had it cleaned and did not put it in a dusty corner
but what is this word blemish a term for
Blemish friend is a term for the spheres of these evil unwholesome wishes
The anger and the bitterness are both a blemish
If the spheres of these evil unwholesome wishes are seen and heard to be unabandoned in any bhikkhu then for all he may be a forest dweller a frequenter of remote abodes an almsfood eater a housetohouse seeker a refuserag wearer a wearer of rough robes still his fellows in the holy life do not honour respect revere and venerate him
So he is angry and bitter thus Another bhikkhu is the one to get superior medicinal requisites not me
And it is possible that some other bhikkhu is the one to get superior medicinal requisites not that bhikkhu
superior almsfood a superior resting placesuperior medicinal requisites not some other bhikkhu
It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish Oh that I might be the one to get a superior robe
visiting the monastery not some other bhikkhu
women lay followers
that I might teach the Dhamma to the bhikkhunis men lay followers
It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish Oh that I might teach the Dhamma to the bhikkhus
It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish Oh that the bhikkhus bhikkhumsmen lay followerswomen lay followers might honour respect revere and venerate me not some other bhikkhu
And it is possible that they honoursome other bhikkhu
and the owners put the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human being in it and covering it with another bowl went back to the market
then people seeing it said What is that you are carrying about like a treasure
and as soon as they saw they were inspired with such loathing repugnance and disgust that even those who were hungry would not want to eat not to speak of those who were full
then people seeing it said What is that you are carrying about like a treasure
and the owners put clean boiled rice and various soups and sauces into it and covering it with another bowl went back to the market
and as soon as they saw they were inspired with such liking appetite and relish that even those who were full would want to eat not to speak of those who were hungry
Now on that occasion Samiti the cartwrights son was planing a felloe
and the Ajlvaka Panduputta son of a former cartwright was standing by
Revered Nāgasena what is the nectar shop of the Buddha the Blessed One
Revered Nāgasena what is the jewel shop of the Buddha the Blessed One
What sire is the Blessed Ones jewel of the analytical knowledges
But have your teachers ever seen the Buddha
Revered Nāgasena what is the Blessed Ones general shop
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park

So it was with reference to this that it was said Bhikkhus dwell possessed of virtue possessed of the Patimokkha restrained with the restraint of the Patimokkha perfect in conduct and resort and seeing fear in the slightest fault train by undertaking the training precepts
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words

If a bhikkhu should wish May I wield the various kinds of supernormal power having been one may I become many having been many may I become one may I appear and vanish may I go unhindered through a wall through an enclosure through a mountain as though through space may I dive in and out of the earth as though it were water may I walk on water without sinking as though it were earth seated crosslegged may I travel in space like a bird with my hand may I touch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and mighty may I wield bodily mastery even as far as the Brahmaworld let him fulfil the precepts

THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
Why is that
Because of the impurity of the cloth
So too when the mind is defiled an unhappy destination may be expected
Bhikkhus suppose a cloth were pure and bright and a dyer dipped it in some dye or other whether blue or yellow or red or pink it would look welldyed and pure in colour
Why is that
Because of the purity of the cloth
So too when the mind is undefiled a happy destination may be expected
What bhikkhus are the imperfections that defile the mind
Covetousness and unrighteous greed is an imperfection that defiles the mind Ill willangerrevengecontempta domineering attitudeenvyavaricedeceitfraudobstinacy presumptionconceitarrogancevanity negligence is an imperfection that defiles the mind
Knowing that covetousness and unrighteous greed is an imperfection that defiles the mind a bhikkhu abandons it Knowing that ill will negligence is an imperfection that defiles the mind a bhikkhu abandons it
When a bhikkhu has known that covetousness and unrighteous greed is an imperfection that defiles the mind and has abandoned it when a bhikkhu has known that ill will negligence is an imperfection that defiles the mind and has abandoned it
When he has given up expelled released abandoned and relinquished the imperfections of the mind in part he considers thus I am possessed of perfect confidence in the Buddha and he gains inspiration in the meaning gains inspiration in the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the Dhamma When he is glad rapture is born in him in one who is rapturous the body becomes tranquil one whose body is tranquil feels pleasure in one who feels pleasure the mind becomes concentrated  He considers thus I am possessed of perfect confidence in the Dhamma and he gains inspiration in the meaning gains inspiration in the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the Dhamma When he is gladthe mind becomes concentrated  He considers thus I am possessed of perfect confidence in the Sangha and he gains inspiration in the meaning gains inspiration in the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the Dhamma When he is glad the mind becomes concentrated
He considers thus The imperfections of the mind have in part been given up expelled released abandoned and relinquished by me and he gains inspiration in the meaning gains inspiration in the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the Dhamma
When he is glad rapture is born in him in one who is rapturous the body becomes tranquil one whose body is tranquil feels pleasure in one who feels pleasure the mind becomes concentrated
Bhikkhus if a bhikkhu of such virtue such a state of concentration and such wisdom eats almsfood consisting of choice hill rice along with various sauces and curries even that will be no obstacle for him
Just as a cloth that is defiled and stained becomes pure and bright with the help of clear water or just as gold becomes pure and bright with the help of a furnace so too if a bhikkhu of such virtueeats almsfoodthat will be no obstacle for him
He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with lovingkindness abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill will
He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion with a mind imbued with appreciative joy with a mind imbued with equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
He understands thus There is this there is the inferior there is the superior and beyond there is an escape from this whole field of perception
When he knows and sees thus his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignorance
When it is liberated there comes the knowledge It is liberated
He understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
Bhikkhus this bhikkhu is called one bathed with the inner bathing
Now on that occasion the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja was sitting not far from the Blessed One
Then he said to the Blessed One But does Master Gotama go to the Bahuka River to bathe
Why brahmin go to the Bahuka River
What can the Bahuka River do
Master Gotama the Bahuka River is held by many to give liberation it is held by many to give merit and many wash away their evil actions in the Bahuka River
Then the Blessed One addressed the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja in stanzas
When this was said the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja said Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama
Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many Ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms
I would receive the going forth under Master Gotama I would receive the full admission
And the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja received the going forth under the Blessed One and he received the full admission
And soon not long after his full admission dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute the venerable Bharadvaja by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
He directly knew Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
And the venerable Bharadvaja became one of the arahants
Bhikkhus suppose a cloth were defiled and stained and a dyer dipped it in some dye or other whether blue or yellow or red or pink it would look poorly dyed and impure in colour
this Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation the unsurpassed field of merit for the world
he acquires perfect confidence in the Buddha thus The Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable leader of persons to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed  He acquires perfect confidence in the Dhamma thus The Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One visible here and now immediately effective inviting inspection onward leading to be experienced by the wise for themselves  He acquires perfect confidence in the Sangha thus The Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples is practising the good way practising the straight way practising the true way practising the proper way that is the four pairs of persons the eight types of individuals
Bahuka and Adhikakka Gaya and Sundarika too
Payaga and Sarassati And the stream Bahumati 
A fool may there forever bathe Yet will not purify dark deeds
What can the Sundarika bring to pass What the Payaga What the Bahuka
They cannot purify an evildoer A man who has done cruel and brutal deeds
One pure in heart has evermore The Feast of Spring the Holy Day
One fair in act one pure in heart Brings his virtue to perfection
It is here brahmin that you should bathe To make yourself a refuge for all beings
And if you speak no falsehood Nor work harm for living beings
Nor take what is offered not With faith and free from avarice
What need for you to go to Gaya For any well will be your Gaya
I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
so above below around and everywhere and to all as to himself he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind imbued with equanimity abundant exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill will
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Then when it was evening the venerable Maha Cunda rose from meditation and went to the Blessed OneAfter paying homage to the Blessed One he sat down at one side
and said to him  Venerable sir various views arise in the world associated either with doctrines of a self or with doctrines about the world Now does the abandoning and relinquishing of those views come about in a bhikkhu who is attending only to the beginning of his meditative training
Cunda as to those various views that arise in the world asso ciated either with doctrines of a self or with doctrines about the world if the object in relation to which those views arise which they underlie and which they are exercised upon is seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self then the abandoning and relinquishing of those views comes about
  It is possible here Cunda that quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
He might think thus I am abiding in effacement
But it is not these attainments that are called effacement in the Noble Ones Discipline
It is possible here that with the stilling of applied and sustained thought some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentration
He might think thus I am abiding in effacement
But
It is possible here that with the fading away as well of rapture some bhikkhu abides in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body he enters upon and abides in the third jhana on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful
He might think thus I am abiding in effacement
But
It is possible here that with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
He might think thus I am abiding in effacement
But it is not these attainments that are called effacement in the Noble Ones Discipline
It is possible here that with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite space
He might think thus I am abiding in effacement
But it is not these attainments that are called effacement in the Noble Ones Discipline
It is possible here that by completely surmounting the base of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness
He might think thus I am abiding in effacement
But
It is possible here that by completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness
He might think thus I am abiding in effacement
But
It is possible here that by completely surmounting the base of nothingness some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception
He might think thus I am abiding in effacement
But these attainments are not called effacement in the Noble Ones Discipline

Others will adhere to their own views hold on to them tenaciously and relinquish them with difficulty we shall not adhere to our own views or hold on to them tenaciously but shall relinquish them easily effacement should be practised thus
  Cunda I say that even the inclination of mind towards wholesome states is of great benefit so what should be said of bodily and verbal acts conforming to such a state of mind
Therefore Cunda Mind should be inclined thus Others will be cruel we shall not be cruel here
Mind should be inclined thus Others will kill living beings we shall abstain from killing living beings here Mind should be inclined thus Mind should be inclined thus Others will adhere to their own views hold on to them tenaciously and relinquish them with difficulty we shall not adhere to our own views or hold on to them tenaciously but shall relinquish them easily
  Cunda suppose there were an uneven path and another even path by which to avoid it and suppose there were an uneven ford and another even ford by which to avoid it So too A person given to cruelty has noncruelty by which to avoid it One given to killing living beings has abstention from killing living beings by which to avoid it One given to taking what is not given has abstention from taking what is not given by which to avoid it One given to be uncelibate has celibacy by which to avoid it One given to false speech has abstention from false speech by which to avoid it One given to malicious speech has abstention from malicious speech by which to avoid it One given to harsh speech has abstention from harsh speech by which to avoid it One given to gossip has abstention from gossip by which to avoid it One given to covetousness has uncovetousness by which to avoid it One given to ill will has nonill will by which to avoid it One given to wrong view has right view by which to avoid it One given to wrong intention has right intention by which to avoid it  One given to wrong speech has right speech by which to avoid it One given to wrong action has right action by which to avoid it One given to wrong livelihood has right livelihood by which to avoid it One given to wrong effort has right effort by which to avoid it One given to wrong mindfulness has right mindfulness by which to avoid it One given to wrong concentration has right concentration by which to avoid it One given to wrong knowledge has right knowledge by which to avoid it One given to wrong deliverance has right deliverance by which to avoid it

  Cunda just as all unwholesome states lead downwards and all wholesome states lead upwards so too A person given to cruelty has noncruelty to lead him upwards One given to killing living beings has abstention from killing living beings to lead him upwards One given toto lead him upwards One given to adhere to his own views who holds on to them tenaciously and relinquishes them with difficulty has nonadherence to his own views not holding on to them tenaciously and relinquishing them easily to lead him upwards
  Cunda that one who is himself sinking in the mud should pull out another who is sinking in the mud is impossible
So too A person given to cruelty has noncruelty by which to extinguish it
One given to killing living beings has abstention from killing living beings by which to extinguish it
 One given toby which to extinguish it
these are called pleasant abidings here and now in the Noble Ones Discipline
these are called pleasant abidings here and now in the Noble Ones Discipline
these are called pleasant abidings here and now in the Noble Ones Discipline
these are called pleasant abidings here and now in the Noble Ones Discipline

Others will be cruel we shall not be cruel here effacement should be practised thus
that one who is himself tamed disciplined with defilements extinguished should tame another discipline him and help extinguish his defilements is possible
That one who is himself untamed undisciplined with defilements unextinguished should tame another discipline him and help extinguish his defilements is impossible
that one who is not himself sinking in the mud should pull out another who is sinking in the mud is possible

What should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them that I have done for you Cunda
That is what the Blessed One said
The venerable Maha Cunda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
There are these roots of trees these empty huts Meditate Cunda do not delay or else you will regret it later This is our instruction to you
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the venerable Maha Moggallana was living in the Bhagga country at Sumsumaragira in the Bhesakala Grove the Deer Park
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Friends bhikkhus
 Friend they replied
The venerable Maha Moggallana said this
What qualities make him difficult to admonish
Here a bhikkhu has evil wishes and is dominated by evil wishes
Again a bhikkhu lauds himself and disparages others
Again a bhikkhu is angry and is overcome by anger
Friends though a bhikkhu asks thus Let the venerable ones admonish me need to be admonished by the venerable ones yet if he is difficult to admonish and possesses qualities that make him difficult to admonish if he is impatient and does not take instruction rightly then his companions in the holy life think that he should not be admonished or instructed they think of him as a person not to be trusted
this is a quality that makes him difficult to admonish
this is a quality that makes him difficult to admonish
this is a quality
Again a bhikkhu is angry and revengeful because of anger
Again a bhikkhu is angry and stubborn because of anger
Again a bhikkhu is angry and he utters words bordering on anger
Again a bhikkhu is reproved and he resists the reprover
Again a bhikkhu is reproved and he denigrates the reprover
Again a bhikkhu is reproved and he counterreproves the reprover
Again a bhikkhu is reproved and he prevaricates leads the talk aside and shows anger hate and bitterness
Again a bhikkhu is reproved and he fails to account for his conduct
Again a bhikkhu is contemptuous and domineering
Again a bhikkhu is envious and avaricious
Again a bhikkhu is fraudulent and deceitful
Again a bhikkhu is obstinate and arrogant
Again a bhikkhu adheres to his own views holds on to them tenaciously and relinquishes them with difficulty
this is a quality that makes him difficult to admonish
Friends these are called the qualities that make him difficult to admonish
Friends though a bhikkhu does not ask thus Let the venerable ones admonish me I need to be admonished by the venerable ones yet if he is easy to admonish and possesses qualities that make him easy to admonish if he is patient and takes instruction rightly then his companions in the holy life think that he should be admonished and instructed and they think of him as a person to be trusted
What qualities make him easy to admonish
Here a bhikkhu has no evil wishes and is not dominated by evil wishes
this is a quality that makes him easy to admonish
Again a bhikkhu does not laud himself nor disparage others
this is a quality
He is not angry nor allows anger to overcome him
He is not angry or revengeful because of anger
He is not angry or stubborn because of anger
He is not angry and he does not utter words bordering on anger
He is reproved and he does not resist the reprover
He is reproved and he does not denigrate the reprover
He is reproved and he does not counterreprove the reprover
He is reproved and he does not prevaricate lead the talk aside and show anger hate and bitterness
He is reproved and he does not fail to account for his conduct
He is not contemptuous or domineering
He is not envious or avaricious
He is not fraudulent or deceitful
He is not obstinate or arrogant
Again a bhikkhu does not adhere to his own views or hold on to them tenaciously and he relinquishes them easily
this is a quality that makes him easy to admonish
Friends these are called the qualities that make him easy to admonish
Now friends a bhikkhu ought to infer about himself in the following way A person with evil wishes and dominated by evil wishes is displeasing and disagreeable to me If I were to have evil wishes and be dominated by evil wishes I would be displeasing and disagreeable to others
A bhikkhu who knows this should arouse his mind thus I shall not have evil wishes and be dominated by evil wishes
 A person who lauds himself and disparages others
A person who adheres to his own views holds on to them tenaciously and relinquishes them with difficulty is displeasing and disagreeable to me If I were to adhere to my own views hold on to them tenaciously and relinquish them with difficulty I would be displeasing and disagreeable to others
A bhikkhu who knows this should arouse his mind thus I shall not adhere to my own views hold on to them tenaciously and I shall relinquish them easily
Now friends a bhikkhu should review himself thus Do I have evil wishes and am I dominated by evil wishes 
If when he reviews himself he knows I have evil wishes I am dominated by evil wishes then he should make an effort to abandon those evil unwholesome states
But if when he reviews himself he knows I have no evil wishes I am not dominated by evil wishes then he can abide happy and glad training day and night in wholesome states
 Again a bhikkhu should review himself thus Do I praise myself and disparage others 
Do I adhere to my own views hold on to them tenaciously and relinquish them with difficulty 
If when he reviews himself he knows I adhere to my own views then he should make an effort to abandon those evil unwholesome states
But if when he reviews himself he knows I do not adhere to my own views then he can abide happy and glad training day and night in wholesome states
Friends when a bhikkhu reviews himself thus if he sees that these evil unwholesome states are not all abandoned in himself then he should make an effort to abandon them all
But if when he reviews himself thus he sees that they are all abandoned in himself then he can abide happy and glad training day and night in wholesome states
Just as when a woman  or a man  young youthful fond of ornaments on viewing the image of her own face in a clear bright mirror or in a basin of clear water sees a smudge or a blemish on it she makes an effort to remove it but if she sees no smudge or blemish on it she becomes glad thus It is a gain for me that it is clean
so too when a bhikkhu reviews himself thus
then he can abide happy and glad training day and night in wholesome states
That is what the venerable Maha Moggallana said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the venerable Maha Moggallanas words
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this  Bhikkhus I shall teach you a discourse on jungle thickets Listen and attend closely to what I shall say
 Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives in some jungle thicket
While he is living there his unestablished mindfulness does not become established his unconcentrated mind does not become concentrated his undestroyed taints do not come to destruction he does not attain the unattained supreme security from bondage
and also the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forth  robes almsfood resting place and medicinal requisites  are hard to come by
The bhikkhu should consider thus I am living in this jungle thicket While I am living here my unestablished mindfulness does not become established I do not attain the unattained supreme security from bondage
and also the requisites of life are hard to come by
That bhikkhu should depart from that jungle thicket that very night or that very day he should not continue living there
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives in some jungle thicket
While he is living there his unestablished mindfulness does not become established his unconcentrated mind does not become concentrated his undestroyed taints do not come to destruction he does not attain the unattained supreme security from bondage
yet the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forthare easy to come by
The bhikkhu should consider thus I am living in this jungle thicket
yet the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forthare easy to come by
However I did not go forth from the home life jnto homelessness for the sake of robes almsfood resting place and medicinal requisites
Having reflected thus that bhikkhu should depart from that jungle thicket he should not continue living there
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives in some jungle thicket
Moreover while I am living here my unestablished mindfulness does not become established I do not attain the unattained supreme security from bondage
While I am living here my unestablished mindfulness does not become established I do not attain the unattained supreme security from bondage
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives in some jungle thicket
Having reflected thus that bhikkhu should continue living in that jungle thicket he should not depart
Moreover while I am living here my unestablished mindfulness has become established I have attained the unattained supreme security from bondage
However I did not go forth from the home life into homelessness for the sake of robes almsfood resting place and medicinal requisites
yet the requisites of lifeare hard to come by
While I am living here my unestablished mindfulness has become established I have attained the unattained supreme security from bondage
The bhikkhu should consider thus I am living in this jungle thicket
yet the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forth are hard to come by
While he is living there his unestablished mindfulness becomes established his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated his undestroyed taints come to destruction he attains the unattained supreme security from bondage
That bhikkhu should continue living in that jungle thicket as long as life lasts he should not depart
and also the requisites of lifeare easy to come by
While I am living here my unestablished mindfulness has become establishedI have attained the unattained supreme security from bondage
The bhikkhu should consider thus I am living in this jungle thicket
and also the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forth  robes almsfood resting place and medicinal requisites  are easy to come by
While he is living there his unestablished mindfulness becomes established his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated his undestroyed taints come to destruction he attains the unattained supreme security from bondage
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain village  Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain town  Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain city  Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain country  Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain person
That bhikkhu should depart from that person without taking leave he should not continue following him
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain person
Having reflected thus that bhikkhu should depart from that person after taking leave he should not continue following him
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain personas in 
Having reflected thus that bhikkhu should continue following that person he should not depart from him
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain person
That bhikkhu should continue following that person as long as life lasts he should not depart from him even if told to go away
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Now on that occasion the venerable Kumara Kassapa was living in the Blind Mens Grove
Then when the night was well advanced a certain deity of beautiful appearance who illuminated the whole of the Blind Mens Grove approached the venerable Kumara Kassapa and stood at one side
So standing the deity said to him
Thus spoke the brahmin Delve with the knife thou wise one
Delving with the knife the wise one saw a bar A bar O venerable sir
Thus spoke the brahmin Throw out the bar delve with the knife thou wise one
Delving with the knife the wise one saw a toad
Thus spoke the brahmin Throw out the toad delve with the knife thou wise one
Delving with the knife the wise one saw a fork
Those spoke the brahmin Throw out the fork delve with the knife thou wise one
Delving with the knife the wise one saw a sieve
Thus spoke the brahmin Throw out the sieve delve with the knife thou wise one
Delving with the knife the wise one saw a tortoise
Thus spoke the brahmin Throw out the tortoise delve with the knife thou wise one
Delving with the knife the wise one saw an axe and block
Thus spoke the brahmin Throw out the axe and block delve with the knife thou wise one
Delving with the knife the wise one saw a piece of meat
Thus spoke the brahmin Throw out the piece of meat delve with the knife thou wise one
Delving with the knife the wise one saw a Naga serpent
Thus spoke the brahmin Leave the Naga serpent do not harm the Naga serpent honour the Naga serpent
Bhikkhu you should go to the Blessed One and ask him about this riddle As the Blessed One tells you so should you remember it
Bhikkhu other than the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata or one who has learned it from them I see no one in this world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmins its princes and its people whose explanation of this riddle might satisfy the mind
That is what was said by the deity who thereupon vanished at once
Then when the night was over the venerable Kumara Kassapa went to the Blessed One After paying homage to him he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One what had occurred
Then he asked Venerable sir Who is the brahmin who the wise one
Bhikkhu the anthill is a symbol for this body made of material form consisting of the four great elements procreated by a mother and father built up out of boiled rice and porridge and subject to impermanence to being worn and rubbed away to dissolution and disintegration
What one thinks and ponders by night based upon ones actions during the day is the fuming by night
The actions one undertakes during the day by body speech and mind after thinking and pondering by night is the flaming by day
The brahmin is a symbol for the Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened
The wise one is a symbol for a bhikkhu in higher training
The knife is a symbol for noble wisdom
The delving is a symbol for the arousing of energy
The bar is a symbol for ignorance
Throw out the bar abandon ignorance Delve with the knife thou wise one This is the meaning

The tortoise is a symbol for the five aggregates affected by clinging namely the material form aggregate affected by clinging the feeling aggregate affected by clinging the perception aggregate affected by clinging the formations aggregate affected by clinging and the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging

The axe and block is a symbol for the five cords of sensual pleasure forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust sounds cognizable by the earodours cognizable by the noseflavours cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust
Throw out the axe and block abandon the five cords of sensual pleasure Delve with the knife thou wise one This is the meaning
The piece of meat is a symbol for delight and lust
Throw out the piece of meat abandon delight and lust Delve with the knife thou wise one This is the meaning
The Naga serpent is a symbol for a bhikkhu who has destroyed the taints
Leave the Naga serpent do not harm the Naga serpent honour the Naga serpent This is the meaning
That is what the Blessed One said
The venerable Kumara Kassapa was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Bhikkhu bhikkhu this anthill fumes by night and flames by day
A toad O venerable sir
A fork O venerable sir
A sieve O venerable sir
A tortoise O venerable sir
An axe and block O venerable sir
A piece of meat O venerable sir
A Naga serpent O venerable sir
what is the anthill what the fuming by night what the flaming by day What is the knife what the delving what the bar what the toad what the fork what the sieve what the tortoise what the axe and block what the piece of meat what the Naga serpent
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
Then a number of bhikkhus from the Blessed Ones native land who had spent the Rains there went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him sat down at one side
Bhikkhus who in my native land is esteemed by the bhikkhus there by his companions in the holy life in this way Having few wishes himself he talks to the bhikkhus on fewness of wishes content himself he talks to the bhikkhus on contentment secluded himself he talks to the bhikkhus on seclusion aloof from society himself he talks to the bhikkhus on aloofness from society energetic himself he talks to the bhikkhus on arousing energy attained to virtue himself he talks to the bhikkhus on the attainment of virtue attained to concentration himself he talks to the bhikkhus on the attainment of concentration attained to wisdom himself he talks to the bhikkhus on the attainment of wisdom attained to deliverance himself he talks to the bhikkhus on the attainment of deliverance attained to the knowledge and vision of deliverance himself he talks to the bhikkhus on the attainment of the knowledge and vision of deliverancehe is one who advises informs instructs urges rouses and encourages his companions in the holy life
Venerable sir the venerable Punna Mantaniputta is so esteemed in the Blessed Ones native land by the bhikkhus there by his companions in the holy life
Now on that occasion the venerable Sariputta was seated near the Blessed One
Then it occurred to the venerable Sariputta It is a gain for the venerable Punna Mantaniputta it is a great gain for him that his wise companions in the holy life praise him point by point in the Teachers presence
Perhaps sometime or other we might meet the venerable Punna Mantaniputta and have some conversation with him
Then when the Blessed One had stayed at Rajagaha as long as he chose he set out to wander by stages to Savatthi
and there he lived in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
The venerable Punna Mantaniputta heard The Blessed One has arrived at Savatthi and is living in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Then the venerable Punna Mantaniputta set his resting place in order and taking his outer robe and bowl set out to wander by stages to Savatthl
Wandering by stages he eventually arrived at Savatthl and went to Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park to see the Blessed One
After paying homage to the Blessed One he sat down at one side and the Blessed One instructed urged roused and encouraged him with talk on the Dhamma
Then the venerable Punna Mantaniputta instructed urged roused and encouraged by the Blessed Ones talk on the Dhamma delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed Ones words rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he went to the Blind Mens Grove for the days abiding
Then a certain bhikkhu went to the venerable Sariputta and said to him Friend Sariputta the bhikkhu Purina Mantaniputta of whom you have always spoken highly has just been instructed urged roused and encouraged by the Blessed One with talk on the Dhamma after delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed Ones words he rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One keeping him on his right he has gone to the Blind Mens Grove for the days abiding
Then the venerable Sariputta quickly picked up a mat and followed close behind the venerable Punna Mantaniputta keeping his head in sight
Then the venerable Punna Mantaniputta entered the Blind Mens Grove and sat down for the days abiding at the root of a tree
The venerable Sariputta also entered the Blind Mens Grove and sat down for the days abiding at the root of a tree
Then when it was evening the venerable Sariputta rose from meditation went to the venerable Punna Mantaniputta and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
 Yes friend
 But friend is it for the sake of purification of virtue that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One
 No friend
 Then is it for the sake of purification of mind that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One
 No friend
 Then is it for the sake of purification of view that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One
 No friend
 Then is it for the sake of purification by overcoming doubt that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One
 No friend
 Then is it for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One
 No friend
 Then is it for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of the way that the holy life is lived tinder the Blessed One
 No friend
 Then is it for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One
 No friend
Friend when asked But friend is it for the sake of purification of virtue that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One  you replied No friend
When asked Then is it for the sake of purification of mind
purification of viewpurification by overcoming doubtpurification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the pathpurification by knowledge and vision of the waypurification by knowledge and vision that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One you replied No friend
For the sake of what then friend is the holy life lived under the Blessed One
Friend it is for the sake of final Nibbana without clinging that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One
But friend is purification of virtue final Nibbana without clinging
 No friend
 Then is purification of mind final Nibbana without clinging
 No friend
 Then is purification of view final Nibbana without clinging
 No friend
 Then is purification by overcoming doubt final Nibbana without clinging
 No friend
 Then is purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path final Nibbana without clinging
 No friend
 Then is purification by knowledge and vision of the way final Nibbana without clinging
 No friend
 Then is purification by knowledge and vision final Nibbana without clinging
 No friend
 But friend is final Nibbana without clinging to be attained without these states
 No friend
When asked But friend is purification of virtue final Nibbana without clinging  you replied No friend
When asked Then is purification of mind
purification of viewpurification by overcoming doubtpurification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the pathpurification by knowledge and vision of the waypurification by knowledge and vision final Nibbana without clinging you replied No friend
And when asked But friend is final Nibbana without clinging to be attained without these states  you replied No friend
But how friend should the meaning of these statements be regarded
Friend if the Blessed One had described purification of virtue as final Nibbana without clinging he would have described what is still accompanied by clinging as final Nibbana without clinging
If the Blessed One had described purification of mind
And if final Nibbana without clinging were to be attained without these states then an ordinary person would have attained final Nibbana
As to that friend I shall give you a simile for some wise men understand the meaning of a statement by means of a simile
Suppose that King Pasenadi of Kosala while living at Savatthi had some urgent business to settle at Saketa
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala leaving Savatthl through the inner palace door would mount the first relay chariot and by means of the first relay chariot he would arrive at the second relay chariot
and by means of the seventh clmriot he would arrive at the inner palace door in Saketa
Then when he had come to the inner palace door his friends and acquaintances his kinsmen and relatives would ask him Sire did you come from Savatthl to the inner palace door in Saketa by means of this relay chariot
How then should King Pasenadi of Kosala answer in order to answer correctly
In order to answer correctly friend he should answer thus Here while living at Savatthi I had some urgent business to settle at Saketa
and between Savatthi and Saketa seven relay chariots were kept ready for me
In order to answer correctly he should answer thus
So too friend purification of virtue is for the sake of reaching purification of mind purification of mind is for the sake of reaching purification of view purification of view is for the sake of reaching purification by overcoming doubt purification by overcoming doubt is for the sake of reaching purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path purificatior by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path is for the sake of reaching purification by knowledge and vision of the way purification by knowledge and vision of the way is for the sake of reaching purification by knowledge and vision purification by knowledge and vision is for the sake of reaching final Nibbana without clinging
It is for the sake of final Nibbana without clinging that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One
When this was said the venerable Sariputta asked the venerable Punna Mantaniputta What is the venerable ones name and how do his companions in the holy life know the venerable one
My name is Punna friend and my companions in the holy life know me as Mantaniputta
It is wonderful friend it is marvellous
Each profound question has been answered point by point by the venerable Punna Mantaniputta as a learned disciple who understands the Teachers Dispensation correctly
It is a gain for his companions in the holy life it is a great gain for them that they have the opportunity to see and honour the venerable Punna Manantaniputta
Even if it were by carrying the venerable Punna Mantaniputta about on a cushion on their heads that his companions in the holy life would get the opportunity to see and honour him it would be a gain for them a great gain for them And it is a gain for us a great gain for us that we have the opportunity to see and honour the venerable Punna Mantaniputta
When this was said the venerable Punna Mantaniputta asked the venerable Sariputta What is the venerable ones name and how do his companions in the holy life know the venerable one
My name is Upatissa friend and my companions in the holy life know me as Sariputta
Indeed friend we did not know that we were talking with the venerable Sariputta the disciple who is like the Teacher himself
If we had known that this was the venerable Sariputta we should not have said so much
It is wonderful friend it is marvellous
Each profound question has been posed point by point by the venerable Sariputta as a learned disciple who understands the Teachers Dispensation correctly
It is a gain for his companions in the holy life it is a great gain for them that they have the opportunity to see and honour the venerable Sariputta
Even if it were by carrying the venerable Sariputta about on a cushion on their heads that his companions in the holy life would get the opportunity to see and honour him it would be a gain for them a great gain for them And it is a gain for us a great gain for us that we have the opportunity to see and honour the venerable Sariputta
Thus it was that these two great beings rejoiced in each others good words
The Blessed One asked them
Wandering by stages he eventually arrived at Savatthi
Is the holy life lived under our Blessed One friend
and said to the venerable Punna Mantaniputta
for an ordinary person is without these states
purification by knowledge and vision as final Nibbana without clinging he would have described what is still accompanied by clinging as final Nibbana without clinging
purification by knowledge and vision of the way
purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path
purification by overcoming doubt
purification of view
and that between Savatthi and Saketa seven relay chariots were kept ready for him
then he would dismount from the first chariot and mount the second chariot and by means of the second chariot he would arrive at the third chariot
by means of the third chariot he would arrive at the fourth chariot
by means of the fourth chariot he would arrive at the fifth chariot
by means of the fifth chariot he would arrive at the sixth chariot
by means of the sixth chariot he would arrive at the seventh chariot
and by means of the seventh chariot I arrived at the inner palace door in Saketa
seventh chariot
sixth
fifth
fourth
and by means of the second chariot I arrived at the third
and by means of the first relay chariot I arrived at the second relay chariot then I dismounted from the first chariot and mounted the second chariot
Then leaving Savatthi through the inner palace door I mounted the first relay chariot
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
if householders can awaken in Dhamma then the ascetic practices of the monks must be fruitless
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
The Blessed One said this
The doctrines of others are devoid of recluses that is how you should rightly roar your lions roar
It is possible bhikkhus that wanderers of other sects might ask But on the strength of what argument or with the support of what authority do the venerable ones say thus
Wanderers of other sects who ask thus may be answered in this way Friends four things have been declared to us by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened on seeing these in ourselves we say thus Only here is there a recluse only here a second recluse only here a third recluse only here a fourth recluse The doctrines of others are devoid of recluses
What are the four
We have confidence in the Teacher we have confidence in the Dhamma we have fulfilled the precepts and our companions in the Dhamma are dear and agreeable to us whether they are laymen or those gone forth
These are the four things declared to us by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened on seeing which in ourselves we say as we do
It is possible bhikkhus that wanderers of other sects might say thus Friends we too have confidence in the Teacher that is in our Teacher we too have confidence in the Dhamma that is in our Dhamma we too have fulfilled the precepts that is our precepts and our companions in the Dhamma are dear and agreeable to us too whether they are laymen or those gone forth
What is the distinction here friends what is the variance what is the difference between you and us
Wanderers of other sects who ask thus may be answered in this way How then friends is the goal one or many
Answering rightly the wanderers of other sects would answer thus Friends the goal is one not many
 But friends is that goal for one affected by lust or free from lust
Answering rightly the wanderers of other sects would answer thus Friends that goal is for one free from lust not for one affected by lust
 But friends is that goal for one affected by hate or free from hate
Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one free from hate not for one affected by hate
 But friends is that goal for one affected by delusion or free from delusion
Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one free from delusion not for one affected by delusion
 But friends is that goal for one affected by craving or free from craving
Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one free from craving not for one affected by craving
 But friends is that goal for one affected by clinging or free from clinging
Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one free from clinging not for one affected by clinging
 But friends is that goal for one who has vision or for one without vision
Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one with vision not for one without vision
 But friends is that goal for one who favours and opposes or for one who does not favour and oppose
Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one who does not favour and oppose not for one who favours and opposes
 But friends is that goal for one who delights in and enjoys proliferation or for one who does not delight in and enjoy proliferation
Answering rightly they would answer Friends that goal is for one who does not delight in and enjoy proliferation not for one who delights in and enjoys proliferation
Bhikkhus there are these two views the view of being and the view of nonbeing
Any recluses or brahmins who rely on the view of being adopt the view of being accept the view of being are opposed to the view of nonbeing
Any recluses or brahmins who rely on the view of nonbeing adopt the view of nonbeing accept the view of nonbeing are opposed to the view of being
Any recluses or brahmins who do not understand as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escapein the case of these two views are affected by lust affected by hate affected by delusion affected by craving affected by clinging without vision given to favouring and opposing and they delight in and enjoy proliferation They are not freed from birth ageing and death from sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair they are not freed from suffering I say
Any recluses or brahmins who understand as they actually are the origin the disappearance the gratification the danger and the escape in the case of these two views are without lust without hate without delusion without craving without clinging with vision not given to favouring and opposing and they do not delight in and enjoy proliferation They are freed from birth ageing and death from sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair they are freed from suffering I say
Bhikkhus there are these four kinds of clinging
What four
Clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
Though certain recluses and brahmins claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they do not completely describe the full understanding of all kinds of clinging
They describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures without describing the full understanding of clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
Why is that
Those good recluses and brahmins do not understand these three instances of clinging as they actually are
Therefore though they claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging they describe only the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures without describing the full understanding of clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
Though certain recluses and brahmins claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging
Why is that
They do not understand two instances
they describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views and clinging to rules and observances without describing the full understanding of clinging to a doctrine of self
Bhikkhus in such a Dhamma and Discipline as that it is plain that confidence in the Teacher is not rightly directed that confidence in the Dhamma is not rightly directed that fulfilment of the precepts is not rightly directed and that the affection among companions in the Dhamma is not rightly directed
Why is that
Because that is how it is when the Dhamma and Discipline is badly proclaimed and badly expounded unemancipating unconducive to peace expounded by one who is not fully enlightened
Bhikkhus when a Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened claims to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging he completely describes the full understanding of all kinds of clinging he describes the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
Why is that
Because that is how it is when the Dhamma and Discipline is wellproclaimed and wellexpounded emancipating conducive to peace expounded by one who is fully enlightened
Now these four kinds of clinging have what as their source
These four kinds of clinging have craving as their source craving as their origin they are born and produced from craving
Craving has feeling as its source
Feeling has contact as its source
Contact has the sixfold base as its source
The sixfold base has mentalitymateriality as its source
Mentalitymateriality has consciousness as its source
Consciousness has formations as its source
Formations have ignorance as their source ignorance as their origin they are bom and produced from ignorance
Bhikkhus when ignorance is abandoned and true knowledge has arisen in a bhikkhu then with the fading away of ignorance and the arising of true knowledge he no longer clings to sensual pleasures no longer clings to views no longer clings to rules and observances no longer clings to a doctrine of self
When he does not cling he is not agitated When he is not agitated he personally attains Nibbana
He understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
 Venerable sir they replied
Bhikkhus only here is there a recluse only here a second recluse only here a third recluse only here a fourth recluse
they describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to views without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
therefore they describe only the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to views without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
therefore they describe only the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures clinging to views and clinging to rules and observances without describing the full understanding of clinging to a doctrine of self
They do not understand one instance
Though certain recluses and brahmins claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging
Bhikkhus in such a Dhamma and Discipline as that it is plain that confidence in the Teacher is rightly directed that confidence in the Dhamma is rightly directed that fulfilment of the precepts is rightly directed and that the affection among companions in the Dhamma is rightly directed
what as their origin from what are they born and produced
Formations have what as their source
Consciousness has what as its source
Mentalitymateriality has what as its source
The sixfold base has what as its source
Contact has what as its source
Feeling has what as its source
Craving has what as its source
like the earth in the sense of being the base
like water in the sense of washing away the stains of all defilements
like heat in the sense of burning up the lust of all the defilements
like the wind in the sense of blowing away the stains and dust of all the defilements
like an antidote in the sense of allaying the diseases of all the defilements
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
What bhikkhus are the five wildernesses in the heart that he has not abandoned
Here a bhikkhu is doubtful uncertain undecided and unconfident about the Teacher
and thus his mind does not incline to ardour devotion perseverance and striving
As his mind does not incline to ardour devotion perseverance and striving that is the first wilderness in the heart that he has not abandoned
Again a bhikkhu is doubtful uncertain undecided and unconfident about the DhammaAs his mind does not incline to ardourthat is the second wilderness in the heart that he has not abandoned
Again a bhikkhu is doubtful uncertain undecided and unconfident about the SanghaAs his mind does not incline to ardourthat is the third wilderness in the heart that he has not abandoned
These are the five wildernesses in the heart that he has not abandoned
What bhikkhus are the five shackles in the heart that he has not severed
Here a bhikkhu is not free from lust desire affection thirst fever and craving for sensual pleasures
and thus his mind does not incline to ardour devotion perseverance and striving
As his mind does not incline to ardour devotion perseverance and striving that is the first shackle in the heart that he has not severed
Again a bhikkhu is not free from lust desire affection thirst fever and craving for the bodyAs his mind does not incline to ardourthat is the second shackle in the heart that he has not severed
Again a bhikkhu is not free from lust desire affection thirst fever and craving for formAs his mind does not incline to ardourthat is the third shackle in the heart that he has not severed
Again a bhikkhu eats as much as he likes until his belly is full and indulges in the pleasures of sleeping lolling and drowsing
As his mind does not incline to ardour devotion perseverance and striving this is the fifth shackle in the heart that he has not severed
These are the five shackles in the heart that he has not severed
Bhikkhus that any bhikkhu who has not abandoned these five wildernesses in the heart and severed these five shackles in the heart should come to growth increase and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline  that is impossible
Bhikkhus that any bhikkhu who has abandoned five wildernesses in the heart and severed five shackles in the heart should come to growth increase and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline  that is possible
What bhikkhus are the five wildernesses in the heart that he has abandoned
Here a bhikkhu is not doubtful uncertain undecided or unconfident about the Teacher and thus his mind inclines to ardour devotion perseverance and striving
As his mind inclines to ardour devotion perseverance
and striving the first wilderness in the heart has been abandoned by him
Again a bhikkhu is not doubtful uncertain undecided or unconfident about the Dhamma As his mind inclines to ardourthe second wilderness in the heart has been abandoned by him
Again a bhikkhu is not doubtful uncertain undecided or unconfident about the Sangha As his mind inclines to ardourthe third wilderness in the heart has been abandoned by him
and thus his mind inclines to ardour devotion perseverance and striving
As his mind inclines to ardour devotion perseverance and striving the fifth wilderness in the heart has been abandoned by him
These are the five wildernesses in the heart that he has abandoned
What bhikkhus are the five shackles in the heart that he has severed
Here a bhikkhu is free from lust desire affection thirst fever and craving for sensual pleasures
and thus his mind inclines to ardour devotion perseverance and striving
As his mind inclines to ardour devotion perseverance and striving the first shackle in the heart has been severed by him
Again a bhikkhu is free from lust desire affection thirst fever and craving for the body As his mind inclines to ardourthe second shackle in the heart has been severed by him  Again a bhikkhu is free from lust desire affection thirst fever and craving for form As his mind inclines to ardourthe third shackle in the heart has been severed by him
Again a bhikkhu does not eat as much as he likes until his belly is full and does not indulge in the pleasures of sleeping lolling and drowsing
Again a bhikkhu does not live the holy life aspiring to some order of gods thus By this virtue or observance or asceticism or holy life I shall become a great god or some lesser god
As his mind inclines to ardour devotion perseverance and striving the fifth shackle in the heart has been severed by him
These are the five shackles in the heart that he has severed
Bhikkhus that any bhikkhu who has abandoned these five wildernesses in the heart and severed these five shackles in the heart should come to growth increase and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline  that is possible
He develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to zeal and determined striving he develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to energy and determined striving he develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to purity of mind and determined striving he develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to investigation and determined striving And enthusiasm is the fifth
A bhikkhu who thus possesses the fifteen factors including enthusiasm is capable of breaking out capable of enlightenment capable of attaining the supreme security from bondage
Suppose there were a hen with eight ten or twelve eggs
which she had covered incubated and nurtured properly
So too a bhikkhu who thus possesses the fifteen factors including enthusiasm is capable of breaking out capable of enlightenment capable of attaining the supreme security from bondage
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Bhikkhus that any bhikkhu who has not abandoned five wildernesses in the heart and not severed five shackles in the heart should come to growth increase and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline  that is impossible
As his mind does not incline to ardour devotion perseverance and striving that is the fifth wilderness in the heart that he has not abandoned
and thus his mind does not incline to ardour devotion perseverance and striving
Again a bhikkhu is angry and displeased with his companions in the holy life resentful and callous towards them
Again a bhikkhu is doubtful uncertain undecided and unconfident about the training
As his mind does not incline to ardour
that is the fourth wilderness in the heart that he has not abandoned
and thus his mind does not incline to ardour devotion perseverance and striving
Again a bhikkhu lives the holy life aspiring to some order of gods thus By this virtue or observance or asceticism or holy life I shall become a great god or some lesser god
that is the fourth shackle in the heart that he has not severed
As his mind does not incline to ardour
Again a bhikkhu is not angry and displeased with his companions in the holy life nor resentful and callous towards them
Again a bhikkhu is not doubtful uncertain undecided or unconfident about the trainingAs his mind inclines to ardourthe fourth wilderness in the heart has been abandoned by him
and thus his mind inclines to ardour devotion perseverance and striving
As his mind inclines to ardourthe fourth shackle in the heart has been severed by him
Even though she did not wish Oh that my chicks might pierce their shells with the points of their claws and beaks and hatch out safely
yet the chicks are capable of piercing their shells with the points of their claws and beaks and hatching out safely
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
A deertrapper lays down bait for a deer herd intending thus The deer herd will eat food unwarily by going right in amongst the bait that I have laid down by so doing they will become intoxicated when they are intoxicated they will fall into negligence when they are negligent I can do with them as I like on account of this bait
Now the deer of the first herd ate food unwarily by going right in amongst the bait that the deertrapper had laid down by so doing they became intoxicated when they were intoxicated they fell into negligence when they were negligent the deertrapper did with them as he liked on account of that bait
That is how the deer of the first herd failed to get free from the deertrappers power and control
Now the deer of a second herd reckoned thus The deer of that first herd by acting as they did without precaution failed to get free from the deertrappers power and control
Suppose we altogether shun that bait food shunning that fearful enjoyment let us go out into the forest wilds and live there
And they did so
But in the last month of the hot season when the grass and the water were used up their bodies were reduced to extreme emaciation
with that they lost their strength and energy
Now the deer of a third herd reckoned thus The deer of that first herd by acting as they did without precaution failed to get free from the deertrappers power and control
The deer of that second herd by reckoning how the deer of the first herd had failed and by planning and acting as they did with the precaution of going to live in the forest wilds
Now the deer of a fourth herd reckoned thus The deer of that first herd by acting as they did without precaution failed to get free from the deertrappers power and control
The deer of that second herd by reckoning how the deer of the first herd had failed and by planning and acting as they did with the precaution of going to live in the forest wilds
Bhikkhus I have given this simile in order to convey a meaning
This is the meaning Bait is a term for the five cords of sensual pleasure
Deertrapper is a term for Mara the Evil One
The deertrappers following is a term for Maras following
Deer herd is a term for recluses and brahmins
Now recluses and brahmins of the first kind ate food unwarily by going right in amongst the bait and the material things of the world that Mara had laid down
That is how the recluses and brahmins of the first kind failed to get free from Maras power and control
Those recluses and brahmins I say are just like the deer of the first herd
Now recluses and brahmins of the second kind reckoned thus Those recluses and brahmins of the first kind by acting as they did without precaution
There they were eaters of greens or millet or wild rice or hideparings or moss or ricebran or the discarded scum of boiled rice or sesamum flour or grass or cowdung they lived on forest roots and fruits they fed on fallen fruits
But in the last month of the hot season when the grass and the water were used up their bodies were reduced to extreme emaciation
Now recluses and brahmins of the third kind reckoned thus Those recluses and brahmins of the first kind by acting as they did without precaution
Those recluses and brahmins of the second kind by reckoning how the recluses and brahmins of the first kind had failed and then planning and acting as they did with the precaution of going to live in the forest wilds
Now recluses and brahmins of the fourth kind reckoned thus Those recluses and brahmins of the first kind by acting as they did without precaution
failed to get free from Maras power and control
Those recluses and brahmins of the second kind by reckoning how the recluses and brahmins of the first kind had failed and by planning and acting as they did with the precaution of going to live in the forest wilds
And where is it that Mara and his following cannot go
Here quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Mara to have become invisible to the Evil One by depriving Maras eye of its opportunity
Again with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentration
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Mara l
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Mara
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Mara
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Mara
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Mara
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Mara
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Mara to have become invisible to the Evil One by depriving Maras eye of its opportunity
Again by completely surmounting the base of neitherperception nornonperception a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling
And his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom
This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Mara to have become invisible to the Evil One by depriving Maras eye of its opportunity and to have crossed beyond attachment to the world
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Bhikkhus a deertrapper does not lay down bait for a deer herd intending thus May the deer herd enjoy this bait that I have laid down and so be longlived and handsome and endure for a long time
And that is how the deer of the second herd also failed to get free from the deertrappers power and control
By so doing they became intoxicated when they were intoxicated they fell into negligence when they were negligent the deertrapper did with them as he liked on account of that bait
They ate food unwarily by going right in amongst it
when they had lost their strength and energy they returned to that same bait that the deertrapper had laid down
They did so
And that is how the deer of the third herd also failed to get free from the deertrappers power and control
Suppose we have the bait that is laid down completely surrounded all round over a wide area with wicker hurdles then perhaps we might see the third deer herds dwelling place where they go to hide
Then having done so we shall eat food not unwarily and without going right in amongst the bait that the deertrapper has laid down by doing so we shall not become intoxicated when we are not intoxicated we shall not fall into negligence when we are not negligent the deertrapper shall not do with us as he likes on account of that bait
But then the deertrapper and his following considered thus These deer of this third herd are as cunning and crafty as wizards and sorcerers They eat the bait laid down without our knowing how they come and go
Suppose we make our dwelling place within range of the deertrappers bait
And they did so
and they saw the third herds dwelling place where they went to hide
And that was how the deer of the fourth deer herd got free from the deertrappers power and control
by so doing they became intoxicated when they were intoxicated they fell into negligence when they were negligent Mara did with them as he liked on account of that bait and those material things of the world
Suppose we altogether shun that bait food and those material things of the world shunning that fearful enjoyment let us go out into the forest wilds and live there
That is how those recluses and brahmins of the second kind failed to get free from Maras power and control
Those recluses and brahmins I say are just like the deer of the second herd
with that they lost their strength and energy
when they had lost their strength and energy they lost their deliverance of mind
with the loss of their deliverance of mind they returned to that same bait that Mara had laid down and those material things of the world
they ate food unwarily by going right in amongst it
by so doing they became intoxicated when they were intoxicated they fell into negligence when they were negligent Mara did with them as he liked on account of that bait and those material things of the world
Those recluses and brahmins I say are just like the deer of the third herd
That is how those recluses and brahmins of the third kind failed to get free ftorn Maras power and control
But then they came to hold views such as the world is eternal and the world is not eternal and the world is finite and the world is infinite and the soul and the body are the same and the soul is one thing and the body another and after death a Tathagata exists and after death a Tathagata does not exist and after death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist and after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist
And they did so
Suppose we make our dwelling place within range of that bait that Mara has laid down and those material things of the world Then having done so we shall eat food not unwarily and without going right in amongst the bait that Mara has laid down and the material things of the world By doing so we shall not become intoxicated when we are not intoxicated we shall not fall into negligence when we are not negligent Mara shall not do with us as he likes on account of that bait and those material things of the world
also failed to get free from Maras power and control
Again with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhu abides in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body he enters upon and abides in the third jhana on account of which the noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindfu
Again with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpain norpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
Again with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite space
Again by completely surmounting the base of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness
Again by completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness
Again by completely surmounting the base of nothingness a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of neitherperception nornonperception
And that is how those recluses and brahmins of the fourth kind got free from Maras power and control
Those recluses and brahmins I say are just like the deer of the fourth herd
They did so
Suppose we treat the fourth deer herd with indifference
and so the deer herds will all desert this bait that we have laid down
Then the deerhunter and his following considered thus If we scare the fourth deer herd being scared they will alert others
but they did not see the fourth deer herds dwelling place where they went to hide
They eat the bait laid down without our knowing how they come and go
But then the deertrapper and his following considered thus These deer of this fourth herd are as cunning and crafty as wizards and sorcerers
Suppose we have the bait that is laid down completely surrounded all round over a wide area with wicker hurdles then perhaps we might see the fourth deer herds dwelling place where they go to hide
And they did so
Then having done so we shall eat food not unwarily and without going right in amongst the bait that the deertrapper has laid down by doing so we shall not become intoxicated when we are not intoxicated we shall not fall into negligence when we are not negligent the deertrapper shall not do with us as he likes on account of that bait
Then having done so we shall eat food not unwarily and without going right in amongst the bait that Mara has laid down and the material things of the world By doing so we shall not become intoxicated when we are not intoxicated we shall not fall into negligence when we are not negligent Mara shall not do with us as he likes on account of that bait and those material things of the world
Suppose we make our dwelling place where Mara and his following cannot go
And the recluses and brahmins of the third kind by reckoning how the recluses and brahmins of the first kind
also failed to get free from the deertrappers power and control
also failed to get free from the deertrappers power and control
They did so
And they did so
failed to get free from Maras power and control
failed to get free from Maras power and control
also failed to get free from Maras power and control
and by planning and acting as they did with the precaution of making their dwelling place within range of the bait that Mara had laid down and the material things of the world
and also the recluses and brahmins of the second kind had failed
also failed to get free from Maras power and control

What are the thirteen
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Then the brahmin Pingalakoccha went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished
he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One Master Gotama there are these recluses and brahmins each the head of an order the head of a group the teacher of a group a wellknown and famous founder of a sect regarded by many as a saint  that is Purana Kassapa Makkhali Gosala Ajita Kesakambalin Pakudha Kaccayana Sanjaya Belatthiputta and the Nigantha Nataputta Have they all had direct knowledge as they claim or have none of them had direct knowledge or have some of them had direct knowledge and some not
Yes sir the brahmin Pingalakoccha replied
The Blessed One said this
Then a man with good sight seeing him might say This good man did not know the heartwood the sapwood the inner bark the outer bark or the twigs and leaves
Thus while needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood he came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood and passing over its heartwood its sapwood its inner bark and its outer bark he cut off its twigs and leaves and took them away thinking they were heartwood
Whatever it was this good man had to make with heartwood his purpose will not be served
Suppose a man needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood Passing over its heartwood its sapwood and its inner bark he would cut off its outer bark and take it away thinking it was heartwood

Then a man with good sight seeing him might say This good man knew the heartwood the sapwood the inner bark the outer bark and the twigs and leaves
Thus while needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood he came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood and cutting off only its heartwood he took it away knowing it was heartwood
Whatever it was this good man had to make with heartwood his purpose will be served
So too brahmin here some clansman goes forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness considering I am a victim of birth ageing and death of sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair I am a victim of suffering a prey to suffering Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be known
When he has gone forth thus he acquires gain honour and renown
He is pleased with that gain honour and renown and his intention is fulfilled
On account of it he lauds himself and disparages others thus I have gain honour and renown but these other bhikkhus are unknown of no account
So he arouses no desire to act he makes no effort for the realisation of those other states that are higher and more sublime than gain honour and renown he hangs back and slackens

He achieves the attainment of virtue
He is pleased with that attainment of virtue and his intention is fulfilled
On account of it he lauds himself and disparages others thus I am virtuous of good character but these other bhikkhus are immoral of evil character
So he arouses no desire to act he makes no effort for the realisation of those other states that are higher and more sublime than the attainment of virtue he hangs back and slackens
I say that this person is like the man needing heartwoodwho passing over its heartwood its sapwood and its inner bark cut off its outer bark and took it away thinking it was heartwood

He achieves knowledge and vision
He is pleased with that knowledge and vision and his intention is fulfilled
On account of it he lauds himself and disparages others thus I live knowing and seeing but these other bhikkhus live unknowing and unseeing
So he arouses no desire to act he makes no effort for the realisation of those other states that are higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision he hangs back and slackens
I say that this person is like the man needing heartwoodwho passing over its heartwood cut off its sapwood and took it away thinking it was heartwood

He arouses desire to act and he makes an effort for the realisation of those other states that are higher and more sublime than knowledge and visionhe does not hang back and slacken
But what brahmin are the states that are higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision
Here brahmin quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
This is a state higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision
Again with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentration
This too is a state higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision
Again with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhu abides in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body he enters upon and abides in the third jhana on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful
This too is a state higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision
Again with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
This too is a state higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision
Again with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite space
This too is a state higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision
Again by completely surmounting the base of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness
This too is a state higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision
Again by completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness
This too is a state higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision
Again by completely surmounting the base of nothingness a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of neitherperception nornonperception
This too is a state higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision
Again by completely surmounting the base of neitherperception nornonperception a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling And his taints are destroyed by seeing with wisdom
This too is a state higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision
These are the states that are higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision
I say that this person brahmin is like a man needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood who came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood and cutting off its heartwood took it away knowing it was heartwood
So this holy life brahmin does not have gain honour and renown for its benefit or the attainment of virtue for its benefit or the attainment of concentration for its benefit or knowledge and vision for its benefit
But it is this unshakeable deliverance of mind that is the goal of this holy life its heartwood and its end
When this was said the brahmin Pingalakoccha said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
Enough brahmin Let this be  Have they all had direct knowledge as they claim or have none of them had direct knowledge or have some of them had direct knowledge and some not 
I shall teach you the Dhamma brahmin Listen and attend closely to what I shall say
Suppose brahmin a man needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood Passing over its heartwood its sapwood its inner bark and its outer bark he would cut off its twigs and leaves and take them away thinking they were heartwood
and so whatever it was he had to make with heartwood his purpose will not have been served
and so whatever it was he had to make with heartwood his purpose will not have been served
and so whatever it was he had to make with heartwood his purpose will not have been served
He achieves the attainment of virtue
He achieves the attainment of concentration
and so whatever it was he had to make with heartwood his purpose will not have been served
He achieves the attainment of virtue
He achieves the attainment of concentration
He achieves knowledge and vision
and so whatever it was he had to make with heartwood his purpose will have been served
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Nadika in the Brick House
Now on that occasion the venerable Anuruddha the venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila were living at the Park of the Gosinga Salatree Wood
Then when it was evening the Blessed One rose from meditation and went to the Park of the Gosinga Salatree Wood
The park keeper saw the Blessed One coming in the distance
There are three clansmen here seeking their own good
Do not disturb them
The venerable Anuruddha heard the park keeper speaking to the Blessed One
It is our Teacher the Blessed One who has come
Then the venerable Anuruddha went to the venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila and said Come out venerable sirs come out Our Teacher the Blessed One has come
Then all three went to meet the Blessed One One took his bowl and outer robe one prepared a seat and one set out water for washing the feet The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready and washed his feet
When they were seated the Blessed One said to them
We are keeping well Blessed One we are comfortable and we are not having any trouble getting almsfood
I hope Anuruddha that you are all living in concord with mutual appreciation without disputing blending like milk and water viewing each other with kindly eyes
Surely venerable sir we are living in concord with mutual appreciation without disputing blending like milk and water viewing each other with kindly eyes
But Anuruddha how do you live thus
Venerable sir as to that I think thus
It is a gain for me it is a great gain for me that I am living with such companions in the holy lifeI maintain bodily acts of lovingkindness towards those venerable ones both openly and privately I maintain verbal acts of lovingkindness towards them both openly and privately I maintain mental acts of lovingkindness towards them both openly and privately
I consider Why should I not set aside what I wish to do and do what these venerable ones wish to do
Then I set aside what I wish to do and do what these venerable ones wish to do
We are different in body venerable sir but one in mind
The venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila each spoke likewise adding That is how venerable sir we are living in concord with mutual appreciation without disputing blending like milk and water viewing each other with kindly eyes
Good good Anuruddha
I hope that you all abide diligent ardent and resolute
Surely venerable sir we abide diligent ardent and resolute
But Anuruddha how do you abide thus
  Venerable sir as to that whichever of us returns first from the village with almsfood prepares the seats sets out the water for drinking and for washing and puts the refuse bucket in its place
Whichever of us returns Ifst eats any food left over if he wishes otherwise he throws it away where there is no greenery or drops it into water where there is no life
He puts away the seats and the water for drinking and for washing He puts away the refuse bucket after washing it and he sweeps out the refectory
Whoever notices that the pots of water for drinking washing or the latrine are low or empty takes care of them
If they are too heavy for him he calls someone else by a signal of the hand and they move it by joining hands but because of this we do not break out into speech
But every five days we sit together all night discussing the Dhamma
That is how we abide diligent ardent and resolute
Good good Anuruddha
But while you abide thus diligent ardent and resolute have you attained any superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a comfortable abiding
Why not venerable sir
Here venerable sir whenever we want quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states we enter upon and abide in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
Venerable sir this is a superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a comfortable abiding which we have attained while abiding diligent ardent and resolute
Good good Anuruddha
But is there any other superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a comfortable abiding which you have attained by surmounting that abiding by making that abiding subside
Why not venerable sir
Here venerable sir whenever we want with the stilling of applied and sustained thought we enter upon and abide in the second jhana
Good good Anuruddha
But is there any other superhuman statewhich you have attained by surmounting that abiding by making that abiding subside
Why not venerable sir
Here venerable sir whenever we want with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite we enter upon and abide in the base of infinite space
Venerable sir this is another superhuman statewhich We have attained by surmounting the preceding abiding by making that abiding subside
Good good Anuruddha
But is there any other superhuman statewhich you have attained by surmounting that abiding by making that abiding subside
Why not venerable sir
Here venerable sir whenever we Want by completely surmounting the base of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite we enter upon and abide in the base of infinite consciousnessBy completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing we enter upon and abide in the base of nothingnessBy completely surmounting the base of nothingness we enter upon and abide in the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception
Venerable sir this is another superhuman statewhich we have attained by surmounting the preceding abiding by making that abiding subside
Good good Anuruddha
But is there any other superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a comfortable abiding which you have attained by surmounting that abiding by making that abiding subside
Why not venerable sir
Here venerable sir whenever we want by completely surmounting the base of neitherperceptionnor nonperception we enter upon and abide in the cessation of perception and feeling And our taints are destroyed by our seeing with wisdom
Venerable sir this is another superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a comfortable abiding which we have attained by surmounting the preceding abiding by making that abiding subside
And venerable sir we do not see any other comfortable abiding higher or more sublime than this one
Good good Anuruddha
There is no other comfortable abiding higher or more sublime than that one
Then when the Blessed One had instructed urged roused and encouraged the venerable Anuruddha the venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila with a talk on the Dhamma he rose from his seat and departed
After they had accompanied the Blessed One a little way and turned back again the venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila asked the venerable Anuruddha Have we ever reported to the venerable Anuruddha that we have obtained those abidings and attainments that the venerable Anuruddha in the Blessed Ones presence ascribed to us up to the destruction of the taints
The venerable ones have never reported to me that they have obtained those abidings and attainments Yet by encompassing the venerable ones minds with my own mind I know that they have obtained those abidings and attainments
And deities have also reported to me These venerable ones have obtained those abidings and attainments
Then I declared it when directly questioned b y the Blessed One
Then the spirit Digha Parajana went to the Blessed One
After paying homage to the Blessed One he stood at one side and said It is a gain for the Vajjians venerable sir a great gain for the Vajjian people that the Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened dwells among them and these three clansmen the venerable Anuruddha the venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila
On hearing the exclamation of the spirit Digha Parajana the earth gods exclaimed It is a gain for the Vajjians a great gain for the Vajjian people that the Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened dwells among them and these three clansmen the venerable Anuruddha the venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila
 On hearing the exclamation of the earth gods the gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kingsthe gods of the heaven of the Thirtythreethe Yama godsthe gods of the Tusita heaventhe gods who delight in creatingthe gods who wield power over others creationsthe gods of Brahmas retinue exclaimed It is a gam for the Vajjians a great gain for the Vajjian people that the Tathagata accomplished and fully enlightened dwells among them and these three clansmen the venerable Anuruddha the venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila
Thus at that instant at that moment those venerable ones were known as far as the Brahmaworld
The Blessed One said So it is Digha so it is
And if the clan from which those three clansmen went forth from the home life into homelessness should remember them with confident heart that would lead to the welfare and happiness of that clan for a long time
And if the retinue of the clan from which those three clansmen went forth
the village from which they went forth
If all brahminsall merchantsall workers should remember those three clansmen with confident heart that would lead to the welfare and happiness of the workers for a long time
If the world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas this generation with its recluses and brahmins its princes and its people should remember those three clansmen with confident heart that would lead to the welfare and happiness of the world for a long time
See Digha how those three clansmen are practising for the welfare and happiness of the many out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of gods and humans
That is what the Blessed One said
The spirit Digha Parajana was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
and told him Do not enter this park recluse
and told him Friend park keeper do not keep the Blessed One out
Then those three venerable ones paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side
I hope you are all keeping well Anuruddha I hope you are all comfortable I hope you are not having any trouble getting almsfood
With the fading away as well of rapturewe enter upon and abide in the third jhana
Venerable sir this is another superhuman state a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a comfortable abiding which we have attained by surmounting the preceding abiding by making that abiding subside
With the abandoning of pleasure and painwe enter upon and abide in the fourth jhana
If all nobles should remember those three clansmen with confident heart that would lead to the welfare and happiness of the nobles for a long time
the country from which those three clansmen went forth from the home life into homelessness should remember them with confident heart that would lead to the welfare and happiness of that country for a long time
the city from which they went forth
the town from which they went forth
Thus have i heard On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Park of the Gosinga Sālatree Wood together with a number of very wellknown elder disciplesthe venerable Sāriputta the venerable Mahā Moggallāna the venerable Mahā Kassapa the venerable Anuruddha the venerable Revata the venerable nanda and other very well known elder disciples
Then when it was evening the venerable Mahā Moggallāna rose from meditation went to the venerable Mahā Kassapa and said to him Friend Kassapa let us go to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma
Then the venerable Mahā Moggallāna the venerable Mahā Kassapa and the venerable Anuruddha went to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma
The venerable nanda saw them going to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma
Thereupon he went to the venerable Revata and said to him Friend Revata those true men are going to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma
Yes friend the venerable Revata to replied
Then the venerable Revata and the venerable nanda went to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma
The venerable Sāriputta saw the venerable Revata and the venerable nanda coming in the distance
Friend nanda the Gosinga Sālatree Wood is delightful the night is moonlit the sāla trees are all in blossom and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air What kind of bhikkhu friend nanda could illuminate the Gosinga Sālatree Wood 
Here friend Sāriputta a bhikkhu has learned much remembers what he has learned and consolidates what he has learned
Such teachings as are good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing and which affirm a holy life that is utterly perfect and puresuch teachings as these he has learned much of remembered mastered verbally investigated with the mind and penetrated well by view
And he teaches the Dhamma to the four assemblies with wellrounded and coherent statements and phrases for the eradication of the underlying tendencies
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood
When this was said the venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Revata thus Friend Revata the venerable nanda has spoken according to his own inspiration
Now we ask the venerable Revata Friend Revata the Gosinga Sālatree Wood is delightful the night is moonlit the sāla trees are all in blossom and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air What kind of bhikkhu friend Revata could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood 
Here friend Sāriputta a bhikkhu delights in solitary meditation and takes delight in solitary meditation he is devoted to internal serenity of mind does not neglect meditation possesses insight and dwells in empty huts
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood
When this was said the venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Anuruddha thus Friend Anuruddha the venerable Revata has spoken according to his own inspiration
Now we ask the venerable Anuruddha Friend Anuruddha the Gosinga Sālatree Wood is delightfulWhat kind of bhikkhu friend Anuruddha could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood 
Here friend Sāriputta with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human a bhikkhu surveys a thousand worlds
Just as a man with good sight when he has ascended to the upper palace chamber might survey a thousand wheelrims so too with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human a bhikkhu surveys a thousand worlds
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood
When this was said the venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Mahā Kassapa thus Friend Kassapa the venerable Anuruddha has spoken according to his own inspiration
Now we ask the venerable Mahā Kassapa Friend Kassapa the Gosinga Sālatree Wood is delightfulWhat kind of bhikkhu friend Kassapa could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood 
Here friend Sāriputta a bhikkhu is a forest dweller himself and speaks in praise of forest dwelling he is an almsfood eater himself and speaks in praise of eating almsfood he is a refuserag wearer himself and speaks in praise of wearing refuserag robes he is a triplerobe wearer himself and speaks in praise of wearing the triple robe he has few wishes himself and speaks in praise of fewness of wishes he is content himself and speaks in praise of contentment he is secluded himself and speaks in praise of seclusion he is aloof from society himself and speaks in praise of aloofness from society he is energetic himself and speaks in praise of arousing energy he has attained to virtue himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of virtue he has attained to concentration himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of concentration he has attained to wisdom himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of wisdom he has attained to deliverance himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of deliverance he has attained to the knowledge and vision of deliverance himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of the knowledge and vision of deliverance
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood
When this was said the venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Mahā Moggallāna thus Friend Moggallāna the venerable Mahā Kassapa has spoken according to his own inspiration
Now we ask the venerable Mahā Moggallāna Friend Moggallāna the Gosinga Sālatree Wood is delightfulWhat kind of bhikkhu friend Moggallāna could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood 
Here friend Sāriputta two bhikkhus engage in a talk on the higher Dhamma and they question each other and each being questioned by the other answers without foundering and their talk rolls on in accordance with the Dhamma
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood
When this was said the venerable Mahā Moggallāna addressed the venerable Sāriputta thus Friend Sāriputta we have all spoken according to our own inspiration
Now we ask the venerable Sāriputta Friend Sāriputta the Gosinga Sālatree Wood is delightful the night is moonlit the sāla trees are all in blossom and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air What kind of bhikkhu friend Sāriputta could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood 
Here friend Moggallāna a bhikkhu wields mastery over his mind he does not let the mind wield mastery over him
In the morning he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide in during the morning at midday he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide in at midday in the evening he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide in during the evening
Suppose a king or a kings minister had a chest full of variously coloured garments
In the morning he could put on whatever pair of garments he wanted to put on in the morning at midday he could put on whatever pair of garments he wanted to put on at midday in the evening he could put on whatever pair of garments he wanted to put on in the evening
So too a bhikkhu wields mastery over his mind he does not let the mind wield mastery over him
In the morningat middayin the evening he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide in during the evening
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood
Then the venerable Sāriputta addressed those venerable ones thus Friends we have all spoken according to our own inspiration
Let us go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him
As the Blessed One answers so let us remember it
The venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One Venerable sir the venerable Revata and the venerable nanda came to me to listen to the Dhamma
I saw them coming in the distance and said to the venerable nanda Let the venerable nanda come
Good good Sāriputta
nanda speaking rightly should speak just as he did
For nanda has learned much remembers what he has learned and consolidates what he has learned
Such teachings as are good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing and which affirm a holy life that is utterly perfect and puresuch teachings as these he has learned much of remembered mastered verbally investigated with the mind and penetrated well by view
And he teaches the Dhamma to the four assemblies with wellrounded and coherent statements and phrases for the eradication of the underlying tendencies
When this was said venerable sir I addressed the venerable Revata thus
And the venerable Revata replied Here friend Sāriputta a bhikkhu delights in solitary meditationas in 
Good good Sāriputta
Revata speaking rightly should speak just as he did
For Revata delights in solitary meditation takes delight in solitary meditation is devoted to internal serenity of mind does not neglect meditation possesses insight and dwells in empty huts
When that was said venerable sir I addressed the venerable Anuruddha thus Friend AnuruddhaWhat kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood
And the venerable Anuruddha replied Here friend Sāriputta with the divine eyeas in 
Good good Sāriputta Anuruddha speaking rightly should speak just as he did
For with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human Anuruddha surveys a thousand worlds
When this was said venerable sir I addressed the venerable Mahā Kassapa thus Friend Kassapa
What kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood
Good good Sāriputta
Kassapa speaking rightly should speak just as he did
For Kassapa is a forestdweller himself and speaks in praise of forest dwellinghe has attained to the knowledge and vision of deliverance himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of the knowledge and vision of deliverance
When this was said venerable sir I addressed the venerable Mahā Moggallāna thus Friend Moggallāna
What kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood
Good good Sāriputta Moggallāna speaking rightly should speak just as he did
For Moggallāna is one who talks on the Dhamma
When that was said the venerable Mahā Moggallāna told the Blessed One Then venerable sir I addressed the venerable Sāriputta thus Friend Sāriputta
Good good Moggallāna
Sāriputta speaking rightly should speak just as he did
For Sāriputta wields mastery over his mind he does not let the mind wield mastery over him
In the morning he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide in during the morning at midday he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide in at midday in the evening he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide in during the evening
When this was said the venerable Sāriputta asked the Blessed One Venerable sir which of us has spoken well
You have all spoken well Sāriputta each in his own way
Hear also from me what kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood
Here Sāriputta when a bhikkhu has returned from his almsround after his meal he sits down folds his legs crosswise sets his body erect and establishing mindfulness in front of him resolves I shall not break this sitting position until through not clinging my mind is liberated from the taints
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood
That is what the Blessed One said
Those venerable ones were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Yes friend the venerable Mahā Kassapa replied
and said to the venerable nanda Let the venerable nanda come
welcome to the venerable nanda the Blessed Ones attendant who is always in the Blessed Ones presence
Then those venerable ones went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him they sat down at one side
Yes friend they replied
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood 
When asked venerable sir the venerable nanda replied Here friend Sāriputta a bhikkhu has learned muchas in 
Friend nanda the Gosinga Sālatree Wood is delightfulWhat kind of bhikkhu friend nanda could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood
Friend RevataWhat kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood 
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood 
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood 
And the venerable Mahā Kassapa replied Here friend Sāriputta a bhikkhu is a forestdweller himselfas in 
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood 
And the venerable Mahā Moggallāna replied Here friend Sāriputta two bhikkhus engage in a talk on the higher Dhamma
as in 
What kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood
And the venerable Sāriputta replied Here friend Moggallāna a bhikkhu wields mastery over his mind
as in 
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sālatree Wood 
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodhas Park
Then when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Kapilavatthu for alms
Dandapani the Sakyan while walking and wandering for exercise also went to the Great Wood
and asked the Blessed One What does the recluse assert what does he proclaim
Friend I assert and proclaim such a teaching that one does not quarrel with anyone in the world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmins its princes and its people such a teaching that perceptions no more underlie that brahmin who abides detached from sensual pleasures without perplexity shorn of worry free from craving for any kind of being
When this was said Dandapani the Sakyan shook his head wagged his tongue and raised his eyebrows until his forehead was puckered in three lines Then he departed leaning on his stick
Then when it was evening the Blessed One rose from meditation and went to Nigrodhas Park where he sat down on a seat made ready for him and told the bhikkhus what had taken place
Then a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One  But venerable sir what is the teaching that the Blessed One asserts whereby one does not quarrel with anyone in the world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmins its princes and its people
And venerable sir how is it that perceptions no more underlie that brahmin who abides detached from sensual pleasures without perplexity shorn of worry free from craving for any kind of being
Bhikkhus as to the source through which perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation beset a man
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said this the Sublime One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling
Then soon after the Blessed One had gone the bhikkhus considered Now friends the Blessed One has risen from his seat and gone into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the detailed meaning
Now who will expound this in detail
Then they considered The venerable Maha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life
He is capable of expounding the detailed meaning
Then the bhikkhus went to the venerable Maha Kaccana and exchanged greetings with him
The venerable Maha Kaccana replied Friends it is as though a man needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood thought that heartwood should be sought for among the branches and leaves of a great tree standing possessed of heartwood after he had passed over the root and the trunk And so it is with you venerable sirs that you think that I should be asked about the meaning of this after you passed the Blessed One by when you were face to face with the Teacher
For knowing the Blessed One knows seeing he sees he is vision he is knowledge he is the Dhamma he is the holy onehe is the sayer the proclaimer the elucidator of meaning the giver of the Deathless the lord of the Dhamma the Tathagata
That was the time when you should have asked the Blessed One the meaning
As he told you so you should have remembered it
Surely friend Kaccana knowing the Blessed One knows seeing he sees he is visionthe Tathagata
That was the time when we should have asked the Blessed One the meaning
As he told us so we should have remembered it
Yet the venerable Maha Kaccana is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life
The venerable Maha Kaccana is capable of expounding the detailed meaning of this summary given in brief by the Blessed One without expounding the detailed meaning Let the venerable Maha Kaccana expound it without finding it troublesome
Then listen friends and attend closely to what I shall say
 Yes friend the bhikkhus replied
The venerable Maha Kaccana said this
Dependent on the eye and forms eyeconsciousness arises The meeting of the three is contact With contact as condition there is feeling What one feels that one perceives What one perceives that one thinks about What one thinks about that one mentally proliferates With what one has mentally proliferated as the source perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation beset a man with respect to past future and present forms cognizable through the eye
Dependent on the ear and soundsDependent on the nose and odoursDependent on the tongue and flavoursDependent on the body and tangiblesDependent on the mind and mindobjects mindconsciousness arises The meeting of the three is contact With contact as condition there is feeling What one feels that one perceives What one perceives that one thinks about What one thinks about that one mentally proliferates With what one has mentally proliferated as the source perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation beset a man with respect to past future and present mindobjects cognizable through the mind
When there is the eye a form and eyeconsciousness it is possible to point out the manifestation of contact
When there is the manifestation of feeling it is possible to point out the manifestation of perception
When there is the manifestation of perception it is possible to point out the manifestation of thinking
When there is the manifestation of thinking it is possible to point out the manifestation of being beset by perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation
When there is the ear a sound and earconsciousnessWhen there is the nose an odour and noseconsciousnessWhen there is the tongue a flavour and tongueconsciousnessWhen there is the body a tangible and bodyconsciousnessWhen there is the mind a mindobject and mindconsciousness
When there is no eye no form and no eyeconsciousness it is impossible to point out the manifestation of contact
Friends when the Blessed One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the detailed meaning that is Bhikkhus as to the source through which perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation beset a man if nothing is found there to delight in welcome and hold to this is the end of the underlying tendency to lust of the underlying tendency to aversion of the underlying tendency to views of the underlying tendency to doubt of the underlying tendency to conceit of the underlying tendency to desire for being of the underlying tendency to ignorance this is the end of resorting to rods and weapons of quarrels brawls disputes recrimination malice and false speech here these evil unwholesome states cease without remainder I understand the detailed meaning of this summary to be thus
Now friends if you wish go to the Blessed One and ask him about the meaning of this
As the Blessed One explains it to you so you should remember it
Then the bhikkhus having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Maha Kaccanas words rose from their seats and went to the Blessed One
After paying homage to him they sat down at one side and told the Blessed One all that had taken place after he had left adding
The venerable Maha Kaccana expounded the meaning to us with these terms statements and phrases
Maha Kaccana is wise bhikkhus Maha Kaccana has great wisdom
If you had asked me the meaning of this I would have explained it to you in the same way that Maha Kaccana has explained it
Such is the meaning of this and so you should remember it
When this was said the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One Venerable sir just as if a man exhausted by hunger and weakness came upon a honeyball in the course of eating it he would find a sweet delectable flavour
Venerable sir what is the name of this discourse on the Dhamma
As to that Ananda you may remember this discourse on the Dhamma as The Honeyball Discourse
That is what the Blessed One said
The venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
When he had wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went to the Great Wood for the days abiding
and entering the Great Wood sat down at the root of a bilva sapling for the days abiding
and when he had entered the Great Wood he went to the bilva sapling where the Blessed One was and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he stood at one side leaning on his stick
here these evil unwholesome states cease without remainder
this is the end of the underlying tendency to lust of the underlying tendency to aversion of the underlying tendency to views of the underlying tendency to doubt of the underlying tendency to conceit of the underlying tendency to desire for being of the underlying tendency to ignorance this is the end of resorting to rods and weapons of quarrels brawls disputes recrimination malice and false speech
if nothing is found there to delight in welcome and hold to
Suppose we went to him and asked him the meaning of this
they sat down to one side and told him what had taken place
addingLet the venerable Maha Kaccana expound it to us
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished
Friends when the Blessed One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the detailed meaning that is Bhikkhus as to the source through which perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation beset a man
if nothing is found there to delight in welcome and hold to this is the end of the underlying tendency to lustthis is the end of resorting to rods and weaponshere these evil unwholesome states cease without remainder I understand the detailed meaning of it to be as follows 
When there is the manifestation of contact it is possible to point out the manifestation of feeling
When there is no ear no sound and no earconsciousness When there is no nose no odour and no noseconsciousness When there is no tongue no flavour and no tongueconsciousness When there is no body no tangible and no bodyconsciousnessWhen there is no mind no mindobject and no mindconsciousness
When there is no manifestation of contact it is impossible to point out the manifestation of feeling
When there is no manifestation of thinking it is impossible to point out the manifestation of being beset by perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation
When there is no manifestation of perception it is impossible to point out the manifestation of thinking
When there is no manifestation of feeling it is impossible to point out the manifestation of perception
it is impossible to point out the manifestation of being beset by perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation
it is possible to point out the manifestation of being beset by perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation
Then venerable sir we went to the venerable Maha Kaccana and asked him about the meaning
so too venerable sir any ableminded bhikkhu in the course of scrutinising with wisdom the meaning of this discourse on the Dhamma would find satisfaction and confidence of mind
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
What eleven
Here a cowherd has no knowledge of form he is unskilled in characteristics he fails to pick out flies eggs he fails to dress wounds he fails to smoke out the sheds he does not know the watering place he does not know what it is to have drunk he does not know the road he is unskilled in pastures he milks dry
and he shows no extra veneration to those bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd
So too bhikkhus when a bhikkhu possesses eleven qualities he is incapable of growth increase and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline
What eleven
Here a bhikkhu has no knowledge of form he is unskilled in characteristics he fails to pick out flies eggs he fails to dress wounds he fails to smoke out the sheds he does not know the watering place he does not know what it is to have drunk he does not know the road he is unskilled in pastures he milks dry
How has a bhikkhu no knowledge of form
Here a bhikkhu does not understand as it actually is thus All material form of whatever kind consists of the four great elements and the material form derived from the four great elements
That is how a bhikkhu has no knowledge of form
How is a bhikkhu unskilled in characteristics
Here a bhikkhu does not understand as it actually is thus A fool is characterised by his actions a wise man is characterised by his actions
Here when a thought of sensual desire has arisen a bhikkhu tolerates it he does not abandon it remove it do away with it and annihilate it
When a thought of ill will has arisenWhen a thought of cruelty has arisen When evil unwholesome states have arisen a bhikkhu tolerates them he does not abandon them remove them do away with them and annihilate them
That is how a bhikkhu fails to pick out flies eggs
How does a bhikkhu fail to dress wounds
Here on seeing a form with the eye a bhikkhu grasps at its signs and features
Even though when he leaves the eye faculty unguarded evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him he does not practise the way of its restraint he does not guard the eye faculty he does not undertake the restraint of the eye faculty
On hearing a sound with the earOn smelling an odour with the noseOn tasting a flavour with the tongueOn touching a tangible with the body On cognizing a mindobject with the mind he grasps at its signs and features
Even though when he leaves the mind faculty unguarded evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him he does not practise the way of its restraint he does not guard the mind faculty he does not undertake the restraint of the mind faculty
That is how a bhikkhu fails to dress wounds
How does a bhikkhu fail to smoke out the sheds
Here a bhikkhu does not teach others in detail the Dhamma as he has learned it and mastered it
That is how a bhikkhu fails to smoke out the sheds
How does a bhikkhu not know the watering place
Here a bhikkhu does not go from time to time to those bhikkhus who have learned much who are well versed in the tradition who maintain the Dhamma the Discipline and the Codesand he does not enquire and ask questions of them thus How is this venerable sir
What is the meaning of this
These venerable ones do not reveal to him what has not been revealed do not clarify what is not clear or remove his doubts about the numerous things that give rise to doubt
That is how a bhikkhu does not know the watering place
How does a bhikkhu not know what it is to have drunk
Here when the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata is being taught a bhikkhu does not gain inspiration in the meaning does not gain inspiration in the Dhamma does not gain gladness connected with the Dhamma
How does a bhikkhu not know the road
Here a bhikkhu does not understand the Noble Eightfold Path as it actually is
That is how a bhikkhu does not know the road
How is a bhikkhu unskilled in pastures
Here a bhikkhu does not understand the four foundations of mindfulness as they actually are
That is how a bhikkhu is unskilled in pastures
How does a bhikkhu milk dry
Here when faithful householders invite a bhikkhu to take as much as he likes of robes almsfood resting places and medicinal requisites the bhikkhu does not know moderation in accepting
That is how a bhikkhu milks dry
How does a bhikkhu show no extra veneration to those elder bhikkhus of longstanding who have long gone forth the fathers and leaders of the Sangha
Here a bhikkhu does not maintain bodily acts of lovingkindness both openly and privately towards those elder bhikkhus he does not maintain verbal acts of lovingkindness towards them both openly and privately he does not maintain mental acts of lovingkindness towards them both openly and privately
That is how a bhikkhu shows no extra veneration to those elder bhikkhus of longstanding who have long gone forth the fathers and leaders of the Sangha
When a bhikkhu possesses these eleven qualities he is incapable of growth increase and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline
Bhikkhus when a cowherd possesses eleven factors he is capable of keeping and rearing a herd of cattle
What eleven
Here a cowherd has knowledge of form he is skilled in characteristics he picks out flies eggs he dresses wounds he smokes out the sheds he knows the watering place he knows what it is to have drunk he knows the road he is skilled in pastures he does not milk dry

Here a bhikkhu understands as it actually is thus A fool is characterised by his actions a wise man is characterised by his actions
That is how a bhikkhu is skilled in characteristics
How does a bhikkhu pick out flies eggs
Here when a thought of sensual desire has arisen a bhikkhu does not tolerate it he abandons it removes it does away with it and annihilates it
When a thought of ill will has arisenWhen a thought of cruelty has arisenWhen evil unwholesome states have arisen a bhikkhu does not tolerate them he abandons them removes them does away with them and annihilates them
That is how a bhikkhu picks out flies eggs
How does a bhikkhu dress wounds
Here on seeing a form with the eye a bhikkhu does not grasp at its signs and features
Since if he left the eye faculty unguarded evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him he practises the way of its restraint he guards the eye faculty he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty
On hearing a sound with the earOn smelling an odour with the noseOn tasting a flavour with the tongue On touching a tangible with the body On cognizing a mindobject with the mind a bhikkhu does not grasp at its signs and features

How does a bhikkhu smoke out the sheds
Here a bhikkhu teaches others in detail the Dhamma as he has learned it and mastered it
That is how a bhikkhu smokes out the sheds
How does a bhikkhu know the watering place
Here a bhikkhu goes from time to time to such bhikkhus who have learned much who are well versed in the tradition who maintain the Dhamma the Discipline and the Codes and he enquires and asks questions of them thus How is this venerable sir
What is the meaning of this
These venerable ones reveal to him what has not been revealed clarify what is not clear and remove his doubts about the numerous things that give rise to doubt
That is how a bhikkhu knows the watering place
How does a bhikkhu know what it is to have drunk
Here when the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata is being taught a bhikkhu gains inspiration in the meaning gains inspiration in the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the Dhamma

Here a bhikkhu maintains bodily acts of lovingkindness both openly and privately towards those elder bhikkhus he maintains verbal acts of lovingkindness towards them both openly and privately he maintains mental acts of lovingkindness towards them both openly and privately
Bhikkhus when a cowherd possesses eleven factors he is incapable of keeping and rearing a herd of cattle
When a cowherd possesses these eleven factors he is incapable of keeping and rearing a herd of cattle
and he shows no extra veneration to those elder bhikkhus of longstanding who have long gone forth the fathers and leaders of the Sangha
That is how a bhikkhu is unskilled in characteristics
How does a bhikkhu fail to pick out flies eggs
That is how a bhikkhu does not know what it is to have drunk
So too bhikkhus when a bhikkhu possesses these eleven qualities he is capable of growth increase and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline

When a bhikkhu possesses these eleven qualities he is capable of growth increase and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
That is how a bhikkhu shows extra veneration to those elder bhikkhus of longstanding who have long gone forth the fathers and leaders of the Sangha
That is how a bhikkhu does not milk dry
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Kajangala in a grove of mukhelu trees
Then the brahmin student Uttara a pupil of the brahmin Parasariya went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
The Blessed One then asked him Uttara does the brahmin Parasariya teach his disciples the development of the faculties
He does Master Gotama
But Uttara how does he teach his disciples the development of the faculties
Here Master Gotama one does not see forms with the eye one does not hear sounds with the ear That is how the brahmin Parasariya teaches his disciples the development of the faculties
If that is so Uttara then a blind man and a deaf man will have developed faculties according to what the brahmin Parasariya says
For a blind man does not see forms with the eye and a deaf man does not hear sounds with the ear
When this was said the brahmin student Uttara Parasariyas pupil sat silent dismayed with shoulders drooping and head down glum and without response
Then knowing this the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda Ananda the brahmin Parasariya teaches his disciples the development of the faculties in one way but in the Noble Ones Discipline the supreme development of the faculties is otherwise
Now is the time Blessed One now is the time Sublime One for the Blessed One to teach the supreme development of the faculties in the Noble Ones Discipline
Having heard it from the Blessed One the bhikkhus will remember it
Then listen Ananda and attend closely to what I shall say
Yes venerable sir he replied
The Blessed One said this
Here Ananda when a bhikkhu sees a form with the eye there arises in him what is agreeable there arises what is disagreeable there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable
But that is conditioned gross dependently arisen
The agreeable that arose the disagreeable that arose and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease in him and equanimity is established
He understands thus
Just as a strong man might easily snap his fingers so too concerning anything at all the agreeable that arose the disagreeable that arose and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly just as rapidly just as easily and equanimity is established This is called in the Noble Ones Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding sounds cognizable by the ear
Again Ananda when a bhikkhu smells an odour with the nose there arises in him what is agreeable there arises what is disagreeable there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable
He understands thus
Just as raindrops on a slightly sloping lotus leaf roll off and do not remain there so too concerning anything at all the agreeable that arose the disagreeable that arose and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly just as rapidly just as easily and equanimity is established This is called in the Noble Ones Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding odours cognizable by the nose
Again Ananda when a bhikkhu tastes a flavour with the tongue there arises in him what is agreeable there arises what is disagreeable there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable
He understands thus
Just as a strong man might easily spit out a ball of spittle collected on the tip of his tongue so too concerning anything at all the agreeable that arose the disagreeable that arose and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly just as rapidly just as easily and equanimity is established This is called in the Noble Ones Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding flavours cognizable by the tongue
Again Ananda when a bhikkhu touches a tangible with the body there arises in him what is agreeable there arises what is disagreeable there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable
He understands thus
Just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm so too concerning anything at all the agreeable that arose the disagreeable that arose and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly just as rapidly just as easily and equanimity is established This is called in the Noble Ones Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding tangibles cognizable by the body
Again Ananda when a bhikkhu cognizes a mindobject with the mind there arises in him what is agreeable there arises what is disagreeable there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable
He understands thus
Just as if a man were to let two or three drops of water fall onto an iron plate heated for a whole day
the falling of the drops might be slow but they would quickly vaporise and vanish so too concerning anything at all the agreeable that arose the disagreeable that arose and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly just as rapidly just as easily and equanimity is established This is called in the Noble Ones Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding ideas cognizable by the mind
That is how there is the supreme development of the faculties in the Noble Ones Discipline
And how Ananda is one a disciple in higher training one who has entered upon the way
Here Ananda when a bhikkhu sees a form with the eye
And how Ananda is one a noble one with developed faculties
Here Ananda when a bhikkhu sees a form with the eyehears a sound with the earsmells an odour with the nosetastes a flavour with the tonguetouches a tangible with the bodycognizes a mindobject with the mind there arises in him what is agreeable there arises what is disagreeable there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable
If he should wish May I abide perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive he abides perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive
If he should wish May I abide perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive he abides perceiving the unrepulsive in that
If he should wish May I abide perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive he abides perceiving the repulsive in that
If he should wish May I avoiding both the repulsive and unrepulsive abide in equanimity mindful and fully aware he abides in equanimity towards that mindful and fully aware That is how one is a noble one with developed faculties
So Ananda the supreme development of the faculties in the Noble Ones Discipline has been taught by me the disciple in higher training who has entered upon the way has been taught by me and the noble one with developed faculties has been taught by me
What should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a Teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them that I have done for you Ananda
There are these roots of trees these empty huts Meditate Ananda do not delay or else you will regret it later
This is our instruction to you
That is what the Blessed One said
The venerable Ananda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Now Ananda how is there the supreme development of the faculties in the Noble Ones Discipline
He understands thus There has arisen in me what is agreeable there has arisen what is disagreeable there has arisen what is both agreeable and disagreeable
this is peaceful this is sublime that is equanimity
Just as a man with good sight having opened his eyes might shut them or having shut his eyes might open them so too concerning anything at all the agreeable that arose the disagreeable that arose and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly just as rapidly just as easily and equanimity is established This is called in the Noble Ones Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding forms cognizable by the eye 
Again Ananda when a bhikkhu hears a sound with the ear there arises in him what is agreeable there arises what is disagreeable there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable
and equanimity is established
and equanimity is established
and equanimity is established
hears a sound with the earsmells an odour with the nosetastes a flavour with the tonguetouches a tangible with the bodycognizes a mindobject with the mind there arises in him what is agreeable there arises what is disagreeable there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable
he is ashamed humiliated and disgusted by the agreeable that arose by the disagreeable that arose and by the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose
That is how one is a disciple in higher training one who has entered upon the way
If he should wish May I abide perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive he abides perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive
and equanimity is established
and equanimity is established
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Vajjian country at Ukkacela on the banks of the river Ganges
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
Then the cattle bunched together in midstream in the river Ganges and they met with calamity and disaster
Why was that
Because that foolish Magadhan cowherd in the last month of the rainy season in the autumn without examining the near shore or the further shore of the river Ganges drove his cattle across to the other shore in the Videhan country at a place that had no ford
So too bhikkhus as to those recluses and brahmins who are unskilled in this world and the other world unskilled in Maras realm and what is outside Maras realm unskilled in the realm of Death and what is outside the realm of Death  it will lead to the harm and suffering for a long time of those who think they should listen to them and place faith in them
Bhikkhus there was once a wise Magadhan cowherd who in the last month of the rainy season in the autumn after examining the near shore and the further shore of the river Ganges drove his cattle across to the other shore in the Videhan country at a place that had a ford
He made the bulls the fathers and leaders of the herd enter first
and they breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore
He made the strong cattle and the cattle to be tamed enter next
and they too breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore
He made the heifers and young oxen enter next
Why was that
Because that wise Magadhan cowherd in the last month of the rainy season in the autumn after examining the near shore and the further shore of the river Ganges drove his cattle across to the other shore in the Videhan country at a place that had a ford
So too bhikkhus as to those recluses and brahmins who are skilled in this world and the other world skilled in Maras realm and what is outside Maras realm skilled in the realm of Death and what is outside the realm of Death  it will lead to the welfare and happiness for a long time of those who think they should listen to them and place faith in them
Bhikkhus just as the bulls the fathers and leaders of the herd breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore so too those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed who have lived the holy life done what had to be done laid down the burden reached the true goal destroyed the fetters of being and are completely liberated through final knowledge  by breasting Maras stream they have gotten safely across to the further shore
Just as the strong cattle and the cattle to be tamed breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore so too those bhikkhus who with the destruction of the five lower fetters will reappear spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world  by breasting Maras stream they will get safely across to the further shore
Just as the heifers and young oxen breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore so too those bhikkhus who with the destruction of three fetters and with the attenuation of lust hate and delusion are oncereturners returning once to this world to make an end of suffering  by breasting Maras stream they too will get safely across to the further shore
Just as the calves and the feeble cattle breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore so too those bhikkhus who with the destruction of three fetters are streamenterers no longer subject to perdition bound for delivernce  headed for enlightenment  by breasting Maras stream they too will get safely across to the further shore
Just as that tender calf just born being urged on by its mothers lowing also breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore so too those bhikkhus who are Dhammafollowers and faithfollowers  by breasting Maras stream they too will get safely across to the further shore
It will lead to the welfare and happiness for a long time of those who think they should listen to me and place faith in me
That is what the Blessed One said
When the Sublime One had said that the Teacher said further
Bhikkhus there was once a foolish Magadhan cowherd who in the last month of the rainy season in the autumn without examining the near shore or the further shore of the river Ganges drove his cattle across to the other shore in the Videhan country at a place that had no ford
At the time there was a tender calf just born and being urged on by its mothers lowing it too breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore
and they too breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore
He made the calves and the feeble cattle enter next
and they too breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore
Bhikkhus I am skilled in this world and in the other world skilled in Maras realm and in what is outside Maras realm skilled in the realm of Death and in what is outside the realm of Death
Rejoice then bhikkhus mightily And set your hearts where safety lies
For Maras stream is breasted now Its current blocked its reeds removed
Both this world and the world beyond Are well described by the one who knows
And what is still in Maras reach And what is out of reach of Death
Knowing directly all the world The Enlightened One who understands
Opened the door to the deathless state By which Nibbana may be safely reached
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
Then when it was evening the venerable Sariputta rose from meditation and went to the Blessed One After paying homage to him he sat down at one side
The Blessed One then said to him
Sariputta your faculties are clear The colour of your skin is pure and bright
What abiding do you often abide in now Sariputta
Now venerable sir I often abide in voidness
Good good Sariputta
Now indeed you often abide in the abiding of a great man
For this is the abiding of a great man namely voidness
If by so reviewing he knows thus On the path by which I went to the village for alms or in the place where I wandered for alms or on the path by which I returned from the almsround there was desire lust hate delusion or aversion in my mind regarding forms cognizable by the eye then he should make an effort to abandon those evil unwholesome states
But if by reviewing he knows thus On the path by which I went to the village for alms and in the place where I wandered for alms and on the path by which I returned from the almsround there was no desire lust hate delusion or aversion in my mind regarding forms cognizable by the eye then he can abide happy and glad training day and night in wholesome states
Again Sariputta a bhikkhu should consider thus On the path by which I went to the village for alms or in the place where I wandered for alms or on the path by which I returned from the almsround was there any desire lust hate delusion or aversion in my mind regarding sounds cognizable by the ear regarding odours cognizable by the nose regarding flavours cognizable by the tongue regarding tangibles cognizable by the body regarding mindobjects cognizable by the mind
If by reviewing he knows thus On the path by which I went to the village for almsthere was desire lust hate delusion or aversion in my mind regarding mindobjects cognizable by the mind then he should make an effort to abandon those evil unwholesome states
But if by reviewing he knows thus On the path by which I went to the village for almsthere was no desire lust hate delusion or aversion in my mind regarding mindobjects cognizable by the mind then he can abide happy and glad training day and night in wholesome states
Again Sariputta a bhikkhu should consider thus Are the five cords of sensual pleasure abandoned in me
If by reviewing he knows thus The five cords of sensual pleasure are not abandoned in me then he should make an effort to abandon those five cords of sensual pleasure
But if by reviewing he knows thus The five cords of sensual pleasure are abandoned in me then he can abide happy and glad training day and night in wholesome states
Again Sariputta a bhikkhu should consider thus Are the five hindrances abandoned in me
If by reviewing he knows thus The five hindrances are not abandoned in me then he should make an effort to abandon those five hindrances
But if by reviewing he knows thus The five hindrances are abandoned in me then he can abide happy and glad training day and night in wholesome states
Again Sariputta a bhikkhu should consider thus Are the five aggregates affected by clinging fully understood by me
If by reviewing he knows thus The five aggregates affected by clinging are not fully understood by me then he should make an effort to fully understand those five aggregates affected by clinging
But if by reviewing he knows thus The five aggregates affected by clinging are fully understood by me then he can abide happy and glad training day and night in wholesome states
Again Sariputta a bhikkhu should consider thus Are the four foundations of mindfulness developed in me
If by reviewing he knows thus The four foundations of mindfulness are not developed in me then he should make an effort to develop those four foundations of mindfulness
But if by reviewing he knows thus The four foundations of mindfulness are developed in me then he can abide happy and glad training day and night in wholesome states
Again Sariputta a bhikkhu should consider thus Are the four right kinds of striving developed in me
Are the four bases for spiritual power developed in me
Are the five faculties developed in me
Are the five powers developed in me
Are the seven enlightenment factors developed in me
Is the Noble Eightfold Path developed in me
Are serenity and insight developed in me
If by reviewing he knows thus Serenity and insight are not developed in me then he should make an effort to develop them
But if by reviewing he knows thus Serenity and insight are developed in me then he can abide happy and glad training day and night in wholesome states
Again Sariputta a bhikkhu should consider thus Are true knowledge and deliverance realised by me
If by reviewing he knows thus True knowledge and deliverance are not realised by me then he should make an effort to realise true knowledge and deliverance
But if by reviewing he knows thus True knowledge and deliverance are realised by me then he can abide happy and glad training day and night in wholesome states 
Whatever recluses and brahmins in the future will purify their almsfood will all do so by repeatedly reviewing thus
Whatever recluses and brahmins in the present are purifying their almsfood are all doing so by repeatedly reviewing thus
Therefore Sariputta you should train thus We will purify our almsfood by repeatedly reviewing thus
The venerable Sariputta was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
 So Sariputta if a bhikkhu should wish May I now often abide in voidness he should consider thus On the path by which  went to the village for alms or in the place where I wandered for alms or on the path by which I returned from the almsround was there any desire lust hate delusion or aversion in my mind regarding forms cognizable by the eye
Sariputta whatever recluses and brahmins in the past have purified their almsfood have all done so by repeatedly reviewing thus
That is what the Blessed One said
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and eventually arrived at a Kosalan village named Nagaravinda
The brahmin householders of Nagaravinda heard The recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and has come to Nagaravinda
Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect That Blessed One is accomplished fully enlightened
Now it is good to see such arahants
Then the brahmin householders of Nagaravinda went to the Blessed One Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side
When they were seated the Blessed One said to them 
you should answer them thus Those recluses and brahmins who are not rid of lust hate and delusion regarding forms cognizable by the eye whose minds are not inwardly peaceful and who conduct themselves now righteously now unrighteously in body speech and mind  such recluses and brahmins should not be honoured respected revered and venerated
Why is that
Because we ourselves are not rid of lust hate and delusion regarding forms cognizable by the eye our minds are not inwardly peaceful and we conduct ourselves now righteously now unrighteously in body speech and mind
Since we do not see any higher righteous conduct on the part of those good recluses and brahmins they should not be honoured respected revered and venerated
Those recluses and brahmins who are not rid of lust hate and delusion regarding sounds cognizable by the earregarding odours cognizable by the noseregarding flavours cognizable by the tongueregarding tangibles cognizable by the bodyregarding mindobjects cognizable by the mind whose minds are not inwardly peaceful and who conduct themselves now righteously now unrighteously in body speech and mindshould not be honoured
But householders if wanderers of other sects ask you thus Householders what kind of recluses and brahmins should be honoured respected revered and venerated
you should answer them thus Those recluses and brahmins who are rid of lust hate and delusion regarding forms cognizable by the eye whose minds are inwardly peaceful and who conduct themselves righteously in body speech and mind  such recluses and brahmins should be honoured respected revered and venerated
Because we ourselves are not rid of lust hate and delusion regarding forms cognizable by the eye our minds are not inwardly peaceful and we conduct ourselves now righteously now unrighteously in body speech and mind
Those recluses and brahmins who are rid of lust hate and delusion regarding sounds cognizable by the earregarding odours cognizable by the noseregarding flavours cognizable by the tongueregarding tangibles cognizable by the bodyregarding mindobjects cognizable by the mind whose minds are inwardly peaceful and who conduct themselves righteously in body speech and mindshould be honoured
Householders if wanderers of other sects ask you thus But what are your reasons and what is your evidence regarding those venerable ones whereby you say about them Surely these venerable ones are either rid of lust or are practising for the removal of lust they are either rid of hate or are practising for the removal of hate
 being asked thus you should answer those wanderers of other sects thus It is because those venerable ones resort to remote junglethicket resting places in the forest
For there are no forms cognizable by the eye there of a kind that they could look at and delight in There are no sounds cognizable by the ear there of a kind that they could listen to and delight in There are no odours cognizable by the nose there of a kind that they could smell and delight in There are no flavours cognizable by the tongue there of a kind that they could taste and delight in There are no tangibles cognizable by the body there of a kind that they could touch and delight in
These are our reasons friends this is our evidence whereby we say about those venerable ones Surely these venerable ones are either rid of lust hate and delusion or are practising for their removal
Being thus asked householders you should answer those wanderers of other sects in this way
When this was said the brahmin householders of Nagaravinda said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama
Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight to see forms
From today let Master Gotama accept us as lay followers who have gone to him for refuge for life
he reveals a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure
some extended their hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down at one side
some exchanged greetihgs with him and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished sat down at one side
some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed Ones presence and sat down at one side
some kept silent and sat down at one side
Householders if wanderers of other sects ask you thus Householders what kind of recluses and brahmins should not be honoured respected revered and venerated
Why is that
We go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
 at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time the venerable Upananda the son of the Sakyans was lying down on a high couch
Then the lord as he was touring the lodgings together with several monks came up to the dwellingplace of the venerable Upananda the son of the Sakyans
The venerable Upananda the son of the Sakyans saw the lord coming from afar
Then the lord having turned back from there addressed the monks saying Monks the foolish man should be spoken to about his abode
Then the lord having in many a figure rebuked the venerable Upananda the son of the Sakyans for his difficulty in maintaining himself   And thus monks this rule of training should be set forth
When a new couch or chair is being made for a monk the legs should be made eight fingerbreadths according to the accepted fingerbreadth except for the knotched ends below In exceeding this  there is an offence of expiation involving cutting down
New means it is so called with reference to the making
Couch means there are four couch a long one one with slats one with curved legs one with removable legs
Chair means there are four chair a long one one with slats one with curved legs one with removable legs
Is being made means making or causing to be made
The legs should be made eight fingerbreadths according to the accepted fingerbreadth except for the knotched ends below means setting aside the knotched ends below If he makes it or causes it to be made exceeding this  in the business there is an offence of wrongdoing having cut it down on acquisition an offence of expiation is to be confessed
If what was incompletely executed by himself he has finished by himself  see BuPc 
If he makes it or causes it to be made for another there is an offence of wrongdoing
If having acquired what was made for another he makes use of it there is an offence of wrongdoing
There is no offence if he makes it to the measure if he makes it less than the measure if having acquired what was made for another exceeding the measure having cut it down he makes use of it if he is mad if he is the first wrongdoer
and seeing him he spoke thus to the lord Lord let the lord come let him lie down on my bed
If he makes others finish what was incompletely executed by others there is an offence of expiation
they are either rid of delusion or are practising for the removal of delusion
Since we do not see any higher righteous conduct on the part of those good recluses and brahmins they should not be honoured respected revered and venerated
Being thus asked householders you should answer those wanderers of other sects in this way
Since we see higher righteous conduct on the part of those good recluses and brahmins they should be honoured respected revered and venerated
Since we see higher righteous conduct on the part of those good recluses and brahmins they should be honoured respected revered and venerated
Being thus asked householders you should answer those wanderers of other sects in this way
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at SavatthI in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this  Bhikkhus I shall teach you a discourse on the great sixfold base
Listen and attend closely to what I shall say
 Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this
When one abides inflamed by lust fettered infatuated contemplating gratification then the five aggregates affected by clinging are built up for oneself in the future
Ones bodily and mental troubles increase ones bodily and mental torments increase ones bodily and mental fevers increase
When one does not know and see the ear as it actually is When one does not know and see the nose as it actually is When one does not know and see the tongue as it actually is When one does not know and see the body as it actually is When one does not know and see the mind as it actually is
Bhikkhus when one knows and sees the eye as it actually is when one knows and sees forms as they actually are when one knows and sees eyeconsciousness as it actually is when one knows and sees eyecontact as it actually is when one knows and sees as it actually is the feeling felt as pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant that arises with eyecontact as condition then one is not inflamed by lust for the eye for forms for eyeconsciousness for eyecontact for the feeling felt as pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant that arises with eyecontact as condition
When one abides uninflamed by lust unfettered uninfatuated contemplating danger then the five aggregates affected by clinging are diminished for oneself in the future and ones craving 
Ones bodily and mental troubles are abandoned ones bodily and mental torments are abandoned ones bodily and mental fevers are abandoned
The view of a person such as this is right view His intention is right intention his effort is right effort his mindfulness is right mindfulness his concentration is right concentration
But his bodily action his verbal action and his livelihood have already been well purified earlier
When he develops this Noble Eightfold Path the four foundations of mindfulness also come to fulfilment in him by development the four right kinds of striving also come to fulfilment in him by development the four bases for spiritual power also come to fulfilment in him by development the five faculties also come to fulfilment in him by development the five powers also come to fulfilment in him by development the seven enlightenment factors also come to fulfilment in him by development
These two things  serenity and insight  occur in him yoked evenly together
He abandons by direct knowledge those things that should be abandoned by direct knowledge
He develops by direct knowledge those things that should be developed by direct knowledge
He realises by direct knowledge those things that should be realised by direct knowledge
The answer to that is the five aggregates affected by clinging that is the material form aggregate affected by clinging the feeling aggregate affected by clinging the perception aggregate affected by clinging the formations aggregate affected by clinging the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging
These are the things that should be fully understood by direct knowledge
And what things should be abandoned by direct knowledge
Ignorance and craving for being These are the things that should be abandoned by direct knowledge
And what things should be developed by direct knowledge
Serenity and insight These are the things that should be developed by direct knowledge
And what things should be realised by direct knowledge
True knowledge and deliverance These are the things that should be realised by direct knowledge
When one knows and sees the ear as it actually isThese are the things that should be realised by direct knowledge  When one knows and sees the nose as it actually is These are the things that should be realised by direct knowledge  When one knows and sees the tongue as it actually isThese are the things that should be realised by direct knowledge  When one knows and sees the body as it actually isThese are the things that should be realised by direct knowledge  When one knows and sees the mind as it actually is
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Bhikkhus when one does not know and see the eye as it actually is when one does not know and see forms as they actually are when one does not know and see eyeconsciousness as it actually is when one does not know and see eyecontact as it actually is when one does not know and see as it actually is the feeling felt as pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant that arises with eyecontact as condition then one is inflamed by lust for the eye for forms for eyeconsciousness for eyecontact for the feeling felt as pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant that arises with eyecontact as condition
and ones craving  which brings renewal of being is accompanied by delight and lust and delights in this and that  increases
and one experiences bodily and mental suffering
one experiences bodily and mental suffering
which brings renewal of being is accompanied by delight and lust and delights in this or that  is abandoned
and one experiences bodily and mental pleasure
Thus this Noble Eightfold Path comes to fulfilment in him by development
He fully understands by direct knowledge those things that should be fully understood by direct knowledge
And what things should be fully understood by direct knowledge
These are the things that should be realised by direct knowledge
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthl in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Then when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Savatthi for alms
Yes venerable sir the venerable Rahula replied and taking his sitting cloth with him he followed close behind the Blessed One
Now on that occasion many thousands of deities followed the Blessed One thinking Today the Blessed One will lead the venerable Rahula further to the destruction of the taints
Then the Blessed One went into the Blind Mens Grove and sat down at the root of a certain tree on a seat made ready
And the venerable Rahula paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side
The Blessed One then said to the venerable Rahula
Rahula what do you think Is the eye permanent or impermanent
 Impermanent venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness
 Suffering venerable sir
Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self
No venerable sir
Rahula what do you think Are forms
Are any feeling any perception any formations any consciousness that arise with eyecontact as condition permanent or impermanent
 Impermanent venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness
 Suffering venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self
 No venerable sir
Rahula what do you think Is the ear permanent or impermanent
Is the nose permanent or impermanent
Is the tongue permanent or impermanent
 Impermanent venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness
 Suffering venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self
 No venerable sir
Then while the Blessed One was alone in meditation a thought arose in his mind thus The states that ripen in deliverance have ripened in Rahula
Suppose I were to lead him on further to the destruction of the taints
When he had walked for alms in Savatthi and had returned from his almsround after his meal he addressed the venerable Rahula thus Take your sitting cloth with you Rahula let us go to the Blind Mens Grove to pass the day
Is the body permanent or impermanent
After expressing truth in this way by means of the special quality of the True Ideal as extinction he now began to express it with the words The Enlightened One most high a pureness praised doing so by means of the special qualities of the True Ideal as the path
Herein the term Enlightened One is explained in the way beginning  He is the discoverer of the truths   and he is most high since he is supreme and praiseworthy he is enlightened and he is most high thus he is the Enlightened One most high Or alternatively among those enlightened by another who are called Enlightened Ones  he is the most high thus he is  the Enlightened One most high
Such   praised  such as that Enlightened One most high commended and expounded in various instances in the way beginning The eightfold is the best of paths For it leads safe to Deathlessness and  Bhikkhus I shall expound to you the Noble Right Concentration with its support and requisite equipment 
Pureness  entire cleansing owing to its severance of the staining of defilement
Calling it concentration straightresulting  and which he called  straightresulting concentration since it produces its fruit quite certainly straightway next to its own occurrence
for when pathconcentration has arisen there is no obstacle whatever that can prevent the arising of its fruit
according as it is said
And were this person already entered upon the way to realization of the fruit of Stream Entry and were it the time for the aeon to be consumed by fire still the aeon would not be consumed by fire until that person had realized the fruit of Stream Entry This type of person is called a  holderup of an aeon 
and all those possessed of a path are holdersup of an aeon 
No equal is there to such concentration  to such pureness praised by the Enlightened One most high as  straightresulting concentration no formsphere concentration or formlesssphere concentration is there that is its equal at all
Why
Because even if someone is reborn somewhere or other in the world of High Divinity owing to the maintenance of these kinds of mundane concentration in being that still implies his liability to be reborn again perhaps in the hells etc and because when this kind of person is ennobled by maintenance of the Arahants supramundane concentration in being that implies the elimination of all rebirth
That is why it is said next in the Sutta quoted in    Bhikkhus in so far as there are determined True Ideals the Noble Eightfold Path is accounted the foremost of them   and so on
When the Blessed One had thus stated how this straightresulting concentration is unequalled by any other kinds of concentration he now in the way already stated  invoked a TruthUtterance namely This in the True Idea  which has for its support the unequalledness of the path as the True Ideal
Its meaning should be understood in the way already stated
And the command in this stanza was also obeyed by nonhuman beings in a hundred thousand myriad worldsystems
Luminous bhikkhus is this mind
The uninstructed worldling does not understand this as it really is
but it is defiled by adventitious defilements
therefore I say that for the uninstructed worldling there is no development of the mind
therefore I say that for the instructed noble disciple there is development of the mind
The instructed noble disciple understands this as it really is
and it is freed from adventitious defilements
Luminous bhikkhus is this mind
Bhikkhus if for just the time of a finger snap a bhikkhu pursues a mind of lovingkindness he is called a bhikkhu who is not devoid of jhana who acts upon the teaching of the Teacher who responds to his advice and who does not eat the countrys almsfood in vain
How much more then those who cultivate it
Bhikkhus if for just the time of a finger snap a bhikkhu develops a mind of lovingkindness he is called a bhikkhu who is not devoid of jhana who acts upon the teaching of the Teacher who responds to his advice and who does not eat the countrys almsfood in vain
How much more then those who cultivate it
Bhikkhus if for just the time of a finger snap a bhikkhu attends to a mind of lovingkindness he is called a bhikkhu who is not devoid of jhana who acts upon the teaching of the Teacher who responds to his advice and who does not eat the countrys almsfood in vain
How much more then those who cultivate it
Bhikkhus whatever qualities are unwholesome partake of the unwholesome and pertain to the unwholesome all have the mind as their forerunner
Mind arises first followed by the unwholesome qualities
Bhikkhus whatever qualities are wholesome partake of the wholesome and pertain to the wholesome all have the mind as their forerunner
Mind arises first followed by the wholesome qualities
Bhikkhus I do not see a single thing that so causes unarisen unwholesome qualities to arise and arisen wholesome qualities to decline as heedlessness
For one who is heedless unarisen unwholesome qualities arise and arisen wholesome qualities decline
Bhikkhus I do not see a single thing that so causes unarisen wholesome qualities to arise and arisen unwholesome qualities to decline as heedfulness
For one who is heedful unarisen wholesome qualities arise and arisen unwholesome qualities decline
For one who is lazy unarisen unwholesome qualities arise and arisen wholesome qualities decline
Bhikkhus I do not see a single thing that so causes unarisen unwholesome qualities to arise and arisen wholesome qualities to decline as laziness
Bhikkhus there are these four modes of practice
What four
Practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge and practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge
And what bhikkhus is the practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge
Here someone is by nature strongly prone to lust and often experiences pain and dejection born of lust
By nature he is strongly prone to hatred and often experiences pain and dejection born of hatred
By nature he is strongly prone to delusion and often experiences pain and dejection born of delusion
These five faculties arise in him feebly the faculty of faith the faculty of energy the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration and the faculty of wisdom
This is called practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge
And what is practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge
Here someone is by nature strongly prone to lust
hatred
delusion and often experiences pain and dejection born of delusion
These five faculties arise in him prominently the faculty of faith the faculty of wisdom
Because these five faculties are prominent in him he quickly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints
This is called practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge
And what is practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge
Here someone by nature is not strongly prone to lust and does not often experience pain and dejection born of lust
By nature he is not strongly prone to hatred and does not often experience pain and dejection born of hatred
By nature he is not strongly prone to delusion and does not often experience pain and dejection born of delusion
These five faculties arise in him feebly the faculty of faith the faculty of wisdom
Because these five faculties are feeble in him he sluggishly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints
This is called practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge
 And what is practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge
Here someone by nature is not strongly prone to lus t
hatred
delusion and does not often experience pain and dejection born of delusion
These five faculties arise in him prominently the faculty of faith the faculty of wisdom
Because these five faculties are prominent in him he quickly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints
This is called practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge
These bhikkhus are the four modes of practice
Because these five faculties are feeble in him he sluggishly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints
Bhikkhus there are these four modes of practice
What four
Practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge and practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge
And what bhikkhus is practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge
Here a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the body perceiving the repulsiveness of food perceiving nondelight in the entire world contemplating impermanence in all conditioned phenomena and he has the perception of death well established internally
He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers the power of faith the power of moral shame the power of moral dread the power of energy and the power of wisdom
These five faculties arise in him feebly the faculty of faith the faculty of energy the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration and the faculty of wisdom
Because these five faculties are feeble he sluggishly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints
This is called practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge
And what is practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge
Here a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the unattractiveness of the bodyand he has the perception of death well established internally
He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers the power of faiththe power of wisdom
These five faculties arise in him prominently the faculty of faiththe faculty of wisdom
Because these five faculties are prominent he quickly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints
This is called practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge
And what is practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge Here secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhana which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by thought and examination With the subsiding of thought and examination he enters and dwells in the second jhana which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration without thought and examination With the fading away as well of rapture he dwells equanimous and mindful and clearly comprehending he experiences pleasure with the body he enters and dwells in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare He is equanimous mindful one who dwells happily With the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection he enters and dwells in the fourth jhana neither painfull nor pleasant which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity
He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers the power of faiththe power of wisdom
These five faculties arise in him feebly the faculty of faith the faculty of wisdom
Because these five faculties are feeble he sluggishly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints
This is called practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge
And what is practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge Here secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhanathe second jhanathe third jhanathe fourth jhana
He dwells depending upon these five trainee powers the power of faiththe power of wisdom
These five faculties arise in him prominently the faculty of faiththe faculty of wisdom
Because these five faculties are prominent he quickly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints
This is called practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge
These bhikkhus are the four modes of practice
Bhikkhus there are these two kinds of illness
Which two
Bodily illness and mental illness
People are found who can claim to enjoy bodily health for one two three four and five years for ten twenty thirty forty and fifty years and even for a hundred years and more
There are bhikkhus these four illnesses incurred by a monk
What four
Here a bhikkhu has strong desires undergoes distress and is not content with any kind of robe almsfood lodging or medicines and provisions for the sick
He arouses himself strives and makes an effort to obtain recognition and gain honor and praise
He cunningly approaches families cunningly sits down cunningly speaks on the Dhamma and cunningly holds in his excrement and urine
These are the four illnesses incurred by a monk
Therefore bhikkhus you should train yourselves thus We will not have strong desires or undergo distress and we will not be discontent with any kind of robe almsfood lodging and medicines and provisions for the sick We will not submit to evil desires for recognition and for gain honor and praise We will not arouse ourselves strive and make an effort to obtain recognition and gain honor and praise We will patiently endure cold and heat hunger and thirst contact with flies mosquitoes wind the burning sun and serpents rude and offensive ways of speech we will bear up with arisen bodily feelings that are painful racking sharp piercing harrowing disagreeable sapping ones vitality
It is in this way bhikkhus that you should train yourselves
But apart from those whose taints have been destroyed it is hard to find people in the world who can claim to enjoy mental health even for a moment
Because he has strong desires undergoes distress and is not content with any kind of robe almsfood lodging and medicines and provisions for the sick he submits to evil desire for recognition and for gain honor and praise
Bhikkhus there are these four inconceivable matters that one should not try to conceive one who tries to conceive them would reap either madness Or frustration
What four
The domain of the Buddhas is an inconceivable matter that one should not try to conceive one who tries to conceive it would reap either madness or frustration
The domain of one in jhana is an inconceivable matter 
These are the four inconceivable matters that one should not try to conceive one who tries to conceive them would reap either madness or frustration
Speculation about the world is an inconceivable matter that one should not try to conceive one who tries to conceive it would reap either madness Or frustration
The result of kamma is an inconceivable matter 
Are mindobjects
Is mindconsciousness
Is mindcontact
Are any feeling any perception any formations any consciousness that arise with mindcontact as condition permanent or impermanent
Seeing thus Rahula a welltaught noble disciple becomes disenchanted with the eye disenchanted with forms disenchanted with eyeconsciousness disenchanted with eyecontact and disenchanted with any feeling any perception any formations any consciousness that arise with eyecontact as condition
On one occasion the Blessed One Was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park
Then Vappa the Sakyan a disciple of the Niganthas approached the Venerable Mahamoggallana paid homage to him and sat down to one side
The Venerable Mahamoggallana then said to him 
I do see such a possibility Bhante
In the past one did an evil deed whose result has not yet ripened
On that account taints productive of painful feeling might flow in upon a person in some future life
While this conversation between the Venerable Mahamoggallana and Vappa the Sakyan was underway
in the evening the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the attendance hall
The Venerable Mahamoggallana here relates his entire conversation with Vappa the Sakyan concluding
Then the Blessed One said to Vappa the Sakyan If Vappa you would admit what should be admitted and reject what should be rejected and if when you do not understand the meaning of my words you would question me about them further saying How is this Bhante What is the meaning of this  then we might discuss this
Bhante I will admit to the Blessed One what should be admitted and rejectwhat should be rejected and when I do not understand the meaning of his words I will question him about them further saying How is this Bhante What is the meaning of this
So lets discuss this
What do you think Vappa Those taints distressing and feverish that might arise because of bodily undertakings do not occur when one refrains from them
He does not create any new kamma and he terminates the old kamma having contacted it again and again The wearing away is directly visible immediate inviting one to come and see applicable to be personally experienced by the wise
Do you see Vappa anything on account of Which taints productive of painful feeling might flow in upon such a person in future lives
No Bhante
What do you think Vappa Those taints distressing and feverish that might arise b ecause of verbal undertakings do not occur when one refrains from them
H e does not create any new kamma and he terminates the old kamma having contacted it again and again
The wearing away is directly visible immediate inviting one to come and see applicable to be personally experienced by the wise
Do you see Vappa anything on account of which taints productive of painful feeling might flow in upon such a person in future lives
No Bhante
What do you think Vappa Those taints distressing and feverish that might arise because of mental undertakings do not occur when one refrains from them
He does not create any new kamma and he terminates the old kamma having contacted it again and again
The wearing away is directly visible immediate inviting one to come and see applicable to be personally experienced by the wise
Do you see Vappa anything on account of which taints productive of painful feeling might flow in upon such a person in future lives
No Bhante
What do you think Vappa With the fading away of ignorance and the arising of true knowledge those taints distressing and feverish that arise with ignorance as condition no longer occur
He does not create any new kamma and he terminates the old kamma having contacted it again and again
The wearing away is directly visible immediate inviting one to come and see applicable to be personally experienced by the wise
Do you see Vappa anything on account of which taints productive of painful feeling might flow in upon such a person in future lives
No  Bhante
A bhikkhu thus perfectly liberated in mind Vappa achieves six constant dwellings
Having seen a form with the eye he is neither joyful nor saddened but dwells equanimous mindful and clearly comprehending
Having heard a sound with the ear Having smelled an odor with the nose Having experienced a taste with the tongue Having felt a tactile object with the body Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind he is neither joyful nor saddened but dwells equanimous mindful and clearly comprehending
When he feels a feeling terminating with the body he understands I feel a feeling terminating with the body When he feels a feeling terminating with life he understands I feel a feeling terminating with life He understands With the breakup of the body following the exhaustion of life all that is felt not being delighted in will become cool right here
Suppose Vappa a shadow is seen on account of a stump
Then a man would come along bringing a shovel and a basket
He would cut down the stump at its foot
dig it up and pull out the roots
even the fine rootlets and rootfibiers
He would cut the stump into pieces
split the pieces and reduce thiem to slivers
So too Vappa a bhikkhu thus perfectly liberated in mind achieves six constant dwellings
Having seen a form with the eye
When he feels a feeling terminating with the body he understands With the breakup of the body following the exhaustion of life all that is felt not being delighted in will become cool right here
When this was Said Vappa the Sakyan a disciple of the Niganthas said to the Blessed One Suppose Bhante there was a man in quest of profit who raised horses for sale
but he would not gain a profit and instead would only reap weariness and distress
Just so in quest of profit I attended upon the foolish Niganthas
Excellent Bhante  Let the Blessed One consider me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life
Here Vappa if one is restrained by body speech and mind then with the fading away of ignorance and the arising of true knowledge
do you see anything on account of which taints productive of painful feeling might flow in upon such a person in future lives
He sat down on the appointed seat and said to the Venerable Mahamoggallana
What Moggallana was the discussion that you were engaged in just now And what was the conversation of yours that was underway
This Bhante was the conversation I was having with Vappa the Sakyan when the Blessed One arrived
Then he would dry the slivers in the wind and sun
burn them in a fire and reduce them to ashes
Having done so he would winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried away by the swift current of a river
Thus the shadow that depended on that stump would be cut off at the root made like a palm stump obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising
Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind he is neither joyful nor saddened but dwells equanimous mindful and clearly comprehending
but I did not gain a profit and instead only reaped weariness and distress
Starting today whatever confidence I had in the foolish Niganthas I winnow in a strong wind or let it be carried away by the current of a river
Bhikkhus there are these four kinds of kamma proclaimed by me after I realized them for myself with direct knowledge
What four
There is dark kamma with dark result there is bright kamma with bright result there is darkandbright kamma with darkandbright result and there is kamma that is neither dark nor bright wth neitherdarknorbright result kamma that leads to the destruction of kamma
And what bhikkhus is dark kamma with dark result
Here someone performs an afflictive bodily volitional activity an afflictive verbal volitional activity an afflictive mental volitional activity
As a consequence he is reborn in an afflictive world
When he is reborn in such a world afflictive contacts touch him
Being touched by afflictive contacts he feels afflictive feelings exclusively painful as in the case of hell beings
This is called dark kamma with dark result
And what is bright kamma with bright result
Here someone performs a nonafflictive bodily volitional activity a nonafflictive verbal volitional activity a nonafflictive mental volitional activity
As a consequence he is reborn in a nonafflictive world
When he is reborn in such a world nonafflictive contacts touch him
Being touched by nonafflictive contacts he feels nonafflictive feelings exclusively pleasant as in the case of the devas of refulgent glory
This is called bright kamma with bright result
And what is darkandbright kamma with darkand bright result
Here someone performs a bodily volitional activity that is both afflictive and nonafflictive a verbal volitional activity that is both afflictive and nonafflictive a mental volitional activity that is both afflictive and honafflictive
As a consequence he is reborn in a world that is both afflictive and nonafflictive
When he is reborn in such a world contacts that are both afflictive and nonafflictive touch him
Being touched by contacts that are both afflictive and nonafflictive he feels feelings that are both afflictive and nonafflictive mingled pleasure and pain as in the case of human beings and some devas andsome beings in the lower worlds
This is called darkandbright kamma with darkandbright result
And what is kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neitherdarknorbright result kamma that leads to the destruction of kamma
The volition for abandoning the kind of kamma that is dark with dark result the volition for abandoning the kind of kamma that is bright with bright result and the volition for abandoning the kind of kamma that is dark and bright with d arkandbright result this is called kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neitherdarknorbright result kamma that leads to the destruction of kamma
These bhikkhus are the four kinds of kamma proclaimed by me after I realized them for myself with direct knowledge
He becomes disenchanted with the earHe becomes disenchanted with the noseHe becomes disenchanted with the tongueHe becomes disenchanted with the bodyHe becomes disenchanted with the mind disenchanted with mindobjects disenchanted with mindconsciousness disenchanted with mindcontact and disenchanted with any feeling any perception any formations any consciousness that arise with mindcontact as condition
Being disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion his mind is liberated
When it is liberated there comes the knowledge It is liberated He understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
That is what the Blessed One said
The venerable Rahula was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Now while this discourse was being spoken through not clinging the venerable Rahulas mind was liberated from the taints
And in those many thousands of deities there arose the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma All that is subject to arising is subject to cessation
Is eyeconsciousness
Is eyecontact
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Then Mahapajapati Gotami together with five hundred bhikkhunis went to the Blessed One
After paying homage to the Blessed One she stood at one side and said to him Venerable sir let the Blessed One advise the bhikkhunis let the Blessed One instruct the bhikkhunis let the Blessed One give the bhikkhunis a talk on the Dhamma
Now on that occasion the elder bhikkhus were taking turns in advising the bhikkhunis
Venerable sir it is the venerable Nandakas turn to advise the bhikkhunis
Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Nandaka Advise the bhikkhunis Nandaka Instruct the bhikkhunis Nandaka Give the bhikkhunis a talk on the Dhamma brahmin
Yes venerable sir the venerable Nandaka replied Then in the morning the venerable Nandaka dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Savatthi for alms
The bhikkhunis saw the venerable Nandaka coming in the distance
The venerable Nandaka sat down on the seat made ready
The bhikkhunis paid homage to him and sat down at one side
When they were seated the venerable Nandaka told the bhikkhunis  Sisters this talk will be in the form of questions
When you understand you should say We understand when you do not understand you should say We do not understand
Venerable sir we are satisfied and pleased with the master Nandaka for inviting us in this way
Sisters what do you think Is the eye permanent or impermanent
 Impermanent venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness
 Suffering venerable sir
Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self
No venerable sir
Sisters what do you think Is the ear
Impermanent venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness
 Suffering venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self
 No venerable sir
Why is that
Because venerable sir we have already seen this well as it actually is with proper wisdom thus These six internal bases are impermanent
Good good sisters
So it is with a noble disciple who sees this as it actually is with proper wisdom
Sisters what do you think Are forms
 Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness
 Suffering venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self
 No venerable sir
Why is that
Because venerable sir we have already seen this well as it actually is with proper wisdom thus These six external bases are impermanent
Good good sisters
So it is with a noble disciple who sees this as it actually is with proper wisdom
Sisters what do you think Is eyeconsciousness
 Impermanent venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness
 Suffering venerable sir
 Is what is impermanent suffering and subject to change fit to be regarded thus This is mine this I am this is my self
 No venerable sir
Why is that
Because venerable sir we have already seen this well as it actually is with proper wisdom thus These six classes of consciousness are impermanent
Good good sisters
So it is with a noble disciple who sees this as it actually is with proper wisdom
Sisters suppose an oillamp is burning its oil is impermanent and subject to change its wick is impermanent and subject to change its flame is impermanent and subject to change and its radiance is impermanent and subject to change
Now would anyone be speaking rightly who spoke thus While this oillamp is burning its oil wick and flame are impermanent and subject to change but its radiance is permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change
No venerable sir
Why is that
Because venerable sir while that oillamp is burning its oil wick and flame are impermanent and subject to change so its radiance must be impermanent and subject to change
So too sisters would anyone be speaking rightly who spoke thus These six internal bases are impermanent and subject to change but the pleasant painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling that one experiences in dependence upon the six internal bases is permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change
No venerable sir
Why is that
Because each feeling arises in dependence upon its corresponding condition
Good good sisters
So it is with a noble disciple who sees this as it actually is with proper wisdom
Sisters suppose a great tree is standing possessed of heartwood its root is impermanent and subject to change its trunk is impermanent and subject to change its branches and foliage are impermanent and subject to change and its shadow is impermanent and subject to change
Now would anyone be speaking rightly who spoke thus The root trunk branches and foliage of this great tree standing possessed of heartwood are impermanent and subject to change but its shadow is permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change
No venerable sir
Why is that
Because venerable sir the root trunk branches and foliage of this great tree standing possessed of heartwood are impermanent and subject to change so its shadow must be impermanent and subject to change
So too sisters would anyone be speaking rightly who spoke thus These six external bases are impermanent and subject to change
No venerable sir
Why is that
Because each feeling arises in dependence upon its corresponding condition
Good good sisters
So it is with a noble disciple who sees this as it actually is with proper wisdom
Sisters suppose a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to kill a cow and carve it up with a sharp butchers knife Without damaging the inner mass of flesh
Then having cut severed and carved all this away he would remove the outer hide and cover the cow again with that same hide Would he be speaking rightly if he were to say This cow is joined to this hide just as it was before
No venerable sir
Why is that
Because if that skilled butcher or his apprentice were to kill a cow
Sisters I have given this simile in order to convey a meaning
This is the meaning The inner mass of flesh is a term for the six internal bases The outer hide is a term for the six external bases The inner tendons sinews and ligaments is a term for delight and lust The sharp butchers knife is a term for noble wisdom  the noble wisdom that cuts severs and carves away the inner defilements fetters and bonds
Sisters there are these seven enlightenment factors through the development and cultivation of which a bhikkhu by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints
What are the seven
Here sisters a bhikkhu develops the mindfulness enlightenment factor which is supported by seclusion dispassion and cessation and ripens in relinquishment He develops the investigationofstates enlightenment factorthe energy enlightenment factorthe rapture enlightenment factor the tranquillity enlightenment factor the concentration enlightenment factor the equanimity enlightenment factor which is supported by seclusion dispassion and cessation and ripens in relinquishment
These are the seven enlightenment factors through the development and cultivation of which a bhikkhu by realising for himself with direct knowledge here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints
When the venerable Nandaka had advised the bhikkhunis thus he dismissed them saying Go sisters it is time
Then the bhikkhunis having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Nandakas words rose from their seats and after paying homage to the venerable Nandaka departed keeping him on their right They went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him stood at one side
The Blessed One told them Go sisters it is time
Then the bhikkhunis paid homage to the Blessed One and departed keeping him on their right
Soon after they had left the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus Bhikkhus just as on the Uposatha day of the fourteenth people are not doubtful or perplexed as to whether the moon is incomplete or full since then the moon is clearly incomplete
Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Nandaka Well then Nandaka tomorrow too you should advise those bhikkhunis in exactly the same way
Yes venerable sir the venerable Nandaka replied
Then the next morning the venerable Nandaka dressed
Soon after they had left the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus Bhikkhus just as on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth people are not doubtful or perplexed as to whether the moon is incomplete or full since then the moon is clearly full so too those bhikkhunis are satisfied with Nandakas teaching of the Dhamma and their intention has been fulfilled
Bhikkhus even the least advanced of those five hundred bhikkhunis is a streamenterer no longer subject to perdition bound for deliverance headed for enlightenment
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
The second stanza begins Therefore beings
Herein Therefore is a term for a reason
O beings  a term of address
Give attention  listen
All  without remainder
What is meant
He meant Because you have left the heavenly places and the excellent enjoyment found there and have assembled here for the purpose of hearing the True Idea not for the purpose of seeing dancers dancing etc therefore o beings give attention all
Or else seeing that with the phrases  let themhave peace of mind  and  listen closely  they had peace of mind and desire to listen what he meant was  Because through peace of mind you are fitted owing to the purity of ends due to rightdirectioninselfguidance and reasonedattention and because through desire to listen closely you are fitted owing to the purity of means due to the waitingonTrueMen and the hearingspeechfromothers that form the footing for right view therefore o beings give attention all
Or else pointing back to the phrase these words at the end of the previous stanza as the reason he meant Because my words are very difficult to come by owing to difficulty in finding the moment that avoids all the aspects of thewrong moment and because they have many advantages owing to their occurrence with the special qualities of understanding and compassionand that was what I desired to express when I said  listen to these words   therefore o beings give attention all
That is what is meant by this line
After exhorting them to attend to his own words by adducing the reason he began to tell what the attention was to be given toby saying work lovingkindness for the race of men 
The meaning of that is as follows Establish friendliness and wellwishing for the race of men that is being plagued by these three plagues
But some read mnusiyam instead of mnusiy which is wrong because the locative sense is not implied
and so what they comment with that as basis is wrong
The intention here is as follows  I am not speaking because of lordly powers as an Enlightened One but rather it is for the sake of the welfare of yourselves and the race of men that I say Work lovingkindness for the race of men
after they have won The earth that teems with creatures travel round
Offering up with ceremonial pomp Horse sacrifice and human sacrifice
 Of him that in his heart keeps love in being 
They are not worth even a sixteenth part
A single breathing thing Who with a heart unsoiled by hate can treat
but if his mind Has sympathy with every breathing thing As one ennobled he performs high merit 
And how lovingkindness benefits those who practise it can be understood here by means of such discourses as above and by means of the Discourse on the Eleven Benefits 
and then how it benefits those towards whom it is practised can be understood by means of such discourses as above
After saying  work lovingkindness for the race of men  thus pointing out how beneficial it is to both he now said By day by night their offerings they bring Wherefore protect them well with diligence showing also what the help to be given was
Its meaning is as follows  There are human beings who portray the gods with paintings and woodcarvings and approach shrines trees etc and for their sake make daytime offerings and also nighttime offerings of honour with lamps in the dark of the moon and so on or they make daytime offerings for the sake of guardian deities with dedication of a gift through merittransference extending to the High Divinities by giving ticketmeals etc and they make nighttime offerings with dedication of a gift through merittransference by having an allnight hearing of the True Idea etc performed with the raising of parasols and with lamps and garlands So since they make their offerings addressed to you thus by day and by night how can you fail to guard them
Therefore protect them therefore protect and guard these human beings who perform these offeringceremonies dispel their woes bring them welfare be diligent in maintaining that gratitude in your hearts and recollect it always
The kingly seers who travel round
Libations too and lavish vjadrinking
with lovingness By just that fact is skilled
The man with whom gods sympathize Will always see auspicious things  
The first stanza is Yriidha bhtni
As to  whatever  here in this stanza whatever means whatsoever kinds whether possessing little or great influence
Here  in this place he spoke with reference to the meetingplace on that occasion
Beings  the word bhta past participle of bhavati to be has in such passages as It is when that is so  an offence entailing expiation   the meaning of factual 
Now although this word has these meanings it should nevertheless be regarded here as referring to nonhuman beings without distinction
Assembled  foregathered
So be they native to the earth  generated on the earth
Or is an alternative particle
hence having taken one alternative with the words  whatever beingsso be they native to the earthare assembled here  then in order to take the second alternative he said or sky 
which means Whatever beings generated in the sky are assembled here
And here it can also be understood that those beings generated upwards from the Yma Heaven as far as the Akanittha Heaven are beings native to the sky  because they are generated in divine mansions manifested in the sky
And it can be understood that beings residing in trees creepers etc or generated on the earth below the Yma Heaven from Sineru downwards are  beings native to the earth  because they are all generated on the earth and in trees creepers rocks etc that are bound up with the earth
Now when the Blessed One had comprised all nonhuman beings under the two alternative phrases  so be they native to the earth or sky  he comprised them again with a single phrase in saying  Let beings each and all have peace of mind
Herein all means without remainder
Each and is for emphasis the intention is Not excluding even one
Beings  nonhuman beings
Let have peace of mind  let them have pleasure in their minds  become happy and joyful
And also  the pair of particles refers to what is about to be said their purpose being to provide a link between functions
Let them listen closely to these words  heeding attending and wholeheartedly reacting let them listen to my teaching which brings heavenly excellence and supramundane pleasure
So after the Blessed One had comprised all beings with the indefinite phrase  whatever beings are assembled here  and had then defined them as twofold thus  so be they native to the earth or sky  and had reunited them with the words  let beings each and all he concluded this stanza by exhorting them about the excellence of the ends with the words have peace of mind and about the excellence of the means with the words  and also listen closely to these words and likewise exhorting them respectively about the excellence of reasoned attention and excellence of others speech  and also about the excellence of right direction in selfguidance and of waiting on True Men  and also about the excellence of the cause for concentration and understanding
and in such passages as   This entity is  do you see in this way bhikkhus  it has the meaning of the pentad of categories 
and in such passages as Bhikkhu the four great entities are the cause it has the meaning of the fourfold material form consisting of the earth element and the elements of water fire and air
and in such passages as  The being who has eaten up time  it has the meaning of an Arahant that is one whose taints are exhausted 
and in such passages as  No beings in the world but shall lay down the compound  it has the meaning of all creatures 
and in such passages as By felling plantlife  it has the meaning of trees  etc
and in such passages as  He perceives a being as a being  it has the meaning of the body of creatures below those of the Four Kings heaven
Thus have I heard On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthī in the Eastern Park in Migāramātās mansion
Now on that occasionthe uposatha day of the fifteenth the fullmoon nightthe Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus
Then having surveyed the completely silent Sangha of bhikkhus he addressed them thus
Bhikkhus if others ask you What is your aim in listening to those teachings that are wholesome noble emancipating leading to enlightenment you should answer them thus For the accurate knowledge of things arranged in dyads
And what would one call a dyad
This is suffering this is the origin of sufferingthis is one contemplation
This is the cessation of suffering this is the way leading to the cessation of sufferingthis is a second contemplation
When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyadheedful ardent and resoluteone of two fruits is to be expected of him either final knowledge in this very life or if there is a residue remaining the state of nonreturning
This is what the Blessed One said
Having said this the Fortunate One the Teacher further said this
Those who do not understand suffering or the origin of suffering
who do not know where suffering completely ceases without remainder
and who do not know the path that leads to the allaying of suffering
they are destitute of liberation of mind and also of liberation by wisdom
Incapable of making an end they fare on to birth and old age
But those who understand suffering and the origin of suffering
who know as well where suffering completely ceases without remainder
and who understand the path that leads to the allaying of suffering
they are possessed of minds liberation and also liberation by wisdom
Capable of making an end they fare no more to birth and old age
If bhikkhus there are those who ask Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way you should answer them thus There could be
And how could there be
Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by acquisition this is one contemplation
With the remainderless fading away and cessation of acquisitions there is no origination of sufferingthis is a second contemplation
When a bhikkhu dwells thus the Teacher further said this
Sufferings in their many forms in the world originate based on acquisition
The ignorant dullard who creates acquisition encounters suffering again and again
Therefore understanding one should not create acquisition contemplating it as the genesis and origin of suffering
If bhikkhus there are those who ask Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way you should answer them thus There could be
And how could there be
Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by ignorancethis is one contemplation
With the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance there is no origination of sufferingthis is a second contemplation
When a bhikkhu dwells thus the Teacher further said this
Those who travel again and again in the saṃsāra of birth and death
with its becoming thus becoming otherwise that journey is due to ignorance
It is because of ignorance this great delusion that one has wandered on for so long
But those beings who have gained clear knowledge do not come back to renewed existence
If bhikkhus there are those who ask Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way you should answer them thus There could be And how could there be
Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by volitional activitiesthis is one contemplation
With the remainderless fading away and cessation of volitional activities there is no origination of sufferingthis is a second contemplation

Settled upon nameandform they conceive This is true

Through the breakthrough to truth hungerless they are fully quenched
If bhikkhus there are those who ask Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way you should answer them thus There could be

all are desirable lovely agreeable so long as it is said They are
These are considered as happiness in the world with its devas
but where these cease that they consider suffering

Running counter to the entire world is this insight of those who see
What others speak of as happiness that the noble ones speak of as suffering
What others speak of as suffering that the noble ones have known as happiness
Behold this Dhamma hard to comprehend here the foolish are bewildered
There is gloom for those who are blocked darkness for those who do not see
but for the good it is opened up like light for those who see
The brutes unskilled in the Dhamma do not understand it even when close
This Dhamma is not easily understood by those afflicted by lust for existence
by those flowing in the stream of existence deeply mired in Māras realm
Who else apart from the noble ones are able to understand this state
When they have correctly known that state those without influxes attain nibbāna

It was said The perception of unattractiveness bhikkhus when developed and cultivated is of great fruit and benefit culminating in the deathless having the deathless as its consummation
For what reason was this said

Just as a cocks feather or a strip of sinew thrown into a fire shrinks away from it turns back from it rolls away from it

Bhikkhus there are these four kinds of persons found existing in the world
What four
The person who goes along with the stream the one who goes against the stream the one who is inwardly firm and the one who has crossed over and gone beyond the brahmin who stands on high ground
And what Is the person who goes along with the stream
Here someone indulges in sensual pleasures and performs bad deeds
This is called the person who goes along with the stream
And what is the person who goes against the stream
Here someone does not indulge in sensual pleasures or perform bad deeds Even with pain and dejection weeping with a tearful face he lives the complete and purified spiritual life
This is called the person who goes against the stream
And what is the person who is inwardly firm
Here with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters some person is of spontaneous birth due to attain final nibbana there wi thout ever returning from that world
This is called the person who is inwardly firm
And what is the one who has crossed over and gone beyond the brahmin who stands on high ground
Here with the destruction of the taints some person has realized for himself with direct knowledge in this very life the taintless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom and having entered upon it he dwells in it
This is called the person who has crossed over and gone beyond the brahmin who stands on high ground
These bhikkhus are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world
Those people who are uncontrolled in sense pleasures
not rid of lust enjoying sense pleasures here
repeatedly coming back to birth and old age
immersed in craving are the ones who go along with the stream
they call this person one who goes against the stream
should give up sense pleasures even if its painful
not resorting to sense pleasures and bad deeds
Therefore a wise person with mindfulness established
this person is called one inwardly firm
One who has abandoned five defilements
a fulfilled trainee unable to retrogress
attained to minds masteryhis faculties composed
but the venerable Nandaka did not want to advise them when his turn came
reached the worlds end is called one who has gone beyond
that sage who has lived the spiritual life
burnt them up so theyre gone and exist no more
One who has comprehended things high and low
Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda Ananda whose turn is it today to advise the bhikkhunis
but he does not want to advise them even though it is his turn
When he had wandered for alms in Savatthi and had returned from his almsround after his meal he went with a companion to the Rajaka Park
and prepared a seat and set out water for the feet
and washed his feet

And what is the result of perceptions
In whatever w ay one perceives something in just that way one expresses oneself saying I was percipient of such and such
And what is the cessation of perceptions
This is called the diversity of kamma
And what bhikkhus is the cessation of kamma
And what is the source and origin of suffering
when you are doubtful or perplexed you should ask me How is this venerable sir What is the meaning of this
the nose
the tongue
the body
the mind permanent or impermanent
sounds
odours
flavours
tangibles
 Impermanent venerable sir
mindobjects permanent or impermanent
earconsciousness
noseconsciousness
tongueconsciousness
bodyconsciousness
mindconsciousness permanent or impermanent
and with the cessation of its corresponding condition the feeling ceases
but the pleasant painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling that one experiences in dependence upon the six external bases is permanent everlasting eternal not subject to change
and with the cessation of its corresponding condition the feeling ceases
and without damaging the outer hide he would cut sever and carve away the inner tendons sinews and ligaments with the sharp butchers knife
and cut sever and carve all that away even though he covers the cow again with that same hide and says This cow is joined to this hide just as it was before that cow would still be disjoined from that hide
so too those bhikkhunis are satisfied with Nandakas teaching of the Dhamma but their intention has not yet been fulfilled
Then the bhikkhunis paid homage to the Blessed One and departed keeping him on their right
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
Then when it was evening the venerable Punna rose from meditation and went to the Blessed One After paying homage to the Blessed One he sat down at one side
and said to him  Venerable sir it would be good if the Blessed One would give me brief advice Having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One I will abide alone withdrawn diligent ardent and resolute
Well then Punna listen and attend carefully to what I shall say
Yes venerable sir the venerable Punna replied
The Blessed One said this
If a bhikkhu delights in them welcomes them and remains holding to them
If a bhikkhu delights in them welcomes them and remains holding to them
Punna there are forms cognizable by the eye
Now that I have given you this brief advice Punna in which country will you dwell
Venerable sir now that the Blessed One has given me this brief advice I am going to dwell in the Sunaparanta country
Punna the people of Sunaparanta are fierce and rough
If they abuse and threaten you what will you think then
Venerable sir if the people of Sunaparanta abuse and threaten me then I shall think These people of Sunaparanta are kind truly kind in that they did not give me a blow with the fist
Then I shall think thus Blessed One then I shall think thus Sublime One
But Punna if the people of Sunaparanta do give you a blow with the fist what will you think then
Venerable sir if the people of Sunaparanta do give me a blow with the fist then I shall think These people of Sunaparanta are kind truly kind in that they did not give me a blow with a clod
Then I shall think thus Blessed One then I shall think thus Sublime One
But Punna if the people of Sunaparanta do give you a blow with a clod what will you think then
Venerable sir if the people of Sunaparanta do give me a blow with a clod then I shall think These people of Sunaparanta are kind truly kind in that they did not give me a blow with a stick
Then I shall think thus Blessed One then I shall think thus Sublime One
But Punna if the people of Sunaparanta do give you a blow with a stick what will you think then
Venerable sir if the people of Sunaparanta do give me a blow with a stick then I shall think These people of Sunaparanta are kind truly kind in that they did not give me a blow with a knife
Then I shall think thus Blessed One then I shall think thus Sublime One
But Punna if the people of Sunaparanta do give you a blow with a knife what will you think then
Venerable sir if the people of Sunaparanta do give me a blow with a knife then I shall think These people of Sunaparanta are kind truly kind in that they have not taken my life with a sharp knife
Then I shall think thus Blessed One then I shall think thus Sublime One
But Punna if the people of Sunaparanta do take your life with a sharp knife what will you think then
Venerable sir if the people of Sunaparanta do take my life with a sharp knife then I shall think thus There have been disciples of the Blessed One who being humiliated and disgusted by the body and by life sought to have their lives deprived by the knife
But I have had my life deprived by the knife without seeking for it
Then I shall think thus Blessed One then I shall think thus Sublime One
Good good Punna
Possessing such selfcontrol and peacefulness you will be able to dwell in the Sunaparanta country
Now Punna it is time to do as you think fit
Then having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed Ones words the venerable Punna rose from his seat and after paying homage to the Blessed One departed keeping him on his right He then set his resting place in order took his bowl and outer robe and set out to wander towards the Sunaparanta country
and there he lived
Then during that Rams the venerable Punna established five hundred men lay followers and five hundred women lay followers in the practice and he himself realised the three true knowledges
On a later occasion the venerable Punna attained final Nibbana 
What is his destination What is his future course
Bhikkhus the clansman Punna was wise He practised in accordance with the Dhamma and did not trouble me in the interpretation of the Dhamma
The clansman Punna has attained final Nibbana
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Punna there are forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust
With the arising of delight Punna there is the arising of suffering I say
There are Punna sounds cognizable by the earodours cognizable by the noseflavours cognizable by the tonguetangibles cognizable by the bodymindobjects cognizable by the mind that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust
Then a number of bhikkhus went to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him they sat down at one side
and told him Venerable sir the clansman Punna who was given brief advice by the Blessed One has died
With the arising of delight Punna there is the arising of suffering I say
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
Now on that occasion the venerable Sariputta the venerable Maha Cunda and the venerable Channa were living on the mountain Vulture Peak
On that occasion the venerable Channa was afflicted suffering and gravely ill
Then when it was evening the venerable Sariputta rose from meditation went to the venerable Maha Cunda and said to him Friend Cunda let us go to the venerable Channa and ask about his illness
 Yes friend the venerable Maha Cunda replied
Then the venerable Sariputta and the venerable Maha Cunda went to the venerable Channa and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished they sat down at one side
I hope your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing and that their subsiding not their increase is apparent
Friend Sariputta I am not getting well I am not comfortable
My painful feelings are increasing not subsiding
I shall use the knife friend Sariputta I have no desire to live
Let the venerable Channa not use the knife
Let the venerable Channa live
We want the venerable Channa to live
If he lacks suitable food I will go in search of suitable food for him
If he lacks suitable medicine I will go in search of suitable medicine for him
If he lacks a proper attendant I will attend on him
Let the venerable Channa not use the knife
Let the venerable Channa live
We want the venerable Channa to live
Friend Sariputta it is not that I have no suitable food and medicine or no proper attendant
But rather friend Sariputta the Teacher has long been worshipped by me with love not without love for it is proper for the disciple to worship the Teacher with love not without love
Friend Sariputta remember this the bhikkhu Channa will use the knife blamelessly
We would ask the venerable Channa certain questions if the venerable Channa finds it opportune to reply
Ask friend Sariputta When I have heard I shall know
Friend Channa do you regard the eye eyeconsciousness and things cognizable by the mind through eyeconsciousness thus This is mine this I am this is my self
Do you regard the earthe nosethe tonguethe bodythe mind mindconsciousness and things cognizable by the mind through mindconsciousness thus This is mine this I am this is my self
Friend Sariputta I regard the eye eyeconsciousness and things cognizable by the mind through eyeconsciousness thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
I regard the earthe nosethe tonguethe bodythe mind mindconsciousness and things cognizable by the mind through mindconsciousness thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
Friend Channa what have you seen what have you directly known in the eye in eyeconsciousness and in things cognizable by the mind through eyeconsciousness that you regard them thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
What have you seen what have you directly known in the earin the nosein the tonguein the bodyin the mind in mindconsciousness and in things cognizable by the mind through mindconsciousness that you regard them thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
Friend Sariputta it is through seeing cessation through directly knowing cessation in the eye in eyeconsciousness and in things cognizable by the mind through eyeconsciousness that I regard them thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
It is through seeing cessation through directly knowing cessation in the earin the nosein the tonguein the bodyin the mind in mindconsciousness and in things cognizable by the mind through mindconsciousness that I regard them thus This is not mine this I am not this is not my self
When this was said the venerable Maha Cunda said to the venerable Channa Therefore friend Channa this instruction of the Blessed Ones is to be constantly given attention There is wavering in one who is dependent there is no wavering in one who is independent
This is the end of suffering
Then when the venerable Sariputta and the venerable Maha Cunda had advised the venerable Channa thus they rose from their seats and went away
Then soon after they had gone the venerable Channa used the knife
What is his destination what is his future course
Sariputta didnt the bhikkhu Channa declare to you his blamelessness
Venerable sir there is a Vajjian village called Pubbajira
There the venerable Channa had families that were his friends families that were his intimates families that were blameworthy
There are those families that were friends of the bhikkhu Channa Sariputta families that were his intimates families that were blameworthy
Sariputta when one lays down this body and clings to a new body then I say one is blameworthy
There was none of that in the bhikkhu Channa
That is what the Blessed One said
The venerable Sariputta was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
delight arises in him
With the cessation of delight Punna there is the cessation of suffering I say
delight ceases in him
If a bhikkhu does not delight in them welcome them and remain holding to them
sounds cognizable by the earodours cognizable by the noseflavours cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body mindobjects cognizable by the mind that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust
delight arises in him
Wandering by stages he eventually arrived in the Sunaparanta country
Let us also go to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma
welcome to the venerable nanda
and the venerable Sariputta said to the venerable Channa I hope you are getting well friend Channa I hope you are comfortable
their increase and not their subsiding is apparent
The words I undertake the training precept of abstinence are shared by all ten and so the following explanation of these words as to the phrasing and the meaning can be understood to be common to all
Firstly as to the phrasing It crushes risk  thus it is abstention  the meaning is that is abandons risk eliminates it does away with it annihilates it
Or alternatively a person with that as instrument abstains from risk  thus substituting the syllable ve for the syllable vi it is abstention 
It ought to be trained in  thus it is a training  one proceeds by that thus it is a state 
The abstention itself is the trainingprecept  thus it is a trainingprecept in the first form as veramanisikkhapadam or according to the second method as viramanisikkhapadam
I completely take  thus I undertake what is meant is that I take it with the intention of nontransgression by keeping it untorn and keeping it unmottled 
Now as to the meaning abstention is abstinence associated with sensualdesiresphere profitable cognizance  as that is stated in the Vibhanga in the way beginning When someone is abstaining from killing breathing things on that occasion any abstaining  abstinence reabstinence abstention from killing breathing things nondoing nonmaking nonoffending nontransgressingoflimit demolitionofbridges to evil 
 of course there is also such supramundane abstention  But since the words I undertake are spoken here it is appropriate to treat it here as an act of undertaking which is why it was said above that abstinence is that associated with sensualdesiresphere profitable cognizance
Training there are three kinds if training training in the Higher Virtue Training in the Higher Cognizance and training in the Higher Understanding 
But in this context what is intended by training is virtue consisting in abstinence as custom  mundane insight form and formless jhana and the Noble Path
On an occasion on which a sensualdesiresphere profitable cognizance has arise accompanied by joy and associated with knowledge on that occasion there is contact for elision see Dhs  there is nondistraction these ideas are training
What ideas are trainings
On an occasion on which in a formed rebirth one maintains in being the Path and quite secluded from sensual desires secluded from unprofitable ideas one enters upon and abides in the first jhana the fifth jhana there is nondistraction these ideas are trainings
What ideas are trainings
On an occasion on which in a formless rebirth  accompanied by the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception there is nondistraction these ideas are trainings
What ideas are trainings
On an occasion on which one maintains in being a supramundane jhana that leads out from the round there is nondistraction these ideas are trainings 
The state as the way to arrive at any one training among these trainings or alternatively as the root support foundation for it is a training precept 
for this is said One maintaining in being and developing the seven factors of enlightenment supported by virtue founded on virtue  and so on
That is how For phrasing and for meaning too We make one common treatment do For terms that all the precepts share
and hence they pronounce it in two ways here in this context namely veramanisikkhapadam and viramanisikkhapadam
and sikkhaya padam  sikkhapadam  the meaning is that it is the means by which to arrive at training
or else what is meant is that it that is the pada is the root the support the foundation for the sikkha
according as it is said
What ideas are trainings
when there is no wavering there is tranquillity when there is tranquillity there is no bias
when there is no bias there is no coming and going
when there is no passing away and reappearing there is no here nor beyond nor in between
Then the venerable Sariputta went to thie Blessed One and after paying homage to him he sat down at one side
and said to the Blessed One Venerable sir the venerable Channa has used the knife
but I do not say that to this extent he was blameworthy
the bhikkhu Channa used the knife blamelessly
when there is no coming and going there is no passing away and reappearing
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this  Bhikkhus I shall teach you an exposition of nonconflict
Listen and attend closely to what I shall say
 Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this
The Middle Way discovered by the Tathagata avoids both extremes giving vision giving knowledge it leads to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana
One should know how to define pleasure and knowing that one should pursue pleasure within oneself
One should not utter covert speech and one should not utter overt sharp speech
One should speak unhurriedly not hurriedly
One should not insist on local language and one should not override normal usage This is the summary of the exposition of nonconflict
One should not pursue sensual pleasure which is low vulgar coarse ignoble and unbeneficial and one should not pursue selfmortification which is painful ignoble and unbeneficial So it was said And with reference to what was this said
The pursuit of the enjoyment of one whose pleasure is linked to sensual desires  low vulgar coarse ignoble and unbeneficial  is a state beset by suffering vexation despair and fever and it is the wrong way
The pursuit of selfmortification  painful ignoble and unbeneficial  is a state beset by suffering vexation despair and fever and it is the wrong way
Disengagement from the pursuit of selfmortification  painful ignoble and unbeneficial  is a state without suffering vexation despair and fever and it is the right way
So it was with reference to this that it was said One should not pursue sensual pleasure which is low vulgar coarse ignoble and unbeneficial and one should not pursue selfmortification which is painful ignoble and unbeneficial
The Middle Way discovered by the Tathagata avoids both these extremes giving vision giving knowledge it leads to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana So it was said
And with reference to what was this said
It is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
So it was with reference to this that it was said The Middle Way discovered by the Tathagata avoids both these extremesto Nibbana
One should know what it is to extol and what it is to disparage and knowing both one should neither extol nor disparage but should teach only the Dhamma So it was said
And with reference to what was this said
How bhikkhus does there come to be extolling and disparaging and failure to teach only the Dhamma
When one says All those engaged in the pursuit of the enjoyment of one whose pleasure is linked to sensual desires  lowand unbeneficial  are beset by suffering vexation despair and fever and they have entered upon the wrong way one thus disparages some
When one says All those disengaged from the pursuit of the enjoyment of one whose pleasure is linked to sensual desires  lowand unbeneficial  are without suffering vexation despair and fever and they have entered upon the right way one thus extols some
When one says All those engaged in the pursuit of selfmortification  painful ignoble and unbeneficial  are beset by suffering vexation despair and fever and they have entered upon the wrong way one thus disparages some
When one says All those disengaged from the pursuit of selfmortification  painful ignoble and unbeneficial  are without suffering vexation despair and fever and they have entered upon the right way one thus extols some
When one says All those who have not abandoned the fetter of being are beset by suffering vexation despair and fever and they have entered upon the wrong way one thus disparages some
When one says All those who have abandoned the fetter of being are without suffering vexation despair and fever and they have entered upon the right way one thus extols some
This is how there comes to be extolling and disparaging and failure to teach only the Dhamma
And how bhikkhus does there come to be neither extolling nor disparaging but teaching only the Dhamma
When one does not say All those engaged in the pursuit of the enjoyment of one whose pleasure is linked to sensual desireshave entered upon the wrong way
When one does not say All those engaged in the pursuit of selfmortificationhave entered upon the wrong way
When one does not say All those disengaged from the pursuit of selfmortificationhave entered upon the right way
When one does not say All those who have not abandoned the fetter of beinghave entered upon the wrong way
When one does not say All those who have abandoned the fetter of beinghave entered upon the right way
One should know how to define pleasure and knowing that one should pursue pleasure within oneself So it was said
And with reference to what was this said
Bhikkhus there are these five cords of sensual pleasure
What five
Forms cognizable by the eyesounds cognizable by the earodours cognizable by the noseflavours cognizable by the tonguetangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desired agreeable and likeable connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust These are the five cords of sensual pleasure
Now the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these five cords of sensual pleasure are called sensual pleasure a filthy pleasure a coarse pleasure an ignoble pleasure
I say of this kind of pleasure that it should not be pursued that it should not be developed that it should not be cultivated and that it should be feared
Here bhikkhus quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana
This is called the bliss of renunciation the bliss of seclusion the bliss of peace the bliss of enlightenment
I say of this kind of pleasure that it should be pursued that it should be developed that it should be cultivated and that it should not be feared
So it was with reference to this that it was said One should know how to define pleasure and knowing that one should pursue pleasure within oneself
One should not utter covert speech and one should not utter overt sharp speech So it was said
And with reference to what was this said
Here bhikkhus when one knows covert speech to be untrue incorrect and unbeneficial one should on no account utter it
When one knows covert speech to be true correct and unbeneficial one should try not to utter it
But when one knows covert speech to be true correct and beneficial one may utter it knowing the time to do so
Here bhikkhus when one knows overt sharp speech to be untrue incorrect and unbeneficial one should on no account utter it
When one knows overt sharp speech to be true correct and unbeneficial one should try not to utter it
But when one knows overt sharp speech to be true correct and beneficial one may utter it knowing the time to do so
So it was with reference to this that it was said One should not utter covert speech and one should not utter overt sharp speech
One should speak unhurriedly not hurriedly So it was said
And with reference to what was this said
Here bhikkhus when one speaks hurriedly ones body grows tired and ones mind becomes excited ones voice is strained and ones throat becomes hoarse and the speech of one who speaks hurriedly is indistinct and hard to understand
Here bhikkhus when one speaks unhurriedly ones body does not grow tired nor does ones mind become excited ones voice is not strained nor does ones throat become hoarse and the speech of one who speaks unhurriedly is distinct and easy to understand
So it was with reference to this that it was said One should speak unhurriedly not hurriedly
One should not insist on local language and one should not override normal usage So it was said
And with reference to what was this said
How bhikkhus does there come to be insistence on local language and overriding of normal usage
Here bhikkhus in different localities they call the same thing a dish pati a bowl patta a vessel vittha a saucer serava a pan dharopa a pot porta a mug hana or a basin pislla
So whatever they call it in such and such a locality one speaks accordingly firmly adhering to that expression and insisting Only this is correct anything else is wrong
This is how there comes to be insistence on local language and overriding normal usage
Here bhikkhus in different localities they call the same thing a dishor a basin
So whatever they call it in such and such a locality without adhering to that expression one speaks accordingly thinking These venerable ones it seems are speaking with reference to this
This is how there comes to be noninsistence on local language and nonoverriding of normal usage
So it was with reference to this that it was said One should not insist on local language and one should not override normal usage
Here bhikkhus the pursuit of the enjoyment of one whose pleasure is linked to sensual desires  lowand unbeneficial  is a state beset by suffering vexation despair and fever and it is the wrong way
Therefore this is a state with conflict
Here bhikkhus disengagement from the pursuit of the enjoyment of one whose pleasure is linked to sensual desires lowand unbeneficial  is a state without suffering vexation despair and fever and it is the right way
Therefore this is a state without conflict
Here bhikkhus the pursuit of selfmortification  painful ignoble and unbeneficial  is a state beset by suffering vexation despair and fever and it is the wrong way
Therefore this is a state with conflict
Here bhikkhus disengagement from the pursuit of selfmortification  painful ignoble and unbeneficial  is a state without suffering vexation despair and fever and it is the right way
Therefore this is a state without conflict
Here bhikkhus the Middle Way discovered by the Tathagata avoids both these extremes giving vision giving knowledge it leads to peace to direct knowledge to enlightenment to Nibbana It is a state without sufferingand it is the right way
Therefore this is a state without conflict
Here bhikkhus extolling and disparaging and failure to teach only the Dhamma is a state beset by sufferingand it is the wrong way
Therefore this is a state with conflict
Here bhikkhus not extolling and not disparaging and teaching only the Dhamma is a state without sufferingand it is the right way
Therefore this is a state without conflict
Here bhikkhus sensual pleasure  a filthy pleasure a coarse pleasure an ignoble pleasure  is a state beset by sufferingand it is the wrong way
Therefore this is a state with conflict
Here bhikkhus the bliss of renunciation the bliss of seclusion the bliss of peace the bliss of enlightenment is a state without sufferingand it is the right way
Therefore this is a state without conflict
Here bhikkhus covert speech that is untrue incorrect and unbeneficial is a state beset by suffering
Here bhikkhus covert speech that is true correct and unbeneficial is a state beset by suffering
Here bhikkhus covert speech that is true correct and beneficial is a state without suffering
Here bhikkhus overt sharp speech that is untrue incorrect and unbeneficial is a state beset by suffering
Here bhikkhus overt sharp speech that is true correct and unbeneficial is a state beset by suffering
Here bhikkhus overt sharp speech that is true correct and beneficial is a state without suffering
Here bhikkhus the speech of one who speaks hurriedly is a state beset by suffering vexation despair and fever and it is the wrong way
Therefore this is a state with conflict
Here bhikkhus the speech of one who speaks unhurriedly is a state without suffering
Here bhikkhus insistence on local language and overriding of normal usage is a state beset by suffering
Here bhikkhus noninsistence on local language and nonoverriding of normal usage is a state without suffering vexation despair and fever and it is the right way
Therefore this is a state without conflict
Therefore bhikkhus you should train yourselves thus We shall know the state with conflict and we shall know the state without conflict and knowing these we shall enter upon the way without conflict
Now bhikkhus Subhuti is a clansman who has entered upon the way without conflict
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
One should not pursue sensual pleasure which is low vulgar coarse ignoble and unbeneficial and one should not pursue selfmortification which is painful ignoble and unbeneficial
One should know what it is to extol and what it is to disparage and knowing both one should neither extol nor disparage but should teach only the Dhamma
 touring for alms in the Cetiya country set out for Bhaddavatikā
Cowherds goatherds yeomen farmers travellers saw the lord coming from afar
And a second time  And a third time cowherds goatherds yeomen farmers travellers spoke thus to the lord Do not lord let the lord go to Ambatittha
And a third time the lord became silent
Then the lord touring for alms in the course of time arrived at Bhaddavatikā
The lord stayed there at Bhaddavatika
Then the venerable Sāgata approached the hermitage of the mattedhair ascetic of Ambatittha and having approached having entered the fireroom having made ready the grass mat he sat down crosslegged the back erect having caused mindfulness to be present in front of him
Then that serpent seeing that the venerable Sāgata had entered
And the venerable Sāgata blew forth smoke
Then that serpent not conquering anger blazed up
Then the venerable Sāgata having mastered by heat that serpents heat approached Bhaddavatika
Then the lord having stayed at Bhaddavatikā for as long as he found suitable departed on an almstour to Kosambī
Layfollowers of Kosambī heard They say that master Sāgata came into conflict with the serpent of Ambatittha
Then the lord touring for alms in the course of time arrived at Kosambī
Then the layfollowers of Kosambī having met the lord approached the venerable Sāgata having approached having greeted the venerable Sāgata they stood at a respectful distance
As they were standing at a respectful distance the layfollowers of Kosambī spoke thus to the venerable Sāgata Honoured sir what is hard for the masters to obtain and liked  What may we give 
When they had spoken thus the group of six monks spoke thus to the layfollowers of Kosambī There is your reverences a spirituous liquor called white spirits it is hard for the monks to obtain and liked  Give that
Then the layfollowers of Kosambī having given the spirituous liquor white spirits in house after house seeing that the venerable Sāgata had entered for almsfood spoke thus to the venerable Sāgata Honoured sir let master Sāgata drink the spirituous liquor white spirits honoured sir let master Sāgata drink the spirituous liquor white spirits
Then the venerable Sagata having drunk the spirituous liquor white spirits in house after house as he was departing from the town fell down at the towngate
Then the lord departing from the town with a great company of monks saw the venerable Sāgata fallen down at the towngate
seeing him he addressed the monks saying Monks take up Sāgata
Yes lord and these monks having answered the lord having led the venerable Sāgata to the monastery made him lie down with his head towards the lord
Then the venerable Sāgata having turned round went to sleep with his feet towards the lord
Then the lord addressed the monks saying Monks formerly was not Sāgata respectful deferential towards the Tathāgata 
Yes lord
But monks is Sāgata respectful deferential towards the Tathāgata now 
No lord
Monks did not Sāgata come into conflict with the serpent of Ambatittha 
Yes lord
But monks is Sāgata able to come into conflict with the serpent of Ambatittha now 
No lord
But monks could he become unconscious having drunk that which may be drunk 
No lord
Monks it is not fitting for Sāgata it is not becoming it is not suitable it is not worthy of a recluse it is not allowable it is not to be done
How monks can Sāgata drink strong drink
It is not monks for pleasing those who are not pleased  And thus monks this rule of training should be set forth
In drinking fermented liquor and spirits there is an offence of expiation
Fermented liquor means if it is fermented liquor from flour fermented liquor from cakes fermented liquor from cooked rice if it is workedup yeast if it is mixed with ingredients
Spirits means if it is an extract from flowers an extract from fruits an extract from honey an extract from sugar if it is mixed with ingredients
Should drink means if he drinks even with a blade of grass there is an offence of expiation
If he thinks that it is strong drink when it is strong drink drinks it there is an offence of expiation
If he is in doubt as to whether it is strong drink 
If he thinks that it is strong drink when it is not strong drink there is an offence of wrongdoing
If he is in doubt as to whether it is not strong drink there is an offence of wrongdoing
If he thinks that it is not strong drink when it is not strong drink there is no offence
There is no offence if he drinks that which is not strong drink though it comes to be the colour of strong drink the smell of strong drink the taste of strong drink if it is in a concoction of broth in a concoction of meat in a concoction of oil in molasses and emblic myrobalam if he drinks a distilled liquor that is not strong drink if he is mad if he is the first wrongdoer
and seeing him they spoke thus to the lord Do not lord let the lord go to Ambatittha
lord in Ambatittha a serpent lives in a mattedhaired ascetics hermitage he has psychic potency he is a terribly venomous snake
do not let him hurt the lord
When they had spoken thus the lord became silent
 do not let him hurt the lord
bad at heart blew forth smoke
and the venerable Sāgata having attained to the condition of heat blazed up
If he thinks that it is not strong drink when it is strong drink drinks it there is an offence of expiation
Disengagement from the pursuit of the enjoyment of one whose pleasure is linked to sensual desires  low vulgar coarse ignoble and unbeneficial  is a state without suffering vexation despair and fever and it is the right way
but says instead The pursuit is a state beset by suffering vexation despair and fever and it is the wrong way then one teaches only the Dhamma
When one does not say All those disengaged from the pursuit of the enjoyment of one whose pleasure is linked to sensual desireshave entered upon the right way
but says instead The disengagement is a state without suffering vexation despair and fever and It is the right way then one teaches only the Dhamma
but says instead The pursuit is a state beset by suffering vexation despair and fever and it is the wrong way then one teaches only the Dhamma
but says instead The disengagement is a state without suffering vexation despair and fever and it is the right way then one teaches only the Dhamma
but says instead As long as the fetter of being is unabandoned being too is unabandoned then one teaches only the Dhamma
but says instead When the fetter of being is abandoned being also is abandoned then one teaches only the Dhamma
So it was with reference to this that it was said One should know what it is to extol and what it is to disparage and knowing both one should neither extol nor disparage but should teach only the Dhamma
the second jhana
the third jhana the fourth jhana
And how bhikkhus does there come to be noninsistence on local language and nonoverriding of normal usage
Therefore this is a state with conflict
Therefore this is a state with conflict
Therefore this is a state without conflict
Therefore this is a state with conflict
Therefore this is a state with conflict
Therefore this is a state without conflict
Therefore this is a state without conflict
Therefore this is a state with conflict
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas Park
There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this  Bhikkhus I shall teach you a summary and an exposition
Listen and attend closely to what I shall say
 Yes venerable sir the bhikkhus replied
The Blessed One said this
If his consciousness is not distracted and scattered externally nor stuck internally and if by not clinging he does not become agitated then for him there is no origination of suffering  of birth ageing and death in the future
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said this the Sublime One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling
Then soon after the Blessed One had gone the bhikkhus considered Now friends the Blessed One has risen from his seat and gone into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the detailed meaning
He is capable of expounding the detailed meaning Suppose we went to him and asked him the meaning of this
How friends is consciousness called distracted and scattered externally
Here when a bhikkhu has seen a form with the eye if his consciousness follows after the sign of form is tied and shackled by gratification in the sign of form is fettered by the fetter of gratification in the sign of form then his consciousness is called distracted and scattered externally
When he has heard a sound with the earsmelt an odour with the nosetasted a flavour with the tonguetouched a tangible with the bodycognized a mindobject with the mind if his consciousness follows after the sign of the mindobject is tied and shackled by gratification in the sign of the mindobject is fettered by the fetter of gratification in the sign of the mindobject then his consciousness is called distracted and scattered externally
And how friends is consciousness called not distracted and scattered externally
Here when a bhikkhu has seen a form with the eye if his consciousness does not follow after the sign of form is not tied and shackled by gratification in the sign of form is not fettered by the fetter of gratification in the sign of form then his consciousness is called not distracted and scattered externally
When he has heard a sound with the earsmelt an odour with the nosetasted a flavour with the tonguetouched a tangible with the body cognized a mindobject with the mind if his consciousness does not follow after the sign of the mindobject is not tied and shackled by gratification in the sign of the mindobject is not fettered by the fetter of gratification in the sign of the mindobject then his consciousness is called not distracted and scattered externally
And how friends is the mind called stuck internally
Here quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
If his consciousness follows after the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion is tied and shackled by gratification in the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion then his mind is called stuck internally
Again with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentration
If his consciousness follows after the rapture and pleasure born of concentrationthen his mind is called stuck internally
Again with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhu abides in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body he enters upon and abides in the third jhana on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful
If his consciousness follows after the equanimitythen his mind is called stuck internally
Again with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
If his consciousness follows after the neitherpainnorpleasure is tied and shackled by gratification in the neitherpainnorpleasure is fettered by the fetter of gratification in the neitherpainnorpleasure then his mind is called stuck internally
That is how the mind is called stuck internally
And how friends is the mind called not stuck internally
Here quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana
Again with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana
Again with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhuenters upon and abides in the third jhana
Again with the abandoning of pleasure and paina bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana
If his consciousness does not follow after the neitherpainnorpleasure is not tied and shackled by gratification in the neitherpainnorpleasure is not fettered by the fetter of gratification in the neitherpainnorpleasure then his mind is called not stuck internally
That is how the mind is called not stuck internally
How friends is there agitation due to clinging
Here an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma regards material form as self or self as possessed of material form or material form as in self or self as in material form
That material form of his changes and becomes otherwise
With the change and becoming otherwise of that material form his consciousness is preoccupied with the change of material form
Agitated mental states born of preoccupation with the change of material form arise together and remain obsessing his mind
Because his mind is obsessed he is anxious distressed and concerned and due to clinging he becomes agitated
That consciousness of his changes and becomes otherwise
With the change and becoming otherwise of that consciousness his consciousness is preoccupied with the change of consciousness
Agitated states of mind born of preoccupation with the change of consciousness arise together and remain obsessing his mind
Because his mind is obsessed he is anxious distressed and concerned and due to clinging he becomes agitated
That is how there is agitation due to clinging
And how friends is there nonagitation due to nonclinging
Here a welltaught noble disciple who has regard for noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma does not regard material form as self or self as possessed of material form or material form as in self or self as in material form
That material form of his changes and becomes otherwise
With the change and becoming otherwise of that material form his consciousness is not preoccupied with the change of material form
Agitated mental states born of preoccupation with the change of material form do not arise together and remain obsessing his mind
Because his mind is not obsessed he is not anxious distressed and concerned and due to nonclinging he does not become agitated
He does not regard feeling as selfHe does not regard perception as selfHe does not regard formations as selfHe does not regard consciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness
That consciousness of his changes and becomes otherwise
With the change and becoming otherwise of that consciousness his consciousness is not preoccupied with the change of consciousness
Agitated mental states born of preoccupation with the change of consciousness do not arise together and remain obsessing his mind
Because his mind is not obsessed he is not anxious distressed and concerned and due to nonclinging he does not become agitated
That is how there is nonagitation due to nonclinging
Friends when the Blessed One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the detailed meaning that is Bhikkhus a bhikkhu should examine things in such a way that while he is examining them his consciousness is not distracted and scattered externally nor stuck internally and by not clinging he does not become agitated
If his consciousness is not distracted and scattered externally nor stuck internally and if by not clinging he does not become agitated then for him there is no origination of suffering  of birth ageing and death in the future I understand the detailed meaning of this summary to be thus
Now friends if you wish go to the Blessed One and ask him about the meaning of this
As the Blessed One explains it to you so you should remember it
Then the bhikkhus having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Maha Kaccanas words rose from their seats and went to the Blessed One After paying homage to him they sat down at one side
The venerable Maha Kaccana expounded the meaning to us with these terms statements and phrases
Maha Kaccana is wise bhikkhus Maha Kaccana has great wisdom
If you had asked me the meaning of this I would have explained it to you in the same way that Maha Kaccana has explained it
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
One who wants to develop compassion should begin his task by reviewing the danger in lack of compassion and the advantage in compassion
And when he begins it he should not direct it at first towards the dear etc persons
One of the opposite sex and one who is dead are also not the field for it
In the Vibhaṅga it is said And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart endued with compassion
Just as he would feel compassion on seeing an unlucky unfortunate person so he pervades all beings with compassion  Therefore first of all on seeing a wretched man unlucky unfortunate in every way a fit object for compassion unsightly reduced to utter misery with hands and feet cut off sitting in the shelter for the helpless with a pot placed before him with a mass of maggots oozing from his arms and legs and moaning compassion should be felt for him in this way This being has indeed been reduced to misery if only he could be freed from this suffering 
But if he does not encounter such a person then he can arouse compassion for an evildoing person even though he is happy by comparing him to one about to be executed
How
Suppose a robber has been caught with stolen goods and in accordance with the kings command to execute him the kings men bind him and lead him off to the place of execution giving him a hundred blows in sets of four
Then people give him things to chew and eat and also garlands and perfumes unguents and betel leaves
Although he goes along eating and enjoying these things as though he were happy and well off still no one fancies that he is really happy and well off On the contrary people feel compassion for him thinking This poor wretch is now about to die every step he takes brings him nearer to the presence of death
So too a bhikkhu whose meditation subject is compassion should arouse compassion for an evildoing person even if he is happy Though this poor wretch is now happy cheerful enjoying his wealth still for want of even one good deed done now in any one of the three doors of body speech and mind he can come to experience untold suffering in the states of loss
Having aroused compassion for that person in that way he should next arouse compassion for a dear person next for a neutral person and next for a hostile person successively in the same way
But if resentment towards the hostile person arises in the way already described he should make it subside in the way described under lovingkindness 
And here too when someone has done profitable deeds and the meditator sees or hears that he has been overtaken by one of the kinds of ruin beginning with ruin of health relatives property etc he deserves the meditators compassion and so he does too in any case even with no such ruin thus In reality he is unhappy because he is not exempt from the suffering of the round of becoming And in the way already described the meditator should break down the barriers between the four kinds of people that is to say himself the dear person the neutral person and the hostile person Then cultivating that sign developing it and repeatedly practicing it he should increase the absorption by the triple and quadruple jhāna in the way already stated under lovingkindness
But the order given in the Aṅguttara Commentary is that a hostile person should first be made the object of compassion and when the mind has been made malleable with respect to him next the unlucky person next the dear person and next oneself That does not agree with the text an unlucky unfortunate person Therefore he should begin the development break down the barriers and increase absorption only in the way stated here
After that the versatility consisting in the unspecified pervasion in five ways the specified pervasion in seven ways and the directional pervasion in ten ways and the advantages described as He sleeps in comfort etc should be understood in the same way as given under lovingkindness
This is the detailed explanation of the development of compassion
for one who is dear simply retains the position of one who is dear
a very dear companion retains the position of a very dear companion
one who is neutral retains the position of one who is neutral
one who is antipathetic retains the position of one who is antipathetic
and one who is hostile retains the position of one who is hostile
One who begins the development of gladness should not start with the dear person and the rest
One of the opposite sex and one who is dead are also not the field for it
However the very dear companion can be the proximate cause for itone who in the commentaries is called a boon companion
for he is constantly glad he laughs first and speaks afterwards So he should be the first to be pervaded with gladness
Or on seeing or hearing about a dear person being happy cheerful and glad gladness can be aroused thus This being is indeed glad How good how excellent
For this is what is referred to in the Vibhaṅga And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart endued with gladness
Just as he would be glad on seeing a dear and beloved person so he pervades all beings with gladness 
But if his boon companion or the dear person was happy in the past but is now unlucky and unfortunate then gladness can still be aroused by remembering his past happiness and apprehending the glad aspect in this way In the past he had great wealth a great following and he was always glad Or gladness can be aroused by apprehending the future glad aspect in him in this way In the future he will again enjoy similar success and will go about in gold palanquins on the backs of elephants or on horseback and so on
Having thus aroused gladness with respect to a dear person he can then direct it successively towards a neutral one and after that towards a hostile one
But if resentment towards the hostile one arises in him in the way already described he should make it subside in the same way as described under loving kindness  He should break down the barriers by means of mental impartiality towards the four that is towards these three and himself And by cultivating that sign developing and repeatedly practicing it he should increase the absorption to triple and quadruple jhāna in the way already stated under lovingkindness
Next the versatility consisting in unspecified pervasion in five ways specified pervasion in seven ways and directional pervasion in ten ways and also the advantages described as He sleeps in comfort etc should be understood in the same way as stated under lovingkindness
This is the detailed explanation of the development of gladness
for a dear person is not the proximate cause of gladness merely in virtue of dearness how much less the neutral and the hostile person
One who wants to develop equanimity must have already obtained the triple or quadruple jhāna in lovingkindness and so on He should emerge from the third jhāna in the fourfold reckoning after he has made it familiar and he should see danger in the former three divine abidings because they are linked with attention given to beings enjoyment in the way beginning May they be happy because resentment and approval are near and because their association with joy is gross And he should also see the advantage in equanimity because it is peaceful Then he should arouse equanimity by looking on with equanimity at a person who is normally neutral
after that at a dear person and the rest
For this is said And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart endued with equanimity
Just as he would feel equanimity on seeing a person who was neither beloved nor unloved so he pervades all beings with equanimity 
Therefore he should arouse equanimity towards the neutral person in the way already stated Then through the neutral one he should break down the barriers in each case between the three people that is the dear person then the boon companion and then the hostile one and lastly himself And he should cultivate that sign develop and repeatedly practice it
As he does so the fourth jhāna arises in him in the way described under the earth kasiṇa
But how then Does this arise in one in whom the third jhāna has already arisen on the basis of the earth kasiṇa etc
It does not
Why not
Because of the dissimilarity of the object
It arises only in one in whom the third jhāna has arisen on the basis of lovingkindness etc because the object is similar
But after that the versatility and the obtaining of advantages should be understood in the same way as described under lovingkindness
This is the detailed explanation of the development of equanimity
Now having thus known these divine abidings Told by the Divine One supremely wise
There is this general explanation too Concerning them that he should recognize
Meanings  Now as to the meaning firstly of lovingkindness compassion gladness and equanimity it fattens  thus it is lovingkindness  it is solvent is the meaning
Also it comes about with respect to a friend  or it is behaviour towards a friend thus it is lovingkindness 
When there is suffering in others it causes good peoples hearts to be moved  thus it is compassion 
Or alternatively it combats  others suffering attacks and demolishes it thus it is compassion
Or alternatively it is scattered upon those who suffer it is extended to them by pervasion thus it is compassion 
Those endowed with it are glad  or itself is glad  or it is the mere act of being glad  thus it is gladness 
It looks on at  abandoning such interestedness as thinking May they be free from enmity and having recourse to neutrality thus it is equanimity 
Characteristic Etc  As to the characteristic etc lovingkindness is characterized here as promoting the aspect of welfare Its function is to prefer welfare It is manifested as the removal of annoyance Its proximate cause is seeing loveableness in beings
It succeeds when it makes ill will subside and it fails when it produces affection
Compassion is characterized as promoting the aspect of allaying suffering Its function resides in not bearing others suffering It is manifested as non cruelty Its proximate cause is to see helplessness in those overwhelmed by suffering
It succeeds when it makes cruelty subside and it fails when it produces sorrow
Gladness is characterized as gladdening  Its function resides in being unenvious It is manifested as the elimination of aversion  Its proximate cause is seeing beings success
It succeeds when it makes aversion subside and it fails when it produces merriment
Equanimity is characterized as promoting the aspect of neutrality towards beings Its function is to see equality in beings It is manifested as the quieting of resentment and approval Its proximate cause is seeing ownership of deeds thus Beings are owners of their deeds Whose if not theirs is the choice by which they will become happy or will get free from suffering or will not fall away from the success they have reached
 It succeeds when it makes resentment and approval subside and it fails when it produces the equanimity of unknowing which is that worldlyminded indifference of ignorance based on the house life
Purpose  The general purpose of these four divine abidings is the bliss of insight and an excellent form of future existence
That peculiar to each is respectively the warding off of ill will and so on
For here lovingkindness has the purpose of warding off ill will
And this is said too
The Near and Far Enemies And here each one has two enemies one near and one far
The divine abiding of lovingkindness has greed as its near enemy since both share in seeing virtues Greed behaves like a foe who keeps close by a man and it easily finds an opportunity So lovingkindness should be well protected from it
And ill will which is dissimilar to the similar greed is its far enemy like a foe ensconced in a rock wilderness So lovingkindness must be practiced free from fear of that
for it is not possible to practice lovingkindness and feel anger simultaneously 
Compassion has grief based on the home life as its near enemy since both share in seeing failure Such grief has been described in the way beginning When a man either regards as a privation failure to obtain visible objects cognizable by the eye that are sought after desired agreeable gratifying and associated with worldliness or when he recalls those formerly obtained that are past ceased and changed then grief arises in him Such grief as this is called grief based on the home life 
And cruelty which is dissimilar to the similar grief is its far enemy
So compassion must be practiced free from fear of that
Gladness has joy based on the home life as its near enemy since both share in seeing success Such joy has been described in the way beginning When a man either regards as gain the obtaining of visible objects cognizable by the eye that are sought  and associated with worldliness or recalls those formerly obtained that are past ceased and changed then joy arises in him Such joy as this is called joy based on the home life 
And aversion  which is dissimilar to the similar joy is its far enemy
So gladness should be practiced free from fear of that for it is not possible to practice gladness and be discontented with remote abodes and things connected with the higher profitableness simultaneously
Such unknowing has been described in the way beginning On seeing a visible object with the eye equanimity arises in the foolish infatuated ordinary man in the untaught ordinary man who has not conquered his limitations who has not conquered future kamma result who is unperceiving of danger Such equanimity as this does not surmount the visible object
Such equanimity as this is called equanimity based on the home life  Equanimity has the equanimity of unknowing based on the home life as its near enemy since both share in ignoring faults and virtues
And greed and resentment which are dissimilar to the similar unknowing are its far enemies
Therefore equanimity must be practiced free from fear of that
The Beginning Middle and End Etc  Now zeal consisting in desire to act is the beginning of all these things Suppression of the hindrances etc is the middle Absorption is the end
Their object is a single living being or many living beings as a mental object consisting in a concept
The Order in Extension  The extension of the object takes place either in access or in absorption
Here is the order of it Just as a skilled ploughman first delimits an area and then does his ploughing so first a single dwelling should be delimited and loving kindness developed towards all beings there in the way beginning In this dwelling may all beings be free from enmity
Next he can successively delimit three four five six seven eight nine ten one street half the village the whole village the district the kingdom one direction and so on up to one worldsphere or even beyond that and develop loving kindness towards the beings in such areas
Likewise with compassion and so on This is the order in extending here
The Outcome  Just as the immaterial states are the outcome of the kasiṇas and the base consisting of neither perception nor nonperception is the outcome of concentration and fruition attainment is the outcome of insight and the attainment of cessation is the outcome of serenity coupled with insight so the divine abiding of equanimity is the outcome of the first three divine abidings
For just as the gable rafters cannot be placed in the air without having first set up the scaffolding and built the framework of beams so it is not possible to develop the fourth without having already developed the third jhāna in the earlier 
Four Questions  And here it may be asked But why are lovingkindness compassion gladness and equanimity called divine abidings
And why are they only four
And what is their order And why are they called measureless states in the Abhidhamma
It may be replied The divineness of the abiding should be understood here in the sense of best and in the sense of immaculate
For these abidings are the best in being the right attitude towards beings
And just as Brahmā gods abide with immaculate minds so the meditators who associate themselves with these abidings abide on an equal footing with Brahmā gods So they are called divine abidings in the sense of best and in the sense of immaculate
Here are the answers to the questions beginning with Why are they only four 
Their number four is due to paths to purity And other sets of four
As welfare and the rest
their order to their aim Immeasurable
Their scope is found to be so measureless states their name
For among these lovingkindness is the way to purity for one who has much ill will compassion is that for one who has much cruelty gladness is that for one who has much aversion  and equanimity is that for one who has much greed
Also attention given to beings is only fourfold that is to say as bringing welfare as removing suffering as being glad at their success and as unconcern that is to say impartial neutrality
And one abiding in the measureless states should practice lovingkindness and the rest like a mother with four sons namely a child an invalid one in the flush of youth and one busy with his own affairs for she wants the child to grow up wants the invalid to get well wants the one in the flush of youth to enjoy for long the benefits of youth and is not at all bothered about the one who is busy with his own affairs
That is why the measureless states are only four as due to paths to purity and other sets of four
One who wants to develop these four should practice them towards beings first as the promotion of the aspect of welfareand lovingkindness has the promotion of the aspect of welfare as its characteristic
and instead of assuming a measure such as Loving kindness etc should be developed only towards a single being or in an area of such an extent they occur with universal pervasion
That is why it was said
Their number four is due to paths to purity And other sets of four
As welfare and the rest
Their scope is found to be so measureless states their name
As Producing Three Jhānas and Four Jhānas Though they have a single characteristic in having a measureless scope yet the first three are only of triple and quadruple jhāna respectively in the fourfold and fivefold reckonings
Why
Because they are not dissociated from joy
But why are their aims not dissociated from joy
Because they are the escape from ill will etc which are originated by grief
But the last one belongs only to the remaining single jhāna
Why
Because it is associated with equanimous feeling
For the divine abiding of equanimity that occurs in the aspect of neutrality towards beings does not exist apart from equanimous that is to say neither painfulnorpleasant feeling
However someone might say this It has been said by the Blessed One in the Book of Eights speaking of the measureless states in general Next bhikkhu you should develop the concentration with applied thought and sustained thought and you should develop it without applied thought and with sustained thought only and you should develop it without applied thought and without sustained thought and you should develop it with happiness and you should develop it without happiness and you should develop it accompanied by gratification and you should develop it accompanied by equanimity  Consequently all four measureless states have quadruple and quintuple jhāna
