The two kinds of latent forces are also similar   Every single defilement has two principles  Discriminated  are the primitive latent forces that produce the panorama of phenomena generated from defilement They have names but no essence  
The discriminator is the essence of defilement It also exists but is not absolute  It is the nature of dependence  
However what we have explained here as the discriminated  and  dependence are named differently in  the Three States of Insubstantiality   
The nature of discrimination is called the categories for aspects and the nature of dependence is called the primitive    If one considers the nature of discrimination as having an essence having categories for aspects and producing the panorama of phenomena of all defilements we say that this is called defilement 
The nature of dependence is the essence of defilement Because it can bring about the retribution of life and death  it is called primitive  
Now because we explain here the nature of discrimination as the categories of aspects and the primitive manifestation  we call it primitive  
The nature of dependence can be attached to the previous category of aspects and is thus called aspects  Each  has its own meaning 
If one wishes to turn to these meanings  the Three States of Insubstantiality has acceptable terminology Theory of Three Natures  The text says 
Whatever is discrimination if one discriminates this or that kind of thing these kinds of things are  called the nature of discrimination  These only have names but the essence  that the name indicates does not really exist 
  The essence  that is indicated  does not really exist this discrimination is generated contingent upon others   Therefore it is called the nature of dependence  
Both natures are inseparable this is identical to the nature of the absolute  
If they were separable from each other then the principle of ConsciousnessOnly would not be upheld because sense objects would be different from consciousness 
Because they are inseparable there is ConsciousnessOnly without an objective world  Because there is no objective world consciousness also does not exist Because the sense object does not exist and neither does consciousness the principle of ConsciousnessOnly is established  This being then established therefore the former nature  are neither identical to nor different from each other 
If one posits their identity or difference then there is an error 
If the nature of discrimination is posited as identical to the nature of dependence then the nature of discrimination would never exist nor could it include the five sets   
 The nature of dependence could never exist either If this were the case then there could be no life or death liberation good or evil morality or discipline  
This cannot be  Therefore since this is not the case the nature of discrimination and the nature of dependence are not to be posited as identical 
If one posits that they are different then given the nature of discrimination one could not dispense with the nature of dependence  
This follows because if we view the nature of discrimination as devoid of existence then and only then will we see that the nature of dependence is also devoid of existence  Therefore we are not to posit that they are different 
Moreover if the nature of discrimination is posited as being different from the nature of dependence then the essence of the nature of discrimination should be posited as existing and one should not say that it never exists  
Existence can be differentiated from nonexistence but how can we discuss the difference 
Therefore we only say that they are neither identical nor different and cannot posit either identity or difference    Verse XXlIb 
 It is like impermanence  and conditioned phenomena We also cannot posit that they are either identical or different 
Impermanence means not existing either in the previous or in the succeeding moment 
The five aggregates are conditioned phenomena If impermanence and conditioned phenomena were posited as being identical then if impermanence did not exist all phenomena would not exist 
Since they both  are not nonexistent they are not to be posited as identical 
If they are posited as different then when one views the impermanent one should not understand conditioned phenomena Because they are understood they are not to be posited as different 
Thus they are neither identical nor different 
Thus all phenomena are like this the form  and the pot are neither identical nor different 
If the form and the pot were posited as identical then the form could not be a pot but if the pot were truly real and if the form is maintained as different from the pot then when one sees form one should not apprehend the pot 
Therefore they are not maintained as identical or different 
These two sets of explanations  are similar in that Verse XXIIc  if one does not view the nature of discrimination then one does not view the nature of dependence   Therefore they are neither identical nor different 
However all phenomena have only three natures and are entirely included in these   
Theory of Three States of Insubstantiality or Naturelessnesses   The Tathagata for the benefit of living beings explained that all phenomena are devoid of a substantial nature  There are three kinds 
The three natures were previously explained    The first two are conventional truth The third one is absolute truth 
All phenomena are included in the two truths conventional and absolute  
The three states devoid of substantial natures are inseparable from the previously mentioned three natures  The nature o f discrimination i s called the state devoid of a substantial nature with respect to characteristics   because its characteristics have no essence  The nature of dependence is called the state devoid of a substantial nature with respect to production   because its essence with relation to causation does not exist   The essence  appears as the aspect of matter 
Since discrimination does not exist the essence  does not exist 
 Since the causes do not exist either the sense object being derived from the nature of discrimination can bring about effects on consciousness 
If an objective world does not exist what produces any effects 
For example seeds can produce a sprout If the seed does not exist how can a sprout emerge 
Therefore there is no production  The nature of the absolute is called the state devoid of any substantial nature with respect to the nature  Exegesis  because it neither exists nor does not exist   
With reference to persons and phenomena they are devoid of any substantial nature as existent things  With reference to these two Emptinesses   they are devoid of any substantial nature as nonexistent things  Therefore we deny both the substantial nature of existence and that of nonexistence and reiterate that this is referred to as the state devoid of any substantial nature with respect to any nature   
These three states devoid of substantial natures are the absolute reality  in all phenomena  Exegesis  Because these are separate from existence they are called permanent  
In order to indicate these three states devoid of substantial natures we explain the principle of ConsciousnessOnly Supreme Knowledge  Verse XXVI 
 Someone who cultivates the path to wisdom  but does not abide in the principle of ConsciousnessOnly has defilements produced by the propensities  of the twofold attachment   that have not been eliminated Exegesis  nor have their roots been eliminated  
For this reason one establishes the One Vehicle in which all are able to learn the Bodhisattva path  Verse XXVII 
 If one says there is only the existence of consciousness based upon attachment to what is presented before him   then since he has not yet eliminated this attachment   he does not enter ConsciousnessOnly  Verse XXVIII 
 If the cognizer  the two  are not manifeste d   At that time the practitioner says I am entering ConsciousnessOnly  Exegesis 
 This is called nonapprehension   that is neither thought  nor sense object This wisdom is called lithe transcendenFo wisdom devoid of  discrimination Exegesis  which means there is no differentiating between cognizer and sense objects  It is called the wisdom of Suchness and Verse XXIXb  
 also called lithe transformation  of the basis   Exegesis   Therefore one abandons the basis of life and death based only upon the principle   
Gross  are the nature of discrimination and the attachments  are the nature of dependence  
These two kinds  are both ended This is called the realm devoid of outflows    This is called the inconceivable   This is called the absolutely real and good   This is called the fruit that permanently abides   This is called transcendent bliss  the body of liberation  and the Dharmabody within the three bodies   
Commentary   The defilements produced by the propensities of the twofold attachment  that have not been eliminated This signifies the defilements  the propensities of the two attachments  of Insight and by  Development which can create seeds and produce unlimited defilements onto the mind  
all take the fundamental consciousness  for their foundation If the foundation is not yet eliminated the branches will not end either As the Srzmaladevzsutra explains If the stage of ignorance is not absolutely eliminated then the limitless four stages of abiding will not be absolutely eliminated   If the cognizer does not apprehend the object the two  are not manifested  The sense objects are the objects of ConsciousnessOnly this is confusion concerning ConsciousnessOnly Because there are no objects there is  no consciousness 
Since consciousness does not exist the mind that apprehends ConsciousnessOnly as an object also does not exist Therefore it is said that the two are not manifested These two  only refer to two  consciousnesses presented with a sense object before them but the sense ocject  before consciousness is already nonexistent 
This is the culmination of the Evolution of Consciousness

the one who teaches a Dharma that is without strife and the one who grants consecration into omniscient wisdom
And also his other relatives Numbering seventyfive quintillion 
Are today in uncertainty Wondering what the Jina is saying 
Since he has his mind set on deliverance he will uproot birth old age and death He is wellborn and will bring beings to awakening
If a preceptor or an instructor were to incur a transgression requiring saṅgha intervention
Bodhisattvas similarly are never late when it comes to ripening sentient beings who are to be trained
The Lord Buddha was in residence in the garden of mrapālī in the city of Vaiśālī attended by a great gathering Of bhikṣus there were eight thousand
Blessed One what are the instructions for attaining this absorption that encapsulates all merit
Blessed One without training we will practice the trainings of the bodhisattvas

On returning they considered the matter
What will they be They will be the food of joy in the Dharma and the food of joy in meditation
Let him follow the One Who Has Completed All Paths

nor does it possess the attributes of maturation
They said How amazing He has such expertise in the arts without even having trained
Then he said All accumulation ends in depletion
Why is that so Because they have the power of previous training in insight and wisdom
they never think Through this gift these roots of virtue and this offering of the Dharma may I become a king a ruler a minister a god a nāga a divine son or any other type of divine being
dwell in the activity of buddhas
Similarly they neither associate feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness with the limit of past time nor do they disassociate them therefrom
Venerable Lord How when maintaining this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom should those great bodhisattva beings practice this transcendent perfection of wisdom
Similarly if they have not misconstrued the emptiness of internal phenomena the emptiness of external phenomena the emptiness of both external and internal phenomena and the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities
So the doctor then goes before them and says Hello everyone I am a doctor I know well about illnesses and their causes and I know how to cure them
All phenomena are empty and equal And
The Blessed One in turn continued
to gain spiritual acceptance of how phenomena truly are
āradvatīputra the expression all things denotes the following
The four guardians of the world are present Waiting to offer you an alms bowl
The sun the moon the celestial chariots the planets and the stars all stood still
An omniscient minds compassion never wanes In its quest for the young calves it nurses
Lord of the World you make no error
They are subtle precise and ultimately incomprehensible

He then addressed the master Viśvāmitra
The tathāgatas bodhisattvas gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas antigods garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragas present in the world systems of the eastern direction numerous as the sands of the River Ganges will sustain their bodies
Tiṣyas son Koṣṭhila returned to the village of Nālada from the South where he had taken up with the Lokāyata ascetics
Accepted an offering of gifts
The Blessed One is endowed with a visage that resembles the full moon
then you should take charge of one while entrusting the other to a monk friend of yours
Moreover they think to themselves The sacred teaching is the DharmaVinaya of the ThusGone One
Therefore you should teach the Dharma by keeping your mind on this
and through the tathāgatas that the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have appeared

So may his wishes be fulfilled and may he Under the best of trees attain supreme and noble awakening
How should we uphold the doctrine revealed by the Elder Subhūti
I should not attain the fruit of entering the stream and should avoid abiding in it

Once the mind has become stable in this One may meditate on the subtle practice
Here I relinquished without exception
They should also maintain the aggregate of correct conduct
Subhūti if the emptiness of internal phenomena were an entity
They are the inconceivably numerous kinds of engagement concerning the composite
Similarly owing to the utter purity of all things they do not apprehend the truth of suffering
What are you A hermaphrodite
Subhūti it is because the essential nature of the applications of mindfulness will not attain emancipation from the three world systems and will not come to rest in omniscience
When they hear this teaching on the transcendent perfection of wisdom they will indeed be afraid and terrified
If one feels a prickling sensation in ones eyes when pricking the soles of the feet it will come within three months
being free of extremist convictions
If ordination was not given the Blessed One decreed
The Tathāgata is the one who knows our aspirations and our past

Subhūti you have said that this vehicle is equal to space
When King uddhodana heard this he sent the councilorpriest before Daṇḍapāṇi ākya with the request
Why is it retentive memory for those dedicated to listening to the Dharma
He does not think does not conceive does not divide things in two
It is the seal of the nature of all phenomena This is the samādhi taught by the guides 
He teaches the Dharma in the form of a nāga to beings who are to be taught by a nāga
That supreme sage asks to enter the kings palace
If they engage with the notion that physical forms are void or that these are not void then they are merely engaging with mental images
Similarly they correctly perceive the six external sense fields to be empty of the six external sense fields
in addition they are also attentive to this transcendent perfection of wisdom in the correct manner and
Is the Jina teaching this samādhi Of the greatly famous supremely wise buddhas 
He will become worthy of veneration
Knowing the great sage Supreme Ones pure intentions and perceiving too the maturity of the beings in this world
When the ethical monks evicted us from the monastery
In order to be in harmony with people he associated with elders with those of middle age and with the young yet always spoke in harmony with the Dharma
That is taught to be the characteristic of the bodys restraint 
Noble son the eloquence of bodhisattvas is free of quivering
who completely frees all beings
They prostrated to the Blessed One placing their heads at his feet
We are freed from the pain of suffering in the three realms
Similarly Subhūti this Great Vehicle is also neither an object of knowledge
and those who have venerated the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas numerous as the sands of the River Ganges
The bodhisattva rīkūṭa declared
He is the one who the lord of the mahoragas longs to see
Why is it called dependent arising
One should place the mantra in the center of a bowl of ghee honey and sugarcandy and
At the same time a symphony of eight hundred thousand cymbals was sounded and a heavy rain of flowers fell
freedom from mistakes freedom from impediments of speech freedom from forgetfulness
If you ask why Subhūti it is because those individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who have been born in the abode of Tuṣita
I pay homage to Avalokiteśvara great lord who gives life
This is the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline possessed by great bodhisattva beings
and some attained the result of becoming a nonreturner
And extremely rare it is that someone develops faith
Subhūti nonentities do not at all abide in nonentity
With such insight wisdom Intellect and mindfulness This ocean of knowledge Even today learns and trains further in calculation
did not ignore his audience pleased all retinues
the avenues the parks and the palaces are made of various perfumes
He is the inevitable result of roots of merit He is adorned by patience
that he resembles a thoroughbred elephant or a thoroughbred steed of noble breed
The Bhagavān came to the street on which was the home of the youth Candraprabha
As one enriches this with the root mantra
Yet this son of noble family brings about these beings fulfillment with the bliss of the higher realms and liberation What are these particular transgressions
The Buddha then said to the venerable Subhūti
That which we refer to as awakening is the bodhisattvas attainment of buddhahood
it is owing to the nonapprehension of sentient beings
When you have earnestly applied the transcendent perfection of wisdom as it has been taught
To be healthy and without disease And to have infinite life without death ever coming
so that they would in the future be drawn into the Blessed Ones sphere
When he arrived in the land of Magadha he saw beings that had lived for twenty years in the wilderness eating each others flesh
Senior āradvatīputra physical forms are empty of physical forms
Due to the virtuous deeds of Māyādevī
Sugata regard them and give your teaching So that they will experience the highest happiness 
When a tree is small Fingernails may fell it
It is reviling previous foolish conduct and not wishing for the level of the śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas

It is taught that one will seize the sixth
who are the specialists in the discourses
which is then transformed into an eightspoked wheel extremely ornate as it is the nature of the complete range of speech
with regard to things that resemble an echo
Instead they each now found themselves dressed in the three robes of a mendicant with an alms bowl and their head shaven
Then for the sake of such a person the bodhisattva kāśagarbha will be born live and teach in the land of the uncivilized or another place
and similarly so that they might completely perfect the other transcendent perfections down to and including the transcendent perfection of generosity and then completely perfect all attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience
Mañjuśrī when bodhisattva great beings wish to achieve this absorption what Dharma should they strive in
Then he summoned Prince Bimbisāra and said
āradvatīputra to what purpose have you said that physical forms do not constitute a bodhisattva and in the same vein that all those other phenomena up to and including the link of aging and death do not constitute a bodhisattva
Subhūti in the same way one who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in the transcendent perfection of generosity
Those who were angry at the dharmabhāṇakas
Without moving from one given buddha realm they appear to awaken to complete buddhahood in numerous buddha realms
The bodhisattvas practice of generosity is not based on desire
Then the student should say
The bodhisattva mahāsattva kāśagarbha is endowed with the excellent quality of such skillful means
āradvatīputra do you think that the designation of sights as with signs or signless constitutes a bodhisattva
It would leave his spiritual practice in tatters leave him ruined wrecked fallen and defeated
and neither does it have aspirations nor is it without aspirations
It is the knowledge of all language It is the knowledge of presenting definitions It is the knowledge of attaining certainty in meaning
This can be remedied by rinsing the nasal passages with sandalwood
Monk dwelling within the essence of enlightenment I have not perceived even the slightest phenomenon that arises that perishes that is afflicted cleansed obscured fettered regretful or miserable
he light encouraged the bodhisattva the great being Vyūharāja who resided in the Sūryāvartā world of the ThusGone One Candrasūryajihmīkaraprabhas buddha realm
So too the practice of the bhūtas starting with Aparājita
but emerge through false imagination
Those who are addicted to their desires Who crave for children and wives
The very moment I heard it from the ThusGone One Vidyuprabhāsa
Moreover Satatasamitābhiyukta the noble man or noble woman who teaches and explains to others this Dharma teaching will have those twelve hundred qualities of the ears
What has become of the brahmin Tiṣya His time came too
Such miracles are not made by humans
In the ponds all the blue red and white lotus flowers also budded and blossomed
I for my part will assume the reins of power here
and went to sit under a large magnolia tree
If you ask why it is because they do not consider the nature of the limit of future time
endowed with a supremely good complexion excellent figure
Similarly if one feels a prickly sensation in all four of the smallest fingers and toes one will die within a month
Subhūti one should know that these are called the refinements of the six extrasensory powers of great bodhisattva beings who abide in the transcendent perfection of wisdom
At that time the five thousand yakṣas who had assembled from everywhere in the universe vanquished by the curse of the incantation
Then from among the assembly of bodhisattvas four hundred million bodhisattvas heard the name of the Blessed One the thusgone ākyamuni
They do not apprehend the emptiness of essential nature as the emptiness of essential nature
What are those ten They are freedom from attachment and aversion with respect to pleasant and unpleasant forms or in relation to pleasant and unpleasant sounds smells tastes textures and mental phenomena Furthermore they are freedom from attachment and aversion in relation to gain and loss pleasure and pain fame and obscurity and praise and blame Noble son bodhisattvas possessing these ten qualities are similar to space
Similarly the purity of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness is identical to it
descended to the levels of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas and failed to enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
The very moment the Victorious One consumes solid and excellent food
Lord where is there such a great being as this
Similarly the transcendence of the sensory element of the ears the sensory element of sounds and the sensory element of auditory consciousness is not the sensory element of auditory consciousness and the other sensory elements of hearing
They help living beings by means of material gifts and do not help them by means of the gift of the Dharma
Just as in space coming going and abiding are not discernible
Reject the faults and practice the qualities Then young man in this life you will become a buddha 
In the same vein as before
Within the milk appeared the contours of an endless knot a simple swastika an elaborate swastika a lotus a vardhamāna and other auspicious signs
You know the aspirations that humans have Therefore I ask this question to you supreme among men 
Phenomena one hundred thousand strong I also perfectly comprehended
The monk informant then prostrates to the seniormost in the saṅgha before taking his place in a kneeling position
Similarly they perfect the four applications of mindfulness the four correct exertions the four supports for miraculous ability the five faculties the five powers the seven branches of enlightenment the noble eightfold path and the three gateways to liberation
A trillion gandharvas dwell in a pore named Suvarṇa
if it counters it would undermine and if it undermines it would debunk the self
then purify them
acknowledging the benevolent activity of the Buddha
they should encourage others also to adhere to the genuine path by abstaining from wrong views
Eighty thousand bodhisattvas achieved the absorption that encapsulates all merit
In terms of wisdom they were like Sumeru
Through words with an implied meaning many bodhisattvas Have been inspired toward the enlightenment of buddhahood 
venerable Vakkula
Then we will have attained nirvāṇa
nanda formerly in times gone by there lived a king named Candraprabha goodlooking
If you ask how this dedication is made
That noble man or noble woman should be known to have been sent to do the Tathāgatas work
How is it then Mañjuśrī that the Dharma taught by the Thusgone One is not false
Nor should they abide in the notion that the aggregates from physical forms up to and including consciousness are nonarising
He replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of mirrors and reflections
the time came for Māyādevī to pass away
Bodhisattvas should be like kings with a vast orientation
These root transgressions cause confusion and beginners who have correctly entered the Mahāyāna will forfeit the entirety of their previously generated roots of virtue and they will be in a state of transgression
What is it you understand Rudraka replied The way of equilibrium which is neither perception nor nonperception
Thus nanda the enlightenment of the buddhas is immeasurable
and teaches without teaching
If they filled all worlds like stands of bamboo Uninterruptedly at all times
As soon as all these precious parasols had been laid down suddenly by the miraculous power of the Lord they were transformed into a single precious canopy
the bodhisattva mahāsattva has no attachment to life or body
the sugata the one who knows the world the unsurpassed guide who tames beings
Such is the bodhisattvas aspiration that knows no dejection
All of these trees produce shoots and flowers according to seasons
Noble son replied the Blessed One this teaching will not spread among beings of inferior merit
That Blessed ThusGone One knew the kings good intentions so he taught him how to gain expertise in the mode of Dharma known as the boundless seal
and thirtytwo thousand great bodhisattva mahāsattvas
attachment to the world system of desire and malice
With his mind filled with faith
To have the conviction that the body is like a reflection
This wheel is without mental elaboration because it is devoid of the sources of conceptual thinking
Bodhisattvas should be unspoiled and unimpaired by any wholesome or unwholesome qualities
Although with their single mind they view the minds of all beings ultimately they view nothing whatsoever
is not without any cause or condition
Exclaiming horrid sounds Beings are tormented
Next the teacher should whisper into the disciples ear about the division of the four joys
they continually delighted in the Dharma and they took vows
Moreover Subhūti great bodhisattva beings by filling the world systems of the great trichiliocosm with divine perfume
The four guardians of the four directions
Padminī Anurāginī
In front of them there were five thousand beautifully decorated elephants
That eon will be named Ratnāvabhāsa
heroic strength consummated in the upholding of the holy Dharma
And dhāraṇī is also not difficult to attain For the one who practices this samādhi 
Just as Sumeru unshakable and immovable Cannot be shaken by the winds
say There is no other Dharma for attaining complete buddhahood and I have attained nirvāṇa
Since the weather that week was intemperate
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara bowed his head to Bhagavat Viśvabhūs feet circumambulated him three times and sat on his left
Venerable Lord this transcendent perfection is without defining characteristics
Noble son what if because he has gone to another land and lacks the facilities he cannot even obtain those 
You have thoroughly eliminated all signs And you wish for nothing whatsoever
They do not forget anything that they have obtained and teach the Dharma to beings
dwelt with all the patience of the bodhisattvas
when the mind does not engage with diverse perceptions so that one achieves and abides in the sense field of infinite space thinking Space is infinite
Desires fall like fruit from trees
According to the division of colorsthe black and so forth
To reply to Māra who said these words The Bodhisattva said
You want to scrape through a mountain with your fingernails Chew through iron with your teeth Penetrate a mountain with your head And measure an unfathomable depth
You have prepared various parasols various crowns various earrings and various necklaces
Knowing the nature and dispositions of fools The wise do not associate with fools
would not even resort to malice
Similarly as great caravan leaders bodhisattvas are worthy of the offerings of those who train and those who are beyond training just as they are worthy of the offerings of gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas demigods garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragas
Their names and their worlds with their devas Will all be exactly the same as What I have previously described For the supreme human Samantaprabhāsa
When he attains enlightenment living beings who are evenly balanced through mindfulness and awareness will be born in his buddhafield
No dharma has been seen by the buddhas nor has it been heard recollected cognized or known
Venerable Lord Is it after hearing the sūtras spoken by the Tathāgata alone that great bodhisattva beings become free from doubt and hesitation and
They have sung their perfect beautiful songs But they do not equal a fraction of the Buddhas speech 
Jewels and pearls were spread out As an offering to Kṣemadatta 
laid down his precious parasol in offering and withdrew to one side
as well as various gods such as the great Brahmā who is the lord of the Sahā world Nārāyaṇa the great śvara akra who is the chief of the gods and Pañcaśikha who is the king of the gandharvas
He may follow the ways of laziness yet his efforts are uninterrupted as he strives in the cultivation of roots of virtue
This is called emptiness as a gateway to liberation
I will be the master of the three realms venerated by gods and humans
will gain special attainments
In that respect Mañjuśrī the Tathāgata thoroughly understands that the root of clinging is the position of a self
They do not have the good karma For listening to this Dharma
Great King what are these eighty minor marks
can irreversible bodhisattvas be called reversible
O hrā hrī hrau
Poised in equanimity your mind is like the sky
He presents them through the wisdom of a tathāgata
In the world system called Vajra abides the Tathāgata called Indestructible Vajra
he established nine hundred and ninety million beings in irreversible progress toward the highest enlightenment
Young man those are the five higher cognitions that are obtained
Bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have the restraint of the mind attain the state of great compassion
amongst them the following bodhisattva mahāsattvas of the excellent eon
will not perceive any flaws in them for they will not think
the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas
Just like awakening so also the earth element does not swerve from the tathatā
The first sense field of mastery refers to the miraculous perceptual transformation that ensues when one who perceives inner forms regards lesser external forms along with excellent colors and inferior colors understands these forms having attained mastery over them and sees them having attained mastery over them
Some proclaim emptiness signlessness and wishlessness
It will be flat pleasant beautiful delightful made of beryl adorned by jewel trees divided eightfold like a checkerboard by golden cords and filled with flowers
They are always weak and hungry Devouring here and there
Those who know that phenomena are empty
They are constantly focused on omniscience In order to bring benefit and happiness to beings 
Many hundreds of thousands of apsarases had gathered there The apsaras named Tilottamā the apsaras named Suvyūhā the apsaras named Suvarṇamekhalā the apsaras named Vibhūṣutā the apsaras named Karṇadhārā the apsaras named Amṛtabindu the apsaras named Pariśobhitakāyā the apsaras named Maṇiprasthanā the apsaras named Cuḍakā the apsaras named Mṛdukā the apsaras named Pañcabhūryābhimukhā the apsaras named Ratikarā the apsaras named Kañcanamālā the apsaras named Nīlotpalā the apsaras named Dharmābhimukhā the apsaras named Sakrīḍā the apsaras named Kṛtsnākarā the apsaras named Suvyūhamati the apsaras named Keyūradharā the apsaras named Dānaṃdadā the apsaras named aśī and many hundreds of thousands of other apsarases were gathered there
owing to the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities that physical forms are nonexistent and nonapprehensible
In the same vein all the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path are not one thing and illusions another
The maṇḍala image is the outer meaning Regarding the outer is the inner The secrecy of just that is the secret meaning
nanda I do not rejoice when this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom is proclaimed to such individuals and
the householder dropped like a felled tree at the monks feet and asked
Similarly when they engage in union with the emptiness of sights they are said to engage in union with the transcendent perfection of wisdom
or a bodhisattva who is about to be initiated into all Dharmas there is no other being
Sarvasumeruparvatarājaśrī Glory of the Entire King of Mountains Mt Sumeru
rather what she says is timely
the love that is without deviation because it acts from decisive motivation
they will accomplish all aims
Have before them the compassionate Amitābha And his host of bhikṣus 
Mañjuśrī I know this clearly
The Buddha then said to the bodhisattva Jagatindhara
the sensory element of the body the sensory element of tangibles and the sensory element of tactile consciousness
When he attains enlightenment living beings who follow the path of the ten virtues with positive thoughts will be born in his buddhafield
Consider noble son the analogy of how the wind moves without impediment without dwelling and without being supported
Here with the sunlight of mindfulness and tranquility I dried up the ocean of existence An expanse of craving churned up By the intoxicated crocodiles of the four physical elements
The bodhisattvas do not believe in the existence of a self Any more than that a fire can burn in the middle of the ocean
one thinks Who is that man having sex with my woman
 Ah Puṣpacandra you are selfcontrolled and compassionate Ah Come here you mountain of love and compassion
The precious divine wheel set in motion by the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class will magically travel through space to the east
Those sounds are heard in all world realms As many worlds as there are in the ten directions
Beautifully adorned body of the one with the ten strengths 
It is rational speech
Similarly the same refrain also should be applied extensively in the case of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness
And finding it place it on the crown of their head
Nor do they apprehend the truths of the origin of suffering the cessation of suffering and the path that leads to it
One should eat cumin seeds with sugar
Bodily mindfulness tranquility and insight the three absorptions the four bases of supernatural power the four thorough relinquishments the four foundations of mindfulness the four concentrations the four truths of the noble ones the five faculties the five powers the six kinds of mindfulness the seven aspects of awakening the eightfold path of the noble ones the nine successive stages of meditative equipoise the ten powers of a thusgone one the eleven liberated sense fields the twelve links of dependent origination the twelvefold wheel of Dharma the sixteen recollections of inhaling and exhaling the breath the eighteen unique attributes of a buddha and the fortytwo lettersall this Brahmā is in the queen of incantations called Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm
Divine son the relative truth which employs all forms of statements speech cognition objects of cognition activities conventions and acts is a gateway to all dharmas
Persons who are not yet twenty years of age cannot accept all they may be subjected to
And nonarising is awakening
and all things are just the same as sin
One who is on the path is not concerned with good or bad paths
And the kṣatriyas together with their retinues become angry at the bhikṣus who diligently practice relinquishment and disparage them
the six sense organs
Venerable Lord if the notion of physical forms as arising or ceasing is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of physical forms as such become a bodhisattva
mouths the size of a needles eye
so that I may heal this bhikṣu of his illness
Mañjuśrī to realize the body and mind in this manner is explained as awakening
but others had two or more some had even up to one hundred thousand
or their view of living creatures their view of living organisms their view of lives
They do not consider whether tangibles are connected with mental phenomena
Oṃ vaiśravaṇāya dhanapuṣṭiṃ kuru ye svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇa vaśaṃ kuru svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇāye śāntiṃ kuru svāhā
he entered his mothers womb as the earth shook and this world
 The Jina thus teaches the relative Dharma Regard the composite and noncomposite in that way
They are always close to the Bodhimaṇḍa Those are the benefits of giving the Dharma 
and in the same vein they apprehend the other sense organs up to and including the mental faculty and develop a view of them in an apprehending manner
Why so It is thought that humans and nonhumans could not be harmed wherever blessed buddhas were dwelling
Reverend āriputra the akras the Brahmās the Lokapālas the devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragas who live in this house
Their renown spreads Through the villages and towns 
Thus bodhisattvas are the ground that holds the seeds of virtuous qualities
Alternatively one should meditate on the white Sarasvatī Arisen from the syllable dhīḥ
In meditation they master the perfections These are distinctive qualities of the second patience 
This tantra must not be revealed
When the Bhagavān taught this Dharma teaching of the samādhi the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomena
They keep in mind the buddhas the supreme humans And they have faith in their supreme conduct
Noble ones it is like this I dwell in happiness I have little harm little illness
Blessed One any god or human being who becomes inspired by this teaching and pursues it will attain the happiness that results from the perfections you have just explained
May beings be liberated from all negative forms of existence
Then create an ink formed from your blood and a pen from one of your bones
I taught for numerous years Explaining the level of nirvāṇa
while auditory consciousness is inner form
children of noble family I will also go there
One will attain the state of Vāgīśvara
Senior ones This transcendent perfection of wisdom which is so profound which cannot be investigated which is not within the perceptual range of sophistry
The nirvāṇa that is the end of causes like an extinguished lamp They will dream those kinds of dreams
Having strewn the earth with flower petals and offered burning butterlamps the patient should then perform worship at that shrine
and beyond the intellect
If someone touchedteinote xmlidUT the corpse of that dog if he shook it if he enjoyed himself with it
Monks so it is replied the Blessed One so it is
If you ask what is the meditative stability free from both ideation and scrutiny

In a similar manner other gods arrived in Jambudvīpa to exhort the solitary buddhas Noble ones they said Give up this buddha realm
āradvatīputra do you think that the designations of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness as afflicted or purified constitute a bodhisattva
And practice what you teach

You a pure being went to the foot of the Bodhi tree
Devas humans kumbhāṇḍas and rākṣasas Wherever beings lived there was happiness and joy
They are terrified of them saddened by them do not value them take no delight in them and have no attachment or clinging to them
It is time to come forth I shall ask you a few questions
What is the attainment of fearlessness It is understanding the Buddhas Dharma and developing the strength of dhyāna
They do not abandon the noble family They have no hypocrisy or boastfulness
observed those miraculous forms emanated through the miraculous abilities of the Tathāgata
neither the lord of the gods Indra nor the most noble ones of this world possess

Youthful Mañjuśrī asked the Bhagavān

Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara then caused divine rains to fall
Placing the sword against the disciples heart

They do not consider the recipient They do not even rejoice in the ripening impact of their giving
With the birth in the family of a universal monarch
Senior āradvatīputra omniscience is not one thing and nonarising another
The Blessed One then spoke the following verses
Such wishing gives rise to rebirthproducing actions by means of body speech and mind This is what is meant by appropriation causes becoming

place it in a charnel ground in a pot seal it
Subhūti if you ask how great bodhisattva beings attract sentient beings through their purposeful activity
Rāhula you will be the eldest son of the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Sāgaravaradharabuddhivikrīḍitābhijña

nanda before long when three months have passed the ThusGone One will pass beyond suffering
Whoever has insight into the four truths of the noble ones Is liberated from existence in saṃsāra Therefore those dwelling in saṃsāra should know all four
I also had there five hundred daughters Who were very beautiful and wore bejeweled shoes
āriputra I cause entry into the vision of the tathāgatas wisdom
I make this praise
Whether I am present or have passed into nirvāṇa
Venerable Lord this transcendent perfection is the emptiness of emptiness
and neither is it void nor is it not void
excellent patience that is not concerned with a purpose
Those phenomena are indeed not their essential nature nor are those words their essential nature
If it has fallen on the giver of fearlessness the student should study the removal of poison
Shifting their attention from their games of pleasure and delights
It is explained with intention as deep
one should incant a peg made of cows bone seven fingers long with  recitations of this mantra and
Venerable Lord this transcendent perfection constitutes the ten powers
For these reasons Senior āradvatīputra the nonarising of the transcendent perfection of wisdom is not the transcendent perfection of wisdom
I can count each drop in those great rivers but
It began to quiver tremble quake move make sound and roar each in three degrees of intensity
These two will become The foremost among all my disciples

the noble lord Avalokiteśvara standing beneath a blossoming aśoka tree
it retains its merit and nonmerit
Later as he was dying he made this prayer
t that time even though great bodhisattva beings become equipoised in the meditative stability of emptiness as a gateway to liberation as far as the realization of the finality of existence is concerned
and are attentive to the notion that inner forms are emptiness and so on up to the notion that inner forms are the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities
They do not practice in order to destroy the harms in cyclic existence nor to destroy the self sentient beings living beings or individuals
Recall the prophecy of Dīpaṃkara
and they were of imposing stature with wide shoulders and broad firm chests He relates all of the beautiful physical attributes of those people

They are adorned with beautiful radiant ornaments
Through many ways they also turn some sentient beings away from the meditative stabilities the formless absorptions the fruit of the meditative stabilities and the fruit of the formless absorptions
while resting in equanimity with the thought Those whom I have freed have indeed crossed over
All the flocks of birds were in the sky Emitting their beautiful perfect songs

 His eyes are clear  stainless  warm  elongated  large and  resemble blue lotuses
He became the king of physicians
Puffed up with pride on account of her magical feminine charm
Subhūti whether or not they have attained the six transcendent perfections irreversible bodhisattvas will respond precisely in the manner of an irreversible great bodhisattva being

Māṭhara repeated them and then said
Oh the suffering Poverty is also suffering

By expounding the bodhisattvas collection of sūtras for the sake of humansteinote xmlidUT They will obtain great merit
From Envy Vajrī

As an elephant does a mud hovel Destroy Yamas minions
The familys fortunes have come about from little merit not a vast store of merit They are impetuous unstable and fickle
As the swords cut into them they let out great cries of torment and flee in all directions
Their two eyeballs are ablaze
since they do not apprehend those bodhisattva levels up to and including the tenth level how could longing for them arise
Wherever one may happen to be There palaces will arise for him
Mistaken conceptual activity then gives rise to the superimposition of a self
nor is there any element of consciousness apart from the element of dharmas

Nor would it measure one thousandth or ever one hundred thousandth of it In fact no number analogy or illustration would suffice
He promised the prince he would do so and went off into the wilds
Therefore nanda this transcendent perfection of wisdom is most important because through it the sentient beings of the world systems of the great trichiliocosm become established in accordance with the deeds of the buddhas
Similarly Subhūti physical forms are also inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
Children of noble family I would not describe as learned any bodhisattvas who do not expound in detail and correctly to others this absorption that encapsulates all merit
Or is it red or white

causing the lilies among humans and gods to bloom
When Māra Pāpīyān heard these words he attempted to become invisible and escape However due to the power of youthful Mañjuśrī he was unable to become invisible and escape
He is then told Listen venerable newly ordained monks name
You are striving for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people and with compassion for the world
based on that would those people create a lot of merit
who has mastered the Vedas and all branches of Vedic knowledge
The glows of the sun and moon the stars jewels fire akra and Brahmā are no longer bright in front of his intense glory
Just as for example the element of consciousness of an arhat who has reached the attainment of cessation remains cognizant after it has ceased internally so too a dying persons element of consciousness retains the capacity for recollection after it has abandoned the body and cast aside the elements
āradvatīputra The purity of phenomena is not subject to rebirth in the world system of desire because the essential nature of the world system of desire is nonapprehensible
Pāpīyān you ought to cut down on your work
He also showed a great display of meditative concentration
By thus attracting them with material things
They should also encourage others to acquire the eight aspects of liberation and the nine serial steps of meditative equipoise
it would not be the transcendent perfection of wisdom if one were to apprehend its essential nature or likewise if one were to apprehend its actualization or genuine origin
and so on up to many eons of dissolution and eons of origination

Then the Licchavi Vimalakīrti knowingly addressed those bodhisattvas who had come from the buddhafield of the Lord Tathāgata Gandhottamakūṭa
Where do you come from venerable one
This will also stop attacks on a garden or field by birds worms locusts and other pests
then āradvatīputra these great bodhisattva beings continue to pursue the paths associated with the ten virtuous actions from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment
they would not equal even one hundredth of the bodhisattva saṅgha of the Blessed One the ThusGone One Samantaraśmyabhyudgataśrīkūtarāja
A great fire started suddenly throughout the house from all sides
It would not even count for one thousandth or onebillionth of it It would not even count as any part any number worthy of consideration simile or approximation of any kind
 All existences are nonexistent they are concepts They are insubstantial they are like mirages and illusions
The wise bodhisattvas who seek to attain The highest supreme enlightenment
You are a savant who only teaches the Ekottarikāgama while
Stay here until you are called
The bodies of some looked awful
bhikṣus the tathāgata teaches them nirvāṇa in accordance with their aspirations
However on that day not a single being followed after them
Lord of sages in order to show me your compassion Chief of devas give your assent vi
not an object of thought or deliberation
is adorned with various jewels
Awakening Mañjuśrī is an appellation for emptiness
They will always be reborn in different ways
Then Senior āradvatīputra addressed Senior Subhūti as follows
suppose a man born blind
Innumerable gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas demigods garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragas anointed their own bodies with the scented water that had come into contact with the body of the ThusGone One

beings wander in the darkness of ignorance and delusion They suffer from the terrors of old age sickness and death They are assailed by the sufferings attendant upon taking birth And they suffer the onslaughts of enemies
Just as hands cannot grasp or capture space
And they will take pleasure in the vaginas of animals
Dispirited he replied Venerables I have a small task to perform so please wait here for a bit
Will not say that emptiness Is other than the nature of form
If you meditate on a worldly samādhi And do not eliminate the conception of a self
If I were to teach this truth to others they would not understand it
the bodhisattvas awakening to unexcelled and complete buddhahood depends on accomplishing the aims of sentient beings
In order to hear the stainless unsurpassable Dharma He sat there with a devout mind 
Prostrations to the bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha
After entering inside he established three hundred and sixty million beings irreversibly in the Dharma
It can be likened to the completion of a thusgone ones body endowed with the marks of a hundred merits and in constant equipoise
And they will hear without exception The many different sounds in this world realm
Upatiṣya asked this of Aśvajit
Venerable Lord Are nonexistent sights unattached to nonexistent sights
Coming into the presence of the Blessed One they prostrated with their heads at his feet
By teaching us this supreme Great Vehicle
Also if that which does not exist were to arise The barren womans son would arise too
for it leads to being in accord with the entirety of the Buddhadharma
For even such activities may be manifested By those perfected in liberative art
The nāga lords Padma and Mahāpadma And also Vāsuki Ananta and Phanaka
He teaches the Dharma in the form of ditya to beings who are to be taught by ditya
Then they train in the emptiness of internal phenomena and in the emptiness of external phenomena
Illusion itself is the ten powers of the tathāgatas and the ten powers of the tathāgatas are themselves illusion
They make offerings from their own hands with respect and reverence
with the presentation of many hundred thousand quintillions of
Thus he abides in the qualities of the profound Dharma

being inclined toward the Dharma
That is why filth emerges from it and it is therefore disagreeable
The virtuous and nonvirtuous actions performed and accumulated
On which day of the month and at which hour
Subhūti those great bodhisattva beings who formerly worked toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment who have maintained purity of conduct in the presence of the genuinely perfect buddhas of the past
in that case they would undervalue the transcendent perfection of wisdom and keep far away from it
This concludes the chapter on mantras the fifth in the glorious Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa tantra called The Sole Hero Chapter  Completion Stage
Similarly the emptiness of the other sensory attributes up to and including feelings due to sensory contact that is mentally compounded will not attain emancipation from the three world systems and
Divine son ultimately all phenomena are without disturbing emotions unborn and unceasing
Again Subhūti there are great bodhisattva beings who can indeed see with their eyes of flesh across an entire chiliocosm
the inconceivable pure places where bodhisattvas take birth as wandering beings
The guides have always praised patience Attaining enlightenment is not difficult for those who practice patience 
similarly I must not establish that many in all those fruits up to and including individual enlightenment

He may follow the ways of those of lowly birth yet through his accumulation of the stores of merit and wisdom he is born in the family of the tathāgatas
that they are not a self that they are empty that they are signless that they are without aspirations that they are calm that they are void that they are purified that they are nonarising that they are unceasing and that they are nonentities
Finally five thousand celestial maidens singing and playing divine instruments came before the Bodhisattvas mother and asked how the birth was and whether she was weary
these are specified those are nonspecified these are contaminated those are uncontaminated these are mundane those are supramundane these are conditioned phenomena those are unconditioned phenomena
Just as when during a famine Someone who finds good food
nanda you only need to act as a mere circumstance
Just in the same way reverend āriputra the bodhisattva reincarnates voluntarily in the impure buddhafields in order to purify the living beings in order to make the light of wisdom shine and in order to clear away the darkness
Nonarising nonabiding nondisintegration and nontransformation with respect to all things
These will be reborn among the gods and humans in the world systems of the happy exalted realms
Through the transcendent perfection of meditative stability they will transcend the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhas
should all be known Bhaiṣajyarāja to be close to the highest complete enlightenment
The minds of sixty great bodhisattva beings were also liberated from contaminants without further grasping that would lead to subsequent rebirth
and whether they go to a temple a house a forest a street a town or the countryside
And why monks did the Bodhisattva examine the country of his birth
They respectfully scattered a multitude of various Flower petals upon the supreme individual 
Make offerings praises and requests
Has been proclaimed as Hatred Vajrī
With the thumb and ring finger
Subhūti there is nothing at all that would apart from the real nature abide in the real nature that would abiding in the real nature attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and that would abiding in the real nature teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings
This occurred even as far down as the great Avīci hell
This Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta has also previously seen this kind of sign from past tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas
From the places where the bhikṣus head ears feet hands and eyes had been cut many quintillions of light rays shone forth
Your palaces are like the palace of Vaijayanta wherein one finds the peace of true Dharma and all ones worries are gone
Within the perfect peace of great bliss They abide in a form that is in all ways delightful
the brahmā ikhin the brahmā Jyotiṣprabha
They offer them gardens temples and parks as well as in a timely manner wealth grains treasuries and storehouses
They are being steadfast in the mind of awakening having cleansed the mind of awakening being in control of the senses having entered the path having the courage to carry the great load never tiring in the pursuit of others welfare pure livelihood avoiding wealth acquired through pretense or flattery being free from deceit and being more honest than the honest Noble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities have trained well
may I dry up the entire ocean of thirst associated with the afflictions of all beings
and in the same vein they apprehend the other sense objects up to and including mental phenomena and develop a view of them in an apprehending manner
Monks therefore abandon wholly negative and mixed actions and seek wholly positive actions
Some attack with weapons Others manifest as disembodied
When seized by Skanda A child moves by hopping skanda
even and well proportioned and of excellent design
The characteristic of phenomena Is the same as that of space and sky
Some palaces were made of pearls others of diamonds
They are the inconceivably numerous accumulations of sūtras concerning the composite
āradvatīputra In the same vein do you think that anything other than the real nature of the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death constitutes a bodhisattva
Similarly all things are neither fettered nor liberated because all things are void because they are nonarising because they are unceasing because they are not fettered and because they are not bound
How can I attain the enlightenment of buddhahood
the bodhisattvas and the great hearers looked toward this Sahā world and saw the ThusGone worthy completely perfect Buddha ākyamuni surrounded by the gathering of bodhisattvas and attended upon by the saṅgha of hearers
King please pay heed
These are good physical actions
Therefore Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom
He whom the King of Aṅga left to defend the city of Campā
is reaping the roots of virtue
She can live wherever she wishes on the strength of her vow to develop living beings
With many kinds of excellent songs and dance With amusements and performances made with a pure mind
Then the precious stūpa also said
Just as Dīpaṃkara granted a prophecy to you Grant me likewise a direct prophecy in this world xxvi
When one puts her two feet Firmly on ones shoulders
This was the first chapter in the Great Sovereign Tantra of Siddhaikavīra
Subhūti it is so It is just as you have said
At that moment however eighty thousand beings stood up fell at the feet of the Blessed One and said
Liberative art not integrated with wisdom is bondage but liberative art integrated with wisdom is liberation
Such is the bodhisattvas perfect giving of material things
Similarly it should be applied to all the meditative stabilities
to which they applied themselves with diligence effort and exertion
The bodhisattva mahāsattva Liberator from Fear then hovered in space at the height of a palm tree and asked the monk
and if there is no mirror no reflection occurs either
Abandon all illusions and arise And teach the Dharma in the city of Ratnāvatī vii
and in order to eliminate the sicknesses of the passions of all living beings you should conceive the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenment
Expertise concerning the aggregates is a gateway to the light of the Dharma for it leads to thorough understanding of suffering
Do not entertain the notion that he is a mere householder
I have already discarded a beautiful kingdom
This noble man is going to turn the wheel of the Dharma He is going to beat the drum of the Dharma
The strength of ten yellow elephants is the same as the strength of one red elephant
Similarly one who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in magical displays mirages echoes optical aberrations and in phantom emanations of the tathāgatas
 If it is true that this phenomenon That is called hand does not exist
He would dedicate his awakening to all beings
Seven mustard seeds is one barley grain
At that time I heard Tathāgata Viśvabhū describe the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
says It is excellent Excellent the scent of the blue lotus will come from their mouth
And afterward start the rites
Venerable Lord As I understand the meaning of the words spoken by the Lord
The youth Candraprabha was overjoyed And in the presence of the Buddha he said these words
His mind was filled with thoughts about the nature of impermanence suffering and repulsiveness He was trained in the applications of mindfulness the thorough relinquishments the bases of miraculous power the faculties the powers the branches of awakening the path the four truths of the noble ones and all the principles conducive to awakening
Similarly consciousness and so forth are themselves the expanse of reality and
And gradually to him will come The attainment of bhūmis and so forth
This is the enlightenment of the tathāgatas Young man have faith in my words
the going forth ordination and monkhood in the wellproclaimed Dharma and Vinaya
and if though you are in the presence of all things you are free of any notion of all things
The Bhagavān was accompanied on his righthand side by Brahmā
to the one who is like a wishfulfilling jewel to the one who protects the treasure of the Dharma
As soon as they see me they will attain samādhi
In like manner why do you say that the designation of fundamental ignorance as permanent or impermanent does not constitute a bodhisattva
It must be due to my many evil deeds in the past
Awakening Mañjuśrī is without striving or giving anything up
Nārāyaṇa wherever bodhisattvas livewhether in towns or in monasteriesif they abide by these four they can be aptly described as dwelling in the abodes
the bodhisattva great being Mahāmati the bodhisattva great being Anantapratibhāna
Enjoin him to dwell in tranquility
Out of deep devotion the householder had a monastery erected for the monk
Now Māra asked his sons
they say Oh a great cloud is pouring down water
āradvatīputra The purity of phenomena is illuminating due to absolute purity
In what way you may wonder are bodhisattvas free of trembling
He attained decisive wisdom in order to sustain the foolish
The soldiers were able to transform their faces in a trillion ways
and this world system will then be called Endowed with Infinite Discourses
There will be no women belonging to Māras faction
Son of noble family through these nine instructions will one attain the absorption that encapsulates all merit
At that time the Guide of the World teaches nothing Other than the āryas truth of suffering
Finally if that merit were multiplied by inexpressibly many hexillions of inexpressibly many times then that would bring forth the voice of a thusgone buddha endowed with sixty thousand aspects
She moved through the sky above An assembly of great men prostrated to her
They will never be blind hunchbacked crippled or mutilated They will not have impaired vision
The Bodhisattva himself however caused all the displays that ornamented all the seats of awakening of the past
will decide to come there to guard protect and offer sanctuary to those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage
Children of the lords of men were revealed Who were residing and practicing in the mountains
And they have no doubt in any of the Dharma And continuously remain in endless wisdom 
This beautiful light glows brilliantly bringing physical bliss
Then the Tathāgata teaches them the Dharma
Bhikṣus do not be afraid of my nirvāṇa There will come a buddha after me 
It will come to rest therein and it will do so owing to nonduality
and that I may go on to abandon all disturbing emotions and actualize arhatship
he told me that he did not have money to pay the fare
In his buddhafield the eight unfree states will not exist
and they should also be attentive to the other notions up to and including the notion that these are extremely calamitous
In that case āradvatīputra do you think that there is affliction or purification with respect to that illusion
Vimalatejā saw the great power with which the Buddha taught the Dharma In his magnificent beauty the Buddha seemed like the lofty king of mountains in the midst of the ocean and Vimalatejā could not stop looking at him
The bhikṣu was not afraid when he saw their weapons
āradvatīputra do you think that these five psychophysical aggregates can train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom and attain emancipation in omniscience
Similarly you should not misconstrue this unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as the applications of mindfulness the correct exertions the supports for miraculous ability the faculties the powers the branches of enlightenment and the paths
O Royal Sage you were the moonlike hero Satyavardhana The king Subhāṣitagaveṣin and the gentle Sumati
Mañjuśrī a bodhisattva who is skilled in this Dharma discourse subjugates and outshines in virtue all opponents
and will develop the aspiration for the highest complete enlightenment
Seeing this some bodhisattvas asked each other Who created such displays
Why Because among the beings of that realm desire anger and dullness are rife
Myriad kinds of lotus anther seats emerged in front and around it On the lotus the bodhisattva mahāsattva kāśagarbha appeared sitting crosslegged
He will be adopted by many millions of buddhas And he will make supreme offerings to those guides 
And all those parks were adorned With fresh flowers and fruit like massed clouds 
Monk as all phenomena are undisturbed by discursive thought they are unelaborated
Since a tathāgata is hard to find and it is difficult to encounter the excellent Dharma
and that is the nature of all phenomena
The inquirer asks Are your parents still living If the ordinand says his parents are still living
Day and night they do not follow the discipline And they do not abhor the path of bad actions 
You have been the king of Kāśi Pradānasūra Ratnacūḍa and āntaga
There is the meditative stability named Taintless Modality Devoid of Impurities
Indeed all phenomena are nonarising unceasing empty unmoving vacuous without a self nonoriginated uncreated unconditioned and without creator or actor
Venerable Lord how is this transcendent perfection of wisdom instructive because physical forms are unseen
As an analogy consider someone who puts on new clothes
Noble son bodhisattvas are free of the stinginess that serves as the cause condition and basis for taking birth as a starving spirit and so they are free from the unbearably savage pain of a starving spirit
One should invite the disciple crowned with the seal of Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa
Senior Subhūti then replied to akra mighty lord of the gods
 the branch of enlightenment that entails correct perseverance
From within their chariots they saw the bhikṣu Whose body had the shining splendor of Mount Meru 
Ask me when we are among the saṅgha and that will prove the time to answer your question
Also Subhūti you asked who will attain emancipation by means of this vehicle
The relics of the Jina are beautified By the clear sound of bells The beauty of silken streamers And bells shaken by the breeze
The Jina with this single light ray from his visage Has made this world and its devas blossom 
Fearing the future
Why is that
This shows that the bodhisattva mahāsattva kāśagarbha possesses inconceivable qualities
Gambhīraghoṣasvaranādita
I ask that the venerable saṅgha grant me ordination
there is a world named Ratnaviśuddhā
One who is in accordance with the virtue of the secret initiation Is in harmony with virtue a novice
Some proclaim the garlands of qualities of the son of the BlissGone Ones
Where do sensation notions formative factors and consciousness come from
I then pondered what was needed for name and form to occur and what conditions contribute to the occurrence of name and form
Abiding in the transcendent perfection of perseverance great bodhisattva beings will perfect all the attributes of the buddhas and attain omniscience
Similarly emptiness is not something other than the ears the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty nor are the mental faculty and the aforementioned sense organs something other than emptiness
This sūtra Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm should then be uttered
tThey will not fall away from hearing the Dharma as they put the teachings into practice assiduously just as they have learned them
They never experience anguish They reach the state of higher bliss
They are never apart from pronouncements of emptiness signlessness wishlessness the unconditioned nonoccurrence nonorigination and nonsubstantiality
When they engage in the conditioning of physical forms and so on up to the conditioning of consciousness I say they will not be released from subsequent rebirths they will be agitated by aging and so on and they will not be released from suffering and so forth
Listen venerable It is time for you to be truthful It is time to come forth
That is to say they do not eat out of yearning craving or attachment
May I always be well
The moon and the sun may fall to the earth But the Jinas speech will never change 
The lords of jinas were not seen And the ten directions were blind
In the same vein why do you say that the remaining designations made with respect to fundamental ignorance up to and including its designation as entity or nonentity do not constitute a bodhisattva
Noble son the Blessed One continued
These childish beings fall like a blind person tumbling into a deep abyss
This is the perfection of knowledge
It is preserving the teaching
then the evil Māra knowing that they are rejoicing might say
Calumny Vajrī vajra yoginī
Bhikṣus the Mahābrahmā named Adhimātrakāruṇika spoke these verses to the great assembly of Brahmās
As he was free of pride vanity haughtiness strife hostility envy miserliness selfishness possessiveness attachment suffering unhappiness and ignorance he was endowed with merit
any notion of the world system of form any notion of the world system of formlessness
This is a fitting place for the Bodhisattva to be conceived
why should I go
In what way you may wonder are bodhisattvas indifferent to harm and assistance
places that are free from attacks by beasts of prey
This transcendent perfection of wisdom does not attain and does not apprehend even omniscience
They turned the irreversible wheel of the Dharma
Bhikṣus in that way the buddha realm of that bhagavān will have inconceivable qualities
Venerable Lord How wonderful it is that this profound sacred doctrine is neither diminished even when it is not explained nor is it enhanced even when it is explained
Similarly owing to their utter purity they do consider the nonarising of the applications of mindfulness
Venerable Lord is this cultivation of the transcendent perfection of wisdom the noncultivation of all things
Behind one should visualize Candraprabha astride a moon disk and holding a blue lotus
They are skilled in the knowledge of the detailed categories of letters and words
who possesses the strength of the ten strengths whose good name has spread in the ten directions
I practice the spiritual life
Wonderful The Blessed One has taught these ten Dharma ways that are supreme and satisfy the profusion of sentient beings
Will you commit yourself to subsisting on such resources The newly ordained monk responds I will so commit myself
What is the elimination of this sickness
Noble Saṅgharakṣita though the Blessed Ones sūtras
It occurred to me then
which fills the treasury of the Dharma
These bodhisattvas stand alongside and will stand alongside the lord buddhas but those do not and will not
Through their abundant contemplation of emptiness they investigate the nature of whatever their minds pursue and have faith in realizing it all to be empty
He appeared to be surrounded by servants yet lived in solitude
Thus he is called the most precious gem
At that time the Buddha taught this topic in detail by reciting these verses
Therefore Mother it is now appropriate for you to let us go
Then he looked back into the Avīci hell
the real nature of physical forms and the real nature of omniscience are one and the same real nature
This concludes the twentysecond chapter on perfect and complete awakening
How does the bodhisattva follow the wrong way
Ultimately the Dharma is not about generating attachment nor is it about bringing attachment to an end
Similarly although the light rays entered the Blessed Ones mouth his mouth could not be seen to be either open or closed
Young man the marvelous things that I have done And the hardships I have undergone for many hundreds of eons
Oh whatever kind of utensil
who have entered upon unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
where before long he would become the Buddha attaining perfect complete and unexcelled awakening
Bodhisattvas should be as immovable as the central mountain
Similarly the other attributes up to and including the ten powers of the tathāgatas are not one thing and emptiness another
It is bridled
Mother is the thusgone Arisen from Flowers still alive
Desire results in a great deal of suffering it is the root of suffering
Such a life is beneficial for oneself and it also helps others
Multitudes of devas and humans listen to me
Enjoin them to perform activity and give an oblation
the inconceivably numerous kinds of words concerning behavior in regard to the kleśas
I will give this very body of mine away to all beings and if I can give this away what need to mention external material things
They attain those four discernments
The Jina cannot be made known By means of the rūpakāya 
The nondual nature is the vajra possessor It fully pervades the vajra sky
Outshining even the light of the sun and moon the light then returned circled around the Bhagavān three times and vanished into the crown of the Bhagavāns head
Therefore he was not a liar
Instead he gathered all four divisions of his great and powerful army
I too find covetousness unpleasant I do not wish for it do not like it and do not enjoy it Therefore
āradvatīputra If great bodhisattva beings flourish accordingly through the transcendent perfection of wisdom
One should eat the gunk licked off her teeth
superiority above the entire world
For a long time he was tormented by his illness And in order to be cured he went in search of a physician 
When practicing generosity by giving away their spouses sons and daughters
When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara comes a profusion of wishgranting trees appears
washed their feet and went hurting and upset to see the Blessed One
and on each of those mountains live eighty thousand rishis
The Bodhisattva explained A league contains  billion nonillions  quintillions  billion  million  thousand smallest particles
They will frown and then reject this yāna Listen to what is the dreadful ripening of their karma
What are the six senses They consist of the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind
Bhagavān I have come before the bhagavān tathāgata ākyamuni in order to listen to this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma in this Sahā world realm
However he did not see such a girl
Then the gods inhabiting the world system of desire and those inhabiting the world system of form said to the Blessed One
With his following of twenty thousand monks he lived and stayed in the Deer Park of ṣipatana near Vārāṇasī
and having turned them away encourage them toward the six attributes of the transcendent perfections
They are my sisters boys
They have been born as humans They are good humans They are supreme humans
Yet when faced with such efforts to make them lose faith and to ridicule them bodhisattvas will think
When not associated with misguided knowledge they are irreproachable
There are many hundreds of thousands of bathing pools
Approach the lord of trees and sit there without fear
those living in the realm of the lord of death
When you left my bed where did you go
He knows the body is like an illusion and chaff As are the ears eyes nose and tongue 
Birth provides the causal condition for old age and death lamentation pain despair and torment Such is how this massive heap of pure anguish comes into being
excellent loving kindness
Mahauṣadhi then asked the Blessed One
When my son was born the world was lit by a brilliant light so I shall name this prince Pradyota Brilliant Light
They practice to attain enlightenmentBut their practice cannot be found 
The world is continually disturbed and is like a tangled mass of cords
tJust so children of noble family
but the ripened fruits of wholly positive actions are wholly positive
Likewise nonvirtuous physical forms are neither fettered nor liberated and similarly nonvirtuous feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are neither fettered nor liberated
Having transformed them into one with his miraculous powers The teacher took into his hand Ambrosialike medicines With that supreme divine vessel
Endowed with such subtle intellect they understand the meaning of what the buddhas and bodhisattvas teach simply by hearing it
the purity of all other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are indivisible
If they think I am a bodhisattva This is a bodhisattva
and a flowing mane of the complete perfection of the thirtyseven branches of awakening along with awareness and wisdom
Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who train accordingly will manifestly attain the transcendent perfection of all trainings
When King ūradatta heard the words of the devas in the sky
Subhūti it is because they well realize the defining characteristic of the sacred doctrine to be that the fruit of nonvirtuous actions is unpleasant and
It must be fearless
they made offerings to the stūpa which contained the relics of the Tathāgata
In this way they engage in abundant contemplation and are diligent in their training
They are fixated on desire hatred and delusion
where he lay down on his bed
Living beings are afflicted by the passions of thought
What is the level It is the tenfold level of the absence of aspiration
It teaches the indivisible nature of phenomena and is a gateway to the limit of reality of all phenomena
Then the Licchavi Vimalakīrti thought to himself
Viśeṣamati
and in the same vein they themselves should cultivate all the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path
why are many different designations applied to all things such as
Only now do I teach it in truth
The outflows have dried up and flow no longer
have known the thoughts that are the various aspirations natures and intentions of beings
This samādhi will not be difficult to attain For those who do not dispute but have peaceful minds 
Since they have the marks of one hundred merits they possess great merit as well
Will experience no joy When they hear this sūtra 
Eating a dish of buffalo curds and rice porridge
Those emanations accomplish buddha activities They go naturally just as is their nature
Noble son go to the Tathāgata the arhat the Samyaksaṃbuddha Padmottama He knows this sixsyllable mahāvidyā
Similarly they neither associate the sensory element of the ears the sensory element of sounds and the sensory element of auditory consciousness with omniscience nor do they disassociate them therefrom
Blessed One how did this young head merchant Bhadrapāla amass his roots of virtue
Emptiness is indeed the noble eightfold path
Then some people arrive there circling around the corpse and
except as liberation
My birth mother
Venerable Lord How do great bodhisattva beings after abiding in the transcendent perfection of perseverance acquire the transcendent perfection of wisdom
Even a hundred axes may fail
He remained in the nature of the Dharma And was unaffected by good or bad qualities
They will go from one pore to another
Consider noble son how a small spark cannot be ignored because of its ability to burn
Blessed One we will cause despair in anyone who hears this Dharma teaching but does not revere it and who fails to worship those who teach it
Venerable Lord Those who would not rejoice in sentient beings who set their mind on enlightenment are on the side of demonic forces
and see with their divine eye
and I will provide recompense from my own stores and treasury
After he passes into nirvāṇa that bodhisattva will uphold his sacred Dharma and propagate it so that the sacred Dharma may remain for long
That magnificence caused this earth to shake And the beings in this supreme city were overjoyed 
They offered the BlissGone One manifold and vast offerings and praised his qualities Then they made this request to his compassionate being
Noble ones I declare to you I proclaim to you
You will become possessed of perfect happiness of mind
But still my Lord you alone are the supreme witness in the worlds of gods and humans and the supreme authority
They do not forget anything that they have obtained and teach the Dharma to beings knowing what will be beneficial for any one person
Thus is the causal relation in outer dependent arising to be seen
The six remembrances are a cause of purification
It is born from sciences and superknowledges
With intelligence and mindfulness restored they returned to their homes
Likewise the great medicinal plants of the Dharma that pacify all the diseases of the afflictions are within the bodhisattvas and emerge from them
The many bhikṣus who were desirous and greedy Yearned for acquisitions held the view of objective reality
they heal sentient beings through their generosity discipline patience diligence concentration and insight Moreover sentient beings are also healed by seeing and hearing bodhisattvas by getting a taste of their qualities and by venerating them
Became irreversible in their progress in all their lifetimes And were never reborn into the lower existences 
and the quality of being devoid of examination Young man that is the restraint of the mind
Prince in the past you were a perfect sage
played the divine drums of paradise and played them throughout the entire ten intermediate eons
When the Guide entered the supreme city The wonders that appeared were uncountable
Moreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of tolerance
The calls of these five hundred men could be heard half a league away
They do not apprehend the sensory elements
Therefore the wise and the realized Are always aspiring to this samādhi
Venerable Lord So it is that the transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely void and
the fruition of streamenterer the fruition of oncereturner
I had also prepared offerings of a thousand tawny cows with silver hooves golden horns and covered with nets of pearls
Different characteristics are characteristic of the nature of phenomena Their essence is empty and their nature is pure
for it leads to unimpaired wisdom

 Sages constantly live in harmony Within such a delightful forest
Moreover ākyas If he can calculate in the duration of a single utterance of the sound huṃ All the dust particles blades of grass forests Medicinal herbs and drops of water in a trichiliocosm
āradvatīputra do you think that the designations of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness as calm or not calm constitute a bodhisattva
To benefit all the worlds
I shall allow his going forthThe sage called out Son who are you
Just as this applies to the inner sense fields so it is with the outer sense fields
Noble son whereas afflicted eloquence is distracted that is not so when it is free of afflictions
We thought There is the attainment of buddhahood through the wisdom of the tathāgatas but we are satisfied with a limited wisdom
But when the inner earth element is not deficient and likewise the elements of water fire wind space and consciousness are not deficient then from the coming together of all these factors the body forms
Also those bodhisattvas will swiftly awaken truly and completely into unsurpassed perfectly complete enlightenment
Who opened the gate for him who led him away
When they observe transcendent awareness they disdain others I say that they have no knowledge
making crushing noises Some were playing kimpalas nakalus and sampas whose resonance boxes had been removed
boiling with affliction their bodies become engorged with semen
you will not be able to create any obstacles for a bodhisattva who has set out with superior intent who is endowed with skillful means and who has departed by means of the perfection of insight
and all others too were bathed in a vast light more luminous than the glow of the gods of the ThirtyThree
Then the bhikṣu not knowing unaware and unsuspecting ate that food
And why will the prince not return Because of his enthusiasm discipline and steadfastness
Venerable Lord if great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom think I am practicing the transcendent perfection of wisdom I should cultivate it then they are merely engaging with mental images
With your stainless concentration and higher knowledge you shine brightly You illumine the ten directions
But the bhikṣus dwelling in emptiness cannot be shaken 
If from today on We should feel any desire
arita with her army And the yakṣiṇī Giridāri With her army The majestic terrific form Known as Hārītī And Caṇḍā Caṇḍālikā Surrounded by her five hundred sons koṭā Karkaṭī Kālī Padumā Padumāvatī Puṣpadantī Viśālā And the rākṣasī Kharakarṇa Candana Viṣṇula Haripiṅgalapiṅgala Kuñjara Nāgadanta Girimitra and Agradaṃṣṭraka The rākṣasī Bhadradantā Brahmilā Viṣṇulā The yakṣa Hālāhala And the rākṣasa Vituṇḍaka
Then the Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta
at that time said these words to the Bhagavān
Bhagavān you are the Instructor the Guide The Teacher of the world and its devas
Then by the supernatural power of the Buddha Bhaiṣajyarāja the gods spoke to him from the heavens
A wise person would always depend upon them And quickly become one who has attained the samādhi 
Under the most excellent lord of trees he will vanquish this friend of darkness And peacefully attain unexcelled awakening
This is what I have heard and all of it is true It is reality In this there is no deception
Therefore if the saṅgha grants consent for the preceptor preceptors name to grant ordination to ordinand ordinands name
The strength of ten celestial gods is the same as the strength of one god who dwells in the immeasurable palace
Return to the place from where they were sent If they are thinking of Avalokiteśvara
Bodhisattvas pursue all the aspects of their training

The bodhisattva Pratyakṣadarśa declared
We see parasols flowers earrings and garlands Wreaths of campaka flowers Necklaces moons and crescent moons
Farther ahead walked five thousand maidens carrying beautiful cushions and five thousand priests carrying bells and ringing out sounds of auspiciousness

These four are the bodhisattvas fearlessnesses
What are those ten They are the excellent wisdom regarding the absence of self in a person the excellent wisdom regarding the absence of self in phenomena the excellent wisdom that is not temporary the excellent wisdom of the sphere of absorption the excellent wisdom of blessings the excellent inalienable wisdom the excellent wisdom that observes the activities of all sentient beings the excellent wisdom of spontaneous accomplishment the excellent wisdom concerning the characteristics of all phenomena and the excellent wisdom that transcends the world
Homage to Tathāgata Nirmitameghagarjanayaśaḥśrī
This same transcendent perfection of wisdom has primacy for those great bodhisattva beings who practice tolerance
In that way the man removes the entire element of earth into the eastern direction
They know the past
and if all the causal and fruitional attributes up to and including enlightenment were distinct things and the emptiness of inherent existence something else
In connection with the secret initiation
Later however excited by desire for sensual pleasures she will forget all that suffering
In terms of worldly experience however they train in the thorough relinquishments
Ignoring what he said they gave ārikā to the brahmin Tiṣya as a wife
Then the fifteen grahas Perpetual drinkers of blood Paid homage to the Lord of the World And with palms joined said
along with the most eminent gods of the Heaven of the ThirtyThree came to meet the Bodhisattva and to offer him their respect and veneration and also to listen to the Dharma

Whenever a female form is seen In the world of the three abodes It should be regarded as my form Be it of low or respectable family
This is the tantra on obtaining wealth a kingdom royalty and the fruit
Noble ones you should do whatever will make it extensively widespread
It does not become an object because it is free of words and letters
That great cloud flashing with lightning Is completely filled with water It resounds with sound Bringing joy to all beings
and though they may indeed practice all the six transcendent perfections and similarly practice in accordance with contaminated uncontaminated mundane supramundane conditioned and unconditioned phenomena exclusively in order that sentient beings might attain final nirvāṇa
One should kick it with ones left foot while
Blessed One will beings who have not produced roots of virtue ever even hear this Dharma teaching let alone commit it to writing commission it to be written retain it recite it or offer flowers incense and incense powder to it
Some ascetics and priests Appear to be caught up in that
Father I will get hold of this monk And throw him to the end of the oceans
They have no part of being a bhikṣu
The nature of these words Is profound subtle and difficult to see 
They do not apprehend the emptiness of both external and internal phenomena as the emptiness of both external and internal phenomena
Dissolve the body speech and mind of the aggressor Into the substances and make the burnt offering
And though one thinks for a very long time There will still be no cessation to thinking 
Moreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline
Monk as all phenomena are inherently nonarising they are tamed
adorned by eight la syllables covered with a maṇḍala of Indra and embellished with a double vajra
Since the Bhagavān has taught the profound Dharma in this way O Bhagavān
However relatively the vinaya of the bodhisattva great beings is aware of all the limitless and boundless worlds in the ten directions
the Dharma will remain for twenty intermediate eons
Senior āradvatīputra I do not hold that attainments are designated with respect to things that are nonarising
If you ask what is the knowledge of the path
to denigrate and be hostile toward bodhisattvas
All is of one taste in being empty
he or she honored each of them by enshrining their preserved bodies in a memorial stūpa made of precious stones each as large as a world with four great continents
You Kuntī and your followers should protect even those who only possess the name of this Dharma teaching
Brahmaviṣṇumaheśvaraśrī Glory of Brahmā Viṣṇu and Maheśvara
At that point Mañjuśrī decided that the entire gathering should witness Māra Pāpīyān residing on a lion throne adorned with all the physical marks of a buddha
Mañjuśrī with respect to what is real no words can be found because it is nonarisen and unceasing
Similarly with the water of training in absorption bodhisattvas cause the web of the roots of affliction to rot
It is the completion of the doorways to liberation
It is exquisite indeed and overwhelms everyone including misguided nonBuddhists the countless wandering mendicants and the naked ascetics
With regard to this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom which the Venerable Lord is explaining
for the sake of a great number of beings and for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans
and they have continued to engage in an apprehending manner in the following views
After they have transcended the sphere of the infinity of consciousness in all aspects
the supports for miraculous ability the faculties the powers the branches of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path
I see some bodhisattvas Who are bhikṣus living in the forests
Those are the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhas
which is the family of all the buddhas which is the secret subject of all the buddhas
Do not look for the Buddha elsewhere
He also established countless innumerable beings in irreversible progress toward the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood and then passed into nirvāṇa
Even at the cost of their lives they would never let their commitments fall apart nor would they refrain from following through on them
they are reborn through the power of their aspirations in those buddhafields
and thus you have to understand the element of consciousness through the particularities of its causes
as alms are not sought after noon packed their begging bowls and Dharma robes
it comprises the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhas
and the defining characteristic of aspirationlessness
Bhagavat I am not satisfied by simply hearing about the sixsyllable mahāvidyā
The left knee resting on the ground signifies protecting the earth
āradvatīputra do you think that the designations of fundamental ignorance and in the same vein of all the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death as entities or nonentities constitute a bodhisattva
Please explain about applying mantras The pacifying and the enriching
It is said that the lower sixth is situated At the center of the superior and disconnected ones
Having donned their armor even if they were afflicted on being struck by the clods of earth sticks or weapons hurled by enemies and assailants
Thereupon in order to make this clear the Bhagavān recited these verses
Nevertheless childish ordinary beings are attached to conceptions of a self and so they think
Divine children wearing sashes were seen moving back and forth between the laps of the women in the retinue of King uddhodanas queen
Mañjuśrī imagine a householder bodhisattva who attends as many buddhas and bodhisattvas
all things are empty of all things and
passing through those  other buddha realms
likewise all the aggregates up to and including consciousness are imbued with suffering
Bones and sinews will be formed from the moon And flesh and other matter from the sun
When the moon is in a clear sky Its reflection appears on the sea
From the right side Siṃhanādin said
and I became arrogant on seeing that I was their sole ruler
Sister what you say is true I must get going regardless of whether I am kicked out
You are a wondrous lamp that discerns them
āradvatīputra if great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom
From the sky tens of millions of gods folded their hands Bowed to him and offered prostrations
For so long parents monks priests spiritual teachers worthy people and religious people have been protected and defended by him
I say that when any sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who have heard this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom who having heard it aspire toward it
The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra The Perfection of Generosity
Such bodhisattvas may alone and unnoticed leave for a place of complete solitude
Surely a being with supreme features helpful activity and wisdom light is here
They experience suffering after suffering I have powerful compassion for them 
Because the rain falls from the cloud the great herbs Grow their stems hollow stalks and skins Their spreading branches and their leaves And likewise their fruits and flowers
up to and including conditioned and unconditioned phenomena then
If you ask why this is mundane
as well as those who worship such Dharma teachers with clothes and ornaments
I have been absorbed in meditation
Because young man for bodhisattva mahāsattvas who are careful the highest complete enlightenment is not difficult to attain let alone this samādhi
perceiving the Buddha is an obscuration
with knowledge they illuminate
the bodhisattva great being Dharaṇīśvararāja
I am powerful with the ten powers Confident with the four confidences And possessor of the eighteen unique qualities The great sage who turns the wheel of Dharma of the Supreme Vehicle
This gives rise to the five superknowledges yet there is no attachment to them
Why is that Because if they become too weak they will turn their backs on virtue and if they become too heavy they will become drowsy
She had never seen heard of or experienced Such a rare happiness
Later as Tiṣya and ārikā sported made love
Alas these beings are suffering from disease
one will confuse all of ones adversaries and appease their anger
pleasurable painful and neutral
Elevating self is a cause of affliction
O King is there anyone in this city who can compete with me in the arts
Yellow is the wisdom of equality
Having taken refuge in and seen these manifestations
Thus they see all these phenomena with the understanding that by purifying disciplining and comprehending the mind they will also purify discipline and comprehend phenomena
Abiding happily in divine bliss
They will not be fascinated by those smells or intoxicated by them
He saw that the bodhisattva mahāsattva Kṣemadattas hand was burning and outshining all other lights
Similarly they do not think Through this ethical discipline may I attain the fruit of one who has entered the stream or the fruit of one tied to one more rebirth or the fruit of one who is no longer subject to rebirth or arhatship or the fruit of individual enlightenment or the maturity of the bodhisattvas or unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
contaminated or uncontaminated conditioned or unconditioned the attributes of ordinary people
I shall introduce them to the Dharmas guidance that has been taught by the Tathāgata and teach it to them
They also entirely give up the subsidiary afflictions that are obstacles on the path to awakening and instead they apply their remedies
What is having a motivation that is not discouraged It is not giving up the motivation and not giving up meditation
It is nirvāṇa because of a word It is peace because of speaking There is equality in terms of conventional appellations There are appellations in terms of ultimate truth
As soon as the bodhisattva great beings and the great hearers had spoken these words
As uddhodanas son he abandoned his kingdom
The connection with this nonexistence Results in a teaching that is one of conventions 
Noble son for many years for many hundreds thousands and hundreds of thousands of years
Kauśika it is because great bodhisattva beings and the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas are not present in the world dependent on the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas
They do not live as householders and become involved in the affairs of householders
Therefore Bhagavān we have contemplated many Dharma teachings that are similar to a rubbish heap
Maudgalyāyana the strength with which I shot it was hereditary it was not shot with any miraculous strength
One should crush the fruit of elephant woodapple and use it to smear a new vessel
You have the feature of nonobscuration
Consider noble son how the god Candra rides a supreme mount and illumines the four continents
Furthermore Mañjuśrī bodhisattvas who pursue enlightenment through the five obscurations
Beautified by ribbons diadems and jewelry Who pulled my chariot with cords of gold 
They do not make offerings to a tathāgata with the hope for anything at all
neither elaboration nor nonelaboration
When those ordinary immature beings who have not gone through arduous training hear such profound sūtras they become extremely frightened and terrified
O Lord they would be incorrect in stating that such and such is the defining characteristic of space
Having attained this peace this stainless samādhi They will be continually pure in celibacy
gripping with the hand gripping using the foot gripping using the top of the head cutting cleaving breaking rubbing target shooting without causing injury target shooting at vital points
will generate many excellent qualities and benefits in this very life
they stayed still looking at the Bhagavat without blinking
For the sake of those sentient beings when I have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment then I should ensure by any means through the four immeasurable aspirations the four formless meditative absorptions and the four attractive qualities of a bodhisattva that those sentient beings act appropriately so that the faults of the perceptual views associated with those sentient beings do not arise
It would be childish dull and bereft of clarity and skill
Therefore the revealed nature of equality Is that all phenomena in essence have no nature
Listen to the explanation Of that which is their field of activity
From now on you should think of your preceptor as your father
Whichever limbs one nails
Venerable Lord if the notion of physical forms as void or not void is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of physical forms as such become a bodhisattva
What is knowledge of the past It is the knowledge of causes
Similarly these four applications of mindfulness are merely names and the same applies to all the remaining causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path
Such is the bodhisattvas fearless aspiration
The postulant postulants name has asked the preceptor preceptors name to allow his going forth
Subhūti all things have the modality of physical forms
That is how this great heap of suffering comes into being
If someone keeps it in mind without distraction and writes it out
he grabbed hold of the elephant by its trunk with his left hand and killed it with his right hand in a single stroke
These are the eight great treasures that one will attain
āriputra this holy person came here from the presence of the Tathāgata Akṣobhya in the universe Abhirati
Furthermore your reality is just the same as the reality of all living beings the reality of all things and the reality of all the holy ones
This great mantra removes all misfortunes that afflict bipeds and quadrupeds and accomplishes all endeavors even when it has not been fully mastered

Whatever karma they create The corresponding result will come to them 
Moreover nanda the sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who resolutely wish to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment should honor venerate respect and make offerings to this same transcendent perfection of wisdom which has just been taught
The effulgence of the Tathāgatas body was manifestly supreme alongside those radiances
At that point the bodhisattva the great being Maitreya said to the Blessed One
Subsequently through those roots of merit after a hundred million eons had passed
that faith that tolerance that confidence that higher aspiration that willingness that volition that renunciation and that unrelenting perseverance until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is attained will increase and flourish since they have been accepted by the transcendent perfection of wisdom
The four meditative concentrations and similarly the four immeasurable aspirations and the four formless absorptions have the defining characteristic of nondisturbance
they do not consider the notions that physical forms are permanent or that they are impermanent
Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who possess those attributes indications and signs are revealed to be irreversible
are endowed with pristine cognition that cannot be captivated
Medhā to the right
Yes there is What type is it Oh it is but a poor one
sentient beings having less desire
from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they are seated at the Focal Point of Enlightenment even for the sake of their own lives do not deprive any sentient being of life
As the Blessed Ones fame spread throughout the world he became known by various names and epithets such as the Blessed One the Worthy One the Perfectly and Completely Awakened One He Who Is Both Wise and Virtuous the BlissGone One the Knower of the World the Peerless Guide Who Tames Beings the Teacher of Gods and Men and the Blessed Buddha
We thought We have obtained a great deal meaning nirvāṇa from the Tathāgata which is like that daily wage
Like a vase of unbaked clay they naturally break
Similarly the pratyekabuddhas the bodhisattvas and the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas do not dream dreams and they are not dreamers of dreams and so on
They should praise and rejoice in others who cultivate the understanding through which the fruit of entering the stream is actualized
How do they act according to the teaching of the thusgone ones
Both their body and mind become blissful These are the benefits of endeavoring in meditation 
āradvatīputra do you think that the real nature of physical forms constitutes a bodhisattva
The laypeople will come to think of them As their teachers
You have great compassion that loves the world and seeks to benefit ordinary beingsgods and humans alikeby accomplishing their welfare and happiness
Blessed One if it is so that were I to become a buddha
acquired eloquence
One is thirsty has red eyes And is constantly suffering with fever
When he saw them he said to the monks
Mañjuśrī what are bodhisattva great beings who have only one birth remaining like
urethral fistula a latent or raging fever
I will practice the six transcendent perfections until even the names of the temporal divisions of month fortnight season and year as employed by sentient beings are no longer existent
His elephants horses conveyances and chariots all fell to the ground
Subhūti In terms of this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom those bodhisattvas of irreversible realization should investigate the transcendent perfection of generosity the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent perfection of wisdom and in the same vein all the other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience
They are all approaching their final existence and surrounded by an assembly of gods they each delight the gods with the appearance of their passing demonstrating the gateway to the light of Dharma
It is purity of action It is the transcendence of the minds perceptions
Similarly they do not think May I be reborn as a universal monarchlord of the four continents
It may be possible for the winds to shake Those mountains declared to be unshakable
then it goes without saying that this is also the case for the thusgone ones who have accomplished roots of virtue throughout millions of eons
and like someone who has perfected the accumulations In this way he sat down on the grass seat and crossed his legs facing toward the east
Knowing that one knows Nirvāṇa deathlessness and peace
so that they can hear from afar the voices
One should explain this tantra to him alone
Similarly Subhūti all things have the modality of real nature
they will never abandon their physical and mental perseverance
It was unconfused harmless and without hesitation
turn away from them
To whom can I turn to about my son To whom shall I cry out in my pain Who will give life back to my only son Who is barely alive
There is no self in this body
Those bodhisattvas who have the power of retention Accomplish countless benefits for beings 
They will stand up and state That is not the teaching of the Buddha 
what cannot be cognized by the ear nose tongue body or mind consciousness
Monks at whichever place the previous thusgone ones the worthy ones turned the wheel of Dharma at that place there appeared one thousand jewel thrones made of seven kinds of jewels

The deceaseds body comes to possess the natural aspects of an ordinary persons form
You performed and amassed an incomparable and immutable wealth of Dharma
Where should he take up residence
Subhūti if the evil Māra were to conjure up the eight great hells with their sentient denizens in the presence of those great bodhisattva beings who are irreversible
nosign is stainless
nowish is nondisturbance
Noble sir how should a sick bodhisattva control his own mind
 He possessed the Dharma of the tathāgatas In the age of destruction he was a treasure of the Dharma
When he said the letter au out came the statement Spontaneously generated aupapāduka
The Blessed One criticised lying in many ways
and said This profound Dharma is the attainment of buddhahood
and omniscience inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
The subtle Dharma that is difficult to perceive And emptiness and peace that is unequaled and inconceivable
It eliminates any views and brings about insight
By reversing the conception of I one will not incite what follows from that

I pay homage to you who know the benefits of sublime diligence

Not only does that acceptance have no object
Those who ridicule and mock those who write out such a sūtra as this will have broken teeth
The nature of omniscience is indeed nonarising
Therefore those eyes will be stainless Unpolluted and pure
likewise all the aggregates up to and including consciousness are impermanent
Mahāmaudgalyāyana then took the two novices for their daily practice
A fine and beautiful elephant white as snow or silver More dazzling than the sun and the moon well proportioned With beautiful legs six great tusks and joints as firm as diamond Entered my wombplease listen to this story
I remember that many eons ago in the past
At bedtime one should recite the mantra eight hundred times
just as noncessation nonsignlessness nonaffliction nonpurification and nonconditioning neither come to rest nor do they not come to rest
Three young ākyas called Bhadrika Mahānāma and Aniruddha tried for a long time to lift the ornaments but they were unable to These ornaments were made for someone with a body as strong as Nārāyaṇa and so other people were not able to wear them
Some like Brahmā have peaceful forms Their peaceful minds rest calmly and their concentration is firm
One billion seven hundred and sixty million towns
O Prajñāpāramitā hū phaṭ
honors it venerates it worships it and makes offerings to it
On this day my wishes have been fulfilled
Smiling at one another the nāgas and their nāga women
Just so do I postulants name too
the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and having greeted me said
One whose mind is in equipoise Should prepare a pleasant seat First one should cultivate loving kindness Second compassion Third sympathetic joy And to complete the lot equanimity
Subhūti when certain great bodhisattva beings lacking the transcendent perfection of wisdom offer donations to those who have entered the stream over eons equal in number to the sands of the River Ganges and
One hundred visaṃjñāgatis is called a sarvasaṃjña
on a human skull
His voice is not loud
He may follow the ways of the rich yet he is without acquisitiveness and often reflects upon the notion of impermanence
At that time akra Brahmā and all the guardians of the world who were present in the gathering said
Noble one since I entered the ocean I have guided all these beings that have appeared here
Jñānābala and Jñānaviśeṣaga Jñānābhibhū and Jñānasamudgata
and do not say that which is anything other than true
Ratnākara
And they sent down a rain of flowers Having come to see the Buddha the Lord of sages 
Part of the way into their voyage they and their seafaring ship were held up by nāgas
You should persevere in those teachings which actualize the fruit of entering the stream
Those of great magical powers Will be as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges
Sons of noble family you know that the time has come so please go ahead
Nonetheless Nārāyaṇa I will use an analogy in order to communicate this point and in order that the absorption that encapsulates all merit may be brought to perfection and in order that beings who desire merit may be granted a basis for obtaining that and in order that the great diligence of beings on the vehicle of bodhisattvas may be brought to perfection
nanda I was skillful in my means and so
Excellent excellent said the Blessed One Thus it is noble son
The nonperception of smell is to have no abode
Moreover Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom think
I should be equipoised in such meditative concentrations
     tWhen practicing generosity by giving away gold silver jewels pearls beryls conch shells moonstones coral and other precious substances
Having become a bodhisattva you must complete the perfection of generosity
the bodhisattva Mahāvikrāmin the bodhisattva Anantavikrāmiṇ
They should meditate on the strength of patience rely on patience and promulgate patience
The buddhas the supreme humans will know it And will expound this single yāna of mine 
These great bodhisattva beings have been exclusively foreordained by the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas to be irreversible in their attainment of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
of the great compassion consummated in the concentration of the holy Dharma on the liberation of all living beings
Desire anger and dullness
All the composite phenomena there are And all the noncomposite phenomena
And quickly become compassionate 
Similarly you should not misconstrue unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as the emptiness of internal phenomena as the emptiness of external phenomena as the emptiness of both external and internal phenomena or as the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities
Similarly the transcendence of the eyes is not the eyes
They will never have the many different kinds of afflictions
And they follow that profound wisdom 
They do not preoccupy themselves with talk about the self sentient beings living creatures lives and the other superimposed notions of a subject up to and including knowers and viewers
Compassion is a gateway to the light of the Dharma
They revel in countless absorptions retentions liberations superknowledges and magical abilities
nanda you should train thinking in this way
The continual reliance on good beings That is the nature of the Jinas teaching 
The bodhisattva mahāsattva Liberator from Fear came into the temple and when he saw the monk crumpled on the ground he asked him
I was thinking about the wife of King Suvarṇapati of Suvarṇadvīpa When her husbands time had come she leapt onto his funeral pyre
The jinas to whom offerings have been made in the past
At this point the bodhisattva mahāsattva Kṣemadatta developed the supreme intention
Then both of those dharmabhāṇakas Said to the king Listen Kṣatriya
Those conceptions have been destroyed Naturally with their conceptions of women 
Be a holder of their supreme Dharma
And they have no longing for food and no longing for clothes That is the uniqueness of this attainment of samādhi i
Let him serve the One with Abundant Merit The Jewel Mine the One Who Bestows Fearlessness and Bliss
King Ratnacchattra said to his sons
His veins are not visible
They discern that physical forms are signless and do not focus on them
Since in a previous existence I offered alms bowls
thus actualizing the fruit of a streamenterer
Make offerings to him
Having reached stability on the eyes of the central figure They are to meditate on the thirtyseven features in full
Well then dear boy Kolita know that the time for such a change has come
lest the outsider sectarians should hear your words
we the four great kings will go there with our armies our young warriors and our retinues to hear the Dharma
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara will come to this great monastery of Jetavana in order to see me to bow down to me to honor me and to give a prophecy concerning the deity Maheśvara in a realm within this universe
went to the ThusGone One
and praised the teachings of the Blessed One
and similarly those who practice in order that they might grasp or reject the transcendent perfection of generosity the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdom
Noble son replied the Blessed One whoever has just one among these factors in a way that is flawless uncorrupted undefiled pure accomplished and perfect has noble son all the other factors as well
If someone were to provide tathāgatas arhats and samyaksaṃbuddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in twelve Ganges Rivers with robes food bowls bedding seats necessary medicine and utensils for an eon the accumulation of merit that would come from serving those tathāgatas would only equal the merit of the tip of one hair on the body of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
He must never leave us
This Maitreya is how the bodhisattvas have excellent giving
Prostrations to the bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin
tAt the same time many trillions of gods assembled
Noble son you may wonder how bodhisattvas pacify wandering beings torments of affliction
I for my part have concealed it very well
For many millions of years They never hear even the name of the tathāgatas Or the Dharma or my followers
They would not be able to describe even a fraction of it Let alone describe the benefit of studying it or of possessing it 
The ground was strewn with purple pink red and white lotus flowers as well as the flowers of goolar fig nīpa varśika taraṇi pāṭalā aśoka kuraṇṭaka nutmeg and utikateinote xmlidUT trees
I myself have noxious fangs
The islands subcontinents mountains the four continents and so forth can be compared to the various practices retentions maturations of sentient beings saṅghas of disciples and so forth
Maudgalyāyana if the blessed buddhas who dwell in other universes did not consecrate the worlds where those bodhisattvas live with an adamantine nature
And who maintain this practice Will be ones who listen to this sūtra 
With your great majesty and beautiful voice Even the majesty of the king does not shine so brightly 
As I have faith in only what is perfect I shall go forth from home into homelessness
Similarly since sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena are nonapprehensible it follows that socalled sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena are nothing but mere names or conventional terms
What is coalescence
they should burn a finger or a toe or a limb or an arm
His whole dwelling swayed
I have suddenly come across this king or great minister
and similarly the fruit of arhatship and actual arhats are all discerned
and also wood
When the gentle profound melodious Speech of the Buddha filled me with joy
He handed them over to the former beggar and said
On the other hand straying from the middle way you will not pass beyond suffering
Noble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities are specialists in the discipline
Monks as soon as the Bodhisattva had this thought a light known as the light which conquers all demonic congregations was emitted from the hair between his eyebrows
All who see this lamp will dance
Through the factor of birth there is old age death misery wailing suffering unhappiness and disturbance
Those with the ten strengths in the past The sugatas of the present and the future
The Bhagavān prophesied to them all that after four million eight hundred thousand countless eons
Like the moon he had perfected all pure qualities
Pressing his palms together he asked
Moreover Subhūti one should know that space is limitless because sentient beings are limitless
A hundred two hundred three four or five hundred people lived in it
They are not attracted to religious robes alms bedding and seats
To those who suffer they offer all that is needed
Noble son the eloquence of those with dull faculties may suffer from a lack of clarity yet that is not the case with those whose faculties are sharp
When they obtain this tolerance they think
 physical forms  feelings  perceptions  formative predispositions and  consciousness
to attain the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood
It is a wheel without disturbance within the realm of phenomena beyond center and edge
sexual misconduct telling lies
Noble son this is the dhāraṇī called jayamatī It exhausts all evil deeds
Monks the ThusGone One replied to the jīvika with this verse
Since there are no differences between these
For example Subhūti space is neither material nor is it immaterial
I will give them eyes that can see reality Saying this you have meditated on knowledge
Subhūti emancipation will be attained from the three world systems and consequently emancipation will be attained in omniscience
Springtime is here the best of seasons
Why Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings not become discouraged with regard to this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom
the radiant majesty of his merit shone brightly among gods and humans As the light of the moon
so that this Dharma teaching is passed on from one to another until it reaches a fiftieth person
Therefore I believed I had attained nirvāṇa But this was not what is called nirvāṇa 
in the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth and in arhatship
Similarly the fruit of entering the stream and likewise the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth arhatship individual enlightenment and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment are all discerned in the world
how could they possibly come or go
Just as it is difficult to fill the oceans desires can never be fulfilled Like salty water objects of desire only make you thirstier
Then once again the daughters of Māra spoke to their father in verse
Their prayers are fulfilled
whether its faculties are impaired or not
I rang a bell and announced I will become the slave of anyone who will give me the highest Dharma and teach me its meaning
One should therefore meditate on Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa
When bodhisattvas see a donor or a benefactor
You may wonder noble son what these qualities from being a source of jewels through to being inexhaustible may imply
Though a hundred spears strike them a third time they still will not die
As the light appeared it illuminated all the infinite buddha realms within all the worlds in the ten directions
Young man what is the cultivation of this samādhi
Moreover Senior āradvatīputra it is owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena
However āriputra in order to teach that meaning extensively I shall teach you parables
He made this proclamation Always enduring abuse and condemnation
and no misfortune will befall him
or on a flat piece of wood or on the surface of a wall that has been wiped clean
Preceptor heed me Please sanction this my ordinands names Dharma robe as a lower robe
Because of this bhikṣu even my own sons refuse to obey me I will be left alone and friendless
Avadavats and flocks of birds with beautiful songs With their beautiful songs that are pleasing to everyone
Subhūti since there are no sentient beings whatsoever among the five classes of living beings who are categorized as sentient beings who are equal to the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas how could any surpass them
steadfast commitment
From then on her fortune became vast and excellent
O cchrī cchrī cchrī Parch parch Stop the flow stop O Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa hū phaṭ
removed his robe from one shoulder and kneeled placing his right knee on the ground
the behavior of such people will not be proper but base
he emitted ten rivers from his ten toes
If that person sits near a heap of embersteinote xmlidUT the more those creatures are tormented by burning the more they eat
These are called the ten recollections
Moreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see sentient beings lacking the major marks
You are the delight of King uddhodanas kingdom Who has won its hearts and minds
that the nature of the mental faculty is emptiness and that emptiness is indeed the mental faculty
Likewise they will not become fixated on the four applications of mindfulness and similarly they will not become fixated on any of the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path
Blessed One they do so to train such beings through those practices replied the bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin
These are called the faculties that will enable knowledge of all that is unknown
That is how the ordinands Dharma robes that have already been cut and sewn are sanctioned
āradvatīputra the bodhisattvas who train accordingly do not train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom and they will not attain emancipation in omniscience
The monks then asked the Blessed One about it and the Blessed One decreed
On his right create Bodhisattva Mahāmaṇidhara
I will do whatever work a slave would do for you
āradvatīputra do you think that anything other than the real nature of the sensory element of the eyes constitutes a bodhisattva
Subhūti great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdom
My diligence is indeed not directed at the transcendence of suffering
It is because they conceive of all those phenomena which are actually unproduced
In accordance with the aspirations formed by the thusgone ones through this offering of the marrow of my bones
Subhūti because the altruistic thoughts cultivated by great bodhisattva beings from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment up to the time when they are seated at the Focal Point of Enlightenment are not entities
The strength of ten collyriumcolored elephants is the same as the strength of one battle elephant
He will appear in this very buddha realm
Because the topic
With the vajra iron hook you summon all
The gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas demigods garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragas who witnessed the qualities of the Bodhisattva watched over him day and night making offerings and forming aspirations
the discernment of definitions and the discernment of eloquence They attain those four discernments
What are those ten They are skill in dedication skill in converting nonBuddhists skill in making others withdraw from objects skill in dispelling lingering regrets skill in being a protector of sentient beings skill in providing sentient beings with a livelihood skill in accepting skill in delivering sentient beings from one context to another skill in genuinely encouraging inspiring and exhilarating beings and skill in worshiping and venerating the ThusGone One
Beings are scorched by attachment and anger Yet they are falsely imputedsuch ills are not for real
bury it in a cow pen
Noble ones if you are uncertain unsure or undecided thinking that Queen Vimaladattā at that time on that occasion was someone else do not have such a view
for it brings complete inner peace
Running before them Are bhūta yakṣas with large bodies
then Bhaiṣajyarāja that bodhisattva has entered the residence of the Tathāgata wears the Dharma robe of the Tathāgata sits upon the seat of the Tathāgata and then teaches this Dharma teaching to the fourfold assembly
And blossoming forth with concentration miracles powers and strengths he will grant to beings a fount of faith
and subsequently you will not be reborn here but on passing away you will proceed to the higher realms
Mañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the state of one who follows out of conviction
You should worship them
splitting their palate
this transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of the innumerable deeds of the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas and by means of their deeds which are equal to the unequaled and so forth
Grown in the fields of karma and born from the water of craving we call it the transitory body
He replied
Some slapped their thighs with their hands and others beat their chests
Young man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of words of unquantifiability What are the four kinds of words of unquantifiability
Friends tonight the Bodhisattva will leave his home So you should delight in making offerings to him
The bhikṣus who after my nirvāṇa Teach this without envy Will have no suffering no obstacles Will have no misery or be disturbed
said to the four great kings
Ah Come here guide who is like a father and mother And close the door through which I will go to hell viii
When food and drink enters the human body it does not matter whether it is clean and fine or of bad quality
Merely visualizing her the yoginī grants the best of things
They turn some sentient beings away from the aggregate of ethical discipline
He will have a full one thousand sons heroic brave and of ideal build who will destroy enemy forces
in one instant of wisdom accurately know hear see and understand everything that is to be known
Are the bhikṣus bhikṣunīs and upāsakas present before me now
They have happiness day and night Their bodies will have pleasurable sensations
If they have gone forth they should be expelled
At that time the Blessed One surrounded and venerated by a retinue of several hundred thousand beings was teaching the Dharma
and then asked it What can I do
First there was a rain of water and the water brought them satisfaction
And could remember countless previous lives 
Yokes shackles prisons The rain of weapons on the battlefield
Due to the absolute purity of what he asked
Such is the bodhisattvas commitment to the vows of individual liberation
By acquiring an innumerable countless and immeasurable number of demerits
and the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of modesty concerning purification Those are the four
never stop receiving the teachings on the perfections
Son of noble family what qualities have you engendered to achieve such acceptance
Young man in the past innumerable vast immeasurable inconceivable unfathomable countless eons ago at that time and in those days
Because I longed for this sublime samādhi
It disciplines ones own mind and protects the minds of others
Emptiness is not other than the ten powers of the tathāgatas nor are the ten powers of the tathāgatas other than emptiness The nature of the ten powers of the tathāgatas is indeed emptiness Emptiness is indeed the ten powers of the tathāgatas
That is called the emptiness of great extent
Among them the eyes are empty of the eyes because they do not endure and they do not disintegrate
All this I shall see no more without him who is so full of qualities
Alas this world is not at peace because of the self
They also taught the Dharma in many worlds Having such an activity through the power of the sugatas 
Last night in my dream
They were not cut off after I went forth
In this way bodhisattvas trust in awakening and the emergence of the thusgone ones
The time for what my Lord The Bodhisattva replied
Many hundred thousand quadrillions of yakṣas let a rain of flowers fall
They maintain discipline out of the wish to bring aid happiness fulfillment and welfare to all beings
Similarly they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that I should possess the thirtytwo major marks of a superior man and consummate each of these marks of a superior man with one hundred merits
That which performs the function of the bodys inhalation and exhalation is called the wind element
the stride of stainless peace the stride that leads to the city of nirvāṇa which is auspicious stainless and free from fear
The sky with its moon and the stars may fall The earth with its mountains and towns may be destroyed
As another analogy a face is reflected on the surface of a very clean mirror
Evil one you are thrown on your back Like a tree tossed about by the wind
has declared four things that lead to an offense for monks who have gone forth and been ordained
When this is attached to the alms bowl During a time of famine
There he will ripen bodhisattvas More numerous than the Ganges sands
How do they become sufficiently stable in their altruism to prevent their mind of awakening from decreasing
Though he saw them he asked the monks
That is the second strange and wonderful thing
As I stay here in this land With water falling from my hands I lack the power to reject it
I haveThe prince thought If the small store of qualities this noble being has attained
If you ask what are the twelve sense fields
He has also offered ornaments golden vessels and goldencolored garments
He is called the one who is like Vaiśravaṇa the one who grants the treasury of the seven noble riches
When the monks saw the two novices miraculously flying through the air picking flowers they asked one another
Noble son bodhisattvas follow the Dharma but not based on form
What do you think son of noble family
He will beget one thousand sons
Her hair as black as a bee frames a fine forehead and a beautiful brow
Noble son I went to Tathāgata Padmottama
Ultimately all phenomena are the same in that they are unborn
But though they appear they do not exist at all Know that all phenomena are like that 
He replied This is owing to the incontrovertible realization of all things
a variety of delightful gardens and a variety of delightful bathing pools Enjoy these divine pleasures
That ray of light illuminated the great trichiliocosm with its intense luminescence and
Noble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities are not fixated on any of their aspirations
Within six months he will become equal to Sarasvatī
Mañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient beings of all the world spheres in the ten directions in the result of an arhat
it is the training of all bodhisattvas
and in the same vein the transcendence of all the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death is always without fear
Noble son in his retinue of queens King Attainment of Victory had ninetynine thousand wives none of whom had entered any other vehicle
Bhagavān I too
and this is the time to be among gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas demigods garuḍas kiṃnaras mahoragas akra Brahmā the world protectors monks nuns as well as male and female novices
the precise identity of old age the source of old age the cessation of old age and the path leading to its cessation
Nor does the expanse of reality consider the sensory element of sights
They will perceive their Dharma teacher as the Teacher in person
and uttered this verse
It is the abode of the Buddha the abode of the Dharma and the abode of the Saṅgha
That is to say it is also known as emptiness nonapprehension the termination of the path the exhaustion of craving the nonresidual state dispassion cessation and nirvāṇa
O Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa you who are a teacher of all magic Teach all the magical methods to remove obstacles Hū phaṭ
The nonobservation of innate joy
Bodhisattvas think like this
Senior āradvatīputra it is in this way that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should refine physical forms
Venerable Lord so be it he replied
They themselves neither understand nor comprehend this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom
Homage to you who are unstained and clean
nanda by the command of the perfectly and completely awakened thusgone arhats of the past future and present
From then on one will be accomplished in every respect
and canopies with victory banners
as if they were fire throw away all the pleasures of a kingdom as if they were a lump of phlegm
Nakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma protects beings from all fear and frees them from all suffering
Please show the path by which with the aid of the teachings one may pass beyond suffering
You should swiftly bring forth the mind that strives for unsurpassable perfectly complete enlightenment and study the Mahāyāna
If from your heart you devote yourself to him with respect
All those śrāvakas have not attained nirvāṇa
These are called the four unhindered discernments
the twelve sense fields the eighteen sensory elements and the maturation of past actions These are considered to be nonspecific phenomena
All such graha kings And terrifying beings Assembled there Are bound by the noose incantation
and similarly having mastered a single syllable by means of the fortytwo syllables
This sentient being has middling beliefs
But if he with perfect faith should cut his hair shave his beard don the saffron robes and go forth from home into homelessness
They are great humans They are human lions They are human elephants
They experienced the unendurable suffering of the great Avīci hell for ten thousand eons
Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Mahāpratibhāna said to the Bhagavān
Grasping is pure owing to the purity of craving
Moreover Mañjuśrī it is in order to attain all phenomena that acceptance is attained
Noble son just as when comparing the full moon and the crescent moon the bodies of the thusgone ones and the bodhisattvas are the same as both fulfill the definition of a body but they are not the same with respect to the power of their qualities
Because it brings freedom from obscuration and the desired true nature of phenomena
All the sentient beings of that realm are without exception bodhisattvas whose progress toward unexcelled and complete awakening is irreversible
Subhūti it is because permanence happiness self and all those attributes up to and including attractiveness never exist and they are nonapprehensible This being the case how could they possibly come and go
They who know the peace that is the nature of phenomena Have a vast abundant inconceivable eloquence
Visualize an iron hook that emerges from the syllable hūṃ Bringing the buddhas and bodhisattvas instantaneously before you Make offerings and so forth to them
who engages with the other bodhisattva levels up to and including the tenth level
When not having any interest in the lesser vehicles they are irreproachable
Venerable Lord When the transcendent perfection of wisdom is actualized in that manner what thing is attained
May I shine the light of Dharma for those who are thrown deep into the darkness of great ignorance within the worldfor the people whose eyes are obscured by the cataract of ignorance who lack the eye of wisdom and who are blind with ignorance and delusion May I raise the lamp of wisdom which destroys the darkness for those who are blinded by ignorance
Bhadrapāla replied the Blessed One the four elements produce the body through their contact
Blessed One how does consciousness abandon the element of form at the time of death
Those with foolish understanding Kill each other with weapons
Divine son when a bodhisattva great being without producing has produced the mindset that thinks I will protect all beings in any possible way he will not yield from that
In the same way a woman should worship a man With respect and with the mind filled with devotion
What can I do 
Those merchants who had fled sought out King Prasenajit their faces and bodies smeared with dirt howling their hair in disarray
and so he truly saw the shortcomings of the physical body
then reverend what is it that makes those persons who are converts to a tīrthika order fit for exclusion
Tell us the reason why you smiled 
This virtuous thought brought the former monk matricides time in hell to an end
Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin bowed his head to the feet of the dharmabhāṇaka and departed
 The beauty of this bhikṣus arrival Is like the sun shining in the sky Dispelling darkness with a thousand light rays Illuminating completely every direction 
in order that they may develop roots of merit the Tathāgata teaches many kinds of Dharma teachings with many kinds of goals
Here I reached the end Of infatuation and aggression The travails of conflicts and disputes
will themselves certainly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
It does not abide in anything nor does it abide in any place nor does it abide in any direction
A woman who has faith on hearing The praise of this precious sūtra
And so he began to search for him among the gods
and one physically actualizes achieves and abides in the cessation of all perceptions and feelings
Adapting to their dispositions and actions and knowing their thoughts
The mind moves is unstable and changes quickly
Blessed One please do so said the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya and listened as the Blessed One had instructed him
Dont help him by holding his robes or his offering bowl
I as a capable man shall do as the king pleases
Why do we not give you a place to stay It is because you have a fault
silken fabrics
While beings see and think That this world realm is burning
Individual liberation bodhisattva
unless there are the two causative factors jealousy and stinginess
If that is not perceived There is no insight into any phenomenon
For the sake of this peaceful samādhi All the immeasurable
On the head a crownseal should be placed Representing the five buddhas
recite the mantra  times for each syllable
Noble son bodhisattvas receive ordination into the excellent teaching of the DharmaVinaya
attained the highest supreme enlightenment
Sir hello Im tormented by the scorching summer heat and Im suffering from thirst
Similarly the diligence of bodhisattvas is also stainless and free of all flaws
Protector you are to conquer the works of Māra And bring defeat to the extremists
and those travelers saw the rogues bandits and foes holding weapons in their hands
Next they focus on their own bodies being one with the body of space and with that focus they entirely transcend all perceptions of form
He replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the emptiness of nondispersal
Their bodies are the same as the bodies of all beings
Noble one I also entrust to you whatever relics there will be from my passing into nirvāṇa
But what is the extent of those sections of the Dharma to which the ThusGone One refers using that expression
At that time the entire surface of this earth Was pleasant and had good harvests and no disorder
When Dipaṃkara made the prediction for the Pure One He said You will become a buddha a lion among the lions of men
to that end Blessed One may all my womans organs now disappear from my body and those of a man appear
An encounter with you O Sage is always so long in coming
Recall all the suffering you have experienced Circling through cyclic existence until now
For the sake of ripening those who experience anger they engage in activities of anger yet they do not dwell on the experience of anger
The many millions of buddhas in the future Who are innumerable beyond reckoning
They do not see any true source of anger nor any way that anger emerges nor any conditions that caused it to arise
It is avoiding that which is outside the scope of correct conduct
Such is the bodhisattvas excellent unperturbed patience
As for these living beings there is nothing to be applied and there is nothing to be removed
Then to those bodhisattva great beings he signaled that he was about to deliver a distinguished Dharma teaching
who is a parasol for beings
Isolation is the unexcelled state of the Teacher
the rākṣasī named Hārītī with her children and servants
the form of a man
so that the śrāvakas might transcend the troubles of birth aging illness death misery wailing suffering and unhappiness
What is arriving at the right time It is knowledge of the time
Similarly the nonexistent applications of mindfulness remain unattached to nonexistent applications of mindfulness and the same goes for the other nonexistent causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path
the light encouraged the bodhisattva the great being Ratnacchattrakūṭasaṃdarśana who resided in the world Ratnavyūhā of the ThusGone One Ratnārcis buddha realm
Similarly it has not been revealed so that they eyes might be grasped or not grasped
Some are established in unimpeded eloquence And some in thousands of millions of retentions
then while they are abiding in cognizing and intent on physical forms
The analogy here is of a group of people who wish to go to a jewel island and set out to cross the great ocean by boat but the boat breaks apart in the great ocean
 they maintain the Dharma they have received  they obtain the Dharma they have not previously received
Their hands and feet are utterly pure
Visualizing her in my complete form
and the mercantile class standing out like a tall sāl tree
They will teach this Dharma again and again And they will not have the slightest weariness in doing so
Exalted in discipline and austerity you act for the welfare of beings
He clearly realizes the faults of women
the four unhindered discernments
in that moment from the sky above there descended a great rainfall of coral tree flowers and great coral tree flowers
All the girls were virtuous agreeable and wholesome in conduct
It is as if there were a man Who went into the home of his friend
Without attributes and without characteristics They are taught to be without attributes 
this same refrain should also be applied in the case of the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth and the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth up to and including the fruit of arhatship
Venerable Lord How are physical forms nonexistent being inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
Even if one is celibate One may engage with a woman of supreme celestial birth
Suddenly release the moon
in the same way Venerable Lord although great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom they do not think The level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas is far from me and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is near
and this was the happiness and suffering I experienced
those who have seen the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha ākyamuni and
In this way one applies oneself entirely to desire without there being any occasion without it
