"The two kinds of latent forces" are also similar  . Every single defilement has two principles . Discriminated  are the primitive latent forces that produce the panorama of phenomena generated from defilement. They have names but no essence . 
The discriminator is the essence of defilement. It also exists but is not absolute . It is the nature of dependence . 
However, what we have explained here as the discriminated  and  dependence are named differently in  the Three States of Insubstantiality  . 
The nature of discrimination is called "the categories for aspects," and the nature of dependence is called "the primitive  ." 51 If one considers the nature of discrimination as having an essence, having categories for aspects, and producing the panorama of phenomena of all defilements, we say that this is called defilement. 
The nature of dependence is the essence of defilement. Because it can bring about the retribution of life and death  it is called primitive . 
Now because we explain here the nature of discrimination as the categories of aspects and the primitive manifestation , we call it primitive . 
The nature of dependence can be attached to the previous category of aspects and is thus called "aspects ." Each  has its own meaning. 
If one wishes to turn to these meanings,  the Three States of Insubstantiality has acceptable terminology. Theory of Three Natures ] The text says: 
"Whatever is discrimination: if one discriminates this or that kind of thing, these kinds of things are Â· called the nature of discrimination."  These only have names, but the essence  that the name indicates does not really exist. 
52  The essence  that is indicated  does not really exist; this discrimination is generated contingent upon others . 53 Therefore it is called the nature of dependence . 
Both natures are inseparable; this is identical to the nature of the absolute . 
If they were separable from each other, then the principle of Consciousness-Only would not be upheld, because sense objects would be different from consciousness. 
Because they are inseparable, there is Consciousness-Only without an objective world . Because there is no objective world, consciousness also does not exist. Because the sense object does not exist, and neither does consciousness, the principle of ConsciousnessOnly is established . This being then established, therefore the former nature  are neither identical to nor different from each other. 
If one posits their identity or difference, then there is an error. 
If the nature of discrimination is posited as identical to the nature of dependence, then the nature of discrimination would never exist nor could it include the five sets  . 
54 The nature of dependence could never exist either. If this were the case, then there could be no life or death, liberation, good or evil, morality or discipline . 
This cannot be . Therefore, since this is not the case, the nature of discrimination and the nature of dependence are not to be posited as identical. 
If one posits that they are different, then given the nature of discrimination, one could not dispense with the nature of dependence . 
This follows because, if we view the nature of discrimination as devoid of existence, then and only then will we see that the nature of dependence is also devoid of existence . Therefore, we are not to posit that they are different. 
Moreover, if the nature of discrimination is posited as being164 different from the nature of dependence, then the essence of the nature of discrimination should be posited as existing, and one should not say that it never exists . 
Existence can be differentiated from nonexistence, but how can we discuss the difference? 
Therefore, we only say that they are neither identical nor different and cannot posit either identity or difference  . 55 [Verse XXlIb: 
] It is like impermanence  and conditioned phenomena. We also cannot posit that they are either identical or different. 
Impermanence means not existing either in the previous or in the succeeding moment. 
The five aggregates are conditioned phenomena. If impermanence and conditioned phenomena were posited as being identical, then if impermanence did not exist, all phenomena would not exist. 
Since they both  are not nonexistent, they are not to be posited as identical. 
If they are posited as different, then when one views the impermanent, one should not understand conditioned phenomena. Because they are understood, they are not to be posited as different. 
Thus, they are neither identical nor different. 
Thus, all phenomena are like this: the form  and the pot are neither identical nor different. 
If the form and the pot were posited as identical, then the form could not be a pot, but if the pot were truly real and if the form is maintained as different from the pot, then when one sees form one should not apprehend the pot. 
Therefore, they are not maintained as identical or different. 
These two sets of explanations  are similar in that [Verse XXIIc: ] if one does not view the nature of discrimination, then one does not view the nature of dependence. 56  Therefore, they are neither identical nor different. 
However, all phenomena have only three natures and are entirely included in these  . 
Theory of Three States of Insubstantiality or Naturelessnesses ]  The Tathagata, for the benefit of living beings, explained that all phenomena are devoid of a substantial nature . There are three kinds. 
The three natures were previously explained . 57  The first two are conventional truth. The third one is absolute truth. 
All phenomena are included in the two truths, conventional and absolute . 
The three states devoid of substantial natures are inseparable from the previously mentioned three natures . The nature o f discrimination i s called the state devoid of a substantial nature with respect to characteristics  58 because its characteristics have no essence . The nature of dependence is called the "state devoid of a substantial nature with respect to production"  59 because its essence with relation to causation does not exist  . The essence  appears as the aspect of matter. 
Since discrimination does not exist, the essence  does not exist. 
60 Since the causes do not exist either, the sense object, being derived from the nature of discrimination, can bring about effects on consciousness. 
If an objective world does not exist, what produces any effects? 
For example, seeds can produce a sprout. If the seed does not exist, how can a sprout emerge? 
Therefore, there is no production  The nature of the absolute is called "the state devoid of any substantial nature" with respect to the nature 62 [Exegesis: ] because it neither exists nor does not exist  . 
With reference to persons and phenomena, they are devoid of any substantial nature as existent things . With reference to these two Emptinesses  , they are devoid of any substantial nature as nonexistent things . Therefore, we deny both "the substantial nature of existence" and that of nonexistence and reiterate that this is referred to as "the state devoid of any substantial nature with respect to any nature"  . 
These three states devoid of substantial natures are the absolute reality 63 in all phenomena . [Exegesis: ] Because these are separate from existence, they are166 called permanent . 
In order to indicate these three states devoid of substantial natures, we explain the principle of Consciousness-Only. Supreme Knowledge ] [Verse XXVI: 
] Someone who cultivates the path to wisdom 64 but does not abide in the principle of Consciousness-Only has defilements produced by the propensities  of the twofold attachment  65 that have not been eliminated, [Exegesis: ] nor have their roots been eliminated . 
For this reason, one establishes the One Vehicle in which all are able to learn the Bodhisattva path . [Verse XXVII: 
] If one says: "there is only the existence of consciousness" based upon attachment to what is presented before him  , then since he has not yet eliminated this attachment  , he does not enter Consciousness-Only. 66 [Verse XXVIII: 
] If the cognizer , the two  are not manifeste d . 67 At that time the practitioner says: "I am entering Consciousness-Only. " [Exegesis: 
] This is called "nonapprehension 68  that is neither thought 69 nor sense object." This wisdom is called lithe transcendenFo wisdom devoid of  discrimination" [Exegesis: ] which means there is no differentiating between cognizer and sense objects . It is called the "wisdom of Suchness" and [Verse XXIXb : 
] also called lithe transformation  of the basis"  . [Exegesis : ] Therefore, one abandons the basis of life and death, based only upon the principle  . 
Gross  are the nature of discrimination, and the attachments  are the nature of dependence . 
These two kinds  are both ended. This is called the "realm devoid of outflows "  . This is called "the inconceivable ." 7! This is called "the absolutely real and good ." 72 This is called "the fruit that permanently abides ." 73 This is called "transcendent bliss," 74 "the body of liberation," 75 and the Dharmabody within the three bodies  . 
Commentary   "The defilements produced by the propensities of the twofold attachment  that have not been eliminated." -This signifies the defilements  the propensities of the two attachments  of Insight and by  Development, which can create seeds and produce unlimited defilements onto the mind; 76 
all take the fundamental consciousness  for their foundation. If the foundation is not yet eliminated, the branches will not end either. As the Srzmaladevz-sutra explains: "If the stage of ignorance is not absolutely eliminated, then the limitless four stages of abiding will not be absolutely eliminated." 77  "If the cognizer does not apprehend the object, the two  are not manifested ." The "sense objects" are the objects of Consciousness-Only; this is confusion concerning Consciousness-Only. Because there are no objects, there is  no consciousness. 
Since consciousness does not exist, the mind that apprehends Consciousness-Only as an object also does not exist. Therefore, it is said that "the two are not manifested." These two  only refer to two  consciousnesses presented with a sense object before them, but the sense ocject  before consciousness is already nonexistent. 
This is the culmination of the "Evolution of Consciousness."
