The two kinds of latent forces are also similar   Every single defilement has two principles  Discriminated  are the primitive latent forces that produce the panorama of phenomena generated from defilement They have names but no essence  The discriminator is the essence of defilement It also exists but is not absolute  It is the nature of dependence  However what we have explained here as the discriminated  and  dependence are named differently in  the Three States of Insubstantiality   The nature of discrimination is called the categories for aspects and the nature of dependence is called the primitive    If one considers the nature of discrimination as having an essence having categories for aspects and producing the panorama of phenomena of all defilements we say that this is called defilement The nature of dependence is the essence of defilement Because it can bring about the retribution of life and death  it is called primitive  Now because we explain here the nature of discrimination as the categories of aspects and the primitive manifestation  we call it primitive  The nature of dependence can be attached to the previous category of aspects and is thus called aspects  Each  has its own meaning If one wishes to turn to these meanings  the Three States of Insubstantiality has acceptable terminology Theory of Three Natures  The text says Whatever is discrimination if one discriminates this or that kind of thing these kinds of things are  called the nature of discrimination  These only have names but the essence  that the name indicates does not really exist   The essence  that is indicated  does not really exist this discrimination is generated contingent upon others   Therefore it is called the nature of dependence  Both natures are inseparable this is identical to the nature of the absolute  If they were separable from each other then the principle of ConsciousnessOnly would not be upheld because sense objects would be different from consciousness Because they are inseparable there is ConsciousnessOnly without an objective world  Because there is no objective world consciousness also does not exist Because the sense object does not exist and neither does consciousness the principle of ConsciousnessOnly is established  This being then established therefore the former nature  are neither identical to nor different from each other If one posits their identity or difference then there is an error If the nature of discrimination is posited as identical to the nature of dependence then the nature of discrimination would never exist nor could it include the five sets    The nature of dependence could never exist either If this were the case then there could be no life or death liberation good or evil morality or discipline  This cannot be  Therefore since this is not the case the nature of discrimination and the nature of dependence are not to be posited as identical If one posits that they are different then given the nature of discrimination one could not dispense with the nature of dependence  This follows because if we view the nature of discrimination as devoid of existence then and only then will we see that the nature of dependence is also devoid of existence  Therefore we are not to posit that they are different Moreover if the nature of discrimination is posited as being different from the nature of dependence then the essence of the nature of discrimination should be posited as existing and one should not say that it never exists  Existence can be differentiated from nonexistence but how can we discuss the difference Therefore we only say that they are neither identical nor different and cannot posit either identity or difference    Verse XXlIb  It is like impermanence  and conditioned phenomena We also cannot posit that they are either identical or different Impermanence means not existing either in the previous or in the succeeding moment The five aggregates are conditioned phenomena If impermanence and conditioned phenomena were posited as being identical then if impermanence did not exist all phenomena would not exist Since they both  are not nonexistent they are not to be posited as identical If they are posited as different then when one views the impermanent one should not understand conditioned phenomena Because they are understood they are not to be posited as different Thus they are neither identical nor different Thus all phenomena are like this the form  and the pot are neither identical nor different If the form and the pot were posited as identical then the form could not be a pot but if the pot were truly real and if the form is maintained as different from the pot then when one sees form one should not apprehend the pot Therefore they are not maintained as identical or different These two sets of explanations  are similar in that Verse XXIIc  if one does not view the nature of discrimination then one does not view the nature of dependence   Therefore they are neither identical nor different However all phenomena have only three natures and are entirely included in these   Theory of Three States of Insubstantiality or Naturelessnesses   The Tathagata for the benefit of living beings explained that all phenomena are devoid of a substantial nature  There are three kinds The three natures were previously explained    The first two are conventional truth The third one is absolute truth All phenomena are included in the two truths conventional and absolute  The three states devoid of substantial natures are inseparable from the previously mentioned three natures  The nature o f discrimination i s called the state devoid of a substantial nature with respect to characteristics   because its characteristics have no essence  The nature of dependence is called the state devoid of a substantial nature with respect to production   because its essence with relation to causation does not exist   The essence  appears as the aspect of matter Since discrimination does not exist the essence  does not exist  Since the causes do not exist either the sense object being derived from the nature of discrimination can bring about effects on consciousness If an objective world does not exist what produces any effects For example seeds can produce a sprout If the seed does not exist how can a sprout emerge Therefore there is no production  The nature of the absolute is called the state devoid of any substantial nature with respect to the nature  Exegesis  because it neither exists nor does not exist   With reference to persons and phenomena they are devoid of any substantial nature as existent things  With reference to these two Emptinesses   they are devoid of any substantial nature as nonexistent things  Therefore we deny both the substantial nature of existence and that of nonexistence and reiterate that this is referred to as the state devoid of any substantial nature with respect to any nature   These three states devoid of substantial natures are the absolute reality  in all phenomena  Exegesis  Because these are separate from existence they are called permanent  In order to indicate these three states devoid of substantial natures we explain the principle of ConsciousnessOnly Supreme Knowledge  Verse XXVI  Someone who cultivates the path to wisdom  but does not abide in the principle of ConsciousnessOnly has defilements produced by the propensities  of the twofold attachment   that have not been eliminated Exegesis  nor have their roots been eliminated  For this reason one establishes the One Vehicle in which all are able to learn the Bodhisattva path  Verse XXVII  If one says there is only the existence of consciousness based upon attachment to what is presented before him   then since he has not yet eliminated this attachment   he does not enter ConsciousnessOnly  Verse XXVIII  If the cognizer  the two  are not manifeste d   At that time the practitioner says I am entering ConsciousnessOnly  Exegesis  This is called nonapprehension   that is neither thought  nor sense object This wisdom is called lithe transcendenFo wisdom devoid of  discrimination Exegesis  which means there is no differentiating between cognizer and sense objects  It is called the wisdom of Suchness and Verse XXIXb   also called lithe transformation  of the basis   Exegesis   Therefore one abandons the basis of life and death based only upon the principle   Gross  are the nature of discrimination and the attachments  are the nature of dependence  These two kinds  are both ended This is called the realm devoid of outflows    This is called the inconceivable   This is called the absolutely real and good   This is called the fruit that permanently abides   This is called transcendent bliss  the body of liberation  and the Dharmabody within the three bodies   Commentary   The defilements produced by the propensities of the twofold attachment  that have not been eliminated This signifies the defilements  the propensities of the two attachments  of Insight and by  Development which can create seeds and produce unlimited defilements onto the mind  all take the fundamental consciousness  for their foundation If the foundation is not yet eliminated the branches will not end either As the Srzmaladevzsutra explains If the stage of ignorance is not absolutely eliminated then the limitless four stages of abiding will not be absolutely eliminated   If the cognizer does not apprehend the object the two  are not manifested  The sense objects are the objects of ConsciousnessOnly this is confusion concerning ConsciousnessOnly Because there are no objects there is  no consciousness Since consciousness does not exist the mind that apprehends ConsciousnessOnly as an object also does not exist Therefore it is said that the two are not manifested These two  only refer to two  consciousnesses presented with a sense object before them but the sense ocject  before consciousness is already nonexistent This is the culmination of the Evolution of Consciousness are completely steadyWhen that night was over on the seventh morning he went back into the capital city of Ratnāvatīthat emptiness which is the emptiness of all phenomena is also empty of the emptiness of all phenomena because it does not endure and does not disintegrateBut I did

All Pathswhose emotions had been cooled as if treated by a balm of sandalwood and whose knowledge had rent open the shellIf a monk were to engage in them he would immediately disqualify himself as a monkYou controlled well your body speech and mind Sugata who has a selfrestrained mind I pay homage to you then in ones dream one will not be able to see ones own head or those of otherson the other hand there are some other sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who retain hold recite and master this transcendent perfection of wisdom and are attentive to it in the correct manner committing it to writing and having it committed to writing and who then honor venerate respect and make offerings to this volume of the scripture with flowers garlands perfume unguents powders religious robes clothing parasols victory banners ribbons and diverse musical soundsThey would take up discipline and abide by that They would then dedicate the roots of what is wholesome toward birth in that reflection of the abode of the ThirtyThreeThe guardians of the world and the other guests sat down on the arranged seatsThey had begun their collection againand those ascetics and brahmins who do not embrace other views are said to be the fewest of the fewIt is the joy of unbreakable faith in the Buddha of wishing to hear the Dharma of serving the Saṅgha and honoring the spiritual benefactors without pridenor does it possess the attributes of maturationThey said How amazing He has such expertise in the arts without even having trainedThen he said All accumulation ends in depletionWhy is that so Because they have the power of previous training in insight and wisdomthey never think Through this gift these roots of virtue and this offering of the Dharma may I become a king a ruler a minister a god a nāga a divine son or any other type of divine beingdwell in the activity of buddhasSimilarly they neither associate feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness with the limit of past time nor do they disassociate them therefromVenerable Lord How when maintaining this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom should those great bodhisattva beings practice this transcendent perfection of wisdomSimilarly if they have not misconstrued the emptiness of internal phenomena the emptiness of external phenomena the emptiness of both external and internal phenomena and the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesSo the doctor then goes before them and says Hello everyone I am a doctor I know well about illnesses and their causes and I know how to cure themAll phenomena are empty and equal AndThe Blessed One in turn continuedto gain spiritual acceptance of how phenomena truly areāradvatīputra the expression all things denotes the followingThe four guardians of the world are present Waiting to offer you an alms bowlThe sun the moon the celestial chariots the planets and the stars all stood stillAn omniscient minds compassion never wanes In its quest for the young calves it nursesLord of the World you make no errorThey are subtle precise and ultimately incomprehensiblesaying Come here manThere is a reason we put even elders to workThey will be without attachment to their religious robesArrange all of this and then swiftly report to meAwakening Mañjuśrī enters the aspectless by entering an aspectThey see my buddha realm this Sahā world realm to have a ground made of beryl that is level divided like a checkerboard with golden cords and to be adorned by trees made of precious materialsThree weeks or twentyone days after the birth relatives came and gathered to celebrate his birth in grand styleIf he should ask Is there or is there not an afterlifeSimilarly all other attributes up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom and enlightenment are indivisible and without dualityTo make snakes flee one should incant some clay with this mantra and place it on the groundUpasena he should be called an immature elderHe then addressed the master ViśvāmitraThe tathāgatas bodhisattvas gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas antigods garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragas present in the world systems of the eastern direction numerous as the sands of the River Ganges will sustain their bodiesTiṣyas son Koṣṭhila returned to the village of Nālada from the South where he had taken up with the Lokāyata asceticsAccepted an offering of giftsThe Blessed One is endowed with a visage that resembles the full moonthen you should take charge of one while entrusting the other to a monk friend of yoursMoreover they think to themselves The sacred teaching is the DharmaVinaya of the ThusGone OneTherefore you should teach the Dharma by keeping your mind on thisand through the tathāgatas that the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have appearedWomen men boys and girls who just see that personnanda replied Yes Blessed One I would love to BlissGone OneComing is not really known in coming and going is not really known in goingIf you ask what constitutes the mundane gift of the sacred doctrinehe is the One with a Voice like a God a Nāga a Yakṣa a Gandharva a Demigod a Garuḍa a Kiṃnara and a MahoragaSo may his wishes be fulfilled and may he Under the best of trees attain supreme and noble awakeningHow should we uphold the doctrine revealed by the Elder SubhūtiI should not attain the fruit of entering the stream and should avoid abiding in itBhikṣus at that time this buddha realm will be like billionworld world realms as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River combined into one buddha realmThey are perfectly happy in this worldThose beings you saw who were shaped like pots were formerly bondmen in the service of the saṅghaOnce the mind has become stable in this One may meditate on the subtle practiceHere I relinquished without exceptionThey should also maintain the aggregate of correct conductSubhūti if the emptiness of internal phenomena were an entityThey are the inconceivably numerous kinds of engagement concerning the compositeSimilarly owing to the utter purity of all things they do not apprehend the truth of sufferingWhat are you A hermaphroditeSubhūti it is because the essential nature of the applications of mindfulness will not attain emancipation from the three world systems and will not come to rest in omniscienceWhen they hear this teaching on the transcendent perfection of wisdom they will indeed be afraid and terrifiedIf one feels a prickling sensation in ones eyes when pricking the soles of the feet it will come within three monthsbeing free of extremist convictionsIf ordination was not given the Blessed One decreedThe Tathāgata is the one who knows our aspirations and our pastThe queen of vidyās the great enchantressWith my infinite compassion for the whole world I do not hesitate when others supplicate meand they will quickly attain this samādhiThen Umādevī came and bowed her head to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvaras feet andKing ūradatta inquired of Nandika If you wish to greatly please me are you able to slay this bhikṣu Nandika answered Your Majestythose who are beautiful those who are ugly those in the blissful higher realms those in the wretched lower realmsSubhūti you have said that this vehicle is equal to spaceWhen King uddhodana heard this he sent the councilorpriest before Daṇḍapāṇi ākya with the requestWhy is it retentive memory for those dedicated to listening to the DharmaHe does not think does not conceive does not divide things in twoIt is the seal of the nature of all phenomena This is the samādhi taught by the guides He teaches the Dharma in the form of a nāga to beings who are to be taught by a nāgaThat supreme sage asks to enter the kings palaceIf they engage with the notion that physical forms are void or that these are not void then they are merely engaging with mental imagesSimilarly they correctly perceive the six external sense fields to be empty of the six external sense fieldsin addition they are also attentive to this transcendent perfection of wisdom in the correct manner andIs the Jina teaching this samādhi Of the greatly famous supremely wise buddhas He will become worthy of venerationKnowing the great sage Supreme Ones pure intentions and perceiving too the maturity of the beings in this worldWhen the ethical monks evicted us from the monasteryIn order to be in harmony with people he associated with elders with those of middle age and with the young yet always spoke in harmony with the DharmaThat is taught to be the characteristic of the bodys restraint Noble son the eloquence of bodhisattvas is free of quiveringwho completely frees all beingsThey prostrated to the Blessed One placing their heads at his feetWe are freed from the pain of suffering in the three realmsSimilarly Subhūti this Great Vehicle is also neither an object of knowledgeand those who have venerated the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas numerous as the sands of the River GangesThe bodhisattva rīkūṭa declaredHe is the one who the lord of the mahoragas longs to seeWhy is it called dependent arisingOne should place the mantra in the center of a bowl of ghee honey and sugarcandy andAt the same time a symphony of eight hundred thousand cymbals was sounded and a heavy rain of flowers fellfreedom from mistakes freedom from impediments of speech freedom from forgetfulnessIf you ask why Subhūti it is because those individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who have been born in the abode of TuṣitaI pay homage to Avalokiteśvara great lord who gives lifeThis is the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline possessed by great bodhisattva beingsand some attained the result of becoming a nonreturnerAnd extremely rare it is that someone develops faithSubhūti nonentities do not at all abide in nonentityWith such insight wisdom Intellect and mindfulness This ocean of knowledge Even today learns and trains further in calculationdid not ignore his audience pleased all retinuesthe avenues the parks and the palaces are made of various perfumesHe is the inevitable result of roots of merit He is adorned by patiencethat he resembles a thoroughbred elephant or a thoroughbred steed of noble breedThe Bhagavān came to the street on which was the home of the youth CandraprabhaAs one enriches this with the root mantraYet this son of noble family brings about these beings fulfillment with the bliss of the higher realms and liberation What are these particular transgressionsThe Buddha then said to the venerable SubhūtiThat which we refer to as awakening is the bodhisattvas attainment of buddhahoodit is owing to the nonapprehension of sentient beingsWhen you have earnestly applied the transcendent perfection of wisdom as it has been taughtTo be healthy and without disease And to have infinite life without death ever comingso that they would in the future be drawn into the Blessed Ones sphereWhen he arrived in the land of Magadha he saw beings that had lived for twenty years in the wilderness eating each others fleshSenior āradvatīputra physical forms are empty of physical formsDue to the virtuous deeds of MāyādevīSugata regard them and give your teaching So that they will experience the highest happiness When a tree is small Fingernails may fell itIt is reviling previous foolish conduct and not wishing for the level of the śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhasAs the negativities of speech completely disappear one will be able to remove poison when those of the mind disappear insight will increase and when the flaws of the body are exhausted one will bring about enthrallmentIt is taught that one will seize the sixthwho are the specialists in the discourseswhich is then transformed into an eightspoked wheel extremely ornate as it is the nature of the complete range of speechwith regard to things that resemble an echoInstead they each now found themselves dressed in the three robes of a mendicant with an alms bowl and their head shavenThen for the sake of such a person the bodhisattva kāśagarbha will be born live and teach in the land of the uncivilized or another placeand similarly so that they might completely perfect the other transcendent perfections down to and including the transcendent perfection of generosity and then completely perfect all attributes and attainments up to and including omniscienceMañjuśrī when bodhisattva great beings wish to achieve this absorption what Dharma should they strive inThen he summoned Prince Bimbisāra and saidāradvatīputra to what purpose have you said that physical forms do not constitute a bodhisattva and in the same vein that all those other phenomena up to and including the link of aging and death do not constitute a bodhisattvaSubhūti in the same way one who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in the transcendent perfection of generosityThose who were angry at the dharmabhāṇakasWithout moving from one given buddha realm they appear to awaken to complete buddhahood in numerous buddha realmsThe bodhisattvas practice of generosity is not based on desireThen the student should sayThe bodhisattva mahāsattva kāśagarbha is endowed with the excellent quality of such skillful meansāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of sights as with signs or signless constitutes a bodhisattvaIt would leave his spiritual practice in tatters leave him ruined wrecked fallen and defeatedand neither does it have aspirations nor is it without aspirationsIt is the knowledge of all language It is the knowledge of presenting definitions It is the knowledge of attaining certainty in meaningThis can be remedied by rinsing the nasal passages with sandalwoodMonk dwelling within the essence of enlightenment I have not perceived even the slightest phenomenon that arises that perishes that is afflicted cleansed obscured fettered regretful or miserablehe light encouraged the bodhisattva the great being Vyūharāja who resided in the Sūryāvartā world of the ThusGone One Candrasūryajihmīkaraprabhas buddha realmSo too the practice of the bhūtas starting with Aparājitabut emerge through false imaginationThose who are addicted to their desires Who crave for children and wivesThe very moment I heard it from the ThusGone One VidyuprabhāsaMoreover Satatasamitābhiyukta the noble man or noble woman who teaches and explains to others this Dharma teaching will have those twelve hundred qualities of the earsWhat has become of the brahmin Tiṣya His time came tooSuch miracles are not made by humansIn the ponds all the blue red and white lotus flowers also budded and blossomedI for my part will assume the reins of power hereand went to sit under a large magnolia treeIf you ask why it is because they do not consider the nature of the limit of future timeendowed with a supremely good complexion excellent figureSimilarly if one feels a prickly sensation in all four of the smallest fingers and toes one will die within a monthSubhūti one should know that these are called the refinements of the six extrasensory powers of great bodhisattva beings who abide in the transcendent perfection of wisdomAt that time the five thousand yakṣas who had assembled from everywhere in the universe vanquished by the curse of the incantationThen from among the assembly of bodhisattvas four hundred million bodhisattvas heard the name of the Blessed One the thusgone ākyamuniThey do not apprehend the emptiness of essential nature as the emptiness of essential natureWhat are those ten They are freedom from attachment and aversion with respect to pleasant and unpleasant forms or in relation to pleasant and unpleasant sounds smells tastes textures and mental phenomena Furthermore they are freedom from attachment and aversion in relation to gain and loss pleasure and pain fame and obscurity and praise and blame Noble son bodhisattvas possessing these ten qualities are similar to spaceSimilarly the purity of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness is identical to itdescended to the levels of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas and failed to enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvasThe very moment the Victorious One consumes solid and excellent foodLord where is there such a great being as thisSimilarly the transcendence of the sensory element of the ears the sensory element of sounds and the sensory element of auditory consciousness is not the sensory element of auditory consciousness and the other sensory elements of hearingThey help living beings by means of material gifts and do not help them by means of the gift of the DharmaJust as in space coming going and abiding are not discernibleReject the faults and practice the qualities Then young man in this life you will become a buddha In the same vein as beforeWithin the milk appeared the contours of an endless knot a simple swastika an elaborate swastika a lotus a vardhamāna and other auspicious signsYou know the aspirations that humans have Therefore I ask this question to you supreme among men Phenomena one hundred thousand strong I also perfectly comprehendedThe monk informant then prostrates to the seniormost in the saṅgha before taking his place in a kneeling positionSimilarly they perfect the four applications of mindfulness the four correct exertions the four supports for miraculous ability the five faculties the five powers the seven branches of enlightenment the noble eightfold path and the three gateways to liberationA trillion gandharvas dwell in a pore named Suvarṇaif it counters it would undermine and if it undermines it would debunk the selfthen purify themacknowledging the benevolent activity of the Buddhathey should encourage others also to adhere to the genuine path by abstaining from wrong viewsEighty thousand bodhisattvas achieved the absorption that encapsulates all meritIn terms of wisdom they were like SumeruThrough words with an implied meaning many bodhisattvas Have been inspired toward the enlightenment of buddhahood venerable VakkulaThen we will have attained nirvāṇananda formerly in times gone by there lived a king named Candraprabha goodlookingIf you ask how this dedication is madeThat noble man or noble woman should be known to have been sent to do the Tathāgatas workHow is it then Mañjuśrī that the Dharma taught by the Thusgone One is not falseNor should they abide in the notion that the aggregates from physical forms up to and including consciousness are nonarisingHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of mirrors and reflectionsthe time came for Māyādevī to pass awayBodhisattvas should be like kings with a vast orientationThese root transgressions cause confusion and beginners who have correctly entered the Mahāyāna will forfeit the entirety of their previously generated roots of virtue and they will be in a state of transgressionWhat is it you understand Rudraka replied The way of equilibrium which is neither perception nor nonperceptionThus nanda the enlightenment of the buddhas is immeasurableand teaches without teachingIf they filled all worlds like stands of bamboo Uninterruptedly at all timesAs soon as all these precious parasols had been laid down suddenly by the miraculous power of the Lord they were transformed into a single precious canopythe bodhisattva mahāsattva has no attachment to life or bodythe sugata the one who knows the world the unsurpassed guide who tames beingsSuch is the bodhisattvas aspiration that knows no dejectionAll of these trees produce shoots and flowers according to seasonsNoble son replied the Blessed One this teaching will not spread among beings of inferior meritThat Blessed ThusGone One knew the kings good intentions so he taught him how to gain expertise in the mode of Dharma known as the boundless sealand thirtytwo thousand great bodhisattva mahāsattvasattachment to the world system of desire and maliceWith his mind filled with faithTo have the conviction that the body is like a reflectionThis wheel is without mental elaboration because it is devoid of the sources of conceptual thinkingBodhisattvas should be unspoiled and unimpaired by any wholesome or unwholesome qualitiesAlthough with their single mind they view the minds of all beings ultimately they view nothing whatsoeveris not without any cause or conditionExclaiming horrid sounds Beings are tormentedNext the teacher should whisper into the disciples ear about the division of the four joysthey continually delighted in the Dharma and they took vowsMoreover Subhūti great bodhisattva beings by filling the world systems of the great trichiliocosm with divine perfumeThe four guardians of the four directionsPadminī AnurāginīIn front of them there were five thousand beautifully decorated elephantsThat eon will be named Ratnāvabhāsaheroic strength consummated in the upholding of the holy DharmaAnd dhāraṇī is also not difficult to attain For the one who practices this samādhi Just as Sumeru unshakable and immovable Cannot be shaken by the windssay There is no other Dharma for attaining complete buddhahood and I have attained nirvāṇaSince the weather that week was intemperateBodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara bowed his head to Bhagavat Viśvabhūs feet circumambulated him three times and sat on his leftVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is without defining characteristicsNoble son what if because he has gone to another land and lacks the facilities he cannot even obtain those You have thoroughly eliminated all signs And you wish for nothing whatsoeverThey do not forget anything that they have obtained and teach the Dharma to beingsdwelt with all the patience of the bodhisattvaswhen the mind does not engage with diverse perceptions so that one achieves and abides in the sense field of infinite space thinking Space is infiniteDesires fall like fruit from treesAccording to the division of colorsthe black and so forthTo reply to Māra who said these words The Bodhisattva saidYou want to scrape through a mountain with your fingernails Chew through iron with your teeth Penetrate a mountain with your head And measure an unfathomable depthYou have prepared various parasols various crowns various earrings and various necklacesKnowing the nature and dispositions of fools The wise do not associate with foolswould not even resort to maliceSimilarly as great caravan leaders bodhisattvas are worthy of the offerings of those who train and those who are beyond training just as they are worthy of the offerings of gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas demigods garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragasTheir names and their worlds with their devas Will all be exactly the same as What I have previously described For the supreme human SamantaprabhāsaWhen he attains enlightenment living beings who are evenly balanced through mindfulness and awareness will be born in his buddhafieldNo dharma has been seen by the buddhas nor has it been heard recollected cognized or knownVenerable Lord Is it after hearing the sūtras spoken by the Tathāgata alone that great bodhisattva beings become free from doubt and hesitation andThey have sung their perfect beautiful songs But they do not equal a fraction of the Buddhas speech Jewels and pearls were spread out As an offering to Kṣemadatta laid down his precious parasol in offering and withdrew to one sideas well as various gods such as the great Brahmā who is the lord of the Sahā world Nārāyaṇa the great śvara akra who is the chief of the gods and Pañcaśikha who is the king of the gandharvasHe may follow the ways of laziness yet his efforts are uninterrupted as he strives in the cultivation of roots of virtueThis is called emptiness as a gateway to liberationI will be the master of the three realms venerated by gods and humanswill gain special attainmentsIn that respect Mañjuśrī the Tathāgata thoroughly understands that the root of clinging is the position of a selfThey do not have the good karma For listening to this DharmaGreat King what are these eighty minor markscan irreversible bodhisattvas be called reversibleO hrā hrī hrauPoised in equanimity your mind is like the skyHe presents them through the wisdom of a tathāgataIn the world system called Vajra abides the Tathāgata called Indestructible Vajrahe established nine hundred and ninety million beings in irreversible progress toward the highest enlightenmentYoung man those are the five higher cognitions that are obtainedBodhisattva mahāsattvas who have the restraint of the mind attain the state of great compassionamongst them the following bodhisattva mahāsattvas of the excellent eonwill not perceive any flaws in them for they will not thinkthe eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasJust like awakening so also the earth element does not swerve from the tathatāThe first sense field of mastery refers to the miraculous perceptual transformation that ensues when one who perceives inner forms regards lesser external forms along with excellent colors and inferior colors understands these forms having attained mastery over them and sees them having attained mastery over themSome proclaim emptiness signlessness and wishlessnessIt will be flat pleasant beautiful delightful made of beryl adorned by jewel trees divided eightfold like a checkerboard by golden cords and filled with flowersThey are always weak and hungry Devouring here and thereThose who know that phenomena are emptyThey are constantly focused on omniscience In order to bring benefit and happiness to beings Many hundreds of thousands of apsarases had gathered there The apsaras named Tilottamā the apsaras named Suvyūhā the apsaras named Suvarṇamekhalā the apsaras named Vibhūṣutā the apsaras named Karṇadhārā the apsaras named Amṛtabindu the apsaras named

the apsaras named aśī and many hundreds of thousands of other apsarases were gathered thereowing to the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities that physical forms are nonexistent and nonapprehensibleIn the same vein all the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path are not one thing and illusions anotherThe maṇḍala image is the outer meaning Regarding the outer is the inner The secrecy of just that is the secret meaningnanda I do not rejoice when this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom is proclaimed to such individuals andthe householder dropped like a felled tree at the monks feet and askedSimilarly when they engage in union with the emptiness of sights they are said to engage in union with the transcendent perfection of wisdomor a bodhisattva who is about to be initiated into all Dharmas there is no other beingSarvasumeruparvatarājaśrī Glory of the Entire King of Mountains Mt Sumerurather what she says is timelythe love that is without deviation because it acts from decisive motivationthey will accomplish all aimsHave before them the compassionate Amitābha And his host of bhikṣus Mañjuśrī I know this clearlyThe Buddha then said to the bodhisattva Jagatindharathe sensory element of the body the sensory element of tangibles and the sensory element of tactile consciousnessWhen he attains enlightenment living beings who follow the path of the ten virtues with positive thoughts will be born in his buddhafieldConsider noble son the analogy of how the wind moves without impediment without dwelling and without being supportedHere with the sunlight of mindfulness and tranquility I dried up the ocean of existence An expanse of craving churned up By the intoxicated crocodiles of the four physical elementsThe bodhisattvas do not believe in the existence of a self Any more than that a fire can burn in the middle of the oceanone thinks Who is that man having sex with my woman Ah Puṣpacandra you are selfcontrolled and compassionate Ah Come here you mountain of love and compassionThe precious divine wheel set in motion by the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class will magically travel through space to the eastThose sounds are heard in all world realms As many worlds as there are in the ten directionsBeautifully adorned body of the one with the ten strengths It is rational speechSimilarly the same refrain also should be applied extensively in the case of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessAnd finding it place it on the crown of their headNor do they apprehend the truths of the origin of suffering the cessation of suffering and the path that leads to itOne should eat cumin seeds with

relative truth which employs all forms of statements speech cognition objects of cognition activities conventions and acts is a gateway to all dharmasPersons who are not yet twenty years of age cannot accept all they may be subjected toAnd nonarising is awakeningand all things are just the same as sinOne who is on the path is not concerned with good or bad pathsAnd the kṣatriyas together with their retinues become angry at the bhikṣus who diligently practice relinquishment and disparage themthe six sense organsVenerable Lord if the notion of physical forms as arising or ceasing is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of physical forms as such become a bodhisattvamouths the size of a needles eyeso that I may heal this bhikṣu of his illnessMañjuśrī to realize the body and mind in this manner is explained as awakeningbut others had two or more some had even up to one hundred thousandor their view of living creatures their view of living organisms their view of livesThey do not consider whether tangibles are connected with mental phenomenaOṃ vaiśravaṇāya dhanapuṣṭiṃ kuru ye svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇa vaśaṃ kuru svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇāye śāntiṃ kuru svāhāhe entered his mothers womb as the earth shook and this world The Jina thus teaches the relative Dharma Regard the composite and noncomposite in that wayThey are always close to the Bodhimaṇḍa Those are the benefits of giving the Dharma and in the same vein they apprehend the other sense organs up to and including the mental faculty and develop a view of them in an apprehending mannerWhy so It is thought that humans and nonhumans could not be harmed wherever blessed buddhas were dwellingReverend āriputra the akras the Brahmās the Lokapālas the devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragas who live in this houseTheir renown spreads Through the villages and towns Thus bodhisattvas are the ground that holds the seeds of virtuous qualitiesAlternatively one should meditate on the white Sarasvatī Arisen from the syllable dhīḥIn meditation they master the perfections These are distinctive qualities of the second patience This tantra must not be revealedWhen the Bhagavān taught this Dharma teaching of the samādhi the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomenaThey keep in mind the buddhas the supreme humans And they have faith in their supreme conductNoble ones it is like this I dwell in happiness I have little harm little illnessBlessed One any god or human being who becomes inspired by this teaching and pursues it will attain the happiness that results from the perfections you have just explainedMay beings be liberated from all negative forms of existenceThen create an ink formed from your blood and a pen from one of your bonesI taught for numerous years Explaining the level of nirvāṇawhile auditory consciousness is inner formchildren of noble family I will also go thereOne will attain the state of VāgīśvaraSenior ones This transcendent perfection of wisdom which is so profound which cannot be investigated which is not within the perceptual range of sophistryThe nirvāṇa that is the end of causes like an extinguished lamp They will dream those kinds of dreamsHaving strewn the earth with flower petals and offered burning butterlamps the patient should then perform worship at that shrineand beyond the intellectIf someone touchedteinote xmlidUT the corpse of that dog if he shook it if he enjoyed himself with itMonks so it is replied the Blessed One so it isIf you ask what is the meditative stability free from both ideation and scrutinySubhūti if the expanse of reality were an entity and not a nonentity then this supreme Great Vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its gods humans and antigodsTo banish the targetBlessed One upon hearing from the Blessed One about the power of the bodhisattvas my pride and arrogance were humbledIf he has lost faith in me that will be an impediment to his living the holy lifeAs another analogy at the point when a flower matures its fruit becomes visibleThe transcendent perfection of meditative concentration is pure owing to the purity of the transcendent perfection of wisdomfreedom from special pride because of pursuing excellent adviceSenior Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom practice the essential doctrineTo what the Teacher knows there is no end His mind the perfection of human capacityWhatever is not a distortion of the intrinsic nature is rationalFor example Subhūti a bird does not fall to the ground even though it moves through the airMy friends only bodhisattva great beings who are free from reference points are born there without being bornIn order to behold make offerings to and venerate the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhasand you would also teach the Dharma with the eloquence of a buddha At this point venerable āradvatīputra thought to himselfThe last of them became the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha DīpaṃkaraThen Senior nanda asked the Blessed OneBrother nanda asked the BhagavatHowever if the king does not appreciate numerous teachings he should first give a teaching that induces wearinessthe stride that floats above the surfaceTranquility is onepointed mind Special insight is to discern phenomena as they actually areThey should praise the actualization of the fruit of entering the streamand the lord of the Dharmacalled to the children Those toys that you delight in and marvel at and that you are unhappy not to have obtainedSimilarly the fruitional attributes from the ten powers of the tathāgatas up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are empty of notions of I and mineLikewise so long will those who have entered the stream those who are tied to one more rebirth those who are no longer subject to rebirth as well as arhats pratyekabuddhas bodhisattvas and the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas all emerge in the worldI entrust you with a supreme entrustmentWhen the western direction was high the eastern direction was lowEveryone we allow to go forth they up and snatch awaydiligence is an obscurationProstrations to the dharmadhātu indescribable ultimate perfectionThey engage equally with all sentient beings have no aversion for any sentient being nor any wish to harm anyoneAnd yet deceived by their own errors childish beings believe that there are pleasant feelingsall other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are neither fettered by nor liberated from their future limitsAnd cover the realms of the victorious ones in all the trichiliocosmHe would become a conqueror a righteous Dharma king Such a king would have the seven treasuresThis concludes the tenth chapter on the demonstration at the writing schoolpossesses just one verse or one line from this Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma andBeings will desire and crave irreligious thingsMañjuśrī askedāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of sights as void or not void constitutes a bodhisattvaAt all times he has served beings through the activity of a buddhaIn the presence of the nāgasWhat then is dullness Dullness is also threefold as there is greater middling and lesser dullnessNoble son you may wonder how bodhisattvas sustain sentient beings with vital breaths of air that emerge from their virtuous qualitiesand thus they are free of all the pains of afflictionThis concludes the ordination portion of the riteMy friends said the Blessed One I say this repeatedlyThey are the inconceivably numerous vajra words concerning the compositeThe buddhas make the sound of clearing their throats And they make the sound

you leave So long as we live you will remain within sight Do not think of disobeyingovercomes all demons brings an end to all evil deedsand that the gods extending as far as the Akaniṣṭha realmWithout a teacher or a guide he gave rise to the thirtyseven qualities conducive to awakening and actualized his own awakeningOn this topic it was said The wise ones who remain in solitude Will quickly attain the treasure of the buddhasThose sūtras that you are following are not the most extensive discourses taught by the tathāgatasWhat is the causal condition of name and form It then occurred to himstood up in the circle of the assembly bowed to the Bhagavān with hands together in homage and said these wordsphysical forms are empty of their own essential natureYou with designs of wheels on your feet You are like a shining golden sacrificial post Illuminator of the world Great Sage you are like fireVery well my lady said UttarāBodhisattva Mahāsattva SarvatīrthamaṅgaladhārinOne should add the mantra Nail such and such body part of such and such a personThe light of the rays of awareness from the round sun of the Tathāgata does not have any such conceptsBhagavān in the future time when the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇaWhy is it the equanimity of those with compassion Because it is the activity that accomplishes a buddhas deedsThis concludes the section on what constitutes a reliable monkThe domain of the four foci of mindfulness where body sensation mind and things are not ultimately of concern such is the domain of the bodhisattvathe inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of existents concerning the kleśasnonorigination nonapprehension nonaffliction and nonpurification are without foundationI contemplated my predicament thinking These rākṣasīs will kill us if they find outIf his spouse drinks this while fasting They will receive a fortunate sonIs the essence of the joy of cessationBhagavān how should one view the eightfold path of the noble onesThey do not preoccupy themselves with talk about animalsTheir joints are extendedto the west of this buddha realm past  buddha realms is the Sahā worldhe dragged it outside the city gateSubhūti if the correct exertions the supports for miraculous ability the faculties the powers the branches of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path and in the same vein the ten powers of the tathāgatas and the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas were entities and not nonentitiesRemaining in this samādhi They will pay homage to the buddhas who have great might Meanwhile a young nāga born not long before thatIn the world system called Endowed with Realization and Intelligence abides the Tathāgata called Purifier of All RebirthsHe never lay down on his belly side or backNoble son great caravan leaders are worthy of the offerings of brahmins nobility townspeople and country dwellersThough they arrest their feeling thought and mental processesBlessed One quickly call out with the great speech of a buddhaWhat is praising correct conduct It is the knowledge of the result of correct conductand at last arrives at the town where lives his father who has much property grain treasure and storehousesHow is the view appropriatedThere the queen may remainAlways remember the Jinas qualities The color of perfect gold shining brightlythey bring all phenomena to perfection and they are aware that they do not make assumptions about all these phenomenalike a famous oneOṃ vajrapāṇi nīlāmbaradhara vajrasphoṭa hūṃ phaṭ svāhā This incantation is a mantra that brings control over activitiesThis Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma is like thisthe four applications of mindfulness are subsumed within itIn this way he rested in a state of immense qualitiesand installed me as a teacher in residence who would share his duties with himand that unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is consequent on having abandoned involuntary reincarnation through propensities and all afflicted mental statesāriputra this buddha realm is beautifully adorned by such displays of the excellences of buddha realms Furthermore āriputra in the Sukhāvatī world there are swans cranes and peacocks that assemble three times during the day and three times at night and perform a concertExternal concepts are exertionAwakening is characterized by the absence of wishes yet the absence of wishes cannot truly realize the absence of wishesJust so though the infantile hate and lust Their desire and hatred are never realthe buddha Bhagavān Stainless Light the Essence of the Sun appeared in the worldand the same goes for the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance and the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationOnly this ritual belongs to the second garland mantraThereupon the Bhagavān in order to teach this meaning to Candraprabhathen they are actually practicing the transcendent perfection of wisdomThose that dwell in maṇḍalas and charnel grounds And likewise in temples At borders and in customs houses Empty houses and wild placesBereft of existence or nonexistenceIf it is concealed wherever harm might occur There will be peace by pronouncing the power of truthThereupon the bodhisattva Sarvarūpasaṃdarśana who was present in that assembly addressed the Licchavi Vimalakīrtihe should then point out the maṇḍala to the discipleIt was surrounded by a variety of treesfreedom from deception with regard to godsa garuḍa made of anthill claythe unimpeded and infinite wisdomsay the rishis to that manas numerous as the grains of sand in the ocean and where there is a great caitya The moment he arrived there for the enjoyment of the BhagavānWhen for instance a preceptor or instructor falls illFor those who do not persevereMoreover while the Bodhisattva was attending schoolLeaving the butter element behind they are transferred into the bodyNoble son in that same way this precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras The Sūtra of the Baskets Display burns up all bad karmaWhat instructions do you give to your students What is the result of living the holy lifeHaving instructed them in this way as a skillful method he goes to another land and having gone there sends news to his sick sons that he is dyingWhen those beings see bodhisattvas residing within their mothers womb they will be astonished and amazed by the bodhisattvas powersAll shall be lovingly reverentialand with his hands together in homage bowed toward the Bhagavān andKaṇṭhaka carry the guide of this world Be swift and dont feel sadAfter that they shine on the elevated regions of the earthWhen he had listened to what they had to say The elephantlike king became distrustfulConclusion of the twentyseventh chapter The Benefits of GenerosityHe was joined in the palace by a group of gods whose good fortune equaled that of the Bodhisattva and who had entered the same vehicleTherein physical forms omniscience and the real nature are nonapprehensibleYoung man you should understand this through the following teachingTherefore once I attain the auspicious peace of awakening The time has come for me to free beings drowning in the ocean of old age and deathMañjuśrī this is the supreme Dharma taught by the tathāgatasthe more the volition of those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage will be enhanced Oh Oh King of the medicine of wisdom unequaled You have reached the perfection of superior wisdomJust like lights illuminating the world This great hero will remain teimilestone xmlidUTFor the benefit of beings For many eons after his nirvāṇaIn all the many lotus ponds were flocks of many types of birds such as leafbirdsNoble son such is the bodhisattvas diligence free of conceitThus they think to themselvesSimilarly they will not construe the notion that conditioned elements are signless and that signlessness is the conditioned elementsThose bodhisattva heroes Are adorned by the primary signsSimilarly they do not apprehend all the other phenomena up to and including the applications of mindfulnessThe Blessed One now asked venerable KauṇḍinyaThus they bring them freedom from evil acts of body speech and mindSimilarly the eighteen aspects of emptiness from the emptiness of internal phenomena up to an including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities being empty of inherent existenceMay we also in that way become Unsurpassable buddhas in the world And through words with implied meaning Teach buddhahoods highest enlightenmentLiving in solitary places practicing meditation And abandoning living among many people I established them in celibacy I introduced them to the meaning of the DharmaWhat is the cause due to which the Tāthagatas companions are now so fewactualize what you have not yet actualizeddo not let your effort lagWhen a bodhisattva considers which things constitute nonspecific phenomena they include the followingThe accumulation of discipline also fulfills two functionsWhen the group of six saw this they saidwhenever they do not engage with the notions that the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are with attachment or that they are without attachmentThey see the supreme humans the sugatas And they give them the prophecy of their stainless enlightenment All the splendor of the four guardians of the world and the lord of the demigods All the splendor of Brahmā lord of the world and Kṛṣṇa Is minuscule in comparison to that of the son of the ākyasThey are hung with Kaśika clothFrom a distance the Licchavi people of Vaiśālī saw the Blessed One coming He was handsome and inspiring and his senses were stilledThe fruit of being tied to one more rebirth is empty of the fruit of being tied to one more rebirthThe Bhagavān replied to CandraprabhaIn like manner why do you say that the designation of the eyes does not constitute a bodhisattvaKauṇḍinya did you understand Did you understand Blissful One he replied I understood I understoodIn such a way you will repay the kindness of the TathāgataThis sacred doctrine is compatible with the fruit of arhatshipTumburu and Sūryavarcasa aila and Asiputra Viśvāmitra and Yaśodharā ḍavaka and Sumanas ūcīkarṇa and Darīmukha Pañcālagaṇḍa and SumukhaAll the gods joyfully proclaimed He will be a Dharma kingVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is the emptiness of ultimate realityAnd why Blessed One because although the ThusGone One may speak of preferenceWithout their consciousness dwelling on it they understand through the sameness of mind that concentration is samenessthey defame omniscience which the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas of the past the future and the present all haveHe lived on just a single sesame seed a single juniper berry and a single grain of riceare not afraid are not terrified and cannot be made to be terrifiedIt was then that the tathāgatas emanated by Bhagavān ākyamuni who had been in the eastern directionWhether for oblations the circle Or inauguration Red substances are always to be appliedUltimately not even a slight distinction can be made with respect to theseThen Bhadrapāla beseeched the Blessed OneBecause both self and liberation are voidāradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomMoreover Kauśika the transcendent perfection of wisdom possessed by great bodhisattva beings dominates the transcendent perfection of generosityBodhisattvas give up unvirtuous company in all regardsaccumulation will occur and accumulation will not disappearbetter exaltedWith the hairs on their bodies bristling with anger they spoke the following verseI answer him by saying The afterlife is like that and not like that We will protect itI am free of doubt I am fixed upon enlightenment This is the nature of my skill in methodsThe strength of ten blue elephants is the same as the strength of one yellow elephantHe had attained excellence in control and calm abiding and superiority in control and calm abidingVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is without purificationfor which a tathāgata arhat perfectly enlightened buddha comes into the worldKnowing existents in this way They are taught to be nonexistent not high not lowAnother young man is that bodhisattva mahāsattvas have correct conductThe dedication of generosity for the sake of attaining omniscience is dualisticFor the sake of ripening sentient beings they display birth throughout all lives accepting birth yet remaining free from appropriationOn the left or right of the guide Amitābha He holds a fan and he fans himthen together with the saṅgha of bodhisattvas the saṅgha of bhikṣusand these too they integrate with the transcendent perfection of wisdomwithout ever feeling any regretThe lifespan of the future buddha Ratnavyūha will be six hundred million yearsThey bow solely to the ThusGone One and prostrate themselves solely to the ThusGone One with their palms joinedThere were no dark mountains nor any ordinary treesEnjoining him to heed what he reveresHere too the bodhisattva kāśagarbha will appear at the break of dawn in the dreams of those beginner bodhisattvas who have committed a transgressionSo O Beloved look at us who ardently desire pleasureVenerable Lord How do great bodhisattva beings after abiding in the transcendent perfection of perseverance acquire the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationAt that moment the ThusGone One realized that Rudraka had died just one week beforeWith your aspiration now fulfilled quick turn the wheel of Dharma in detailThe Tathāgata appeared sitting crosslegged upon that throneWhat is the perfection of conduct It is its perfect preservationAbandon the nature of voidthat has been kept through the power of the Tathāgata and has not previously been revealed has not previously been toldThen in order to ripen students He taught the ritual of conferring empowermentThrough the sound of the great Dharma drumand the indulgence of all their desires resulted in no child male or femalethe body will not be afflicted by illnessthe samādhi named OrnamentWhen Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra was in the samādhi named Intimidating Lion Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was in the samādhi named Play of the Lionand also various kinds of clothing monastic robes clothing commanded by the vidyādharas and Kaśika clothand so he was named Kolitaa noble son or daughter were to sprinkle with their own blood the path that their Dharma teacher is to walk uponIf you ask why Subhūti it is because great bodhisattva beings are already established in the attributes which are the aspects of enlightenmentIf a child vomits breastmilk The ashes of burnt peacock feathers Should be bound to its neckThat is called the knowledge of suffering The restraint of the body is said to have this meaning It is a meaning that cannot be taught through wordsYet the great wealth and renown he enjoyed were like drops of water rolling off the petals of a lotus flower The Blessed One remained detached and untainted by it allBhagavān please do not expound this Dharma discourseit is free from all tormentsThroughout many eons they will not lose a limb And will always avoid the eight disadvantageous states In Ujjayinī the son of King Anantanemi was bornWhere might these five companions be stayingBut one cannot count the different aspects of their speechwithout characteristicsOne should also eat the root of moonseedand that Nakula and Sahadeva are the sons of the two AśvinsThey said to each otherOn the level of the arhat you have accomplished your goal Which is the cessation of all sufferingWho is soothing and clear minded like the moonThe palms of her hands and the soles of her feet are like liquid lacIf this precious gemstone were immersed in a pool of waterElder you are foremost of the wise Why do you not speakhaving created a stūpa made of the seven precious materials that is as high as the realm of Brahmā encircled by a circumambulatory walkway with parasols upon it with flags and ringing bellsIn this manner with his pristine divine eye beyond that of humans the Bodhisattva saw sentient beings dying and being born in all their beauty and ugliness in favorable and unfavorable circumstances degenerating and advancing respectively precisely in accordance with their actionsthat great bodhisattva beings will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentAnd confessed absolutely whatever bad actions however small He may have committed in this life or throughout the three timesSimilarly do you think that anything other than the real nature of the ears nose tongue body and mental faculty constitutes a bodhisattvaThose who have no thought of mine Those who have abandoned all attachmentsAnd if all of the various infinite realms Were covered with gold from the Jambu Riveror a body belonging to the realm of the Lord of Death were freed from their feelings of pain and instead they found happinessAnd how does that accord with the awareness of realityYoung man in that way bodhisattva mahāsattvas obtain the treasure of wisdomand adorned by trees made of the seven precious materialsWhen they saw his handsome body they desired himThe seers saw the venerable Saṅgharakṣita approaching from off in the distanceWearing a red upper garmentIn death there is pain lamentation despair and anxietyMany incalculable innumerable Inconceivable millions of eons in the pastThe mind pacifies itselfO when there is terror this is for confusing Hū phaṭIn Vārāṇasī there lived two householders and friends who had wished to go forth in their youthit can still cause its reflection to appear in water LikewiseSimilarly knowing that the eight aspects of liberation the nine serial steps of meditative absorption the ten powers of the tathāgatas the four assurances the four unhindered discernments great loving kindness great compassion the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas the thirtytwo major marks of a superior man and the eighty minor marks are all empty of inherent existenceand who are alive at present even now teaching the sacred doctrineThe monk instructors eyes lit up with joy and the monk said to the nāga disguised as a brahminYour Majesty you are joyfulAs I exert myself to benefit all beings I may well remain in hellThere is a saying Boys and girls are born in the world because they are prayed forResting in the equanimity of the patience of selflessness Worms are the action ḍākinīIt is not suitable O Friend of the Worldfor which reason it always is the real nature Therefore they are not two but indivisibleThe cord should then be tied to the wrist and the following should be recitedThe transcendence of physical forms is not physical forms It is rejecting that which should not be engaged in  It is the aspiration to good qualitiesI will explain to the world about the origin and arising of things And also about nirvāṇa the cool state where suffering is pacifiedOur heads would split into seven pieces Like the blossom of a basil shrubThe wise ones always remain in happiness They remain just as I have taughtWith hundreds of paṇava drums and loud mṛdaṅga drums With paṭaha drums lutes the excellent sound of flutestI too find ill will unpleasant I do not wish for it do not like it and do not enjoy it ThereforeSuvikrāntavikrāmiṇ AnupamamatiThey are full of attachment and affectionsomeone whose mind is undistorted will have authentic attainmentMany terrifying malevolent spirits approach With wild matted hair sheep heads crooked bones and goitersto produce images of the thusgone ones to restore shrines that have crumbled to offer incense at shrines devoted to the thusgone ones to wash statues of the thusgone ones with scented water to sweep and plaster shrines devoted to the thusgone onesGreat Sage no one has discipline like youtheir deaths and their rebirths whether they have good color or bad colorThe surface of the entire billionworld galaxy was reflected in the interior of the great precious canopythe stride of he whose fingers are connected through a web and who has coppercolored nailsIn this regard excellent positioning of the feet means that the soles of his two feet entirely touch the groundthe bodhisattva mahāsattvas should continuously possess this Dharma teaching teach it read it and explain itSūkṣmā prostrated at his feet and said this prayerthey are not known seen or comprehended as such by sentient beingsHowever while indeed no beings exist the ripening of karma does manifestthe nāga hastily transformed cloaking his natural appearance and reverting to his conjured lookThey go to millions of realms And bow down to the feet of the buddhasSimilarly those who follow the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhasConsider noble son the analogy of the sun that rises to dispel all pitchblack darknessSage Buddha you practiced emptinessEach of the trees had grown to a height of two and a half leagues with a trunk that reached a width of two krośasIt is its nonperception as one does not objectify a thing that is not perceivedSimilarly coming from the thusgone ones and their bodhisattva retinues who reside in the pure realms the windlike bodhisattvasMahāsthāmaprāpta when that bodhisattva mahāsattva bhikṣu made that proclamation before a bhikṣu or bhikṣunī an upāsaka or upasikā or anyoneJust as the sun manifests through the signs of heat its yellow color as well as its setting and rising so too consciousness should be viewed through its signsDeceived by his priests rīgupta made an offering Of poisonous alms To the protector the Lion of the ākyasdid not take part in amusements and did not go for walksHe said this which was soothing to gods and humans And removed their doubtThis twelvefold dependent arisingwhich comes from several different causes and from several different conditionsAlternatively Blue Acala is spaceI have not attained any store of qualitiesEndowed with wisdom they will manifest many emanations That will go to millions of realms to guide beingsSimilarly the windlike bodhisattvas strike sentient beings who are elevated on peaks of pride conceit arrogance and the view of the transitory collectionThey will contemplate many supreme dharmas They will always teach many dharmasThe deaf could hearIt is free of the extreme views of beginning and endwithout being well presented or well dressedcalm or not calm void or not void afflicted or purified arising or not arising ceasing or not ceasing and as entities or nonentitiesIn the same vein they do not consider any real nature of the attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience in which they should have confidenceA selfarisen one performs this method So that the wisdom of buddhahood may be realizedI will teach the application of mindfulness that carefully considers phenomena in such a way that there will be no notion of them as wholes These teachings will take placeWe put them on wrung our clothes dryNevertheless Mañjuśrī for those gods in the heaven of the ThirtyThree who have previously purified themselvesor the moon god or the sun god or a garuḍaDay and night they will meditate on the supreme DharmaDivine princes the ten powers of the tathāgatas are also like a dream like a magical displayowing Venerable Lord to the fact that these phantom emanations of the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas are without conceptualisationIf the holder of the ākya lineage leaves this royal line will be brokenSimilarly they do not investigate the notions that omniscience is permanent or impermanent and similarly the notions that it is imbued with happiness or suffering that it is not imbued with suffering or happiness that it is a self or not a self that it is empty or not empty that it is with signs or signless that it is having aspirations or lacking aspirations that it is calm or not calm and that it is void or not voidYakṣas rākṣasas kumbhāṇḍas

their irreversibilitythe faculties that will enable knowledge of all that is unknown the faculties that acquire the knowledge of all things the faculties endowed with the knowledge of all thingsThe earth was pleasant to the touch like soft kācilindika clothby not grasping at the eye and not perceiving formThe supreme gods with flowing hair approached Just when they emerged from the door the whole trichiliocosm trembledThrough magiclike meditative concentrationsome have two clairvoyanceslike an elephantin the same vein being unskilled they will not have cultivated the fruitional

formed a great circle around the ThusGone One The circle was wonderful and beautiful to the eyeIt also moistens the seed of the aggregatesImmediately the Bodhisattva looked around and examined the retinue of consortsAgain one should grind with dharmarasa With yavatiktikā And the juice of ākhukarṇī For a period of three daysThen sitting crosslegged and upright the Bodhisattva practiced concentration Immersed in the virtue of the four concentrationsThey are prepared for liberation They will quickly reach liberation Or else the lord should be painted alone without a consortcompared to such a person someone who keeps in mind the various teachings of the Dharma with faith in the Tathāgata and who reads them worships them copies them or commissions their copying and teaches them correctly to others will have a vastly greater increase in meritThis noble son has been continuously dedicated to receiving many teachingsAnd in yet another life fools may eat her flesh And in their

the essential nature of phenomena And at that time I was healed of my disease And always being attracted to and delighting in the Jina That is the supreme Dharma that the Jina teaches it is the tathāgatas pristine cognition of omnisciencenanda remember this Dharma discourse and keep it in mind retrieve it from memory explain it and teach it at length to othersas well as those who have cultivated the transcendent perfection of generosity and similarly cultivated the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom in the presence of the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas numerous as the sands of the River Gangesthen they will not know through their meditative stabilities that all things are sameness nor will they have any

a buddhaIf a woman rubs this on her vagina at the time of birth She will give birth with easenor indeed are the ten powers of the tathāgatas and the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas discernedit is because they do not apprehend those levels of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas and they do not apprehend any thought that they should dedicate their physical verbal and mental ethical discipline to the level of the śrāvakas or to the level of the pratyekabuddhasSimilarly it should be applied to the fruit of entering the stream and also to the other attainments up to and including individual enlightenmentAll roots and flowers should be wound into cords of various colors and fastened to swords tridents spears and arrowsI must examine my

thousand girls headed by Yaśovatī were also bornThat is why this abode of mine is bright and adorned with this golden lightIn a similar manner other gods arrived in Jambudvīpa to exhort the solitary buddhas Noble ones they said Give up this buddha realmāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness as afflicted or purified constitute a bodhisattvaAnd practice what you teachThis concludes the Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra The Three BodiesI am now close to the city of omniscienceThey know which teachings sever the ties of

not abandon the noble family They have no hypocrisy or boastfulnessobserved those miraculous forms emanated through the miraculous abilities of the Tathāgataneither the lord of the gods Indra nor the

for worldly conversationThey do not consider the recipient They do not even rejoice in the ripening impact of their givingWith the birth in the family of a universal monarchSenior āradvatīputra omniscience is not one thing and nonarising anotherThe Blessed One then spoke the following versesSuch wishing gives rise to rebirthproducing actions by means of body speech and mind This is what is meant by appropriation causes becomingGive up pride arrogance and harsh speechuntil all those sentient beings are no longer consumed with doubt concerning mundane supramundane contaminated

passed into nirvāṇaVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is the emptiness of emptinessand neither is it void nor is it not voidexcellent patience that is not concerned with a purposeThose phenomena are indeed not their essential nature nor are those words their essential natureIf it has fallen on the giver of fearlessness the student should study the removal of poisonShifting their attention from their games of pleasure and delightsIt is explained with intention as deepone should incant a peg made of cows bone seven fingers long with  recitations of this mantra andVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection constitutes the ten powersFor these reasons Senior āradvatīputra the nonarising of the transcendent perfection of wisdom is not the transcendent perfection of wisdomI can

multitude of bodhisattva mahāsattvas he proceededThe Licchavi Vimalakīrti addressed the whole gathering of bodhisattvasIndeed he is like a savage so it is inappropriate for the Bodhisattva to take his final existence in a family with wrong viewsFree all beings from the suffering of saṃsāraLet him with his mind calm tranquil and totally at peace Quickly follow the One Who Has Tamed His MindWhat are those four observances Venerable from now on though you be rebuked do not rebuke in returnMy friends if you aspire to that realm you must strive in the perfection of knowledge in a manner free from

retains its merit and nonmeritLater as he was dying he made this prayert that time even though great bodhisattva beings become equipoised in the meditative stability of emptiness as a gateway to liberation as far as the realization of the finality of existence is concernedand are attentive to the notion that inner forms are emptiness and so on up to the notion that inner forms are the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesThey do not practice in order to destroy the harms in cyclic existence nor to destroy the self sentient beings living beings or individualsRecall the prophecy of Dīpaṃkaraand they were of imposing stature with wide shoulders and broad firm chests He relates all of the beautiful physical attributes of those peopleHe gazed at Vajrapāṇi and said One should know the ritual of activityBut they will not relish these meditative stabilities or the fruits of these meditative stabilitiesThey must make offerings to the sages to the gods and to stūpas and also pay homage to their ancestorsA second time the complete assembly of bodhisattvas requested the BhagavānOn the seventh and final day of this great sacrifice the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and saidNoble son the kiṃnaras who rejoice in the Dharma in that way continually remember the name of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraAh This sublime being will be able to dwell at the seat of awakening where the victorious ones of the past residedand similarly they train in the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of nonentities and the emptiness of essential natureFor the highest enlightenmentThey played many thousands of trillions of divine musical instrumentsthe weapons of the executioners would break into pieces and be scattered aroundThey are adorned with beautiful radiant ornamentsThrough many ways they also turn some sentient beings away from the meditative stabilities the formless absorptions the fruit of the meditative stabilities and the fruit of the formless absorptionswhile resting in equanimity with the thought Those whom I have freed have indeed crossed overAll the flocks of birds were in the sky Emitting their beautiful perfect songs Similarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are absolutely pure because they neither arise nor cease and they are neither afflicted nor purifiedWhen he had

upon a Virtuous Spiritual Friendand so on until birth is prevented thus putting an end to old age and death anguish lamentation pain despair and tormentBodhisattvas should be impartial toward all beingsWhen the king heard this speech he rejoiced and proclaimed Let everything you wish come to passWhat are those ten They have constant love undifferentiated love Dharma love realized love gentle love beneficial love equal love for all beings love free of ill will omnipresent love and transcendent loveWhen the followers of the Bodhisattva Vehicle hear this teaching they will develop an extremely steadfast diligenceAfter the tīrthika had offered back his training and returned to his community of tīrthikasWhen the supreme gods saw the Leaders feet and nails Copper colored stainless pure and majesticThere is a profusion of languages customs and merchandise from different countriesSukuṇḍala offered him the divine jewelsIf someone were for a devas eon to serve tathāgatas arhats and samyaksaṃbuddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges with robes food bowls bedding seats necessary medicine and utensilsThe prince is dangerous and ruthlessRatnamudrāhasta His eyes are clear  stainless  warm  elongated  large and  resemble blue lotusesHe became the king of physiciansPuffed up with pride on account of her magical feminine charmSubhūti whether or not they have attained the six transcendent perfections irreversible bodhisattvas will respond precisely in the manner of an irreversible great bodhisattva beingnone of them would understand the field of experience of a single bodhisattva who has attained acceptance that phenomena are nonarising nor his liberation his analysis of ultimate reality or his practice of bringing sentient beings to complete spiritual maturityIn this way they crush pride as they think To my friends close family relatives and kinsmen I am now like a dead personThe Bodhisattva supposedly entered into his mothers womb where he mixed with impure fluids And yet he is said to have had such enjoymentsFourarmed and of the color of kunkumaThey bestow generosity that is equal to the unequaled They perfect generosity that is equal to the unequaledThe young men complainedThe four thorough relinquishments are gateways to the light of the DharmaThey have faces like tigers snakes and hogs Elephants horses donkeys and camels Monkeys lions or bearsMāṭhara repeated them and then saidOh the suffering Poverty is also sufferingAs soon as he had done so Sunandas son Rohiṇīkumāra by name acquired insightWho follow vinaya and scriptureSubhūti do you think that physical forms are apprehensible with respect to that which is inconceivable equal to the unequaled and so forthBy expounding the bodhisattvas collection of sūtras for the sake of humansteinote xmlidUT They will obtain great meritFrom Envy VajrīMay you the one with supreme intelligence be victoriousHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the noble eightfold pathThe time of my death is close Sons do not be sad Do not be unhappy If you need great medicine take this medicineO my lords please advise us When we milked all your cows they yielded clarified butterThis is why Great King I cry and sigh so sadlyIf a lay bodhisattva may be endowed with such eloquenceHe carries his offering bowl and is not overbearing or haughtyFrom where did they first originate Know that all phenomena are like that Monk as all phenomena are deep like space they are deepYet even the aspirations of all beingsthe samādhi named Practicing YogaI myself will never speak about anyone surreptitiouslyIt is a wheel without the allground It is a wheel of the Dharmaway of nonconceptuality to its full extentand the ruler of many suffering beingsThey will quickly attain the lineage of samādhis They will never become illVenerable nanda then turned to the god Ratnavara with the following wordsGood nanda the holder of my teaching Will in the future become a jina After making offerings to six hundred million sugatasWhen he travels with his miraculous powers hold on to the corner of his robeOne hundred gaṇanāgatis is called a niravadyaBlessed One what is the nature of consciousnessSimilarly they teach the doctrine so that the bodhisattvas might cultivate the correct exertionsHe sat down for a bit and then said Father open the doorOne should kiss her mouth For as long as one likes again and againHe renounced his beloved family and kinsmen And entered homelessness in that jinas teaching By offering what is suitable and pleasant one will enjoy pleasant possessions such as beds and clothesmalice and wrong views desist from fraud in weights fraud in measuresYoung man bodhisattva mahāsattvasSimilarly this mind of the bodhisattvas is unattached to sightsOne should drink milk or wine In order to make ones desire arise againHe had mastered the perfections of generosity discipline patience diligence mental stability knowledge and skillful meansAs an elephant does a mud hovel Destroy Yamas minionsThe familys fortunes have come about from little merit not a vast store of merit They are impetuous unstable and fickleAs the swords cut into them they let out great cries of torment and flee in all directionsTheir two eyeballs are ablazesince they do not apprehend those bodhisattva levels up to and including the tenth level how could longing for them ariseWherever one may happen to be There palaces will arise for himMistaken conceptual activity then gives rise to the superimposition of a selfnor is there any element of consciousness apart from the element of dharmasunconcerned with other menAt that point he will personally know the waters cool qualityThose with poisonous gazes those with poisonous snakes and those with poisonous breath shot flames of fire at the BodhisattvaHow does liberation arise In the process of the mind Relish playing with usit will bring great pleasureDharma physician you develop compassion And teach on the unsurpassed state of peaceadorned with the auspicious signs and marks and of such an appearance that he outshone the whole assemblyHaving heard this unsurpassable sūtra They will not go in futureYour Majesty quickly summon the priests Who are specialists in the Vedic treatises on dreamsThis concludes the sūtra entitled Destroyer of the Great TrichiliocosmThen when they depart from that life in their next lifetime they will have a life in which they acquire oxdrawn carriages horsedrawn carriages elephantdrawn carriages palanquins boats bulldrawn carriages and the airborne palaces of a deityNor would it measure one thousandth or ever one hundred thousandth of it In fact no number analogy or illustration would sufficeHe promised the prince he would do so and went off into the wildsTherefore nanda this transcendent perfection of wisdom is most important because through it the sentient beings of the world systems of the great trichiliocosm become established in accordance with the deeds of the buddhasSimilarly Subhūti physical forms are also inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaledChildren of noble family I would not describe as learned any bodhisattvas who do not expound in detail and correctly to others this absorption that encapsulates all meritOr is it red or whiteWhen King Mahāpadma who sat shut up in his upper citadel surrounded by his council saw them depart he asked his ministersIt is also conscious of both its virtuous and nonvirtuous actionsYou should also know it as The Questions of Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristicsIn those two hundred thousand million world realms in each direction there were no villages towns market towns districts countries or capitalsThey have no inhalation no exhalation and no connection with lifeTheir eloquence is boundlessThe King of Aṅga found this message intolerable and commanded his ministersThis is based on conventional usage but it is not in the ultimate senseThey bring benefit to sentient beings and pursue the aims of sentient beings never relinquishing their commitment and never abandoning their bodhisattva activitiesGentlemen are there any opponents in my kingdom capable of settling a matter in debate with this brahminThen the bodhisattva mahāsattva Dharaṇīṃdhara rose from his seatHe cannot be seen or beholdenempowers another great Brahmā as the controller of ten trichiliocosmsone will destroy all feverIt is not cognizant of physical forms due to the emptiness of inherent existenceLike the completely pure lord of the host of stars The full moon of the last month of autumn The Teacher who is without equal was encircled xliiwho may assume this or that corporeal form by which they are capable of acting on behalf of sentient beingsOne should rub it in around the penis and so oncausing the lilies among humans and gods to bloomWhen Māra Pāpīyān heard these words he attempted to become invisible and escape However due to the power of youthful Mañjuśrī he was unable to become invisible and escapeHe is then told Listen venerable newly ordained monks nameYou are striving for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people and with compassion for the worldbased on that would those people create a lot of meritwho has mastered the Vedas and all branches of Vedic knowledgeThe glows of the sun and moon the stars jewels fire akra and Brahmā are no longer bright in front of his intense gloryJust as for example the element of consciousness of an arhat who has reached the attainment of cessation remains cognizant after it has ceased internally so too a dying persons element of consciousness retains the capacity for recollection after it has abandoned the body and cast aside the elementsāradvatīputra The purity of phenomena is not subject to rebirth in the world system of desire because the essential nature of the world system of desire is nonapprehensiblePāpīyān you ought to cut down on your workHe also showed a great display of meditative concentrationBy thus attracting them with material thingsThey should also encourage others to acquire the eight aspects of liberation and the nine serial steps of meditative equipoiseit would not be the transcendent perfection of wisdom if one were to apprehend its essential nature or likewise if one were to apprehend its actualization or genuine originand so on up to many eons of dissolution and eons of originationThe numerous piśācas are running around And those without merit are burned by the fireSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom will refine the buddhafields accordinglyThe past nightmares Will now come true If you do not retreatAlthough the other monks ministered to him with medicinal roots stalks leaves flowers and fruits he continued to get worsenanda you should know that for as long as this transcendent perfection of wisdom is active in the worldIn this way without weariness they each collect whatever alms are appropriate being content with a bare minimumWhatever you wish to know ask and I shall explain it to youNakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña possesses this Dharma teaching or

DharmaWhen asked they reveal that because they are all of just that sameness by nature all phenomena are samenessI bring satiation to all the world Like a cloud that rains equally on allPadmaśrī in that way the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara has attained the development of the power of wisdomThere are six superknowledges the divine eye the divine ear knowledge of the minds of others

consciousness are nonexistentone who sees the Dharma sees the TathāgataSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline accordingly will swiftly perfect the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineIn whatever situation he may be The yogin should visualize the divine formWhen bodhisattvas are generousMañjuśrī it is difficult to feel conviction in the ultimate truthWhen they have rejected a sūtra such as thisHaving purified your own conduct you have reached the culmination of conductAnd with the eighty thousand million others He came before the Lord of the World For all beings old age overcomes youthIf they are thinking of Avalokiteśvara Immediately the enemies will be pacifiedand adorned by beautiful vast high golden mountainsHow you are worshiped by gods and humansDisperse all the darkness and turbidity of ignorance With the lamp of knowledgeNoble sons it is the prayer of this noble son that this will be the cause for bodhisattvas reaching perfectionand similarly they undertake verbal actions imbued with loving kindness and mental actions imbued with loving kindnessFrom now on I will never have doubts I am ripened in this supreme yāna Blessed One what is meant by suchnessIn the moment that I have attained This samādhi the path of great wisdom Having attained this supreme samādhiBodhisattva mahāsattvas who have the restraint of the mind attain the eighty secondary signs of a great beingAll the gods in the sāl forest revealed half their bodies from among the trees leaves and remained there bowingBhagavān we will have faith in whatever the Tathāgata says thinking The Tathāgata speaks infallibly The Tathāgata knows the truthHe said that unless he awakens to perfect and complete buddhahood he will never again enter the city of Kapilavastu So he will not return with youAt that time he had a shining saṅghaEven millions of māras cannot disturb The one who has trained in this restraint of the body Free of the stains of darkness you have realized the immortal stateNārāyaṇa even if all beings included in the great billionfold universe had the same amount of merit as akra their collected merit would still not match one hundredth of the amount of merit possessed by Great Brahmā it would not even bear comparisonThey have wisdom and train correctly Having trained they liberate many lost beings For a full two thousand years The Jina taught the DharmaWhoever desires many such qualities And the happiness of existence as well as nirvāṇa And wants to utterly perfect all qualitiesSo please assemble everyone who is skilled in the artsThrough my giving the gift of the Dharma I developed a pleasing followingsee sentient beings whose conceptual notions are perverse who lack genuine views whether mundane or supramundane who habitually indulge in nonvirtuous actions and who propound inactionand having set out had second thoughts on the way downBodhisattvas who maintain the aggregate of correct conduct Who practice the conduct wishing for benefitThe Blessed One answered the bodhisattva mahāsattva MaitreyaThose desiring clothes received clothing those wanting a mount received one and those wishing for wealth found richeswho brings relief to turtles crocodiles and fishI will go back nowquick turn my chariot arounduntil he reaches the essence of enlightenmentAnd were even to practice them For an entire eighty billion eonsSome had their eyes closed some had them open and some were rolling their eyesNoble children this sublime being has produced roots of virtue in the company of ninetynine trillion buddhassome of crystalAt that time the Bodhisattva stood to one side while the five hundred ākya youths wrestled among themselvesGreat prosperity and a generous attitudeFurther it involves giving up the company of those who are fond of social activities the lazy those who are fond of cyclic existence and those who turn their back on awakening as well as avoiding association with householdersāriputra just as I now praise the inconceivable qualities of those bhagavān buddhas likewisethe realm of phenomena was understoodTo live in such peace is to enter into nondualityto embrace the true Dharma and ensure the continuity of the Three JewelsAll of them bowed to the feet of the ThusGone One And returned to their own abodes in magnificent arrays The guides of the past who had the ten strengths Who had pacified senses and kindnessFriends this sūtra known as The Play in Full is a very extensive account of the Bodhisattvas playful activityHaving pulled out the root of a white uccaṭa plant Once consecrates it with fifty recitations of the mantraand they should become equipoised in the other meditative concentrations up to and including the fourth meditative concentrationand having done all those things there would be no sin in that nor would any sin come from ita powerhouse since he was endowed with the ten powerscauses them to become discernible in the god realms and the human realmFurthermore the element of consciousness after it has left the body behindThey became free of hunger and thirst That is to say they do not depend on physical forms feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessIn the past you made these and other offerings Manifold and marvelous to the best of beingshaving been incinerated they will become sentient denizens of the great hells in other world systemsIn the later times during the later times of the last five hundred years of the Dharmafor those striving toward enlightenment like a rosary Thus does he appearhose with hands of webbed fingers those with no lips those whose bodies are marked or the very oldWith great compassion he goes to the three realmsThe supreme allknowing one The Tathāgata the great physician Who has the nature of compassion Appears in the world that is stupefied by ignoranceThey who have massive bodies Where did they come fromand make a tika with this substanceand was praised and revered by one hundred thousand godsThe bodhisattvas who maintain the aggregate of correct conduct Make the greatest most special offering to meand so they are generous without any hope that the causes conditions or bases of their generosity will bring any rewardWith the root of Indian licorice one will kill worms in ones teethshe broke through the earths surface and revealed her upper body adorned with all sorts of jewelsgoats milk yellow myrobalan the three hot substancesIt is not the level of ignorance It is the arising of wisdomMonks through the blessing of the Bodhisattva Chanda told King uddhodana the ākya princess Gopā the retinue of consorts and everyone else among the ākyas what had happened in order to alleviate their sufferingSaṅgharakṣita sees the effects of actions with his own eyestWill they sniff at its stench or notThey do not see the phenomena and they do not perceive the phenomena ofAs soon as that guide had taught He sat crosslegged and in that instantThey do not consider whether the nose is connected with the tongueEndowed with such disciplinesDwelling constantly in the sky O SageWhen this has mingled with the mercury Emeralds and so forth are also to be infusedSay you brought all the beings in the great trichiliocosm together and all of them had the quantity of merit made by engendering the meditation of Great Brahmās loveTherefore Padmaśrīgarbha listen very well and keep in mind what I will now explainOr else are they practicing the essenceless doctrineRather boys and girls are born when three circumstances are presentFor that reason we ask that you send the noble Saṅgharakṣita with us across the oceanThe Bodhisattva the Great Being has donned the great armorthe Lord replied in meditating they meditate with a nonabiding meditationThe eye does not think I serve as the basis for the eye consciousnessand having done so they emanate the array of a universal monarchHe has reached the perfection of all good qualities And is renowned throughout the worlds in all directions The excellent king commanded his entourage Make the finest preparations in the upper quarters of the palaceAjita in the same way that the directions of east south west north above and below and the intermediate directions in the element of space have no endI will practice the six transcendent perfections by any means until even the name of the acquisitiveness of those sentient beingsfrom their acquisitiveness regarding physical forms to their acquisitivenesss regarding consciousnessis no longer heard I will even refine the buddhafields I will also bring sentient beings to maturitylogicwhile the monastic community of that one will be innumerableA virtuous spiritual friend a virtuous companion a virtuous support is half the holy lifeDear boy listenhe entered the samādhi named the state of infinite instructionfor it leads to the complete perfection of the entirety of the BuddhadharmaSimilarly owing to the fact that physical forms feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are indestructibleMonks everyone followed the commands issued by the kingYoung brahmin having met you we have another questionThey are focused onepointedly on the DharmaThe aspectless is explained as transcending comparisonSome are the size of humans and some the size of dogsin the presence of a crowd of common folk may deceive childish persons by conjuring up the four corps of an armythe elephant corps the cavalry corps the chariot corps and the infantry corpsHis body is free of any blemishes or dark spotsbecause it recollects its previous bodily stateThe Bodhisattva with the pristine divine eye beyond that of humansHow does one stay in a solitary place How does wisdom increase And liberate quintillions of beingsJust as wild horses or wild elephants will not be tamed unless the goad pierces them to the marrowWell then Gautama whatever teaching I know you also know And whatever you know I also knowThey praised the one who is like the bayur tree or the campakaThrough those teachings those beings will have happiness in this life and at death will be reborn in happy existencesThey do not consider the fact that they are not practicing itThe tathatā is purityThrough hearing that enlightenment will be attainedadorned with scattered flowersAnd then we and all beings Will reach the highest enlightenmentor it is white or is colored white or is like white or shines with white lightIf the Blessed One was about to foretell rebirth as an animal the rays of light would fade into his ankleand similarly when they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the other sensory elements up to and including mental phenomena are nonentitiesif they are not inclined toward extensive acts of virtuous conductThough he will pass into nirvāṇa his sacred Dharma will remain for  trillion eonsLater the food will have spoiledGreat bodhisattva beings who abide accordingly in this transcendent perfection of wisdom do not apprehend the designation of physical formsAre continuously making an offering to all the buddhas And hurled it far outside the fair city Beyond seven of the citys moatsThe great Brahmā placed this drop into a beautiful vessel of beryl and offered it to the BodhisattvaIn this way the mind corrects itselfTherefore what need is there to mention the importance of keeping in mind the Dharma reading it copying it or commissioning this action or accurately teaching it in a detailed way to othersNoble ones those two boys through performing those miracles guided their father King ubhavyūhaIn that way the yogins fly through the air Unimpeded like the wind and the clouds They should have compassion for all those beings who are not yet dedicated to enlightenmentI am from the WestRelishing those different kinds of sensations taking delight in them clinging to them and having that clinging remain is what is meant by sensation causes cravingYou know the conduct of all beings You have the wisdom of all phenomenaThose who engage in writing out the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras The Sūtra of the Baskets Display are engaged in writing the eightyfour thousand compilations of the Dharmaalso constantly travel to other realms Where they will praise thousands of buddhasSenior āradvatīputra the six extrasensory powers are nonexistent and nonapprehensibleIt is with this in mind that the Blessed One has taught Space does not stick to the palm of ones hand so too are a spiritual practitioners qualitiesor write the mantra on the wall of a house with incanted chalkThere were no Kāla mountain ranges There were no Mucilinda or Mahāmucilinda MountainsThey speak with unimpeded words like the voice of Brahmā Have a voice like the song of a goose a voice like a kiṃnaras songI was able to quickly escape from the burning house through the doorAvalokiteśvara saidYet if a listener received a prophecy that would not be the caseThey attain measureless wisdom free of darkness These qualities from attaining samādhi are measureless But these things do not originate from the nāgas bodies or mindsHaving gone up into the air they lay down there they walked in the air they shook themselves free of dust in the airGardenia aśoka and kachnar trees As well as red lotuses blue lotuses night lotuses and white lotuses The Tathāgata knows the weakness of the aspirations of beingsOther bodhisattva mahāsattvas as numerous as the atoms in one fourcontinent world realm heard this Dharma teaching and developed the aspiration to the highest complete enlightenment in one lifetimePerception is the internal description of things after apprehending their particular formsIf you ask what is the knowledge of the origin of sufferingIn the same way all endeavors of a yogin who relies on meditative cultivation will be successfulAnd the forty misdeeds I eliminated here at the center of the earthListen I shall explain all These tiny minute herbs Those that are small in the world And the other medium and large herbsIs he like a blind man or does he know the country and seek advantageIt was not with knives and arrows That he defeated Māras armyNoble ones whatever the Tathāgata has to do that is what the Tathāgata doesEven if one were to speak for countless hundreds of eons It would be difficult to conclude the praisesWe will now mete out the punishmentGet upThey experienced emptiness remained within the absence of marks and were free from any fixation on wishesYou arrive evenly and go evenlyand who was to take his last body died and passed from the lofty heights of a god and entered his wifes wombJust as this bow was drawn by the Sage Without rising from his seatgets attached to it and enjoys its tasteI would not have quickly attained the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood in this wayEven those who make a little offering to the relics of a sugata Who play music on just one instrument āriputra the tathāgatas do not lie This one yāna āriputra is the BuddhayānaThat they would see as many guides of the worldTo attain accomplishment and bliss He remained calm and diligentHe walks with his eyes toward the ground at a distance of six feetThe buddhas and bodhisattvasWho engage in the supreme conduct of secret mantraAfter a time the saṅgha elder lifted his cup of waterIn this way he rested in wisdomThey will pass genuinely beyond the danger of taking birth as animalsAcceptance of the Dharma of nonarising is a gateway to the light of the Dharmawill be guarded protected looked after and brought peace and wellbeing by themits rivers lakes fountains streams oceans and other bodies of waterThis sentient being has vast beliefsThen the Bhagavān in order to give this Dharma teaching on entering the patience of profound Dharma recited these versesWhen bodhisattvas observe disciplineit will accrue these qualities and advantages in this life and in the next lifethat all views are encapsulated in the view of wishlessness andhe is called the Destroyer of All AdversariesSo surely the Tathāgata will indeed wish to expound and spread the king of sūtras of the great vehicle called The Teaching on the Extraordinary Transformation that is the Miracle of Attaining the Buddhas PowersHe knows the phases and the degreesin the same way Subhūti the attributes of the tathāgatas are inconceivable and equal to the unequaledIt is not due to a persons skill It is not due to his overpowering abilityHe was a master of generosity in bestowing the gift of the unexcelled great DharmaI gave away my wealth grains cowries and gold to help those who were bound by attachment anger and ignoranceYoung man it arises from training in the great higher cognitions and it is known as the tathāgatakāyaAt which point the ordinand says It is excellentthe universe of gods humans asuras and gandharvas rejoiced and praised his wordsThere is the meditative stability named Lamp of the SunAt that time the daughter of Sāgara king of the nāgas had a jewel of the value of an entire realm of a billion worldsThe Bhagavān then asked all those bodhisattvasVibhūtī AbundanceThe Blessed One was dwelling in the Jetavana Anāthapiṇḍadas grove in rāvastīWhen Māra powerful and persistent arrived You defeated him with your insight diligence and love And then you attained the deathless supreme stateAmid all this activity while the Bodhisattva was exiting through the eastern gate of the city on his way to the parksWhen the yakṣas are engorged Having ferociously eaten other beingsSimilarly if they abide in cognize and are intent on sightsIt is the seat of love because it is equal to all living beingsTherefore Bhagavān it would be fitting if the Bhagavān were quickly to give us the prophecy of our attainment of the highest complete enlightenmentThey will encounter no impediment One should smear and rub it with the previously described preparation For three days and it will become healthy and stronggaining acceptance that phenomena are nonarisingAt that time the Bhagavān spoke these appropriate verses to Bodhisattva MaitreyaThey do not stay in mountain caves and they do not hide from waterIn order to guard the Bodhisattvaāradvatīputra This purity of phenomena is due to absolute purityTheir mouth is fragrant Speaking little pleasantly and articulately Speaking good and gentle words to othersThe power of love is the residence Patience and gentleness is the robeone should start on the first day of the bright fortnight and proceed as before until the day of the full moonIt is a wheel utterly ungraspable It is a wheel beyond effort and effortlessness an inexpressible wheelExpert in the deep analysis of things you teach their ultimate meaningSubhūti even if the evil Māra were to approach great bodhisattva beings in the guise of a buddhaMañjuśrī it is difficult in many worlds to be able to hear the words the sound or the name of this Dharma teachingIf we are permitted reverend we would obtain the going forth ordination and monkhood in the wellproclaimed Dharma and VinayaMonk as all phenomena are like a body of space and an empty hand they cannot be graspedO the Blessed One has revealed this sacred doctrine which is incompatible with mundane thingsWith this mastery there is instantaneously a complete knowledge of such areas as the thusgone ones ten powers fearlessnesses correct understandings unique qualities excellent marks and signs and sacred complete awakening as well as the number of extremely subtle particles in all buddha realms throughout timeSimilarly they should be attentive to the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are impermanent and so on up to calamitousAt the same time hundreds of buddhas residing in the ten directions all became silentNārāyaṇa please pay heed and understand this wellThat sounds are not heard is the lack of reference pointVisualizing it as nectar expand it greatly Through two expansions purify ithe will display the form of the Buddha and utter these wordsTunnel beneath the earth and I will yank you up as if with a hookKnowing the characteristic of the true Dharma He brings to an end all illusions In addition all the chief gods believed that the mother of the Bodhisattva remained only in the residence they had given her and not anywhere elseThe beings who remember your name will have good thoughtsThrough all of this fiery sand had not fallen on a number of scrawny nāgas either prompting him to askAlas He is leaving The vow he made in the past is now being fulfilledI took a vow to remain fastingI have understood the Bhagavāns teaching to mean that he does not praise the perfection of generosityhas given birth to all the tathāgatas the arhats the perfectly enlightened buddhasSome to be converted strive for the roots of virtue that arise from commissioning statues images and representations of gold silver and brassThe wife with whom he had sported made love and indulged all of his desires then gave birth to a sonYou may wonder noble son what these qualities may imply from the bodhisattvas dispelling of the darkness of ignorance through to their being the joy of virtuous beingsBodhisattvas should be like a father or mother to all beings giving them things that are helpful and pleasingHe cried out and collapsed on the groundthis āradvatīputra is the transcendent perfection of wisdom originating from the skillful means of great bodhisattva beings who practice the meditative concentrations the immeasurable aspirations and the formless absorptionsthe uppermost  leagues of the earths surface in those world systems would be demolished when the bodhisattva took those seven steps after being bornGreat king why are you and this great assembly of people here before me crying out loudlySo needless to mention that an insightful person would not feel any desire eitherBecause the awakened ones knowBhagavān we have lived in great hardshipdying precious gems dying clothes creating optical illusions dream analysis bird soundsIn this way the wind amasses great cloud formations that yield a constant and continuous downpour of rainones words will be heededThen Brother nanda bowed his head to the Bhagavats feet and departedIt is the teaching of the Dharma that causes the acquisition of the vision of the tathāgatas wisdomone should make offerings to her the Blessed OneThe vinaya of the hearers does not embody the ten strengths the various types of fearlessness the unique qualities or omniscient wisdomLikewise this city of Kapilavastu will become prosperous And replete with treasuresThe priest Nārada pronounced a curseseven realms with discerning awareness seven realms lacking discerning awarenesswhen noble sons and daughters accept it repeat it understand it deeply write it completely and making it into a book honor itwhy should I be fixated on phenomenaThey are nonapprehensible because emptiness is indeed emptiness SoSimilarly eight million four hundred thousand goddesses from each of the realms of the Heaven of the ThirtyThree the Heaven Free from Strife the Heaven of Joy the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations and the Heaven of Making Use of Others EmanationsMaitreya the transgressions of a minister are also five in numberAnd will quickly attain supreme awakeningNoble son the ocean does not allow a dead corpse to remainIt has not been revealed so that the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of mental phenomena and the sensory element of mental consciousness might be grasped or not graspedThis samādhi is not difficult to attain For those who understand the natural results That come to those who become envious of wealth And to those who seek and enjoy it The domain of the realization of the unborn nature of all things yet of the perfection of the body the auspicious signs and marks and the ornaments of the Buddha such is the domain of the bodhisattvaIn accordance with the aspirations expressed by the thusgone ones through this gift of wealth grains and storeswould not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in which all things are signless free from recollection and free from attention and they would not become established in uncontaminated phenomena in the real natureIn order to create the precious images Of statues that possess the thirtytwo signsThe Protector of the World came to the city in Magadha Peacefully he stayed as long as he wishedGiving this world realm of a billion worlds filled with the seven precious materials to all the buddhas bodhisattvas śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas is not comparableThe nature of phenomena is like that of space Inexpressible beyond speech and wordsKumārabhuta Mañjuśrī how is the spiritual community of hearers that belong to the Blessed thusgone worthy perfect Buddha Ratnaketuand similarly they oppose all the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including omniscienceof skill in erudition consummated by religious practiceāradvatīputra if you ask what are the ten powers of the tathāgatas they are as followsI will definitely practice generosity by giving away crest jewels and crownsand the eighteen distinct qualities of a buddha Young man that is the restraint of the mindSince they derive from imagination who in fact is scolding or striking meFearless when enemies descend you are unharmed by their attacksand when they are ovulatingNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities relinquish the eight unfree statesThis sacred doctrine is compatible with the fruit of individual enlightenmentNoble one this Dharma offering of giving away your own body is the preeminent the highest offeringSubhūti it is because there is nothing which the tathāgatas bodhisattvas pratyekabuddhas and the śrāvakas of the tathāgatas apprehend outside the expanse of realitydress yourself in colorful robes You must make an effort to be sure that he falls under your powerDesire is like poison and has endless faults It pushes beings into hell and the realms of hungry spirits and animalsMonks in this way the Bodhisattva lived according to the DharmaThey should dwell outside the monasterygaruḍaSuch a mind is unclear just as is the case for example with the obscured mind state of someone who has just been woken up from a deep sleepThe time has come to utter melodious speechDestructible and indestructible are dualisticSubhūti all things have a modality that does not ariseSubhūti the bodhisattvas bestow all their gifts in order to release all sentient beings from suffering The Dharma is taught through illusory words And all those words cease in that instantThe power of insight and the power of means The power of miracles and unattached love The power of correct discernment and complete truth Today I will accomplish thosein the fruit of being tied to one more rebirthnot perceiving dharmas the mindconsciousness has no ground to stand uponAnd that they lead away from the noble path of wisdomThe newborn Bodhisattva had already practiced good conduct for countless trillions of eons and he possessed great diligence and strengthIt is taught to superior personsThe Blessed One expressed his approval to the bodhisattva noble Avalokiteśvara sayingNoble sons nanda and I together at the same moment developed the aspiration to the highest complete enlightenment in front of the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha DharmagaganābhyudgatarājaThose are the four retentions The four retentions are thoseI am someone who has the great strength that comes with being a mighty and powerful strongmanWhat type of phenomenon does my mind engage withthe great Queen MahāmāyāHe is the one who is supported by large gatherings of worthy ones Those who know the unceasing Dharma Will always know the unceasing DharmaSome live on just one mouthful of food or anything up to seven mouthfulsThey understand the mind as being like an illusion Like a dream and similarly like a mirageThey joined the palms of their hands and prostrated toward the Blessed One the thusgone worthy completely perfect Buddha ākyamuni while they called out Homage to the Blessed One the thusgone worthy completely perfect Buddha ākyamuniExcept for the tathāgatas no one could easily express the excellent quality of that beings accumulation of merit and of his or her roots of virtueYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of knowledge of existence What are the four kinds of knowledge of existenceAt one point venerable āriputra venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana venerable Mahākāśyapa venerable nanda and venerable Rāhula all went to see the Blessed OneNoble son bodhisattvas possessing these ten qualities are similar to fireowing to the nonapprehension of the arising of all other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscienceVenerable Lord Why are all phenomena gathered in the expanse of realityrobes parasolsFriends replied akra wait until the best of the superior gods come into the presence of the Blessed One and delight himOf all the lords of the worlds And they have no doubt in the Dharma of the Buddha has equanimity without any attainment of equanimityhe enters the absence of conceptual knotsMañjuśrī the Tathāgata the Arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha who is the great King of the Dharma while he is the King of the Dharma sees the śrāvakas and bodhisattvas battling with the Māra of the skandhas or the Māra of the kleśasconsider a filthy rotten and foulsmelling corpse of a dog with repulsive dark bluishgreen skin completely full of maggots lying on a roadsideAnd the Tathāgata realized them precisely in the way in which they are emptyThe merchants asked me On what day should we gonot to hope for a reward from the ripening of ones spiritual or material generosityand their bodies beautiful without ornamentsOne who wishes for a girl will soon obtain the one he desiresI myself will never speak covetously to anyone order others to speak so or rejoice in someone so speaking to anyoneThe four elements and the four mothersIn that way it is similar to space and therefore it is described as suchor whether its limbs are wellproportionedReverend what the Blessed One has done for me my father did not do for meYou should not make assumptions on account of these resourcesEven Brahmā the peaceful and compassionate one Who speaks lovingly awaits you thinking I must request this lord of men To turn the unexcelled wheelis not interested in the Dharma but is interested in verbalizationShe was overcome by sorrow and cried outThey held aloft vast white parasols and beautiful yaktail fansAs I was teaching them properly the benefits and virtues of renouncing the worldOne has the notion of happiness as happiness and suffering as sufferingThough a hundred spears strike them a second time they will not dievenerable AniruddhaThe saṃbhogakāya remains the same meditative absorption for all the buddhasHence to know that affliction is indeed the very nature of the realm of phenomena is what we call purificationVenerable Lord If all things are nonarisingRudraka the son of Rāma is really in charge of a group indeed a large group he is the head of the congregation and moreover wellknown popular venerated by the masses and recognized by all scholarsThere were the superior kings of great power renowned as having great powerI shall go forth He then said this to his sonThe god said Mañjuśrī you should not deliver this Dharma teaching when beginners are presentwhile they are seated with their divine sense of smellthose spirits that dwell in mountains forests thickets trees rivers fountains ponds pools wells and reliquariesNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities will never separate from their spiritual teachersOf the best beryls and likewise sapphiresThis completes the fifteenth chapter from The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled The Transcendent Perfection of Toleranceit is the termination of any focus of the mindYou have bodies as infinite as the element of spaceThey have wisdom concerning states of existence They have complete understanding of all phenomena When he had completely liberated the beings there he went to the city of the pretastathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas in other hundreds of thousands of quintillions of world realmsHe is free from feeling from all absence of feeling from all perceptions all thoughts and all ways of directing the mindSubhūti great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration never develop thoughts of desireFrom the development of insight comes buddhahoodDivine being the ThusGone One has prophesied your awakening to true and perfect buddhahood You have gained something excellentHe will teach so that all opponents are defeatedHow does it not involve transmigrationUltimately all phenomena up through nirvāṇa itself are unarisenthe inconceivably numerous accumulations of sūtras concerning teaching the compositetogether with many hosts of vajra yogins and yoginīslike a special onein the same way āradvatīputra the meaning of the term bodhisattva as a great bodhisattva being abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdom is nonexistentabandoned and let go of my childHe is without activity without birthMy friend take this precious jewel and go to the big city andSubhūti If you have conviction in the transcendent perfection of wisdom you should not have conviction in physical formsThe body is ownerless being the product of a variety of conditionsTheir words are not meaningless Their teaching of the Dharma is fruitful Even the tathāgatas do not have Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvaras prowessAbhorring the wickedness of the mind Never abandoning the mendicants disciplinewho has eleven headsThey are always beside the doorway to deathlessness They are always close to stainless enlightenmentDivine princes there is no one at all who will receive this transcendent perfection of wisdom which is so profound and so forth up to so immaculate and sublime and which is to be known by the learned and the wise aloneArise wise one come into my home And teach the Dharma to the citys women vconsidering all elements to be present in the fire elementI will not kill living beingsand the noon hour arrived akra the lord of the godsMonks prosperity is appealing singled out considered valuable pleasant and highly appreciated by everyoneWherever the most sublime being happens to walkLamp of the World we have been made content Through having heard this prophecyWhoever desires the divine and human enjoyments Or all the happiness of the three realms of existence Or the bliss of concentration and the happiness in solitudeI will myself repeat and recite themYou prophesied my supreme enlightenment In front of the world and its devas I have a few questions for the Bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened BuddhaBodhisattvas as numerous as the sands of the River Ganges accepted that phenomena are nonarisingGods and men worship your ocean of qualities And I with my sons offer worship as wellSo it is Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings who wish to enter into the irreversible level should train in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomWith these words of praise the gods And bodhisattvas with their vast knowledgeHe is not stuck in the past future or present mind As he practices in this wayIt is the intelligence that is far removedHaving heard it I had longing for what had been described Free from uncertainty I embraced enlightenment owing to the emptiness of great extentWhen doing pūraka one gazes at a bush of common milk hedgeThese phenomena are not present There is no presence to be perceivedAt this the Bhagavān knowing the thoughts in the minds of the fourfold assembly Seeking the wisdom of buddhahood I offer to the lords of the worldsNoble son when bodhisattvas have received ordination they will have little wealth yet be fully content with the wealth of the DharmaThey do not have faith in this sūtra Nor are they generous toward the Buddhas teachingHowever if shelterless bodhisattvas are physically unable to endure that they should take up residence at a templeRight absorption is a gateway to the light of the Dharmanot acquiring things through pretense and flattery not acquiring things by making hints not acquiring things by covert urging not acquiring things through improper avenues not acquiring things through nonDharma not acquiring things through impure ways not being attached to acquisition not desiring acquisition not growing weary and being content with the acquisition of the DharmaSubhūti it is because physical forms and similarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are absolutely pure sensory contact which arises contingent on the six sense fieldswill be afraid and terrifiedEven in a million trillion eons it will be Very difficult to find a supreme Dharma such as thisThose who are well disciplined by your precious Dharma Are free of vain imaginings and always deeply peacefulRelinquishing the attachment of desirethey grant their generosity with a mind endowed with omniscience and dedicate this for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment making common cause with all sentient beingsThey themselves should turn the wheel of the sacred doctrinewho will all be heroic brave handsome and triumphantBhagavān I will do anything so that this Dharma discourse is not practiced in JambudvīpaThen noble ones at that time the boy Vimalagarbha and the boy Vimalanetra recited these verses to their birth motherāriputra in that way a tathāgata accomplishes that one deed and one action that one great deed and great action of the tathāgatasSon of noble family through these four instructions will one attain the absorption that encapsulates all meritAt this point the full refrain should be extensively applied exactly as indicated above in the middle of this chapterAnd also of such measure the side the altar The garland the halfgarland and the paṭṭikāimbued with suffering not a selfPlease teach us this point And we shall follow your advice One perspires and drools One falls asleep repeatedlyWhat is meant by the foolish rejecting it It means that it is difficult for all who are foolish to understandSuch was my aspiration and it has now been perfected my pledge has now been fulfilledBodhisattvas think as follows All that I have heard of the profound tune of the thusgone ones voice is trueYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of knowledge of the kleśas What are the four kinds of knowledge of the kleśasThat

experience in another world the roots of virtue accumulated in this worldAs the fruition of that act they have come to resemble trees leaves flowers and fruitIt teaches the lack of forgetfulness of phenomena and is a gateway to diligence with respect to all phenomenaIf you ask why it is because they do not consider the nature of physical formsSimilarly Subhūti all things have the modality of

twenty yearsat the last moment of beings consciousness you will have the capacity to eliminate their obscuration of afflictions their obscuration of karma and their obscuration with regard to phenomena and send them to the completely pure buddhafieldsYou who have great love arise and speak to me ivAt that time when they saw the form of the Guides body They developed the aspiration for the supreme wisdom of buddhahoodEnjoining him to dwell in tranquilitySimilarly it indicates to these worlds that the paths of the ten virtuous actions the four meditative concentrations the four immeasurable aspirations and the four formless absorptions are emptyFor people without the mantra no enjoyment can be wonIn that respect Mañjuśrī the Tathāgata is everywhere the same neutral without concepts and does not make any distinctionsSubhūti this is because all phenomena are naturally voidin the same way the unmistaken real nature the reality the expanse of reality and maturity with respect to all things are without foundationthat is why you shine todayMaitreya and  other bodhisattva mahāsattvas endowed with clairvoyance had also assembled thereMoreover Satatasamitābhiyukta the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who possess this Dharma read it teach it explain it or write it out will attain twelve hundred qualities of mental activity and their mental faculty will be purifiedand

to their strength and locationāriputra I cause the realization of the vision of the tathāgatas wisdomWhat is the negation of attributes It is realizing that all phenomena are like a dream and the extinction of thingsthe tathāgatas engage in the perception of pristine cognition which is unobstructed with respect to phenomenaHe is known as the member of the royal class because he is the only one who carries the jewel parasolSo it is in these ways that there is the discernment of phenomena through knowing phenomenaSubhūti do you think that you should consider this illusionlike mindIf you ask what is the emptiness of external phenomenaThere was no thought no movement no conceptual mind and no change yet it was allpervading and not dependent on anythingUnderstanding such flaws bodhisattvas engage in the practice of contemplating emptiness for the sake of going beyond all mental constructsand who having blossomed will be freedIs something that cannot be stated May I give everything away without miserlinessYou illuminate darkness everywhere in the worldKauśika great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom in that manner should not dwell on anything at allBut great bodhisattva beings should not cultivate disparate thoughts of vacillation thinking Perhaps I should not keep my former vow to become the protector of unprotected sentient beings to become a sanctuary for those without sanctuary and to become a guide for who those without a guideAs they play intoxicated by their gamesThat would be a sin and I reject such ignoble principlesThe

herselfand even those among them who teach the sacred doctrineHe will liberate from birth the infinite number of beings who are bornEventually I gave away my arms legs eyes and head as well as my beloved sons spouses and daughtersThey enter the divine hall called SudharmaIf you ask why Subhūti it is because great bodhisattva beings who practice this transcendent perfection of wisdom transcend the levels of the śrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhas and after transcending the maturity of the bodhisattvas they will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentTheir lack of understanding and insight occurs randomly and by chanceDivine son because on the ultimate level nothing manifests and therefore all phenomena are pacifiedlike the fun of

also nonconceptualHow do they abide in compassionThe moment the Bhagavān placed his right foot adorned by a precious wheel from the accumulation of countless roots of merituse this as an errhineThe

Answer simply by saying what is so is so and what is not is notThere are many present who are foolish and proud They will not understand and will reject my teaching Venerable Lord Is there a reason why great bodhisattva beings may be styled irreversibleThere is the meditative stability named Obliterating Defects of Speech Transforming Them as if into Space AndAt that time the bodhisattva

without apprehending anythingMañjuśrī replied the Blessed One you should begin by teaching the nature of the realm of phenomenaThat bodhisattva should avoid the householder life avoid associating with nonspiritual friends and give up all personal possessionsWhy is that Because free from all forms of unevenness the body is at that point equal to the bodies of all bodhisattvasThey too heard the exhortation of the gods rose up into the sky to the height of seven tāla trees andThey know that it is composed of the unsurpassable wisdom of omniscienceMay you gather a single syllable within the

completed the ākyas went before King uddhodana at the time of the constellation of Puṣya and saidShould meditate on Passion VajrīTherein there is no attainment of completely perfect buddhahood and no genuinely perfect enlightenmentSimilarly they know the modalities of the sensory elements and yetOne should rejoice in those who have set their mind on the aspiration toward unsurpassed genuinely

a rooftop shedOwing to the utter purity of all things they do not apprehend pratyekabuddhasThey who possess this stainless samādhi Attain the ten powers and attain the eight and two bhūmisSubhūti it is because the essential nature of an arhat whose contaminants have ceased is empty of the essential nature of an arhat and similarly the essential nature of a pratyekabuddha is empty of the essential nature of a pratyekabuddha and the essential nature of a tathāgata is empty of the essential nature of a tathāgataGentlemen have I not already prohibited you from collecting tributes and taxesin

the ascetic sons of the ākya for they have secured from the king the liberty of a princeIn this time of the destruction of the supreme Jinas teaching Although they see all dharmas with their dharma eye ultimately they see nothing whatsoeverIn this way they have no conception of a self And liberated from that concept they have no fear Having understood these Dharmas these beings will reach the higher realmsEight trillion four hundred thousand million beings purified their eye of Dharma regarding phenomena so that it became stainless and unobscuredOnce when I was sitting in my fathers park under the shade of a rose apple treeBlessed One a lions roarThrough these prostrations with devotion to the Three JewelsOf those who had the six higher cognitions the three knowledges Subdued senses great powers great miraclesHe thought There is no reason why I should give inferior carts to my childrenA noble son or noble daughter who wishes to enter that maṇḍala should write the names of the entire lineage of his or her family and first of all cast those names into the maṇḍalaThe teacher Vajradhara Emanated light from his eyesWith the bodies of skeletons They terrorized many peoplethey

displayed by that thusgone onethe unconditionedAbiding in those meditative stabilities of the bodhisattvas and so forthI will satisfy human beings By providing the beverage with the taste of liberationInside the womens quarters jeweled shoots sprouted forth Scented water saturated with fragrant oils flowed forthWith your goal accomplished you reached independenceI teach the Dharma to those with little capacity To those with inferior and those with higher understandingTasting and offering the ambrosia Is taught to be the practice of offeringHere there is nothing whatsoever that transmigrates from this existence to the nextUltimately their knowledge is born through not apprehending ignorance as something to be exhaustedReverend Mahākāśyapa to avoid the houses of the wealthy and to favor the houses of the poorthis is partiality in benevolence Reverend Mahākāśyapa you should dwell on the fact of the equality of thingsThen the Bodhisattva wondered What is the prerequisite for the six sense fields to emergeO when there is crying or wailing this is for removing it Hū phaṭYour doubt is army number sevenSo if bodhisattvas become fixated on some viewpoint even if it is the Buddhas teachings or the view of the transcendence of suffering they disappoint the thusgone onesMoreover Subhūti great bodhisattva beings should themselves acquire an excellent life spaneyebrows that met and a prominent noseand there is no one indeed who can attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to that in which number and calculations are nonapprehensibleAnything that is conceptualized neither arises nor ceases and is only conventionally designated by names and symbolsSubhūti that which is innumerableWeeping I adorned that king of horses And gave it to the most exalted among menThese ten powers of the tathāgatas are merely names and the same applies to all the remaining fruitional attributes and attainments up to and including omniscienceI oversaw his bath I inducted him into the novitiate and I ordained himThey crush their pride as they think I must please my masters my gurus and those worthy of offeringsReverend āriputra impropriety for one who has renounced the world for the discipline of the rightly taught Dharma consists of constructual thought and discrimination yet the elders are full of such thoughtsbut the lord buddhas in order to develop living beings do not reveal all at once the pure realm of the BuddhaThe brilliant sun and moon would never bow down before a fireflyIn order to obtain gain and honor And teach it in the middle of assembliesThe domain of living with the five powers where one delights in the ten powers of the tathāgata such is the domain of the bodhisattvaThe Bhagavān said to Brother MahākāśyapaIn this way the essential nature is said to be empty of the essential natureWhen resting in concentration and attainment they are free from evilAbiding in these attributesReverend āriputra these eight strange and wonderful things are seen in this houseLikewise the sufferings experienced by beings in the realm of the lord of death such as hunger and thirst were also pacifiedThe lifespan of humans in that world Will be eight intermediate eonsIt would have been good had the ascetic Gautama who was prophesied to become king of the world become royal priestCertainly Blessed One he repliedthe entire gathering of countless innumerable bodhisattva mahāsattvasone will increase all ones abilitiesand praised him with the following hymnWhat are your attainments and what type of realization have you gained that you now cover yourselves with your upper robes before MañjuśrīIn that way there sounded The words of the Guide of the World And imagine that akra lord of the gods could be seen there playing and enjoying

the understanding of all phenomena the understanding of the aspects of the path omniscience and the bodhisattvas are also neither fettered nor liberatedThey are not the actions of holy beingsafter actually realizing those very truths imparted by the lord buddhasAfter prostrating at āriputras feet the householder Buddharakṣita laid out a seat and invited the venerable āriputra to sitAt that time Mañjuśrī while the great Brahmā who controls ten trichiliocosms looks upon all the classes of godsThese included the omniscient venerable Kauṇḍinya and the venerables Aśvajit Vaṣpa Mahānāman Bhadrika

While turning in cyclic existenceThis supreme peace of samādhi The moon has the nature of the five elements andYet Mañjuśrī sentient beings with varied beliefs perceive the speech of the Tathāgata issuing forth in accordance with their manifold inclinationsBhaiṣajyarāja that noble son or noble woman should be known to have attained the highest complete enlightenmentDo not speak words that are unture In front of their parents or teachers and which is the imperishable teaching of omniscienceto familiarize oneself with the absence of marks and thereby become free of expectationsTranscendent perfection is the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities Transcendent perfection is extensive in all enlightened attributesThey cause the abandonment of avarice immorality malice laziness forgetfulness foolishness and jealousy as well as bad convictions adherence to objects and all oppositionāradvatīputra it is in this way that bodhisattvas become unskilled in the transcendent perfection of wisdom Great King although the five aggregates are insubstantial childish ordinary beings think of them as being substantialThis completes the Noble Mahāyāna kāśagarbha SūtraSo his time came and he died and he was reborn among the denizens of Avīci the Great Hell of Unrelenting TormentThus they endeavor in practiceMañjuśrī bodhisattva mahāsattvas should expound this Dharma teaching in the later times in a later era by maintaining four qualitiesOnce they have left their homes they practice urgently as if their hair were on fire for the sake of attaining this DharmaTherefore young man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who wish to attain the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodThey do not apprehend even the transcendent perfection of wisdom through which anything could be actualized nor do they apprehend anything that could bring about actualizationIt is the equality of the different kinds of beings It is skill in examining phenomenathose who are not attached to wealth

to his mother who askedVenerable Lord if therefore physical forms do not exist and they are not apprehensibleDo not lie speak words of slander Indulge in idle talk or speak harsh words and individual enlightenment are attainedWhen bodhisattvas see a donor or a benefactor they will not make any indication by saying I need clothing I have no begging bowl or I need medicineAs nothing impedes their mind they will engage in authentic conductSeeing those who are in distress I teach thousands of millions of sūtrasand saw each other as parents and childrenFor those who are stuck in their attachment to the stain of laziness having present diligence toward realization is attachmentHappy is the solitude of the contented one Who has heard the Dharma and can seeSimilarly those great bodhisattva

too that the attributes of the tathāgatas which the tathāgatas possess are inconceivable equal to the unequaled and so forthThose who maintain this sūtra During the cruel age of destructionAt first in youth when one has a fine body One is liked and desired and acts like a childThe nose cannot be found and nor can the tongueHe teaches Dharma wellThis occurs due to their comprehension of the absence of self which ensures that they have no experience of being harmedBy being in service to the virtue of the vase initiation One is in the service of virtue a permanent layvow holderSome suggested The city of Vaiśālī is wealthy prosperous and happyO people why be so amazed Do you know whats amazingthat these sentient beings with a childish disposition perceive that which does not exist as a sentient being andHe did not lapse from continually giving rise to the state of omniscienceIt entails absorption in the three modes of meditative stability having realized that all things are naturally in equipoiseTherefore I must first actualize these experiences myself In that way I can demonstrate that his worldly absorptions which are limited to concentration and which only support states of equilibrium do not carry a resultThe entire domain of the king of Alakavatī Became empty with no yakṣa remaining thereMonks such was the awesome strength of the newborn Bodhisattvas first

austerities you sought awakening and wisdom of many qualitiesPrabhāvyūha repliedPlease Blessed One have compassion for meSo I will silently remain in the forest emptiness of all thingsBecause the time has come when there are many bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs upāsakas and upāsikās who are extremely arrogant and have rejected the good DharmaBhikṣus in the future times when I have passed into nirvāṇaSo it is Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings should be skilled in dedicating the transcendent perfection of wisdomMahāsthāmaprāpta in that way I obtained this Dharma teaching directly from the tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas of the past and read it and taught itWhen you dream that your pearl necklace is torn And that you are naked and your body is mutilatedThey train in the six

and unimpeded wisdom vision of the presentYou have reduced to rubble the massive mountain of prideSubhūti it is because the emptiness of names is empty of the emptiness of names and in the same vein the emptiness of those other terms up to and including designations is empty of the emptiness of designated phenomena and so forthSarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin such are the bodhisattvas within that poreThere are monks and priests in the pastBy nature it is like a magical displayConsider noble son how the place where a lotus grows is clean and how it attracts brahmins royalty townspeople and

pronounce their punishmentthey do not transgress the real nature of all things and apart from that they do not consider anything at all to be virtuous or nonvirtuous specified or unspecified

seven precious substances filling that entire great billionfold universeThey constantly train in wisdom And beat loudly the drum of the DharmaIt is indeed to bodhisattvas who realize such a teaching that the blessed buddhas prophesy awakening to unexcelled and perfect buddhahoodUltimately it is not about generating anger nor is it about bringing anger to an endHe was clear like a lake immaculate

omens ofSimilarly the essential nature of magical displays and the essential nature of mirages echoes optical aberrations and phantom emanations of the tathāgatas will not attain emancipation from the three world systems andand for that alone I would exclude from this Dharma and Vinaya those persons who are converts to a tīrthika orderOne should join them together andFor that long even if it takes many eons We shall act for the welfare of beingsFriends there is a bodhisattva a great being who has excellently and diligently practiced purification generosity discipline patience diligence concentration knowledge methods studies conduct ascetic practices and austerities for countless trillions of eonsIt would not be appropriate for me to take these alms with my hands What vessel did the previous perfect and complete awakened ones use to accept alms Right then the answer dawned on himYet they do not make assumptions on account of such miraculous abilities nor do they make assumptions about those miraculous abilities and they do not even apprehend them because anything on account of which they might make assumptions anything about which they might make assumptions and the assumptions which they might make are all essentially empty essentially void and essentially nonapprehensibleYou who have ascended the throne of the sublime victorious onesThe oceans can be compared to the oceans of absorptionThe Buddha who was the color of gold Placed his hand upon Candraprabhas head The Tathāgata who had a gentle voice The Teacher then said to him Having attained this peace this stainless samādhi Such people will be those who always have a retinue They will not cause division but will always keep harmonious unity And practice the supreme highest peaceful bodhisattva conduct If you ask why it is because the transcendent perfection of generosity is not a transcendent perfectionImmutable like the central mountain He practiced the allpervasive concentrationThey will

previous practice And those bodhisattvas dwell in supreme roots of merit Who aim for the highest supreme enlightenment And carry out for me the work that has to be donedo you think that they would generate many merits on this basisthen from what phenomena have great bodhisattva beings turned away when they are revealed to be irreversibleThereupon Senior Subhūti asked the Blessed One Venerable Lord What is the sameness of great bodhisattva beingsthe sameness in which great bodhisattva beings should trainhas proceeded from time immemorial without interruption like the flow of a riverFifty full years passed by after that And since I saw him another twentynanda there are some monks nuns laymen and laywomen who do not feel inspired when they hear sūtras like this one Instead they do not trust these sūtras and they reject themThe man knew what his children thought He understood that they would wish for many different kinds of amusements andIn the same vein why are all attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience nonexistent being inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaledAnd so monks King uddhodana satisfied the sage Asita and his nephew

speaking with reason acting in meaningful ways creating harmony through material things and creating harmony by means of their wealthAbove the devas are beating their great drums And sending down a rain of coral tree flowersit is because the first meditative concentration is empty of its essential natureIn the same way they reveal to sentient beings the sacred doctrine that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness neither arise nor cease and that they are neither defiled nor purifiedIt is in this way Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings become a sanctuary for the worldsIf you wish to attain buddhahood quickly Listen to me and then practice this and the five aggregates of appropriationThey teach through knowing the conduct of all beings And similarly their thoughts and past practicecarefully surveyed them looking to see if there was anyone similar to himself in terms of virtuous conduct discipline meditative absorption or knowledgeWhen the Blessed One

and the things that do not arise are all neither conjoined nor disjoined andWhen the king had heard the words of his sons He furiously ordered his serving executionerThere is no greater evil than the absence of passionThrough mind one attains freedomThey have no analysis or examination of those phenomenaand give rise to the mind of unexcelled and complete awakeningmay that being thereby make irreversible progress toward unexcelled and complete awakeningWith the following verses to the buddhas One should request empowermentVenerable Lord it is because the essential nature of anything through which pleasant or unpleasant things could be cognized is nonapprehensibleThere is not even a single chair in this housethe inconceivably numerous words concerning clarification in regard to the kleśas and the inconceivably numerous words of clarification in regard to purification Those are the fourSimilarly in the emptiness of internal phenomena the maturation of sentient beings is nonapprehensible due to its utter purity and in to the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities the maturation of sentient beings is

the water of craving and strewn with the manure of ignorance the sprout of name and form manifests within whichever mothers womb one will take rebirth throughWhen a tree rotsWhen a bodhisattva perceives all beings as worthy recipients of gifts such a bodhisattva is endowed with skillful meansWhat is being skilled concerning past lifetimes It is remembering lifetimes and having received many teachingsAll phenomena like illusions or dreamsthey comprise  the sense field of the eyes  the sense field of the ears  the sense field of the nose  the sense field of the tongue  the sense field of the body and  the sense field of the mental facultyWell executed though the painting may be it does not involve any phenomenon at all being transferred from the artists hand or mind to the physical

with the transcendence of all things thenbecause he fully embraced skillful meansIt is eyes for those who wish for the viewIn the past when I was practicing bodhisattva activityI must find some way around itIt is not discontinuous because the aggregates at birth do not arise from the final aggregates at death either when they have already ceased or when they have not yet ceased Like the beam of a scale tilting from up to down the aggregates at birth arise precisely when the final aggregates at death have ceasedOne should combine the practice of kumbhaka and so forth With the four gazesDivine

fulfill the aspirations of all beingsThus commanded by the Buddha they took their thronesWhile meditating with the movement of breath controlled it blazes in an instantSubhūti do you think that there is anything in which those great bodhisattva beings who would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment having trained their minds should not trainDo you think that one is liberated by perceiving feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness as entities and nonentitiesThey will therefore regard the realms of sentient beings in

were one landNo longer gleaming and luminous they ceased to shineThese countless buddhas are now seated At the foot of trees like a multitude of lotusesand all places of deep darkness throughout the world were bathed in that golden lightOne will be devoid of craving and feel buoyantHe is a parasol for those burned and pained by the sunāradvatīputra it is in this manner that great bodhisattva beings perceive all things distinctly but do not become fixated on those phenomenaAs soon as Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta said those wordsThose who remember his name And live for the sake of awakening Will all attain liberationVarious birds flew through the air singing out their beautiful melodies Among them were parrots śārikas cuckoos geese peacocks ducks pheasants snipe partridge and many othersSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent wisdom of spontaneous accomplishmentGreat King may you be victorious May you be victoriousNoble son did you find what you soughtAmoghadarśinThey know that all the Dharmas that teach Of beings individuals and persons are provisional truth When some skillful people analyze this and wondernamely Purāṇa Kāśyapa Māskārin Gośāliputra Saṃjāyin Vairaṭiputra Kakuda Kātyāyana Ajita Keśakambala and Nirgrantha Jñātiputra and follow the ways they prescribeThe strength of ten gray elephants is the same as the strength of one white waterlily elephantMaitreya if bodhisattvas possess these four qualitiesThere is a divine king of horses named Bālāha who has compassion for the desolate and destituteSubhūti the passage commencing with the words the illusionist or the skilled student of an illusionist is similarly applicable here just as has been indicated aboveThe name of the eon will be RatiprapūrṇaWhat you say is very true and I agreeAs not permanent as not discontinuous as not involving transmigration as the production of a large result from a small cause and as a continuity of similar typeThe Blessed One said Padmaśrīgarbha consider this analogyThere was not a place to be found Not walked upon by the millions of gods who saidHowever Blessed One someone who had his head cut off would be unable to surviveDivine princes Can you not understand the transcendent perfection of wisdomBecause your own failings and others failings act as a spur to disenchantmentThe blind found their sight The deaf found their hearingThey are called those who long for the rāvakayāna and they escape from the three realmsThe reverend Upāli who was proclaimed by the Lord as the foremost of the upholders of the discipline is not his equalTo be translucent like a pure crystalSeeking the right opportunity he would never miss it just like the great ocean which is always timely they purify buddha realms  they reach the Bodhimaṇḍa  they give away material things  they overcome the kleśasbodhisattvas should think Who is scolding or reprimanding me with harsh words Who is beating me with clubs striking me with weapons and whipping meWhen suffering is exhausted one is freed from sufferingThat which is accomplished by the word buddha Is also accomplished by the words correct conductthen provided there is a majority within the saṅgha he should be suspended for refusing to acknowledge the transgressionif in that same place he were then to exhibit a diversity of mats or clothingThe yogins who meditate on this Tārā Will first experience some sufferingSome princes may wish to be promoted to a higher rankBhikṣus in the northwestern direction there is the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha named Tamālapatracandanagandhābhijña andSome sangThe deva Sukuṇḍala then asked himIn the past for billions of eons You cultivated patience as the basis for attaining awakeningThe five kinds of gems symbolize the five buddha bodiesand at that time he perfectly adorned the entire road in between Vulture Peak Mountain and the great city of RājagṛhaIn order that these sentient beings who over a long period of time have fallen under the sway of evil associatesThis path is incapable of eradicating the continuation of birth old age and death in the futureHaving shown such a miracle Vimalakīrti saidThose that streamed downwards proceeded to the hell realms of SañjīvaThat which resembles a butter lamp Is taught to be the sign of ha for deathThey will depend upon their perception They will dwell in craving and desireWhen that night had passed and King Jñānabala awoke from his sleep he entered his harem and he described the dream to his harem sayingBodhisattvas aware of beings who are wild and can hardly be trained will never grow tired of themSimilarly they make assumptions that ethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration and wisdom are theirsThe Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas took away the maidensno knowing them and no making them knownThose who inhale that persons breath whether in love or in anger will become irreversible bodhisattvasNo tathāgata can see the body of his true nature let alone Samantabhadra or other bodhisattvasthe nāgas thrice felt fiery sand fall from the heavens upon themWith birth comes old age and an aged person will dieMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see sentient beings debased and lacking the five extrasensory powersThe buddhas Vajrasattva and so forthSimilarly those who cultivate the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of sights as empty or not empty constitutes a bodhisattvaDivine son understanding this state where phenomena are utterly beyond formation is awakeningThis was the seventh omenThe master will become the slave of a woman And kings will turn into servantsand he then ceases to fire the subsequent arrows far into the skyKnowing too the deeds of Māra that have arisen and occurredIt is the illumination of causes It is the nondissipation of the results of karmaIn many millions of eons you are difficult to findconchIt will be adorned by many flowersReifying what does not exist they think I am attached I am averse I am perplexedMoreover nanda the stock of merit of those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who commit this transcendent perfection of wisdom to writing or have it committed to writing and then honor venerate respect and make offerings to this scripture with flowers ribbons and so forth as well as with diverse musical sounds is equal to that of those who honor venerate respect and make offerings with flowers ribbons and so forth as well as with diverse musical sounds to the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas of the world systems of the ten directions and four times numerous as the sands of the River Gangesyou have not accomplished what needs to be accomplishedHaving entered homelessness he possessed Read and understood this samādhiFrom these formations arises consciousness which is sixfoldFollow their example and remain in the forest You who have perfect discipline do not leave Kauśika in this regard what one might ask is this transcendent perfection of wisdomimprisoning them or taking their livesThey were free of pride vanity haughtiness aggression arrogance miserliness selfishness possessiveness fixation attachment grasping oblivion craving and longingMy eyeballs appeared like stars in a sunken wellnanda said the Blessed Oneand are never separated from the mind that knows all things will possess the immeasurable aggregate of ethical disciplinegood in the middle and good in the end that has a good meaning that has good wordsIt contains vast jewels and light rays And therefore it is called vast They will not degenerate from the transcendent perfection of wisdom omniscience and so forthYour Majesty master of the earth good lord I pray that you hear meThey discern that physical forms are pure and do not focus on themThe nonperception of dharmas is to have no abodeThey practice the transcendent perfection of generosity and they also encourage others to assume the transcendent perfection of generosityThey gathered like clouds from the four directions Roaring and raining down bolts of lightning iron balls Swords spears sharp axes and poisoned arrowsHaving prepared the ship of insight I shall deliver sentient beings beyond the ocean of cyclic existenceHe may follow the ways of the weak the ugly and the wretched yet he is beautiful to look upon and his body is like that of Nārāyaṇaand purification will occur and defilement will disappearYou previously accumulated virtuous actionsUndiscovered by any other exponentThey discern that physical forms are without aspirations and do not focus on themIt has no striving or giving upblazing with energy to conquer the host of demons Those with foolish minds will reject my Dharma And having rejected it they will go to the lower realmspacify all craving for ignoble qualities and so forthHaving thus accepted it he then spoke in verse to the great king DhṛtarāṣṭraHe greeted me and I then addressed himthis is feelingnanda in order to truly accomplish the highest complete enlightenmentto engender wholesome qualities that have not yet come aboutwhere he gave instruction to five hundred young brahmins in the reciting of mantrasSenior Subhūti is it then the case that those things are indeed nonarising that the act of inspiration is also nonarising that those statements are also nonarising and that those comments of yours commencing therefrom are also nonarisingāriputra the man was very strong and had very strong armsIndeed all the world systems of the ten directions are similar to the eastern directionThey do not maintain discipline out of fear of and to seek a refuge from the world of the Lord of Deathit is owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena and to the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities that the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are nonexistent Howeverand the highest vision of wisdomI pledged to awaken to buddhahood so that I could lead others to buddhahood as wellGreat King a great being like this does not sleep longThe more those eminently powerful gods endowed with great occult powerAnd having heard it remembers that renowned name They will quickly attain this samādhi the soundbaseIn the same vein it does not measure all those other attributes up to and including buddhahood nor does it not measure themthe other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas do not apprehend the limit of past timeShe will recollect her past lives and attain unimpeded eloquence and retentionThe venerable nanda then said to the Blessed OneThe buddha who has entered nirvāṇa The muni Prabhūtaratna alsoIt is by means of this illumination that great bodhisattva beings don the armor of the transcendent perfection of generosity and of the other attributes up to and including the buddha bodyThey are learned in singing and playing musical instruments And in artistic skillsAnd still Mañjuśrī according to whether sentient beings are low middling or highMañjuśrī a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattvaSome a handspan tall some a cubit And some two cubits wandering aroundwhenever they do not engage with the notions that physical forms are pure or that they are impureAnd at that inconceivable summit They will know no doubt He stretched out his hand like a lightning bolt striking from the skyOrnament the gates of this excellent cityMay you be protected by all deities And may you return with great profitHe ripened innumerable countless beings for the highest complete enlightenmentDoes a phenomenon engage in afflicted acts with respect to another phenomenonThe Blessed One repliedMahauṣadhi let us compare consciousness to the formless and invisible wind element The wind element stays on mountain tops butson of noble family in accordance with their merit he will stand before those sentient beings as an ordinary personSubhūti There is no possibility and no chance for that to happenChildren of noble family none of the dharmas are dharmasHomage to the Bhagavān MañjuśrīkumārabhūtaHe had a stride that destroys all lower realms and all miserable existences a stride that brings happiness to all beingsThe Bhagavān then recited these versesseven hundred lakes seven great dreams seven hundred dreamsnor do they ripen on the inner elements of water fire or windand the utterly unbornMonk quick get up and do as I tell you Or I will cut you right away like a bamboo twig or dūrvā grassTherefore consciousness and the other aggregates are nonexistent while being inconceivable equal to the unequaled and so forthEven with everyone making great effort the carts would move no fartherYoung man therefore if bodhisattva mahāsattvasTheir high resolve as hard as diamond unbreakable in their faith in the Buddha Dharma and SaṅghaAnother young man is that bodhisattva mahāsattvas are frightened of the three realmsReverend Saṅgharakṣita shall we travel under our own miraculous powers or under your miraculous powersPadmaśrīgarbha these two holy beings have attained the illusory absorptionYouthful Mañjuśrī ripened them and this Dharma teaching on the indivisible nature of the realm of phenomena has ripened themHe had the body of a thusgone one bedecked like the king of sal treesits hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvasWhen I saw a certain monk I gave rise to longing desireIn each of their realmsit is because they have acquired the mnemonic incantations that enhance retentionand many jewels adorn her bodyNoble son you may wonder about the character of the bodhisattvas expertise with respect to unequaled insightI will definitely practice generosity by offering my feetall those rākṣasīs came to where the Bhagavān wasOn arriving he wished King Bimbisāra success and long lifethe intrinsic defining characteristic of formative predispositions which is conditioningThey give freedom from fear to those who are afraid They constantly bring relief to those who are fearfulSo much benefit for living beings could not be accomplished in the universe Sarvagandhasugandhā even in one hundred thousand eonsYour Majesty the young prince is not in the ladies apartmentsYou displayed such discipline many timesAjita if someone who hears enters follows and comprehends this Dharma teaching that teaches the lifespan of the Tathāgata will generate a supremely incalculable accumulation of merit that leads to the wisdom of buddhahoodThe four miraculous gods are now giving me These four wellformed alms bowlsThey should then make an image of Vajradhara in the color of a reed It should be adorned with every ornamentBhagavat I pray that you give me a prophecywhenever they do not engage with the notions that physical forms are imbued with happiness or that they are imbued with sufferingThey will not degenerate from emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessnessthe gateways to liberationI shall cause them to sit at the seat of awakening so that they can fully awaken to unexcelled and complete buddhahoodIt may be possible to count the inhalations and exhalations Of all the beings that are in this buddha realmLike the head of a viper they are dangerous to touchHundreds of thousands of censers made from precious materials and containing priceless incense moved around by themselvesSo it is that the purity of conditioned phenomena and the purity of unconditioned phenomena are indivisibleMaitreya the Buddha has prophesied that only one more birth stands between you and unexcelled perfect enlightenment They achieve and maintain the second meditative concentration where there is an intense inner clarity free from both ideation and scrutiny the absence of ideation and scrutiny being due to onepointed mental focus while the joy and bliss that arise from meditative stability are presentattributes that are virtuous and nonvirtuous specified and nonspecified contaminated and uncontaminated mundane and supramundane and conditioned and unconditionedIf the Blessed One was about to foretell rebirth as a human the rays of light would fade into his kneeThey remain in the family of the buddhas And are not captured by form So it is Subhūti that the tathāgatas honor venerate respect and make offerings to this very sacred doctrine of the transcendent perfection of wisdomThus arises this mass of nothing but sufferingThat is why they do not turn backHow should he who wishes to eliminate afflictions apply himselfLike the moon in a cloudless sky Studded with stars You are adorned with sublime characteristics In the midst of a śrāvaka assemblyThis being the case Venerable Lord how would great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beingsand in the same vein the transcendence of all other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathWhen they saw the Rishi the rishis were overjoyed And they bowed down to the feet of the king of sagesIf you ask in what way they do not become fixated āradvatīputraBhikṣus you should train in this wayIt is a happy life that results in the sweet nectar of immortalityShe prepared it adding various excellent flavorsAt that time the Tathāgata Arhat Genuinely Perfect Buddha Dīpaṃkara foreordainedInvestigating the absence of self is a gateway to the light of the DharmaNoble son giving what is beneficial is generosity with the Dharmabeing inclined toward the DharmaThat is why filth emerges from it and it is therefore disagreeableThe virtuous and nonvirtuous actions performed and accumulatedOn which day of the month and at which hourSubhūti those great bodhisattva beings who formerly worked toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment who have maintained purity of conduct in the presence of the genuinely perfect buddhas of the pastin that case they would undervalue the transcendent perfection of wisdom and keep far away from itThis concludes the chapter on mantras the fifth in the glorious Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa tantra called The Sole Hero Chapter  Completion StageSimilarly the emptiness of the other sensory attributes up to and including feelings due to sensory contact that is mentally compounded will not attain emancipation from the three world systems andDivine son ultimately all phenomena are without disturbing emotions unborn and unceasingAgain Subhūti there are great bodhisattva beings who can indeed see with their eyes of flesh across an entire chiliocosmthe inconceivable pure places where bodhisattvas take birth as wandering beingsThe guides have always praised patience Attaining enlightenment is not difficult for those who practice patience similarly I must not establish that many in all those fruits up to and including individual enlightenmentWholly engaged in the MantrayānaOnce they examine things in this wayI will eat with the saṅghahe witnessed the two holy beings prostrating before all those blessed buddhasfive hundred laypeopleIgnite a blazing fire Scatter the water of the burnt offering Above below and throughout the four directionsHe may follow the ways of those of lowly birth yet through his accumulation of the stores of merit and wisdom he is born in the family of the tathāgatasthat they are not a self that they are empty that they are signless that they are without aspirations that they are calm that they are void that they are purified that they are nonarising that they are unceasing and that they are nonentitiesFinally five thousand celestial maidens singing and playing divine instruments came before the Bodhisattvas mother and asked how the birth was and whether she was wearythese are specified those are nonspecified these are contaminated those are uncontaminated these are mundane those are supramundane these are conditioned phenomena those are unconditioned phenomenaJust as when during a famine Someone who finds good foodnanda you only need to act as a mere circumstanceJust in the same way reverend āriputra the bodhisattva reincarnates voluntarily in the impure buddhafields in order to purify the living beings in order to make the light of wisdom shine and in order to clear away the darknessNonarising nonabiding nondisintegration and nontransformation with respect to all thingsThese will be reborn among the gods and humans in the world systems of the happy exalted realmsThrough the transcendent perfection of meditative stability they will transcend the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhasshould all be known Bhaiṣajyarāja to be close to the highest complete enlightenmentThe minds of sixty great bodhisattva beings were also liberated from contaminants without further grasping that would lead to subsequent rebirthand whether they go to a temple a house a forest a street a town or the countrysideAnd why monks did the Bodhisattva examine the country of his birthThey respectfully scattered a multitude of various Flower petals upon the supreme individual Make offerings praises and requestsHas been proclaimed as Hatred VajrīWith the thumb and ring fingerSubhūti there is nothing at all that would apart from the real nature abide in the real nature that would abiding in the real nature attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and that would abiding in the real nature teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beingsThis occurred even as far down as the great Avīci hellThis Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta has also previously seen this kind of sign from past tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhasFrom the places where the bhikṣus head ears feet hands and eyes had been cut many quintillions of light rays shone forthYour palaces are like the palace of Vaijayanta wherein one finds the peace of true Dharma and all ones worries are goneWithin the perfect peace of great bliss They abide in a form that is in all ways delightfulthe brahmā ikhin the brahmā JyotiṣprabhaThey offer them gardens temples and parks as well as in a timely manner wealth grains treasuries and storehousesThey are being steadfast in the mind of awakening having cleansed the mind of awakening being in control of the senses having entered the path having the courage to carry the great load never tiring in the pursuit of others welfare pure livelihood avoiding wealth acquired through pretense or flattery being free from deceit and being more honest than the honest Noble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities have trained wellmay I dry up the entire ocean of thirst associated with the afflictions of all beingsand in the same vein they apprehend the other sense objects up to and including mental phenomena and develop a view of them in an apprehending mannerMonks therefore abandon wholly negative and mixed actions and seek wholly positive actionsSome attack with weapons Others manifest as disembodiedWhen seized by Skanda A child moves by hopping skandaeven and well proportioned and of excellent designThe characteristic of phenomena Is the same as that of space and skySome palaces were made of pearls others of diamondsThey are the inconceivably numerous accumulations of sūtras concerning the compositeāradvatīputra In the same vein do you think that anything other than the real nature of the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death constitutes a bodhisattvaSimilarly all things are neither fettered nor liberated because all things are void because they are nonarising because they are unceasing because they are not fettered and because they are not boundHow can I attain the enlightenment of buddhahoodthe bodhisattvas and the great hearers looked toward this Sahā world and saw the ThusGone worthy completely perfect Buddha ākyamuni surrounded by the gathering of bodhisattvas and attended upon by the saṅgha of hearersKing please pay heedThese are good physical actionsTherefore Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomHe whom the King of Aṅga left to defend the city of Campāis reaping the roots of virtueShe can live wherever she wishes on the strength of her vow to develop living beingsWith many kinds of excellent songs and dance With amusements and performances made with a pure mindThen the precious stūpa also saidJust as Dīpaṃkara granted a prophecy to you Grant me likewise a direct prophecy in this world xxviWhen one puts her two feet Firmly on ones shouldersThis was the first chapter in the Great Sovereign Tantra of SiddhaikavīraSubhūti it is so It is just as you have saidAt that moment however eighty thousand beings stood up fell at the feet of the Blessed One and saidLiberative art not integrated with wisdom is bondage but liberative art integrated with wisdom is liberationSuch is the bodhisattvas perfect giving of material thingsSimilarly it should be applied to all the meditative stabilitiesto which they applied themselves with diligence effort and exertionThe bodhisattva mahāsattva Liberator from Fear then hovered in space at the height of a palm tree and asked the monkand if there is no mirror no reflection occurs eitherAbandon all illusions and arise And teach the Dharma in the city of Ratnāvatī viiand in order to eliminate the sicknesses of the passions of all living beings you should conceive the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenmentExpertise concerning the aggregates is a gateway to the light of the Dharma for it leads to thorough understanding of sufferingDo not entertain the notion that he is a mere householderI have already discarded a beautiful kingdomThis noble man is going to turn the wheel of the Dharma He is going to beat the drum of the DharmaThe strength of ten yellow elephants is the same as the strength of one red elephantSimilarly one who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in magical displays mirages echoes optical aberrations and in phantom emanations of the tathāgatas If it is true that this phenomenon That is called hand does not existHe would dedicate his awakening to all beingsSeven mustard seeds is one barley grainAt that time I heard Tathāgata Viśvabhū describe the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvarasays It is excellent Excellent the scent of the blue lotus will come from their mouthAnd afterward start the ritesVenerable Lord As I understand the meaning of the words spoken by the LordThe youth Candraprabha was overjoyed And in the presence of the Buddha he said these wordsHis mind was filled with thoughts about the nature of impermanence suffering and repulsiveness He was trained in the applications of mindfulness the thorough relinquishments the bases of miraculous power the faculties the powers the branches of awakening the path the four truths of the noble ones and all the principles conducive to awakeningSimilarly consciousness and so forth are themselves the expanse of reality andAnd gradually to him will come The attainment of bhūmis and so forthThis is the enlightenment of the tathāgatas Young man have faith in my wordsthe going forth ordination and monkhood in the wellproclaimed Dharma and Vinayaand if though you are in the presence of all things you are free of any notion of all thingsThe Bhagavān was accompanied on his righthand side by Brahmāto the one who is like a wishfulfilling jewel to the one who protects the treasure of the DharmaAs soon as they see me they will attain samādhiIn like manner why do you say that the designation of fundamental ignorance as permanent or impermanent does not constitute a bodhisattvaIt must be due to my many evil deeds in the pastAwakening Mañjuśrī is without striving or giving anything upNārāyaṇa wherever bodhisattvas livewhether in towns or in monasteriesif they abide by these four they can be aptly described as dwelling in the abodesthe bodhisattva great being Mahāmati the bodhisattva great being AnantapratibhānaEnjoin him to dwell in tranquilityOut of deep devotion the householder had a monastery erected for the monkNow Māra asked his sonsthey say Oh a great cloud is pouring down waterāradvatīputra The purity of phenomena is illuminating due to absolute purityIn what way you may wonder are bodhisattvas free of tremblingHe attained decisive wisdom in order to sustain the foolishThe soldiers were able to transform their faces in a trillion waysand this world system will then be called Endowed with Infinite DiscoursesThere will be no women belonging to Māras factionSon of noble family through these nine instructions will one attain the absorption that encapsulates all meritAt that time the Guide of the World teaches nothing Other than the āryas truth of sufferingFinally if that merit were multiplied by inexpressibly many hexillions of inexpressibly many times then that would bring forth the voice of a thusgone buddha endowed with sixty thousand aspectsShe moved through the sky above An assembly of great men prostrated to herThey will never be blind hunchbacked crippled or mutilated They will not have impaired visionThe Bodhisattva himself however caused all the displays that ornamented all the seats of awakening of the pastwill decide to come there to guard protect and offer sanctuary to those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritageChildren of the lords of men were revealed Who were residing and practicing in the mountainsAnd they have no doubt in any of the Dharma And continuously remain in endless wisdom This beautiful light glows brilliantly bringing physical blissThen the Tathāgata teaches them the DharmaBhikṣus do not be afraid of my nirvāṇa There will come a buddha after me It will come to rest therein and it will do so owing to nondualityand that I may go on to abandon all disturbing emotions and actualize arhatshiphe told me that he did not have money to pay the fareIn his buddhafield the eight unfree states will not existand they should also be attentive to the other notions up to and including the notion that these are extremely calamitousIn that case āradvatīputra do you think that there is affliction or purification with respect to that illusionVimalatejā saw the great power with which the Buddha taught the Dharma In his magnificent beauty the Buddha seemed like the lofty king of mountains in the midst of the ocean and Vimalatejā could not stop looking at himThe bhikṣu was not afraid when he saw their weaponsāradvatīputra do you think that these five psychophysical aggregates can train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom and attain emancipation in omniscienceSimilarly you should not misconstrue this unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as the applications of mindfulness the correct exertions the supports for miraculous ability the faculties the powers the branches of enlightenment and the pathsO Royal Sage you were the moonlike hero Satyavardhana The king Subhāṣitagaveṣin and the gentle SumatiMañjuśrī a bodhisattva who is skilled in this Dharma discourse subjugates and outshines in virtue all opponentsand will develop the aspiration for the highest complete enlightenmentSeeing this some bodhisattvas asked each other Who created such displaysWhy Because among the beings of that realm desire anger and dullness are rifeMyriad kinds of lotus anther seats emerged in front and around it On the lotus the bodhisattva mahāsattva kāśagarbha appeared sitting crossleggedHe will be adopted by many millions of buddhas And he will make supreme offerings to those guides And all those parks were adorned With fresh flowers and fruit like massed clouds Monk as all phenomena are undisturbed by discursive thought they are unelaboratedSince a tathāgata is hard to find and it is difficult to encounter the excellent Dharmaand that is the nature of all phenomenaThe inquirer asks Are your parents still living If the ordinand says his parents are still livingDay and night they do not follow the discipline And they do not abhor the path of bad actions You have been the king of Kāśi Pradānasūra Ratnacūḍa and āntagaThere is the meditative stability named Taintless Modality Devoid of ImpuritiesIndeed all phenomena are nonarising unceasing empty unmoving vacuous without a self nonoriginated uncreated unconditioned and without creator or actorVenerable Lord how is this transcendent perfection of wisdom instructive because physical forms are unseenAs an analogy consider someone who puts on new clothesNoble son bodhisattvas are free of the stinginess that serves as the cause condition and basis for taking birth as a starving spirit and so they are free from the unbearably savage pain of a starving spiritOne should invite the disciple crowned with the seal of CaṇḍamahāroṣaṇaSenior Subhūti then replied to akra mighty lord of the gods the branch of enlightenment that entails correct perseveranceFrom within their chariots they saw the bhikṣu Whose body had the shining splendor of Mount Meru Ask me when we are among the saṅgha and that will prove the time to answer your questionAlso Subhūti you asked who will attain emancipation by means of this vehicleThe relics of the Jina are beautified By the clear sound of bells The beauty of silken streamers And bells shaken by the breezeThe Jina with this single light ray from his visage Has made this world and its devas blossom Fearing the futureWhy is thatThis shows that the bodhisattva mahāsattva kāśagarbha possesses inconceivable qualitiesGambhīraghoṣasvaranāditaI ask that the venerable saṅgha grant me ordinationthere is a world named RatnaviśuddhāOne who is in accordance with the virtue of the secret initiation Is in harmony with virtue a noviceSome proclaim the garlands of qualities of the son of the BlissGone OnesWhere do sensation notions formative factors and consciousness come fromI then pondered what was needed for name and form to occur and what conditions contribute to the occurrence of name and formAbiding in the transcendent perfection of perseverance great bodhisattva beings will perfect all the attributes of the buddhas and attain omniscienceSimilarly emptiness is not something other than the ears the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty nor are the mental faculty and the aforementioned sense organs something other than emptinessThis sūtra Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm should then be utteredtThey will not fall away from hearing the Dharma as they put the teachings into practice assiduously just as they have learned themThey never experience anguish They reach the state of higher blissThey are never apart from pronouncements of emptiness signlessness wishlessness the unconditioned nonoccurrence nonorigination and nonsubstantialityWhen they engage in the conditioning of physical forms and so on up to the conditioning of consciousness I say they will not be released from subsequent rebirths they will be agitated by aging and so on and they will not be released from suffering and so forthListen venerable It is time for you to be truthful It is time to come forthThat is to say they do not eat out of yearning craving or attachmentMay I always be wellThe moon and the sun may fall to the earth But the Jinas speech will never change The lords of jinas were not seen And the ten directions were blindIn the same vein why do you say that the remaining designations made with respect to fundamental ignorance up to and including its designation as entity or nonentity do not constitute a bodhisattvaNoble son the Blessed One continuedThese childish beings fall like a blind person tumbling into a deep abyssThis is the perfection of knowledgeIt is preserving the teachingthen the evil Māra knowing that they are rejoicing might sayCalumny Vajrī vajra yoginīBhikṣus the Mahābrahmā named Adhimātrakāruṇika spoke these verses to the great assembly of BrahmāsAs he was free of pride vanity haughtiness strife hostility envy miserliness selfishness possessiveness attachment suffering unhappiness and ignorance he was endowed with meritany notion of the world system of form any notion of the world system of formlessnessThis is a fitting place for the Bodhisattva to be conceivedwhy should I goIn what way you may wonder are bodhisattvas indifferent to harm and assistanceplaces that are free from attacks by beasts of preyThis transcendent perfection of wisdom does not attain and does not apprehend even omniscienceThey turned the irreversible wheel of the DharmaBhikṣus in that way the buddha realm of that bhagavān will have inconceivable qualitiesVenerable Lord How wonderful it is that this profound sacred doctrine is neither diminished even when it is not explained nor is it enhanced even when it is explainedSimilarly owing to their utter purity they do consider the nonarising of the applications of mindfulnessVenerable Lord is this cultivation of the transcendent perfection of wisdom the noncultivation of all thingsBehind one should visualize Candraprabha astride a moon disk and holding a blue lotusThey are skilled in the knowledge of the detailed categories of letters and wordswho possesses the strength of the ten strengths whose good name has spread in the ten directionsI practice the spiritual lifeWonderful The Blessed One has taught these ten Dharma ways that are supreme and satisfy the profusion of sentient beingsWill you commit yourself to subsisting on such resources The newly ordained monk responds I will so commit myselfWhat is the elimination of this sicknessNoble Saṅgharakṣita though the Blessed Ones sūtrasIt occurred to me thenwhich fills the treasury of the DharmaThese bodhisattvas stand alongside and will stand alongside the lord buddhas but those do not and will notThrough their abundant contemplation of emptiness they investigate the nature of whatever their minds pursue and have faith in realizing it all to be emptyHe appeared to be surrounded by servants yet lived in solitudeThus he is called the most precious gemAt that time the Buddha taught this topic in detail by reciting these versesTherefore Mother it is now appropriate for you to let us goThen he looked back into the Avīci hellthe real nature of physical forms and the real nature of omniscience are one and the same real natureThis concludes the twentysecond chapter on perfect and complete awakeningHow does the bodhisattva follow the wrong wayUltimately the Dharma is not about generating attachment nor is it about bringing attachment to an endSimilarly although the light rays entered the Blessed Ones mouth his mouth could not be seen to be either open or closedYoung man the marvelous things that I have done And the hardships I have undergone for many hundreds of eonsOh whatever kind of utensilwho have entered upon unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentwhere before long he would become the Buddha attaining perfect complete and unexcelled awakeningBodhisattvas should be as immovable as the central mountainSimilarly the other attributes up to and including the ten powers of the tathāgatas

generosity by giving away their spouses sons and daughtersWhen Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara comes a profusion of wishgranting trees appearswashed their feet and went hurting and upset to see the Blessed Oneand on each of those mountains live eighty thousand rishisThe Bodhisattva explained A league contains  billion nonillions  quintillions  billion  million  thousand smallest particlesThey will frown and then reject this yāna Listen to what is the dreadful ripening of their karmaWhat are the six senses They consist of the eyes ears nose tongue body and mindBhagavān I have come before the bhagavān tathāgata ākyamuni in order to listen to this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma in this Sahā world realmHowever he did not see such a girlThen the gods inhabiting the world system of desire and those inhabiting the world system of form said to the Blessed OneWith his following of twenty thousand monks he lived and stayed in the Deer Park of ṣipatana near Vārāṇasīand having turned them away encourage them toward the six attributes of the transcendent perfectionsThey are my sisters boysThey have been born as humans They are good humans They are supreme humansYet when faced with such efforts to make them lose faith and to ridicule them bodhisattvas will thinkWhen not associated with misguided knowledge they are irreproachableThere are many hundreds of thousands of bathing poolsApproach the lord of trees and sit there without fearthose living in the realm of the lord of deathWhen you left my bed where did you goHe knows the body is like an illusion and chaff As are the ears eyes nose and tongue Birth provides the causal condition for old age and death lamentation pain despair and torment Such is how this massive heap of pure anguish

consciousness are neither fettered nor liberatedHaving transformed them into one with his miraculous powers The teacher took into his hand Ambrosialike medicines With that supreme divine vesselEndowed with such subtle intellect they understand the meaning of what the buddhas and bodhisattvas teach simply by hearing itthe purity of all other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are indivisibleIf they think I am a bodhisattva This is a bodhisattvaand a flowing mane of the complete perfection of the thirtyseven branches of awakening along with awareness and wisdomSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who train accordingly will manifestly attain the transcendent perfection of all trainingsWhen King ūradatta heard the words of the devas in the skySubhūti it is because they well realize the defining characteristic of the sacred doctrine to be that the fruit of nonvirtuous actions is unpleasant andIt must be fearlessthey made offerings to the stūpa which contained the relics of the TathāgataIn this way they engage in abundant contemplation and are diligent in their trainingThey are fixated on desire hatred and delusionwhere he lay down on his bedLiving beings are afflicted by the passions of thoughtWhat is the level It is the tenfold level of the absence of aspirationIt teaches the indivisible nature of phenomena and is a gateway to the limit of reality of all phenomenaThen the Licchavi Vimalakīrti thought to himselfViśeṣamatiand in the same vein they themselves should cultivate all the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathwhy

virtueEmptiness is indeed the noble eightfold pathThen some people arrive there circling around the corpse andexcept as liberationMy birth motherVenerable Lord How do great bodhisattva beings after abiding in the transcendent perfection of perseverance acquire the transcendent perfection of wisdomEven a hundred axes may failHe remained in the nature of the Dharma And was unaffected by good or bad qualitiesThey will go from one pore to anotherConsider noble son how a small spark cannot be ignored because of its ability to burnBlessed One we will cause despair in anyone who hears this Dharma teaching but does not revere it and who fails to worship those who teach itVenerable Lord Those who would not rejoice in sentient beings who set their mind on enlightenment are on the side of demonic forcesand see with their divine eyeand I will provide recompense from my own stores and treasuryAfter he passes into nirvāṇa that bodhisattva will uphold his sacred Dharma and propagate it so that the sacred Dharma may remain for longThat magnificence caused this earth to shake And the beings in this supreme city were overjoyed They offered the BlissGone One manifold and vast offerings and praised his qualities Then they made this request to his compassionate beingNoble ones I declare to you I proclaim to youYou will become possessed of perfect happiness of mindBut still my Lord you alone are the supreme witness in the worlds of gods and humans and the supreme authorityThey do not forget anything that they have obtained and teach the Dharma to beings knowing what will be beneficial for any one personThus is the causal relation in outer dependent arising to be seenThe six remembrances are a cause of purificationIt is born from sciences and superknowledgesWith intelligence and mindfulness restored they returned to their homesLikewise the great medicinal plants of the Dharma that pacify all the diseases of the afflictions are within the bodhisattvas and emerge from themThe many bhikṣus who were desirous and greedy Yearned for acquisitions held the view of objective realitythey heal sentient beings through their generosity discipline patience diligence concentration and insight Moreover sentient beings are also healed by seeing and hearing bodhisattvas by getting a taste of their qualities and by venerating themBecame irreversible in their progress in all their lifetimes And

who practice the transcendent perfection of toleranceThe calls of these five hundred men could be heard half a league awayThey do not apprehend the sensory elementsTherefore the wise and the realized Are always aspiring to this samādhiVenerable Lord So it is that the transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely void andthe fruition of streamenterer the fruition of oncereturnerI had also

distracted that is not so when it is free of afflictionsWe thought There is the attainment of buddhahood through the wisdom of the tathāgatas but we are satisfied with a limited wisdomBut when the inner earth element is not deficient and likewise the elements of water fire wind space and consciousness are not deficient then from the coming together of all these factors the body formsAlso those

write it down and memorize itThe Thusgone One knows that all phenomena are unestablished in the ultimate senseHe is dedicated to holding the Dharma in many ways within my teachingWhen the scouts returned they reported There is no threat whatsoeverāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of the sensory element of the eyes the sensory element of sights and the sensory element of visual consciousness constitute a bodhisattvaNoble son you may wonder about the nature of the bodhisattvas discipline that is purified of the three spheresBodhisattvas teach the Dharma for the accomplishment of the qualities of buddhahood yet they observe neither the qualities of buddhahood nor any accomplishmentSimilarly the understanding of all phenomena and the understanding of omniscience are uncreated undestroyed and unconditionedWhen they sweep and repair such sacred objects they dedicate their work so that sentient beings may be free from repulsive behavior and instead take up beautiful and excellent activitiesJust as the autumn season which is white and bright becomes of yellow hue so too your senses Lord Gautama are bright and your round face is perfectly pureThey will not be patient in their own country yet impatient abroad nor will they be patient abroad and yet not at homeSimilarly all famines conflicts and civil wars will be interrupted alleviated and become nonexistentWithin the vast teaching of the one with ten strengthsdo not harbor doubt or hesitation with regard to the doctrine when the doctrine of the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas is being taughtQuick Lord of Men dispense that nectarBut the bhagavān tathāgata ākyamuni said to the bodhisattva Prajñākūṭathe three gateways to liberationUpatiṣya and Kolita then went to Gośālīputra the wanderer and askedMonks at the time of the Bodhisattvas birth a great show of generosity was instigatedSaying Oh Behold the beauty of that human womanThey will all pass into nirvāṇa at the same timeForm itself is empty of the essence of formMay I provide relief to those who have not found relief And guide them on the path to the transcendence of sufferingWhen the Bodhisattva had finished distributing all the gifts she went up to him and with a smile on her face said to himHe made a request to those bodhisattva mahāsattvas that he mightReverend the noble monks allowing the going forth of invalid sons of noble familiesThis completes the twentyfourth chapter from the Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled Initial EngagementO gods this is the profundity of all things in which the habitual ideas of duality do not at all existAnd likewise years and intermediate eonsThere were also many trees made of coral many blossomcovered treesThe thirst of someone who pursues desires increases evermore Just like one feels after drinking salty waterThis is what Māra said When addressing the Bodhisattvawhen the householder saw him and saidIs some misfortune to befall the princeknowing that the entirety of his emanations was assembled beings in the meditation of compassiona supreme human a great sageup to five hundred attendants of the Vajra family will always follow behind without interruption in order to guard and protect themThese sentient beings pointed their fingers at the Bodhisattva and asked each otherTranslated and edited by the Indian scholar Surendrabodhi and the principal editor and translator Venerable Yeshe DHow are their perfections of powerTo those who are the offspring of the sugatasShould exercise diligence regardless of risks to their lives And always follow young man my example With a loving mind they give Their portion to all beingsUpananda thought My Why I dont recognize this retired devotee as one of our instructorsfor it leads one to realize that all words sounds language and speech are like echoesWhen the drawing is complete insert it in the heart center Summon usher and so forth then burnin the worlds of gods demons Brahmā mendicants priests humans kiṃnaras and mahoragasBy offering a homa with flowers of the palāśa tree  times using as an option firewood from the same treeAll of the oceans in this buddha realm At that time all became landAs indicated above in the context of the psychophysical aggregates the same refrain should be applied extensively to all those other phenomenological categoriesNoble son replied the Blessed One let me provide an analogy so that you may understand this pointTherefore I will definitely practice generosity by offering beveragesand attracted a following with the DharmaIt is being wise concerning the āyatanas It is making ones higher cognitions manifest to othersYoung man those are the qualities and benefits that bodhisattvas who know the nature of all phenomena will haveThe extensive enjoyment of sensual desires does not make wise people arrogant  tTherefore I will definitely practice generosity by relinquishing male and female slaves staff and workersLike the stainless moon free from cloudsYoung man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have completely pure conduct of the mind avoid all unfavorable conditionsHe will have inconceivable miraculous powersthey do not become covetousYou are also weary from austerities and diligently contemplating the DharmaThey will hear the voices of men and women And also the voices of boys and girlsDo not listen to them do not read them and do not teach them to othersThings that are without defining characteristics cannot acquire things that are without defining characteristics the total consummation of the fire elementthey acknowledge such individuals with respect and veneration in body and mindThe lord buddhas will proclaim their names and clans while teaching the sacred doctrine and uttering aphorismsThey all could leave with joy proclaiming songs of praiseFurthermore Maitreya if bodhisattvas possess nine qualities they will abandon all evil rebirths and not fall into the clutches of sinful associates but swiftly realize supreme perfect enlightenment and become a buddhaWhen knowledge and no knowledge have been examined That is what is said to be the knowledge of buddhahood  they do not disparage the buddhas and  they possess the DharmaSimilarly the emptiness of feelings the emptiness of perceptions the emptiness of formative predispositionswho grope in darkness because of extreme dullnessAnd this is known By all the beings in the ten directions The Bodhisattva then remarked Charioteer how sad Childish and ignorant beings do not see old age Proud and crazed as they are in youthDeprived of food and drink Other dreadful beings Search about for the best sense pleasures And look everywhere throughout the four directionsSenior Pūrṇa that is the case Physical forms are neither fettered nor liberatedThey encourage secure and establish those beings in the transcendent perfection of generosityThe mendicant will receive donationsSimilarly they will instantly smell The aroma of perfumed sesame oil And the various aromas of fruits and flowers And know the particular places those aromas areHe who has mastered those minds that are difficult to tame And whose own mind is free from the snares of Māra For seeing him and hearing him is not without benefitnot being possessiveCreate beautiful images of the Buddha Perfectly made of precious materialsVenerable Lord Since all things are dreamlike nonentities with the essential nature of nonentity and empty of intrinsic defining characteristicsThose women who are pregnant And whether it is a boy or a girl Carried inside their weary bodiessaw the entire great trichiliocosm He saw all the cities towns estates kingdoms royal cities and lands as well as all gods and humansNor find a seat In the company of the bhūta assembliesMeditate upon the first syllable which is the color of IndraHe thought I have created so much bad karma Through my having Puṣpacandra killed They lead to enlightenment Countless millions of māras It is like a lamp for those in the obscuration of darknessThis is my last birthThey do not criticize in any way Another superior being who is without defilement Subhūti since all things are nonentitiesReverend Pūrṇa first concentrate yourself regard the minds of these young bhikṣus and then teach them the DharmaNo Venerable LordEven as you brought your enemy to safety you remained calmone young brahmin respondedMany bhikṣus with unrestrained senses Who covet the wives of othersTo illustrate this when a person sleeps their breathing happens spontaneouslyIt neither bestows nor withholds the transcendent perfection of generosityWhat concept did you produce toward themI cannot open the door for youthe sensory element of the ears the sensory element of soundsThe kings of horses and elephants raised their bodies The lions the kings of animals roared Thus noble son bodhisattvas are not intimidatedIf there is no seed the sprout cannot arise and so on until finally without the flower the fruit cannot ariseSubhūti this is the meditative stability known as the yawning lionSome to be converted strive for the roots of virtue that arise from offering lamps incense flowers perfume garlands salves jewel necklaces and so forth The words that describe the mode are not the mode of being The nature of phenomena is a mode of subtle meaningSubhūti great bodhisattva beings will also attain omniscienceAre protectors who lead all beings To enlightenmenthe saw a group of young monks and thoughtfacing the fire throw on seven double handfuls of water having first incanted it with the mantraIn the northwest corner Is MāmakīWhen the bodhisattvas attain These three unsurpassable patiencesHaving seen children of the buddhas such as these You too should be one who has banished doubtTherefore young man in the future Remember past declines like thatWhen he said the letter bha out came the statement The destruction of existence bhavavibhavamay I cause all beings to achieve sovereignty over the kingdom of the sacred DharmaWhen asked they reveal the indivisible nature of the realm of phenomenaThis is the ripening of good qualities Which is seen without mentationthey are to regard all things as emptiness and not to abandon any sentient beingsāriputra what are the thoughts of evil menThen Yamarāja circumambulated him three times and departedwithin each of them appeared bodhisattvas seated in crosslegged postureand they perfect the transcendent perfection of meditative stability maintaining the five acquisitive psychophysical aggregates which are like a phantom and so onSimilarly they have not conceptualized the ethical discipline which they have maintainedand I am happy with what I wearNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities take birth free of any stain of the wombWhen the Licchavi Vimalakīrti andThey will become cakravartin kings who rule the world See stainless buddhas who have minds of perfect peace perception of sufferingEven the garuḍa Suparṇi could not dislodge themOn this topic it was said Those who give the supreme giftsimilarly by practicing the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineYou know the activities of all beings You have the knowledge of all phenomenaand they will exclusively engage in conduct that is the cause of obtaining such formsIn this regard the tenderness and softness of his palms and soles means that they resemble the smooth surface of a kapok sheet or a cotton sheetthe one who has perfected knowledge and the one who has accomplished aspirationhe should carry on his fathers tradition orThe maturation of that merit produced the fine celestial chariotYoung man bodhisattva mahāsattvas will attain all these qualitiesWords spoken with ill intent cause them no disturbing emotionsThe Bhagavat gave his approval saying Noble son it is excellent that you have accomplished the task ExcellentHow are they unskilled in the transcendent perfection of wisdomA lump of kanaka flowers One should certainly spin on the top and the bottomdoes not think I am acting according to a certain objectiveand with great skillful means of primordial wisdom he will lead them to disclose their root transgressionsO kurukulle svāhāVenerable Lord The transcendent perfection of wisdom is profoundNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities are tent dwellerswere to conjure a tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddhaRelinquishing affliction while not relinquishing sentient beings it is both relinquishing and nonrelinquishingThrough practicing generosity discipline and restraint For many tens of millions of eons He attained perfect sublime awakening And therefore shines here todayFriends the body of a tathāgata is the body of Dharma born of gnosisas being imperceptible and as being wiseand that is why these omens appearWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas expertise with respect to the vehicles of the hearers and solitary buddhas consist inWhen practicing generosity by offering ornamentsHe has attained the supreme highest wisdom of skillful methods in bringing certainty in all the dharmasAnd led away all Sañjayins students Only when there was naught else to lead awayand not prone to idle or frivolous chatterSaṅgharakṣita leads an entourage of one thousand to the Buddha Along the wayand they will not construe the notions that they are unceasing that they are void and so forthJust like a low forest fire Would burn a dry hollow treethis is explained as awarenessFurthermore reverend āriputra the Dharma is without taint and free of defilementthe flavorbaseYou have immediately forgotten Whatever happened in your mothers wombA tathāgata is the true nature and that true nature is the limit of realityOn wondering Whence have I come Where have I been born What actions led to thisI wondered whom I should honor venerate respect make offerings to and rely uponA woman the sole mother of the three worlds A gentle giver of true pleasureHaving gone not very far they departed through their miraculous powers and became invisibleGreat bodhisattva mahāsattvas in numbers as limitless as the sands of the River GangesBodhisattvas should be intent solely on what is wholly virtuous in order to safeguard those beings who come for refugewill never make bodhisattvas lose faithCease their defilements and in that last life of theirs They all simultaneously attain arhathoodHow should one view this consciousnessOn hearing this verse the lad thoughtIn the same way that a lightning bolt illumines everything as it emerges from a mass of cloudsJust as when the long evenly balanced base of a basket is placed on level ground the bottom of the base entirely touches the ground in the same way the Blessed One is endowed with feet that are well positionedMañjuśrī answeredHow can they be as steadfast as a doorsill as they set their minds on omniscience itself and stay free of the wish to be a śrāvaka or solitary buddhaThey said This venerable applies himself diligently always making an effort in his recitationsThey perfect the first bodhisattva level without any longing for it arisingand bury it That will stop the woman from losing her fetusThis position is called variegatedIn the future times there will be no obstacle To his celibacy or to his life Impurities have been extinguishedVenerable Lord How do great bodhisattva beings after abiding in the transcendent perfection of generosity acquire the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationKaṇṭhaka look at the path prepared for you in the sky It is so bright and beautiful Its bejeweled ledges are ornamented in various ways And it is censed with divine incense based on supreme essencesThen Senior āradvatīputra addressed Senior Subhūti as followsHe is the one who does not forget thereforeBe evenminded toward all beings Do not have likes or dislikes in your mindAlternatively one should create things mentally If they cannot be physically obtainedtāriputra those paṇḍakas who thus entertain evil mens conceptions have the experience I am touching that and thus perceive the body with its nine orificesthis impure leaking thingas cleanThey themselves should be equipoised in the meditative absorption of the sense field of infinite space in the meditative absorption of the sense field of infinite consciousness in the meditative absorption of the sense field of nothingatall and in the meditative absorption of the sense field of neither perception nor nonperceptionthat the hour of midnight had comeRight effort is a gateway to the light of the Dharmaāradvatīputra it is in this way that great bodhisattva beings who are diligent alert and mindful after eliminating worldly covetousness and sadnessāradvatīputra that is how great bodhisattva beings should train in the transcendent perfection of wisdomThe third Dharma gate that he manifested is called putting great compassion into practice It is a disposition of never abandoning any sentient beingsWhen the time of passing away has arrived One is always separated from ones favorite possessions and loved onesNoble son tell me how will this be for the person who is tormented by the heat of summer and suffering from thirstthe sound of a great beingThe thirtyseven aspects of enlightenment the three gateways to liberationWhen a fasting lady drinks this She will gain a son with the characteristics of a kingWhen the ritual of yadakabaka Is inscribed on a piece of leadThrough the cessation of actual birth aging and death ceaseand so they will not be reborn in the world system of desire in the world system of form or the world system of formlessness through any of these meditative stabilitiesIn the same way they then achieve and maintain the mind that is endowed with compassion empathetic joy and equanimity its volition permeating the entire universeSimilarly they become equipoised in the formless absorptions up to the sense field of infinite space and up to the cessation of feelings and perceptions andThey are free of all stains in the absence of all the stains of afflictionthey do not assert the supremacy of anything at all and so they do not thinkThey were stamped with the insignia of signlessnessIf you ask why Subhūti it is because when these great bodhisattva beings practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom they do not consider and do not apprehend anything at all Since they do not apprehend they do not develop thoughts with regard to anythingNor steal anothers propertyastride a sun disk and holding a blue lotusIt also sees celestial realms made of divine jewels pleasure groves and gardens flowery earornaments lotus flowers including red lotuses celestial mansions and dense groves surrounded by frolicking divine maidensat that time young man those bodhisattva mahāsattvas easily attain the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodThe world and its devas will pay homage to those who possess the names of these two high beingsWithout selfnature or locationTherefore āriputra I shall teach that meaningWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas extraordinary diligence consist init will bring fulfillment to a multitude of beings and bring benefit and happiness to humans and devasThat merit would be greatly surpassedIn its center one should according to the enthrallmentprocedure write the name of the person to be enthralled supported by a pair of hrīḥ syllables One should draw this on birch bark or on cotton with flowers and make it into a charm that is to be worn on the upper armTo make blood flowHe is without any complexityShould train in this restraint of the body The strengths are not difficult to attain for one thus trained I was entirely celibate and only performed acts of generosityDo not be proud of maintaining correct conduct Do not become proud through listening to the DharmaAs these do not subsideHowever Kauśika when the five lower transcendent perfections starting with the transcendent perfection of generosity have been acquired through the transcendent perfection of wisdomWhat beauty he createsYoung man whoever has this practice of peace This supreme samādhi the ultimate truth of emptinessIn the same vein just as it has been stated here in relation to the transcendent perfection of generosityIf sons or daughters of noble family kings ministers monks nuns male lay vow holders or female lay vow holders keep in mind the various teachings of the Dharma with faith in the Tathāgata worship them copy them or commission their copying and teach them correctlythose who are free of deceit and free of dishonesty to those who act without hypocrisySimilarly the bodhisattvas accumulations of merit and wisdom are wide and infiniteThey should teach in the middle of an assembly Millions of sūtras without impediment There is the meditative stability named Lions Play  There is the meditative stability named Beautiful MoonIn all the world there shone an immeasurable radianceThis concludes the twentyseventh chapter the epilogueBut even though they can hear the voices of gods and humans they do not make assumptions on account of their clairaudienceIn it there is nothing at all that accrues or disintegrates nothing that is enhanced or diminishedand the one who never abides and neither accepts nor rejects Even the king is severely depressed and given to broodingand then he lunged at the BodhisattvaSimilarly when bodhisattvas are born they will be protected by the buddhas and bodhisattvas as well as by akra Brahmā and the guardians of the worldBut nanda although King Candraprabha had plucked out his eye and given it to the manThe coarse level is secretly destroyed by fourNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities renounce the household lifeIn this way Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of generosity acquire the transcendent perfection of perseveranceMañjuśrī not all sentient beings are like physiciansWhen meeting wet grass the fire retreatsGiving away ones flesh and blood represents the bodhisattvas extraction of substance from all that lacks substance Thereforeand was radiant unsullied and clear like a lakebut no one can fathom the extent to which the bodhisattva mahāsattva kāśagarbha is gifted in skillful means and wisdom or the extent of his activities that ripen sentient beings through skillful meansa white lotus seven hands in diameter on top of it a moon diskConsider noble son how the shining sun delights virtuous people but displeases the savageIn this regard the expression marked with the motif of the wheel denotes the motif of a wheel with a thousand spokes a hub and a circumference which appears on the soles of his two feet entirely golden in colorTo burn the afflictions of these evil and degenerate timesit shook shook strongly and shook intenselyThey will be reborn in the pure buddha realms will not die a horrible death and will not be reborn in the lower realmsMoreover āradvatīputra demonic forces will transform themselves into the guise of a fully ordained monkVenerable Lord if the notion of physical forms as calm or not calm is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of physical forms as such become a bodhisattvananda if you wonder whether King Candraprabha was then at that time  someone else or you are of two minds about it or doubtful do not see him sowhen they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the aggregates from physical forms to consciousness are emptyFather I wish to visit the village of KāṣṭhavāṭaIf you see an error of theirs Do not mention that faultThe sentient beings for whom great bodhisattva beings don the great armor are also uncreated undestroyed and unconditionedKaṇṭhapāṇinī is in the form of a cockYou should not have conviction in the applications of mindfulness and you should not have conviction in the other causal attributes up to and

buddha named ākyamuniTheir minds partake of the pleasures of perfect kingdomsAfter that the ordinand puts the Dharma robes on along with the ceremonial robe if there is oneIt is the same when they practice the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance and the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and when they practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomThey have gratitude toward the buddhas And have no doubt concerning the Dharma of the buddhasfor it leads to the attainment of the absorption of an undisturbed mindIt will free

form of tathāgatas teaching the Dharma to beings in other buddha realms in thousands of other world realmsHowever relatively the vinaya of the bodhisattva great beings goes further in order to eliminate the disturbing emotions of all beingsRather they wish May all beings attain whatever they need for their livelihood May they attain all manner of happiness both of the world and beyond

of the buddhas might be grasped or not grasped contemplation of a putrefied corpseOn the relative level correct view is a gateway to all happinessthrough great joy to take joy and great delight in the Dharma andstealing from a place of worshipThey are the inconceivably numerous elucidations concerning the compositesimilarly that the remaining designations made with respect to the other sensory elements up to and including the designation of the sensory element of mental consciousness as entities or nonentities do not constitute a bodhisattvaWith happiness and delightIn the very same way Mañjuśrī the Tathāgata the Arhat the Perfect and Complete Buddha is not past future or presentlatent formations were uprootedThe rightupward glance signifies protecting the seven eggofBrahmā worldsit has not been revealed so that the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas might be grasped or not graspednanda as an analogy if there were a person who was on fire from his feet to the crown of his headIs it impossible O lord because bliss does not ariselike a mirageThat is how you should perfectly understand phenomenaand because he does not like any narrowminded teachings he does not destroy compounded thingsThis eightfold path of the noble ones combined with the attainment of its results and nirvāṇa is what the Bhagavān has called the DharmaThey do not escape this same realitykāśagarbha teaches the Dharma in various places according to the specificities of various beingsShould meditate on the patience praised by the jinas And then supreme enlightenment will not be difficult to attain At that time he uttered these verses They are devoid of composite or noncomposite And the sages have no concepts concerning themMoreover Kauśika if these sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage accept maintain recite comprehend and attend in the correct manner to this transcendent perfection of wisdomBy drinking an herbal remedy incanted with this mantraSimilarly Mahauṣadhi said the Blessed One the element of consciousness once it has cast off the corpse has no opportunity to occupy that same corpse againThey are adorned with the accumulations of merit and wisdomInner ambrosia is selfarisenwe are supreme in this worldIt should similarly be applied to the ten powers of the tathāgatas and also to the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasSaying We who are śrāvakas Are far from the supreme highest enlightenmentBhagavān if I again possess these bad qualities I will not seek to come before the Bhagavānnot abandoning the means of unificationthey see Land but not life can be found againReverend or venerable heed meAll who were struck with fear found releaseWhat nine qualitiesI was a king named BhīṣmottaraThe yakṣas who are agreeable to discipline Perceived the weapons in their hands to be flower garlandsOne should make the woman sit in

supremely brilliant and pure The light of wisdom he radiates dispels darkness Peaceful in form his mind is virtuous and tranquilFrom various buddha realms in the four directions many thousands of bodhisattvas now arrived Descending from the sky they all gathered before the Blessed One worshipping him by bowing their heads to his feetO Blessed One the city of Vārāṇasī has merely a limited populationHe then covered everyone who was present in the gathering and in the end he covered completely the entire trichiliocosmThe bodhisattva mahāsattvas who abide in the practice of the samādhi that is free of apprehending will abide in all aspirationsThe Blessed One is amazing the bodhisattvas respondedthey abstain from killing living creatures and oppose the killing of living creaturesNor indeed do the tathāgatas apprehend anything apart from engaging in omniscienceSimilarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are empty of consciousness and the other aggregatesIf you dont believe me follow that roadThey should also encourage others to acquire the meditative stabilities of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessnessSo too are all the worlds in the ten directions With their Sumerus and their oceansdo not see are not aware of or do not noticeFor example Subhūti space is not the past the future or the presentclouds that rained down divine standardsWith red light of different hues She illuminates the three worldsFrom the right side Siddhārtha saidThey continue in the performance of activities Whether that of engagement or

element which is exclusively the fire elementKolita asked UpatiṣyaThey who possess this supreme samādhi Will always be gentle will speak appropriate wordsMoreover Subhūti you should know that this is like when a man or woman thinks of fetching water in a clay jar that has not been fired that man or woman would be unskilled in natureThe others remarked No hes not dying This is simply how worthy ones abide in absorptionKnowing the thoughts and aspirations of beings I teach the Dharma in many different formsWhy did you make the fruit of your loins go forth they askedwithout elaboration free from elaborationVenerable Lord If great bodhisattva beings are endowed with many roots of virtueif they pay homage to him and even offer their lives to himFurthermore he should understand thoroughly the conception of himself as a thing by cultivating the following considerationYoung man there are countless faults in those composite phenomenaI will practice the six transcendent perfections by any means until even the name of the pride of those sentient beings is no longer heardSeeking the supreme highest enlightenmentThis sacred doctrine is compatible with the transcendent perfection of toleranceyou will be the holder of the Dharma of many hundred thousand quintillions of tathāgatasAnnounce the perfect fulfillment of his greatest desireHis monk wards then built a sweatchamber for himThis private food is the best Eaten by all the buddhasThose who have ceased conceptualizing things Do not see the Lord of Jinas as a rūpakāya The second root mantraThe son of noble family did not appear in this way to those beingsIf one smears barley flour cows urine oleogum resin and Indian licorice on the body together with clarified butter the whole body will become healthyAnd bites his lower lip with his fangshung with divine flower garlandsThis is a giftWe have never before seen A single one of these offspring of yours But today we have suddenly seen them Muni tell us of their activitiesIndeed all things have an undifferentiated nature because they denote the expanse of reality and because they denote the finality of existenceNext Nārāyaṇa imagine that you then passed through as many world systems toward the east as there are mustard seedsHe replied This is owing to the noncessation and nonarising of all thingsSimilarly Yellow Acala in the southThe venerable nanda then pressed his palms together and said to the Blessed OneThereupon magically influenced by the Buddha the venerable āriputra had this thoughtthe phenomena of desire the desire or the desirerThey will all of them attain enlightenment Kāśyapa it is like when a great cloud covers all the worlds in the allcontaining realm of a billion worldskaṭapūtanas and pāṃśukūla piśācasa modality that arises and a modality that is nonarising a modality that ceases and a modality that is unceasingthey were to think The worthy recipient of my generosity is the genuinely perfect Buddha but not a living creature born in the animal realm they would lack the attributes of a bodhisattvaThey practice their conduct unobservedAnd she should say Ah whoever serves According to procedure this lotus of mine Which is endowed with every pleasureand entered Rājagṛha to beg for almsEighty thousand divine maidens sprinkled the path with flowers of divine scentUpatiṣya is intelligent I would have him attend the master while I go in search of medicine and saidBhagavān since things that are nonarising do not exist it would be impossible for them to go to the lower realmsmakes many kinds of offerings to it such as flowers incense perfume garlands ointments powders cloth parasols banners flags music clothing the act of placing hands together in homage lamps of ghee lamps of sesame oil lamps of perfumed sesame oil lamps of magnolia oil and lamps of royal jasmine bignonia gardenia and shrubby jasmine oilsUnless you must do not open any doorEncourage the supreme being to renounce his homeSenior Subhūti Do great bodhisattva beings skilled in means who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom have dualistic perceptionLord of the World Buddha Illuminator bringer of benefitthey are undistracted on

three categories Homage to you wisdoms might supremeMoreover Subhūti any thought without the four applications of mindfulness and similarly any thought without the four correct exertionsHowever I

wisdom integrated with liberative art is liberationthe transcendent perfection of perseveranceStanding walking or runningto say nothing of arhatshipIf you ask why Subhūti it is because dedication in this context denotes this dedication of the transcendent perfection of wisdomthe inconceivably manifold experiences of beingsSenior āradvatīputra for these reasons great bodhisattva beings do not know through their meditative stability that all things are sameness nor do they have any cognitionowing Venerable Lord to the fact that the tathāgatas and their phantom emanations are without conceptual imaginationFormations that possess the three characteristicsSpace is taught to be ungraspable There is nothing there to be graspedWishing to attain enlightenment they will sit On a lion throne at the

hypocrisy or pretense practices great love and compassion in pursuit of the liberation of all beingsWhile acting in conformity with the worldfor it is only proper that knowledgeable and prominent people like us visit our followersIt is having a sense of modesty and selfrespectand will be victorious in disputes and quarrelsThis sūtra Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm Disclosed by the previous buddhaswho had reached their goals who had ended engagement with existenceand similarly as one who actualizes the extrasensory powers andThe eloquence of bodhisattvas is not short of

wisdomSimilarly they always maintain the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdomgave a detailed teaching by chanting the following extensive verses to the youth CandraprabhaOne becomes master of the thirteen stages There is no doubtBecause a bodhisattva is not born into an inferior family like a family of outcastes flutemakers cartwrights or servantsother merchants abandoned their goods and fledIn that same way not having attained the samādhi A bodhisattva is not esteemed By gods or humansWe are well trained in singing playing instruments and theatrical performanceThis is false wisdom and this is the fruit of false wisdomI should not linger hereis the noncultivation of the sensory element of the nose the sensory element of odors and the sensory element of olfactory consciousnessThey do not experience the sufferings of saṃsāra and are satisfied by perfect happinessMañjuśrī thus should a sick bodhisattva control his own mind in order to overcome old age sickness death and birthKṣitigarbha the Blessed One the Tathāgata has three bodiesThey will not migrate to states of birth in families that have wrong viewsBhikṣus those people enter the miraculous city and believe they have arrived at their destinationThey themselves have degenerated from the pathways to the higher realms and to liberation from cyclic existenceThen at that time Brother āriputra recited this verseas well as different types of fragrant and delightful food and drinkthey became his followers in order to listen to the DharmaThese are called the ten powers of the tathāgatasMoreover all these points are comprehended through hearing contemplating and training in the teachings They are not understood merely through words being spokenMy concentration will be one That even solitary buddhas cannot

empowerment should be givenThe Bhagavān having given him this opportunity the young man Candraprabha askedAs you behold all these beings without protection wealth or guidance Noble Guide please share the seven types of wealth and turn the wheelwill not come to rest in omniscienceand was revered honored and praised by Indra and the gods who attend himNāga girls could be seen holding aloft various

defining characteristics of the essential nature of the finality of existenceMoreover āradvatīputra the maturity of a great bodhisattva being also entails the seven branches of enlightenmentThey should not even dwell on the notion In this my buddhafield may the term physical forms not exist and similarly may the terms feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness not existBut another bodhisattva pure in his inclinations and disciplined whether householder or ordainedYet ordinary beings conceptualize the form aggregate Consequently some of these people Develop doubts about the Buddhas teachingMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who are irreversible move about they do so in accordance with the applications of mindfulnessI am also fond of my wife I too cherish her like her and enjoy being with her Thereforeand even for a single day rejoices in all these roots of virtuous actions and then dedicates the merits toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment making common cause with all sentient beings that one will generate many merits greater than thoseRegarding this there are also some concluding versesO I am of the nature of vajra which

awakening should train in these seven qualitiesSomeone with such marks would become one of two things There would be no third option they saidWhether one is enthralling a man or a womanin the same vein that the designations of the other links of dependent origination up to and including the link of aging and death as permanent or impermanent do not constitute a bodhisattvaBeing in saṃsāra where there is no peace is no good That is why said the Sugata nirvāṇa is supremeO Red Acala hū phaṭLikewise from the existence of ignorance formations occur and so on until finally from the existence of birth comes aging and deathWhat is a recitation instructor He is one who recites even a single verse of four lines three times which you then repeatThe elements of water fire and wind are not the

can see Were simultaneously to attain buddhahoodIn proximity to this book they should not negligently engage in careless actionsthe teacher regarded as a guru a spiritual teacher and a revealer of the pathThen Bhadrapāla asked furtherAt that point one has become essentially identical to the semensmell odors with their nosesIf I have sex with this monk I will be cured from my illnessand form realmsThey introduce living beings to the great compassion and teach them the great loveMars MercurySince its discipline is flawlessIt is touched by śrāvakas blessed by Brahmā praised by Indra revered by the world protectors worshipped by śvara extolled by the gods and saluted by yoga practitionersWhy is it difficult to know for those without dedication Because they have not previously obtained itnanda it is because great bodhisattva beings also will attain emancipation through the transcendent perfection of wisdom andSubhūti all these aspects of emptiness constitute the sameness of great bodhisattva beings Having trained in these great bodhisattva beings will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentIf you ask what are the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas they are as follows  The tathāgatas are without clumsiness  they are not noisy  they are without false memories  they are without differentiating perceptions  they are without uncomposed minds  they are without the indifference that lacks discernment  they do not degenerate in their resolution  they do not degenerate in their perseverance  they do not degenerate in their recollection  they do not degenerate in their meditative stability  they do not degenerate in their wisdom  they do not degenerate in their liberation nor in their perception of liberating pristine cognition  all the activities of their bodies are preceded by pristine cognition and followed by pristine cognition  all the activities of their speech are preceded by pristine cognition and followed by pristine cognition  all the activities of their minds are preceded by pristine cognition and followed by pristine cognition  they engage in the perception of pristine cognition which is unobstructed and unimpeded with respect to the past  they engage in the perception of pristine cognition which is unobstructed and unimpeded with respect to the future and  they engage in the perception of pristine cognition which is unobstructed and unimpeded with respect to the present These are called the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasLet fall a rain of flowers on the Sugata They scattered flowers while in the middle of the sky Ambition greed and wanting praise Fame obtained through deception Seeking to exalt oneself And put down othersAnd yet he does ridicule us because he gives us a prophecy of our highest complete enlightenment without our having thought of it or wished for itThat action of making offerings and prayers to the pratyekabuddha ripenedHow should they train to be reborn in the god realm of BrahmakāyikaBy touching the earth with the palm of his hand it trembled in six waysIt also entails the completion of the six extrasensory powers having resolved that all things neither come nor goYou should place your vajra thereThe analogy here is that of someone who travels out into the great secluded wilderness where he suffers hunger thirst and exhaustionVenerable Lord How do great bodhisattva beings after abiding in the transcendent perfection of tolerance acquire the transcendent perfection of perseverancebeing like an apparition and being like a hallucination something that does not come from anywhere and does not go anywheredie among animals and are reborn among godsIt would not be easy to recite all the praises of the jinas the total consummation of bluenessYou are the supreme physician who liberates beings from sufferingSimilarly Subhūti feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are nonexistent being

seenHe then squats with his two heels pressed to a grass mat on bricks so as to relieve pressure on the nervesThere is no doubt that the target will be slainThen Mañjuśrī the Tathāgata knows the sameness of all dharmas through the sameness of awakeningas well gemsHundreds of thousands of goddesses each sang songsWithout such future existence there will not be any birthand as he stands before them asks the following questionThe mother of the Bodhisattva could also see the Bodhisattva within her wombIn the same way son of noble family bodhisattva great beings should see their bodies made of the four major elements as being like medicinal treesWhat is the scope of the skillful methods of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara likeowing to the fact that that all those other attributes up to and including buddhahood are without essential naturedispense their generosity toward all sentient beingsShielding his face with his palm he turned his head and stared out unblinking and completely transfixed but he was unable to see the jeweled structureBut at these words the ThusGone One remained silentDevelop the aspiration for the state of enlightenment Beautify the stūpas of the sugatasThey do not consider whether the ears are connected with the nosewho would allow me to go forthNoble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities are endowed with excellent powerIf you ask why the transcendent perfection of generosity is neither fettered nor liberated because it is nonexistent Similarly the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom are neither fettered nor liberated because they are nonexistentOh Oh You who when struck by swords and sticks Have the power of great patience and kindnessthe thirtytwo major marks of a superior manReverend as for one who has knowledge of the three and who has cast aside the three stainsIt then very swiftly takes rebirthYou have been kings rich in merit and renowned for splendor Nimindhara Nimi Kṛṣṇabandhu Brahmadatta Keśarin Sahasrayajña Dharmacinti Arcimat and DṛḍhadhanuHearing them he quickly enters In order to rescue his sons thinking I shall not let my children all these boys Be quickly burned and annihilatedcommanding all worldly knowledgeor similarly the concept of physical formskilling stealingAs they rouse diligence all obscurations fade awayThat everything is this way You realized when you met DīpaṃkaraThis noble teacher too has strayed onto a spurious pathMaster which of those sixtyfour scripts will you teach meThis will cure feversa one two three or fourday fever etcāriputra knowing the different aspirations and different thoughts and natures of beingsThey are decorated with braided lengths of strings of pearls and silk and they are hung with hundreds of strings of pearlsThere is no lord such as you in all the worldsWait a moment my dearthe samādhi named Summoning the AsurasVenerable nanda a monk who because he himself is at peace within sees all outer objects as at peacesuch a monk has no conceited ideas about the same or not the same knowledge or ignorance perception or nonperception the conditioned or the unconditionedlikewise all the aggregates up to and including consciousness are calmThen the Blessed One transformed the ground into vajra and the bhūtas fled throughout the four directionsOn a lotus base within a jeweled vessel Array the Lord of Secrets in the centerMonks in the early morning the four great kings and the twentyeight great commanders of the yakṣas together with five hundred yakṣas arrived to meet the Bodhisattva and to offer him their respect and veneration and also to listen to the DharmaIt is the joy of accumulating all virtues in order to cultivate the auspicious marks and signsThey had subjugated demons and opponents and overcome all the activities of MāraHe replied This is owing to the eradication of all conceptual elaborationsMañjuśrī all dharmas nonarisen and unceasing come into being after having not existedYou know nirvāṇa to be unmovingYes they would Venerable SugataSo it is Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should train according to this approach which is without defining characteristicsyou must spread a teaching such as thisThey will not construe the notion that conditioned elements are emptiness and that emptiness is the conditioned elementsHe will be dedicated to purifying his own buddha realm and ripening beingsIn fact not only does it not diminish it grows strongerSince this is their ultimate mode there is no counteragentAjita see the amount of merit that is generated by inspiring just one beingAnd why Because at that time at that point the Blessed One the thusgone worthy completely perfect Buddha Amitābha was named King Glorious Splendorwithout arms without legs without ears with leprosy or morbid pallor orHe also teaches primordial wisdom endowed with skillful meansStruck by the fiery light of Avīci the former monk patricide exclaimedand gandharvas rejoiced exceedinglywere not accepted by a spiritual mentor and did not revere many buddhasOne should know this to be the absence of skillful means which great bodhisattva beings might haveOnce they have gone forth they should be ordained if they have reached twenty yearswho they are how they are and what kind they are what they think how they think and why they thinkMerukūṭa Merudhvaja Merurāja Meruśikharasaghaṭṭanarāja MerusvaraThat is how it knows I made these votive offeringsThey offered them to the ThusGone One saying to

you conceive of anything which you would wish to guard and protect and toward which you would offer sanctuaryIf you ask why it is because this vehicle of the transcendent perfection of wisdom is the vehicle of great bodhisattva beings and it is through this vehicle that they pursue omnisciencethe handling of ritual vasesAnd may the special good qualities Arising from the sermons of each bhagavān be accomplishedQueen Vimaladattā repliedThey reject all that should not be done The wise ones engage in what should be doneI am poorHe says Desires are like poles for impalement Desires are like pikes Desires are like the edge of a sword Desires are like the edge of a razor Desires are like a snakes head Desires are like bursting bubbles Desires are rot Desires stinkVisualize yourself as the deity of activity And place it in a boxThe teacher Viśmāmitra was appointed judge by the ākyas and he announced You are to determine who among these boys is superior whether in penmanship or in the knowledge of scriptsThey will be stupid and unskilled in any craft They will be in poverty with nothing in their homes Similarly they become absorbed in the four applications of mindfulnessThe vinaya of the hearers is like a stone that cannot be repaired when brokenIts high surrounding wall Is studded with all precious materials It is sixteen leagues in height And made out of gold Each of its four directional turrets Is inhabited all around By vajraholding yakṣas With weapons manifested in their handsif bound up in the eight adversities you do not obtain favorable conditionsSubhūti if one were to ask in what way great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdom encourage secure and establish sentient beings one hundred billion trillion in number in the transcendent perfection of wisdom in this regardWho are theyVenerable Lord Why do great bodhisattva beings who are irreversible have no doubt indecision or hesitation with regard to profound phenomena and attributesThe luminous body represents the body of the intermediate stateand are neither defiled nor purified going or coming is nonapprehensibleIf the son of noble family had manifested a display of unborn ultimate reality the worlds inhabitants including the gods would have become confused and defiledI have pledged to fully awaken to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood andIf you ask why it is because all things are utterly pure on account of the emptiness of conditioned phenomena and the emptiness of unconditioned phenomenaSuch is the bodhisattvas aspiration that is not inferiorAnd they have constant love for all beingsMy spine appeared uneven and rugged like a braid of hair with all its ups and downsthere would be no unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment or the enlightenment of the pratyekabuddhas or the enlightenment of the śrāvakasWhat is the single teaching It is not being reborn in the inferior state of a tīrthikaThey will know where the tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas are seatedCraving is the causal condition of clingingHow do they transcribe it recite it and gain the acceptance that comes with assimilating itNoble ones they become devoted just on seeing me and hearing me and they enter and remain in the wisdom of the buddhasWhen he has attained his last lifetimeWhen he inquired who had killed the animal he was told that it was Devadatta The Bodhisattva said That was not good of Devadattaand then after that return to your buddha realmIn my conduct I use mere words But within this world remain within nirvāṇa That name will not be found anywhere One who knows that is a bodhisattva Venerable Lord this transcendent perfection is not a selfSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent power of the retinuefor example to bless the element of space so that it would not get scorched during the eon of fireLike white and pale yellow birdsall of them are transformed exclusively into consciousnessEndowed with wisdom and likewise stable They ask questions and do not become angryin that very life water began to drip from the novices handsWe have been born into a family that holds the wrong view we are not sons of a Dharma kingI plant the roots of merit of this generosity so that I may attain an existence in which I take care of beings taking care of them in two waysCome out immediately and I shall look favorably upon youwill attain eight great forms of merit through this virtuous causeDurvāsa and also Cyavana Came to the supreme city to see the Guide iiiThe beautiful aroma of the guides of the world Spreads throughout the ten directionsand having studied it they will retain it hold it master it and be attentive to it in the appropriate mannerInside that temple hovered an identical second structure which did not touch the first structureakra mighty lord of the gods then asked Senior āradvatīputraThey pay homage to houses pillars and rocks clubs swords bows axes arrows spears and tridentsHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of virtuous and nonvirtuous attributesReverend please grant me ordinationThis Subhūti is the distinction between the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas and great bodhisattva beingsVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is like a mirageand a teacher of gods and menThen at that time the Bhagavat spoke the following versesDoes that mean that the man would be a liarDivine son ultimately all phenomena do not exist as something that can be apprehended whatsoeverand similarly when they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings in order that they might abandon their view of sentient beings to be matured their view of fields to be refined their view of enlightenment their view of the buddha and their view concerning the promulgation of the doctrinal wheelWhat are the six elementsWill extract and consume The great blood and the great heartIt is analogous Blessed OneThey will also hear the Tathāgata Arhat Genuinely Perfect Buddha impart the sacred doctrines from the six transcendent perfections and the four applications of mindfulness up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasIt involves repulsiveness love dependent origination and so onwere to engage in the act of sexual intercourse without first offering back his training with training intactSimilarly they discern feelings as resembling a water bubble perceptions as resembling a mirage formative predispositions as resembling a hollow plantain and consciousness as resembling a magical displayIt is like the trunk of the plantain tree having no corethat mind and the factors arising from it then condition the formation of virtuous and unvirtuous actionsTo the memorials of the thusgone ones and the statues of the thusgone ones he has offered golden ornamentsOne should prepare the five maṇḍalas According to the division of the five yoginsDiverse colors emerged permeated infinite limitless world systems with light and extended up to the brahmā worldsSimilarly why do you say that the nonarising of all things up to and including omniscience is not omniscience and so forthThey all lack a self and do not abideYou have illuminated the ten directionsand all those pratyekabuddhas of the present who abide in the innumerable countless world systems of the ten directionsneither escape from the world nor failure to escape from the worldIf you ask what constitute the eight aspects of liberationand who was encircled by many bodhisattvasThen the dharmabhāṇaka Supuṣpacandra recited the following verses to that great assembly of bodhisattvasThis will cure smallpoxIf you ask what is great loving kindness it is an action in which the tathāgatas engage on behalf of all sentient beings treating enemies and friends identically That is called great loving kindnessThis is referred to as pure diligence and in this way bodhisattvas have pure diligenceEmptiness Mañjuśrī is purityMany thousands of gods with palms joined Bowed down to the feet of this resolute childThe Bhagavān then recited these verses to the youth CandraprabhaThe nature of breath fills the six channelswho desires virtuous qualities should take joy in solitudeAlas all of these foolish persons Will deprive themselves of the jewels if they turn backunderstand it preserve it recite it to others promote itVenerable Lord if the notion of sights as entities is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of sights as nonentities become a bodhisattvaThis concludes The Prophecies to the rāvakas the sixth chapter of the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharmaalong with a large monastic saṅgha of  bhikṣus all of them great elders śrāvakas and arhatsIn the same vein they abide in the attainments up to and including omniscience which are neither fettered nor liberatedWhen they noticed they had been sleeping on a piece of dry ground they realizedThey will never dedicate it toward attaining the gratification of desire political gain wealth or powerVilifying us they spoke in verseand similarly they do not make assumptions about the other sense fields up to and including the sense field of the mental facultyHis fingers are longHolding fragrant perfect nāga flowers And sat before the Sugata at no great distance iiiplaces where natural medicines can be foundfills the emanation chakraAnd of crystals and of emeraldsHow do they steer clear of wearinessas well as to the king the queen and their courtdie among animals only to be reborn among spiritsI answer him by saying The afterlife is like and unlike this worldIt is the absence of interest in honor It is the absence of anger at dishonorSimilarly they will be reborn as a householder within the priestly class like a mighty sāl treewhich the herdsmen brought to the two merchants Trapuṣa and Bhallika sayingMay the vetāḍa action be interruptedDivine son whoever does not conceptualize the sameness of all phenomena in not occurring as ultimately having substance materiality and essenceI will do as the Bhagavat has instructedThey are all respectful their palms together in homageDependent on this transcendent perfection of wisdom great bodhisattva beings attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentHearing the exhortation of the gods he became as still as mud resting upon a boulderMāyā gave them to the sick who all became curedFor those whose hearts have become like a broken vesselI shall give a Dharma discourseNoble sons even if yearning for this DharmaWhen he sees repeatedly Earth that is wet and muddyWhen one speaks of the sameness of all phenomena in being utterly unarisen Mañjuśrī what phenomenon is that a designation forat which point the group of six said Nanda and Upananda what does this retired devotee knowwith tearful eyes and stricken with agony exclaimed the following versesPerfect buddha foremost among men How should we venerate yousimilarly that the designations of the remaining sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of mental consciousness do not constitute a bodhisattvaThe god Lalitavyūha offeredMay I obtain a prophecy like theseare the essence of joyAs they investigate the origin of sentient beings they examine all phenomenaThey see perfectly the deaths Of beings and their rebirths I then pondered what must be absent for conditioning not to occur and what must cease for conditioning to ceaseWhen it rises dimness and darkness vanish and when the sun vanishes darkness sets inDo not abandon those afflicted beings Who are agitated by the web of disturbing emotionsThey spoke in verseattains the five higher knowledgesone billion Heavens of Delighting in EmanationsNoble one the time for me to pass into nirvāṇa has comeTheir bodies will be purifiedIf the beings that are in this world Were to recite the praises of the bodhisattvasthose of the Brahmapurohita and Mahābrahmā realms those of the Parīttābha Apramāṇābha and bhāsvara realmsAs I consider for a whileit goes without saying that someone who hears this kind of Dharma teaching proclaims it maintains it writes it has it written and honors the text or has others honor it with flowers incense perfume garlands ointments powders clothing parasols banners flags sesame oil lamps ghee lamps and perfumed oil lampslike a magical displayBodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to the fourlegged beings who lived thereThis noble man is going to the Bodhimaṇḍaāradvatīputra one should know that they would not be great bodhisattva beingsI should maintain ethical discipline in this mannerHaving vanquished all the demon hordes they are heroesāriputra have faith in me trust in me and have confidence in meSuch a monk should not be given soap or a toothbrushThose stricken with sickness were healedand apply themselves earnestly as instructed in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomReverend Upāli sin is not to be apprehended within or without or between the twoThe eighth fourteenth and fifteenth days Of the waxing and waning lunar periods Are taught as auspicious times for everythingYou teach the Jewel of the DharmaFor the real nature of the sensory element of the eyesIn all those buddha realms he saw blessed buddhasadorned his body with two pearl necklaces one long and one medium in lengthMañjuśrī explanations given by magical creations of the Thusgone One are not true nor are they falseMahauṣadhi listen replied the Blessed One I shall tell you how beings that are not bound for a meritorious rebirth are reborn in the hell realmswere to apprehend the physical bodyThis completes the third chapter from the Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled NonfixationWe should pursue them within the ultimate truthThe Bhagavān arose from that samādhiWith respect to that a bodhisattva should understand well the cause of affliction and the cause of purificationWhen people placed grass or cotton in his ears it would stick out of his nostrilsOnes complexion becomes sickly and ones body emaciated Ones hair and nails grow longHow can you be so delighted When living amid a cemeteryThis was the method of the wheel of ArapacanaBhaiṣajyarāja many beings will reject this Dharma teaching while the Tathāgata livesup to and including their unsurpassable perfect awakening and thusHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the five facultiesThe Blessed Buddha pledged to pass the rainy season in the Kalandakanivāpa at the Bamboo Grove near Rājagṛharyā Noble OneBhagavān it is wonderful Sugata it is wonderfulThen the Bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha JñānaprabhāsaThe Blessed One has long toes and fingersThe bhikṣu meditators have become vessels for meditative concentration dhāraṇīs tolerance and the groundshe bowed toward the Bhagavān and praised him with these appropriate versesSon of noble family a bodhisattva great being who possesses these four qualities will swiftly achieve acceptance that phenomena are unbornthey make assumptions on account of those giftsI will liberate these beings from this mass of sufferingThey practiced bodhisattva conduct For countless millions of eonsthe abiding nature of all things and the expanse of reality continue to abide and these neither arise nor ceaseSimilarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are naturally neither fettered nor liberatedHow should they train in the thirtytwo major marks of a superior man and how should they train in the eighty minor marksfree from distinctionsAlas For a long period of time these sentient beings have engaged with signs that is to say they have engaged with signs denoting the female gender the male gender signs of visible forms and signs of sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomenaYouthful Mañjuśrī however made this plea to the Bhagavānthose who have not venerated many hundreds of thousands of buddhasWhich of the Dharmas included In the vehicle of enlightenment are to be cherisheddo you think Subhūti that this illusionist or this apprentice of an illusionist would have established any sentient beings in the transcendent perfection of wisdomSome said The Kośala family has a large retinue many mounts and great wealthThe sound was as loud and intense as when a blacksmiths bellows is being squeezedAlas You should once again confess and reject those roots of virtueor it is a deva or is devacolored or is like a deva or shines with a devas lightYet although I am an ordinary person I will not dieHolding her under her kneesLikewise those who wish to comprehend the four nourishmentsAnd having perfect conduct and a wellcontrolled mind That is the way of the Dharma that the Sugata teaches Hearers are not acknowledged among gods and humans and hence they do not receive this prophecyThen water makes the particles fall and renders the sky stainless and completely pristineA Lord of the World will be present before them With the beautiful primary and secondary signs of the bodyIn accordance with the aspirations expressed by the thusgone ones may this gift of crest jewels and crowns cause all beings to achieve the unseen crown of the headhe too called up the four branches of his armed forcesHe sees himself victorious in the midst of a battle With the immortals in the sky cheering him in joyous voicesHe actualized the Buddha and the Dharma and perfected the power of aspirationOne should repeatedly enact protection and oblation actsCompared to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance consisting of the bodhisattvas acts of giving would not even amount to a hundredth partIf you ask what is the emptiness of all intrinsic defining characteristicsAnd then yet later again with time it will grow buds branches foliage flowers and fruitFool have you really committed this actThings put in his nostrils would appear out of his ears nose and mouthand then accomplish the activitiesChanda dont badger me now Instead without any further delay bring me my horse Kaṇṭhaka well adornedwent quickly back up the southern roadPhysical forms are not one thing and illusions another Illusion itself is physical forms and physical forms themselves are illusionAs beings that seek the Dharma and practice the Dharma They do not harm creaturesit is because it does not abide in any location it does not abide in any direction it does not arise from anywhere and it does not go anywheregenerosity without expecting reward in the form of ripeningsome were being ground in millsNoble son such are the signs seen within that poreWhen we saw two boiling iron vats standing empty we askedto not serve noble beings to attend to childish beingsIt is experiencing joy through venerationThey should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that I as a great bodhisattva being should subsequently reach the irreversible levelThe vajraḍākinīs dance and call out to Vajrasattvaāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of physical forms as having aspirations or lacking aspirations constitutes a bodhisattvaand in the same vein the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path are subsumed within itexcellent unperturbed patienceJust as for tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas miserliness and acquisitiveness never arise so it is also for those great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomNow may we swiftly become the best in this world may we give to others the eye of DharmaThey remain in that knowledge of phenomena And are venerated by this world and its devas A nāginī a bhūtinī A kiṃnarī or a human girlthe four assurancesThe temple was made from uraga sandalwood which is so precious that a single mote of its dust is equal in value to a thousand universesand the outer form of his Dharma will remain for a further twenty intermediate eonsThe eloquence of bodhisattvas is not unclearBrother nanda said to the Bhagavatmeditate on it with unadulterated meditationThey will reprimand themselves and disclose give up and relinquish negative actionsand actualized his own awakeningSentient beings do resemble a magical displaySo why does he not look at us with circumspectionNext purify gold and so forth the seven precious things And place these in a jeweled vessel or clay potYou wholly perfected the patience of a buddhaWithout having to rely on the statements of others one becomes free from hesitation doubt and uncertainty with respect to the qualities of a buddhaSuch will be the physical states endured by those individuals who have defamed the sacred doctrineand they release those sentient beings who have heard this doctrine from birth aging death sorrow lamentation suffering discomfort and agitationOne should add Destroy all my evilthe branch of genuine enlightenment that is doctrinal analysis and the other branches of genuine enlightenment comprising perseverance delight mental and physical refinement meditative stability and equanimityAre you wearyA sheanimal a female hungry ghosthe summoned his ministers and said Gentlemen as the ruler of all who have been crowned and anointed kṣatriya kingsSimilarly while they may become absorbed in the four immeasurable aspirations and the four formless absorptionsElder the two novices must be given a little scareAccordingly they decided to decorate another eighty thousand bodhi treesThey do not know the path that will end sufferingThe prince fails to appreciate the situation they thought Let us go submit the matter to King MahāpadmaBlessed One how do bodhisattvas express the Dharma how do they follow the Dharma and how do they become experts with respect to the realm of phenomenaThis king of elephants is known as Bodhithey do not then become frightened but are instead utterly and completely fearlessThey follow the Dharma but not based on going beyond DharmaIt was the finest season when the moon enters the constellation Viśākhā The leaves of trees unfurled and the most exquisite flowers blossomed It was neither cold nor hotAnd also their various kinds of karma Their happy and unhappy existences are visibleOne should eat this preparation with gheeWhat is the element of consciousnessThe young god donned a pair of glittering hooped earrings that swung to and froHe had already relinquished suffering and as he now abandoned the feeling of comfort both mental pleasure and displeasure vanishedand knowing that those tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas had expressed their wishIf you ask what is the understanding of the aspects of the path it is the emancipation from cyclic existence that bodhisattvas acquire through the path of the bodhisattvas inasmuch as they are not attracted by the vehicles of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas even though they understand the paths of all three vehicles That is called the understanding of the aspects of the pathnanda the sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritageis it also for other beingsand having attained them they transformed their bodies to a height of fortytwo hundred thousand leagues and sat upon the thronesThey appear in the form of the sun and stars And in the form of the moonAlas these beings are helplessOne can do nothing that would make him unhappylikewise they do not consider whether the ears nose tongue body and mental faculty are void or notOne hiccups and pants Likewise ones breath becomes coldEndowed with buddha knowledgethey have the modality of the expanse of reality they have the modality of the finality of existence they have the modality of sameness and they have the modality of the inconceivable expansewill see tathāgatas as numerous as the grains of sand in seventytwo Ganges RiversVenerable Lord When all things are without defining characteristics how could a single defining characteristic be designatedThey retain everything the Buddha has saidand therefore the Bhagavān tolerated us and did not say to us This is the Tathāgatas treasure of wisdom which will be yoursand when he saw that the merchants daughter had become so weak he askedYet no sound can be heard at this very moment As everyone looks with a peaceful mind to the Victorious OneThis transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of deeds that are equal to the unequaled and so forth in order that one might not appropriate or become fixated on physical forms and likewise in order that one might not appropriate and become fixated on feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness and in the same vein as before in order that one might not appropriate and become fixated on all attributes and attainments up to and including omniscienceFor a learned wearer of the saffron robes to fall is hardFor its sake the previous perfect and complete buddhasthe fully awakened onesas well as the pratyekabuddhas and śrāvakas are honored like parents objects of veneration and gurusall of them are transformed exclusively into rednessf you ask what is the emptiness of unconditioned phenomenaPure realms numerous as sand in the GangaAfter the rainy season had passed Upasena took up his Dharma robesSimilarly they teach the doctrine so that the bodhisattvas might cultivate the ten powers of the tathāgatasKauśika thoughts of dedication are nonmindHe had become a youth who did not indulge in desires but was a young celibate who had been keeping the vow for a yearBeat the drums of merit and ring the bells of auspiciousnessI had him killed today because of my desires Which was extremely evil and I will go to hell The measured is taught to be a conception The measureless is nonconceptualAll conceptions have been eliminated Therefore it is called samādhi and should be regarded as a place of worshipWhen men and women see him They cannot get enough of beholding himThis family is a fitting place for the Bodhisattva to be conceivedand those who see the Buddhas teachings as essentially desire will attain purification of karmic obscurationsthe bodhisattva is supreme over all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhasGiving up a beloved spouse son or daughter is not comparableneither is it revealed nor is it unrevealedAs a result they will be completely liberated from the lower realms and will not turn back from attaining perfectly complete enlightenmentThe second heart mantra What condition has occasioned it And then he asked again in verseThey would have no anger And their love and compassion would not diminish and they have been well trained in all the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristics but they do not apprehend anything at all apart from those aspects of emptinesslike a lionHow many other blessed buddhas apart from that thusgone one have these two holy beings servedBhikṣus at that time the sixteen mendicants acquired maintained and understood that teaching of the BhagavānSimilarly how do they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings by means of the six extrasensory powers which originate from the ripening of past actionsOne then sees oneself as having a female formWhat wise person would be hurt by a gathering of such dependently arisen phenomenaFrom them are emitted sounds Countless numbers of the word buddhaThese are the eight supreme attributes that one will attainThey should don the armor of the buddha body Then they will illuminate the world system of the great trichiliocosmto quell both latent and manifest afflictionsThen Nārāyaṇa appeared in his own form He was vast with the sun and moon on his shouldersThe bodhisattvas possess it It is realized by those who have the ten strengthsfor they gather sentient beings and turn them into suitable recipients for the Dharma that comes from the discovery of awakeningthat the nature of consciousness is emptinessSo the ThusGone One wondered Where would he be nowAmid this cultivate the practice of Vajrapāṇi His feet are placed on the holder of the hareI go to the Dharma my refugeand the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas have been taught without apprehending anythingIn this way bodhisattva great beings who genuinely uphold the component of discipline will not deviate from these four thingsSimilarly the nonaffliction and nonpurification of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are without foundationSo how would you explain what are words and what is meaning Young man the discernment of eloquence is teachingThe ones who have faith in this sūtra Have seen the tathāgatas of the pastThey will have strong desire and strong anger They will have strong ignorance and be conceited and arrogantSubhūti it is because those great bodhisattva beingsWhy did I suggest it Incapacitated as I am by emotions I trusted you would know what to do You have been long absent from the kings capital Weeping they long for the greatly compassionate bhikṣuThey have out of compassion in order to benefit the world been born as humans in this Jambudvīpa through the power of prayer in order to teach this Dharma teachingWhatever those beings wished for their wishes were fulfilled each timeThey have ended engagement with existence They have liberated their minds through true knowledgeThe elders of the ākya clan both male and female were also placed everywhere at road intersections junctions and many highways in order to guard the BodhisattvaAlas those dwelling within cyclic existence are blinded by ignoranceWhat are those ten They are to be free of yearning and free of cravingMay I reach awakening and then do everything so that these beings realize all dharmasSimilarly they discern that consciousness and so forth are empty of the emptiness of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnesswealth or crops should worship this Dharma teaching and those who teach it with vast offeringsThe wisdom light of the Tathāgata Shines equally like the sun and moon And it guides all beings Without diminution or excessVimalatejā the Dharma treasures of bodhisattva great beings who yearn for the Dharma are found within mountains mountain caverns and treesIt neither bestows nor withholds the attributes of the bodhisattvasMay this elder Subhūti elucidate this transcendent perfection of wisdomAt this point the Blessed One expressed his approval to the god Ratnavarawhile apprehending all those up to and including the transcendent perfection of generosity will make assumptions on account of those transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of generosityThe eye Mañjuśrī is empty of a self and what belongs to a selfHe neither moved from the sun to the shade Nor from the shade to the sunBhikṣus those Brahmās wondered These airborne palaces of the Brahmās have become very beautiful bright radiant glorious and majestic Who is this a sign ofI shall attain the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood and thenThose who possess this samādhi Are wise ones who will obtainIndeed Subhūti there is no doctrine at all that is not included in the syllables and the absence of syllablesThen the physician thinks These sons of mine have deluded perception because of the poison or venom and so will not drink the medicine but they are praising me I will use a skillful method to make them drink this medicineVenerable Lord I do not consider anything which would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment but which is other than illusion or other than illusionlike mindTherefore if someone wishing to go forth approaches any of youSubhūti repliedAlambuśā and Miśrakeśī Puṇḍarīkā and ruṇā Ekādaśā Navanāmikā ītā and Kṛṣṇā DraupadīAnd also describes another enlightenment To those who are frightened of saṃsāraWith this count serving as the basic unit of calculation it is possible to calculate the number of grains of sand in ten Ganges riversFrom these cognitive fields arises contactSimilarly the applications of mindfulness are also free from contaminants and not included within the three world systemsSimilarly Subhūti all things have the modality of generosity great bodhisattva beings too do not transgress this modalitywhen they cease they do not think I ceaseWith the king of medicines he even heals Desire anger and ignorance  the branch of enlightenment that entails correct mental and physical refinementSo they set out for unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment saying Let us become a sanctuary for the worldsa protector a refuge an ally an island a torchbearer a lamp a helmsman a guide and a supportIt is liberation through knowledge of the true nature having gained the strengths of buddhahoodThen āriputra the man gave all his sons carts drawn by powerful oxen that were as fast as the windSubhūti if you ask what constitute the eighty minor marks which the tathāgatas have they are as followseven though those great bodhisattva beings may have dispensed generosity from the time when they first began to set their mind on enlightenment they have not conceptualized itI should undertake such perseveranceOne should scratch her and inscribe the three syllablesReverend āriputra this goddess has already served ninetytwo million billion buddhasAjita it is like thisWhen the Jina had passed into nirvāṇa Following their proper conduct they saw millions of buddhasand similarly they do not entertain thoughts of hatred and delusionLet him follow this pure beingThe rākṣasī asked me Noble son why did you sighNārāyaṇa such is the skill in method of these bodhisattvasMammā mammābut its nature is not afflictedBy offering seats one will attain important positionsthen reverend what constitutes an impostorLately it has become common for brahmins to go forthand nirvāṇathis Dharma teaching is to be revered by the world with its gods humans and asurasSimilarly are the aspects of consciousness from visual consciousness to mental consciousness also nonconceptualThey teach as if they themselves have desire And also have anger and ignoranceSugata its impossibleThere he will not be afflicted by desire anger ignorance pride envy rage or malicehey will purify the negativity of body and if they also purify the negativity of speech and purify the negativity of mindThere are extremely beautiful and delightful divine celestial palaces of crystal and silverdo not consider the transcendent perfection of generosity as a designationThey protected the Bodhisattva while he was in his mothers wombakra Brahmā and the guardians of the world paid the Bodhisattva three visits In order to make offerings to the GuideWhen not observing any phenomena they are free from evilThen at that time the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara andIn that sublime residence of King uddhodana all the provisions of butter sesame oil honey raw sugar and sugarcane juice were never depleted and appeared to be full even though they were used abundantlyAnd he has identical carts made for themDuring lovemaking one should feed the root of black nightshade with betel to a womanSenior āradvatīputra the nature of physical forms is nonentityYou will have the direct perception of the Sugatas Dharma And you will attain the inconceivable buddha qualities Will attain the accomplishment of Buddha    tNārāyaṇa I would not call bodhisattva great beings laypeople if they happen to even hear of this absorption nor if they acquire it transcribe it recite it and do not abandon itWhenever a female form is seen In the world of the three abodes It should be regarded as my form Be it of low or respectable familyThis is the tantra on obtaining wealth a kingdom royalty and the fruitNoble ones you should do whatever will make it extensively widespreadIt does not become an object because it is free of words and lettersThat great cloud flashing with lightning Is completely filled with water It resounds with sound Bringing joy to all beingsand though they may indeed practice all the six transcendent perfections and similarly practice in accordance with contaminated uncontaminated mundane supramundane conditioned and unconditioned phenomena exclusively in order that sentient beings might attain final nirvāṇaOne should kick it with ones left foot whileBlessed One will beings who have not produced roots of virtue ever even hear this Dharma teaching let alone commit it to writing commission it to be written retain it recite it or offer flowers incense and incense powder to itSome ascetics and priests Appear to be caught up in thatFather I will get hold of this monk And throw him to the end of the oceansThey have no part of being a bhikṣuThe nature of these words Is profound subtle and difficult to see They do not apprehend the emptiness of both external and internal phenomena as the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenaDissolve the body speech and mind of the aggressor Into the substances and make the burnt offeringAnd though one thinks for a very long time There will still be no cessation to thinking Moreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineMonk as all phenomena are inherently nonarising they are tamedadorned by eight la syllables covered with a maṇḍala of Indra and embellished with a double vajraSince the Bhagavān has taught the profound Dharma in this way O BhagavānHowever relatively the vinaya of the bodhisattva great beings is aware of all the limitless and boundless worlds in the ten directionsthe Dharma will remain for twenty intermediate eonsSenior āradvatīputra I do not hold that attainments are designated with respect to things that are nonarisingIf you ask what is the knowledge of the pathto denigrate and be hostile toward bodhisattvasAll is of one taste in being emptyhe or she honored each of them by enshrining their preserved bodies in a memorial stūpa made of precious stones each as large as a world with four great continentsYou Kuntī and your followers should protect even those who only possess the name of this Dharma teachingBrahmaviṣṇumaheśvaraśrī Glory of Brahmā Viṣṇu and MaheśvaraAt that point Mañjuśrī decided that the entire gathering should witness Māra Pāpīyān residing on a lion throne adorned with all the physical marks of a buddhaMañjuśrī with respect to what is real no words can be found because it is nonarisen and unceasingSimilarly with the water of training in absorption bodhisattvas cause the web of the roots of affliction to rotIt is the completion of the doorways to liberationIt is exquisite indeed and overwhelms everyone including misguided nonBuddhists the countless wandering mendicants and the naked asceticsWith regard to this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom which the Venerable Lord is explainingfor the sake of a great number of beings and for the benefit and happiness of devas and humansand they have continued to engage in an apprehending manner in the following viewsAfter they have transcended the sphere of the infinity of consciousness in all aspectsthe supports for miraculous ability the faculties the powers the branches of enlightenment and the noble eightfold pathI see some bodhisattvas Who are bhikṣus living in the forestsThose are the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhaswhich is the family of all the buddhas which is the secret subject of all the buddhasDo not look for the Buddha elsewhereHe also established countless innumerable beings in irreversible progress toward the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood and then passed into nirvāṇaEven at the cost of their lives they would never let their commitments fall apart nor would they refrain from following through on themthey are reborn through the power of their aspirations in those buddhafieldsand thus you have to understand the element of consciousness through the particularities of its causesas alms are not sought after noon packed their begging bowls and Dharma robesit comprises the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhasand the defining characteristic of aspirationlessnessBhagavat I am not satisfied by simply hearing about the sixsyllable mahāvidyāThe left knee resting on the ground signifies protecting the earthāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of fundamental ignorance and in the same vein of all the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death as entities or nonentities constitute a bodhisattvaPlease explain about applying mantras The pacifying and the enrichingIt is said that the lower sixth is situated At the center of the superior and disconnected onesHaving donned their armor even if they were afflicted on being struck by the clods of earth sticks or weapons hurled by enemies and assailantsThereupon in order to make this clear the Bhagavān recited these versesNevertheless childish ordinary beings are attached to conceptions of a self and so they thinkDivine children wearing sashes were seen moving back and forth between the laps of the women in the retinue of King uddhodanas queenMañjuśrī imagine a householder bodhisattva who attends as many buddhas and bodhisattvasall things are empty of all things andpassing through those  other buddha realmslikewise all the aggregates up to and including consciousness are imbued with sufferingBones and sinews will be formed from the moon And flesh and other matter from the sunWhen the moon is in a clear sky Its reflection appears on the seaFrom the right side Siṃhanādin saidand I became arrogant on seeing that I was their sole rulerSister what you say is true I must get going regardless of whether I am kicked outYou are a wondrous lamp that discerns themāradvatīputra if great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomFrom the sky tens of millions of gods folded their hands Bowed to him and offered prostrationsFor so long parents monks priests spiritual teachers worthy people and religious people have been protected and defended by himI say that when any sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who have heard this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom who having heard it aspire toward itThe Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra The Perfection of GenerositySuch bodhisattvas may alone and unnoticed leave for a place of complete solitudeSurely a being with supreme features helpful activity and wisdom light is hereThey experience suffering after suffering I have powerful compassion for them Because the rain falls from the cloud the great herbs Grow their stems hollow stalks and skins Their spreading branches and their leaves And likewise their fruits and flowersup to and including conditioned and unconditioned phenomena thenIf you ask why this is mundaneas well as those who worship such Dharma teachers with clothes and ornamentsI have been absorbed in meditationBecause young man for bodhisattva mahāsattvas who are careful the highest complete enlightenment is not difficult to attain let alone this samādhiperceiving the Buddha is an obscurationwith knowledge they illuminatethe bodhisattva great being DharaṇīśvararājaI am powerful with the ten powers Confident with the four confidences And possessor of the eighteen unique qualities The great sage who turns the wheel of Dharma of the Supreme VehicleThis gives rise to the five superknowledges yet there is no attachment to themWhy is that Because if they become too weak they will turn their backs on virtue and if they become too heavy they will become drowsyShe had never seen heard of or experienced Such a rare happinessLater as Tiṣya and ārikā sported made loveAlas these beings are suffering from diseaseone will confuse all of ones adversaries and appease their angerpleasurable painful and neutralElevating self is a cause of afflictionO King is there anyone in this city who can compete with me in the artsYellow is the wisdom of equalityHaving taken refuge in and seen these manifestationsThus they see all these phenomena with the understanding that by purifying disciplining and comprehending the mind they will also purify discipline and comprehend phenomenaAbiding happily in divine blissThey will not be fascinated by those smells or intoxicated by themHe saw that the bodhisattva mahāsattva Kṣemadattas hand was burning and outshining all other lightsSimilarly they do not think Through this ethical discipline may I attain the fruit of one who has entered the stream or the fruit of one tied to one more rebirth or the fruit of one who is no longer subject to rebirth or arhatship or the fruit of individual enlightenment or the maturity of the bodhisattvas or unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentcontaminated or uncontaminated conditioned or unconditioned the attributes of ordinary peopleI shall introduce them to the Dharmas guidance that has been taught by the Tathāgata and teach it to themThey also entirely give up the subsidiary afflictions that are obstacles on the path to awakening and instead they apply their remediesWhat is having a motivation that is not discouraged It is not giving up the motivation and not giving up meditationIt is nirvāṇa because of a word It is peace because of speaking There is equality in terms of conventional appellations There are appellations in terms of ultimate truthAs soon as the bodhisattva great beings and the great hearers had spoken these wordsAs uddhodanas son he abandoned his kingdomThe connection with this nonexistence Results in a teaching that is one of conventions Noble son for many years for many hundreds thousands and hundreds of thousands of yearsKauśika it is because great bodhisattva beings and the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas are not present in the world dependent on the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhasThey do not live as householders and become involved in the affairs of householdersTherefore Bhagavān we have contemplated many Dharma teachings that are similar to a rubbish heapMaudgalyāyana the strength with which I shot it was hereditary it was not shot with any miraculous strengthOne should crush the fruit of elephant woodapple and use it to smear a new vesselYou have the feature of nonobscurationConsider noble son how the god Candra rides a supreme mount and illumines the four continentsFurthermore Mañjuśrī bodhisattvas who pursue enlightenment through the five obscurationsBeautified by ribbons diadems and jewelry Who pulled my chariot with cords of gold They do not make offerings to a tathāgata with the hope for anything at allneither elaboration nor nonelaborationWhen those ordinary immature beings who have not gone through arduous training hear such profound sūtras they become extremely frightened and terrifiedO Lord they would be incorrect in stating that such and such is the defining characteristic of spaceHaving attained this peace this stainless samādhi They will be continually pure in celibacygripping with the hand gripping using the foot gripping using the top of the head cutting cleaving breaking rubbing target shooting without causing injury target shooting at vital pointswill generate many excellent qualities and benefits in this very lifethey stayed still looking at the Bhagavat without blinkingFor the sake of those sentient beings when I have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment then I should ensure by any means through the four immeasurable aspirations the four formless meditative absorptions and the four attractive qualities of a bodhisattva that those sentient beings act appropriately so that the faults of the perceptual views associated with those sentient beings do not ariseIt would be childish dull and bereft of clarity and skillTherefore the revealed nature of equality Is that all phenomena in essence have no natureListen to the explanation Of that which is their field of activityFrom now on you should think of your preceptor as your fatherWhichever limbs one nailsVenerable Lord if the notion of physical forms as void or not void is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of physical forms as such become a bodhisattvaWhat is knowledge of the past It is the knowledge of causesSimilarly these four applications of mindfulness are merely names and the same applies to all the remaining causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathSuch is the bodhisattvas fearless aspirationThe postulant postulants name has asked the preceptor preceptors name to allow his going forthSubhūti all things have the modality of physical formsThat is how this great heap of suffering comes into beingIf someone keeps it in mind without distraction and writes it outhe grabbed hold of the elephant by its trunk with his left hand and killed it with his right hand in a single strokeThese are the eight great treasures that one will attaināriputra this holy person came here from the presence of the Tathāgata Akṣobhya in the universe AbhiratiFurthermore your reality is just the same as the reality of all living beings the reality of all things and the reality of all the holy onesThis great mantra removes all misfortunes that afflict bipeds and quadrupeds and accomplishes all endeavors even when it has not been fully mastered His face and forehead are proportionalproclaim it chant it meditate on it with unadulterated meditation promulgate it and make it widely known to othersIf he should exert himself then all is wellWhatever karma they create The corresponding result will come to them Moreover nanda the sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who resolutely wish to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment should honor venerate respect and make offerings to this same transcendent perfection of wisdom which has just been taughtThe effulgence of the Tathāgatas body was manifestly supreme alongside those radiancesAt that point the bodhisattva the great being Maitreya said to the Blessed OneSubsequently through those roots of merit after a hundred million eons had passedthat faith that tolerance that confidence that higher aspiration that willingness that volition that renunciation and that unrelenting perseverance until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is attained will increase and flourish since they have been accepted by the transcendent perfection of wisdomThe four meditative concentrations and similarly the four immeasurable aspirations and the four formless absorptions have the defining characteristic of nondisturbancethey do not consider the notions that physical forms are permanent or that they are impermanentSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who possess those attributes indications and signs are revealed to be irreversibleare endowed with pristine cognition that cannot be captivatedMedhā to the rightYes there is What type is it Oh it is but a poor onesentient beings having less desirefrom the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they are seated at the Focal Point of Enlightenment even for the sake of their own lives do not deprive any sentient being of lifeAs the Blessed Ones fame spread throughout the world he became known by various names and epithets such as the Blessed One the Worthy One the Perfectly and Completely Awakened One He Who Is Both Wise and Virtuous the BlissGone One the Knower of the World the Peerless Guide Who Tames Beings the Teacher of Gods and Men and the Blessed BuddhaWe thought We have obtained a great deal meaning nirvāṇa from the Tathāgata which is like that daily wageLike a vase of unbaked clay they naturally breakSimilarly the pratyekabuddhas the bodhisattvas and the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas do not dream dreams and they are not dreamers of dreams and so onThey should praise and rejoice in others who cultivate the understanding through which the fruit of entering the stream is actualizedHow do they act according to the teaching of the thusgone onesBoth their body and mind become blissful These are the benefits of endeavoring in meditation āradvatīputra do you think that the real nature of physical forms constitutes a bodhisattvaThe laypeople will come to think of them As their teachersYou have great compassion that loves the world and seeks to benefit ordinary beingsgods and humans alikeby accomplishing their welfare and happinessBlessed One if it is so that were I to become a buddhaacquired eloquenceOne is thirsty has red eyes And is constantly suffering with feverWhen he saw them he said to the monksMañjuśrī what are bodhisattva great beings who have only one birth remaining likeurethral fistula a latent or raging feverI will practice the six transcendent perfections until even the names of the temporal divisions of month fortnight season and year as employed by sentient beings are no longer existentHis elephants horses conveyances and chariots all fell to the groundSubhūti In terms of this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom those bodhisattvas of irreversible realization should investigate the transcendent perfection of generosity the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent perfection of wisdom and in the same vein all the other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscienceThey are all approaching their final existence and surrounded by an assembly of gods they each delight the gods with the appearance of their passing demonstrating the gateway to the light of DharmaIt is purity of action It is the transcendence of the minds perceptionsSimilarly they do not think May I be reborn as a universal monarchlord of the four continentsIt may be possible for the winds to shake Those mountains declared to be unshakablethen it goes without saying that this is also the case for the thusgone ones who have accomplished roots of virtue throughout millions of eonsand like someone who has perfected the accumulations In this way he sat down on the grass seat and crossed his legs facing toward the eastKnowing that one knows Nirvāṇa deathlessness and peaceso that they can hear from afar the voicesOne should explain this tantra to him aloneSimilarly Subhūti all things have the modality of real naturethey will never abandon their physical and mental perseveranceIt was unconfused harmless and without hesitationturn away from themTo whom can I turn to about my son To whom shall I cry out in my pain Who will give life back to my only son Who is barely aliveThere is no self in this bodyThose bodhisattvas who have the power of retention Accomplish countless benefits for beings They will stand up and state That is not the teaching of the Buddha what cannot be cognized by the ear nose tongue body or mind consciousnessMonks at whichever place the previous thusgone ones the worthy ones turned the wheel of Dharma at that place there appeared one thousand jewel thrones made of seven kinds of jewelsMoreover ten million beings focused upon taking refuge in the Buddha Dharma and Saṅgha and generated bodhicitta for the first timeNārāyaṇa a bodhisattva relying on the true meaning does not reduce his wordsIf someone were to make into the smallest particles of dust All the worlds in a realm of a billion worlds AndThe deceaseds body comes to possess the natural aspects of an ordinary persons formYou performed and amassed an incomparable and immutable wealth of DharmaWhere should he take up residenceSubhūti if the evil Māra were to conjure up the eight great hells with their sentient denizens in the presence of those great bodhisattva beings who are irreversiblenosign is stainlessnowish is nondisturbanceNoble sir how should a sick bodhisattva control his own mind He possessed the Dharma of the tathāgatas In the age of destruction he was a treasure of the DharmaWhen he said the letter au out came the statement Spontaneously generated aupapādukaThe Blessed One criticised lying in many waysand said This profound Dharma is the attainment of buddhahoodand omniscience inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaledThe subtle Dharma that is difficult to perceive And emptiness and peace that is unequaled and inconceivableIt eliminates any views and brings about insightBy reversing the conception of I one will not incite what follows from thatdo not have desire for any form sound smell taste or touchI pay homage to you who know the benefits of sublime diligenceWhat are these fourNoble son bodhisattvas do not transgress the thusgone ones points for training in the way that otherwise causes birth in the animal realm and once born there the unbearable suffering experienced by animalsMañjuśrī answered Bhagavān yes they doWhile the Blessed Buddha was resident at the Banyan Grove near Kapilavastuthe precise identity of clinging the source of clinging the cessation of clinging and the path leading to its cessationthe great bodhisattva mahāsattva Youthful MañjuśrīWith that the king may settle down become gentle and relaxAs for truth renunciation is born of true thoughtsMy births have come to an end I have lived the holy life I have done what needed doing I will know no lives after this oneIt did not fall upon them because they took refuge and adopted the precepts in the presence of the Blessed OneBodhisattvas should live in freedom for all beings alike and live without apprehending a self sentient being life sustenance being or personThereupon the Licchavi bodhisattva Ratnākara with five hundred Licchavi youths each holding a precious parasol made of seven different kinds of jewels came forth from the city of Vaiśālī and presented himself at the grove of mrapālīāradvatīputra do you think that the real nature of the eyes constitutes a bodhisattvaAt that time and in those days the lifespan of the Bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha RatnapadmacandraviśuddhābhyudgatarājaKing uddhodana sitting in the female quarters thought to himselfThen Vajragarbha askedYour Majesty who would you have defend a position firstAs numerous as are the names And aspirations of all beingsBodhisattva Mahāsattva Sūryagarbhanow he joined the Dharmaway of all awakened onesIt became perfumed by very precious incense and perfumesSon the royal priesthood for which you have made offerings to the gods performed fire pūjaHonorable One having come here alone to a secluded place I had gone into meditative retreat when the following thought arose in my mindāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of sights constitutes a bodhisattvaThey see bodhisattvas residing in perfectly enjoyable kūṭāgārasShe then went south but there as well she met the BodhisattvaThus if they so wish they can place all Jambudvīpa upon the tip of a single hairis internally without supportThrough such acts they have to remain in hell for a long time and they develop the wish to hurt other beings in the hellsThere resounded from the sky above the beautiful melodious and gentle sounds of drums without their being beatenBodhisattvas likewise emerge from the waters of cyclic existence and yet they are not stuck thereAnd then at a later time The Jina passed into nirvāṇaWhen they hear of my past conduct They will make vast offerings to the buddhas In the same vein all the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are not one thing and illusions anotherThis can be undone by censing with honey incenseUttaramatiBy not being dominated by any propagators of other doctrines one will have a voice like the roar of a lionāradvatīputra just as darkness when the sun has risen is without foundationThe Tathāgata is a reflected imageBecause one resides in the mindthe mind that abides in the fathers semenAltogether a retinue of  million entered the palace each sitting on a lion throne according to rankIgnorance and formative factors Are naturally empty and inertEven if all sentient beings had become pratyekabuddhas who dwell alone like the rhinocerosReverend I have come from distant lands just now and I seek to speak with you about passing the rainy season in distant landsall of them are transformed into a single element which is exclusively the water elementhe took off for the palace of King uddhodana surrounded by one million two hundred thousand gods bathing the entire city of Kapilavastu in lightThere are two conditional four secret Sixteen natural and two empowered chakrasThe strength of ten bodhisattvas who have achieved acceptance that phenomena are unborn is the same as the strength of one bodhisattva who dwells on the levels and has taken his or her last existenceTheir speech was honest with a smiling demeanor their countenances without frowns of angerSimilarly they perfect the other aspects of emptiness from the emptiness of external phenomena and the emptiness of nonentities up to the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristicsneither tolerance nor maliceThe monk officiants petition to ordain After that the monk officiant petitions the saṅghaConsciousness is the causal condition of name and formTo these he applied himself with diligence energy and exertionAfter the mother and the father

individual liberation consists inIt is like a dream being an unreal visionSubhūti the transcendent perfection of wisdom is neither heard nor seen owing to the nature of phenomena being inanimateIn each of the mansions appeared  victory banners made of divinely manufactured fabric each of them covered in a lattice of small golden bellsI will by all means avoid this helllike experience of the wombBringing all beings joy in this comprehensive manner they empower them with the Dharma in order to bring them further perfect circumstances and joyIf a man were to stand before me and praise me With his hands together in homage for an entire eon With many quintillions of verses While seeking for this supreme enlightenmentāriputra womens bodies have twentyfive more groups of parasites that are not like the ones present in mens bodiesLater when the sacred Dharma has disappeared in that buddha realm Mahāsthāmprāpta will awaken there to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahoodThey obtain their food through the Buddhas merit But these fools do not keep that in mind I myself will never rob order someone to rob or rejoice in anyone being robbedSuch a monk claims What do I know I know

joyous speech you delight gods and humansFrom the left side Duścintitacintin saidOcean nāgas in the guise of brahmins and householders gathered there and listened to the shapeshifting nāga teach the DharmaWhen existence ceases birth ceasesThe venerable Maudgalyāyana then replied to the Blessed OneIn the emptiness of both external and internal phenomena the emptiness of emptiness is not discernedSimilarly the transcendence of the understanding of all phenomena the understanding of the aspects of the path and omniscience is always without fearWith the power of kindness teachI have not been touched I have not been burned by this great fireHe has the power to know how all habitual tendencies are formed and how all defiled states without exception are exhausted ThereforeThe followers of the bodhisattvas Who are renowned and are as numerousThose who have assumed such forms do not at all experience sufferingswhen he saw a poor man on his begging rounds holding a staff and a broken beggars bowlIt is in this way Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings set out sentient beings for the wellbeing of the worldsThey felt an immense love for the Guide And took refuge in the Buddha Dharma and Saṅgha Thus have I heard at one timeTo the bodhisattva mahāsattvas he taught the Dharma that commences with the highest complete enlightenmentthe bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly

the buddhas and pratyekabuddhas The śrāvakas of the buddhas Brahmā Indra and the guardians of the world The yakṣa generals and śvara The yakṣa warriors And Hārītī with her sonsand in return the monks gave them the leftovers from their begging bowlsVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection constitutes the steps of meditative equipoiseThis concludes the first chapter the introduction to the tantra in the glorious Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa tantra called The Sole HeroThose tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas who are alive and reside teaching the sacred doctrine at the present time in the world systems of the ten directions numerous as the sands of the River Ganges are also nonconceptual and they have abandoned all thoughts and conceptsand for a hundred and forty thousand million years I listened to the samādhi the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomenaSimilarly Subhūti the transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely pure owing to the absolute purity of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessVenerable Subhūti is it then the case that those sentient beings resemble a magical displayin the same vein they teach the doctrine so that they might cultivate the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThese methods quickly liberate beings from negative views and actions from unwholesome intentions from wrong objects of refuge and from a mind engaged in negativityThere are some who only stand some who dont talk and some who hold the vīrāsana body posture Oh Oh You possess the Dharma and have marvelous qualities You are as rare as a flower on the sacred fig treeIn this way they complete the third concentration free of joy and remain within itand in the same vein the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities are nonapprehensible owing to their utter puritypillars adorned with divine precious jewelsThe prince the noble horse as well as ChandaThis sacred doctrine is compatible with the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold paththey may attract by their generosity those sentient beings who are attracted by generosityThey know with certainty the emptiness of phenomena And cannot be swayed by any opponent Ratnākara SusārthavāhaWhat is the result of living a holy life What are its benefitsTherefore I will definitely practice generosity by offering residencesimmediately on touching it the ailments would be alleviated by the brilliance of this precious gemstoneThey will not

including Akaniṣṭha are discernedAs appropriate objects for others generosity they are worthy recipients of offeringsSon of noble family you can also consider the accumulations of generosity and

multicolored beds beautiful gardens and beautiful poolsThe gods speak truthfully The earth abides truthfully The Buddha and the Dharma too are true May truth reign Not deceptionalong with many thousands of other gods will deliberately follow themAnd as the Buddha vanquished the unbelievers gatheringsThereupon the Buddha said to the Licchavi Vimalakīrtiwhenever they do not engage with the notions that all attainments up to and including omniscience are with attachment or that they are without attachmentI was in the past attached to views I was an esteemed tīrthika mendicantSubhūti it is because the emptiness of the eyes will not attain emancipation from the three world systems andAnd the experience of the victorious ones is entirely inconceivableTheir knowledge is boundlessThat is called the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristicsThe Bhagavān answered Mañjuśrī what do you thinkHow are they delightful to accompanyis neither afflicted nor purified and is neither enhanced

similarly regarding all the attributes and attainments up to and including enlightenmentSimilarly the moonlike bodhisattvas constantly wish for and seek the joy of the Dharma and have no liking for the pleasures of passionfor they enable one to teach modes of conduct that accord with the interests of sentient beings and to practice all the teachings of the Buddhathey do not change nor do they harm one anotherThey make the realm of Māra shudder They make the māras shakethe sky above was covered with divine food and these words were spokenHis canines are sharp and well spacedconfer its transmissionThey do not perceive all phenomena as empty nor do they harbor doubt regarding any phenomenonTremendous harm will unfold and a lot of unhappiness will be experienced in such a placeThey should also encourage others to acquire the meditative concentrations up to and including the fourthIn addition the tathāgatas definitively know multiple world systems and diverse sensory elementsinstead of focusing on the lineage of the Buddha the lineage of the Dharma the lineage of the Saṅgha and the Great VehicleSimilarly through pure clairvoyance that surpasses the range of human sight they perceive all beings who move in accordance with their past actionsFor this question Lion of the ākyas supreme human You gave away horses elephants and chariots Slaves jewels silver and pearlsI should encourage all sentient beings also to assume the first meditative concentration correct actionvenerable KauṣṭhilaThey declared Ah today a second buddha has been born in this worldbut

spread to the cardinal and intermediate directionsCountless bodhisattva great beings developed without developing it the acceptance that phenomena are unborngave a detailed teaching on this episode from the past by chanting the following verses to the youth Candraprabhathe cold the heat the hunger the thirst I pay homage to any monks Who possess this samādhithe light that sees all sentient beings facetoface the one that shines on the minds and thoughts of all beings so that they appear exactly as they are the great arrayBhagavān all the abodes of Māra are shakenAfter passing the rainy season at the monastery a retired devotee left for rāvastīHe is neither the other shoreThis one is not the tathāgata nor is he a śrāvaka of the tathāgataFurthermore if bodhisattvas who refrain from late meals becomes afflicted by a disease that is a threat to their life or an obstacle to virtuous practiceThey accurately know a mind that has desire to be a mind that has desireand said Elders do you know who I amAt other times King Mahāpadma and his armies were dominantThe sentient beings of that world system took an interest in the lesser pathsthen the voice of the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas endowed with its sixty aspects would not envelop the countless innumerable worlds of the ten directions HoweverAll the bodhisattva great beings then circumambulated the Blessed One three times and sat to one side to listen to the DharmaSome of the soldiers swung their lassosAlways be good and gentle Always have pure conduct and a serene mindCovered with the lotuses of the seven puritiesBlessed One what is understood by no deceptionYou are the supreme physician remover of thornsVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is nonexistentHe had a śrāvaka saṅgha of six hundred million arhatsthe  kinds of conduct in which all three come togetherUpasena how many years have you passed as a monk How many years has your ward passedIn all those arrogant sentient beings that migrate in saṃsāra You found no life force or substanceIf you ask what they do not know and do not seeLikewise āradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings breathe in mindfully and breathe out mindfullyUpon seeing them the meeting occurs with great intensityor from a seed that is damagedrecognition of freedom from desirous attachment recognition of cessation recognition of deaththe emptiness of emptiness the emptiness of great extent the emptiness of ultimate realityThey cast gold and gold dust And spread out clothingThrough the power of the Buddha they recalled the blessed buddhas of innumerable and incalculable eons remembering the qualities of the buddha realms of each blessed buddha as well as the retinue that surrounded the buddhas and the teachings they gaveHe is not a whole nor a conglomerationConsider noble son the analogy of the wide and infinite earthHaving said this the Bhagavān fell silentThey will honor venerate respect and make offerings to the tathāgatasEnlightenment is not attained by mere words For one who is dedicated to practice enlightenment will not be difficult to attain the king among kings the king of DharmaIt is like seeing the stainless and faultless light of Kāśyapa the Dharma kingThey should always be trained in by the wise ones Who wish for the enlightenment of buddhahood they hear many aspects of divine and human soundWhen they see beings who are proud Arrogant and constantly heedlessThose with reference points are left without referenceThe Blessed One thoughthe does not practice by thinking The future mind has yet to be obtainedPracticing the transcendent perfection of wisdomHow should they train to be reborn in the god realm of TrayastriṃśaPratyekabuddhas and bodhisattva mahāsattvas will appear in the worldto cure fever heart diseases cough and so onSo since women steal ones virtues I have abandoned their companythey defaced a wall belonging to the saṅgha with their spitWise ones do not have any

heart center And like the winds at the end of an eon cause them to dispersenor does the expanse of reality exist separate from physical formsNoble son the thusgone ones teaching of the Dharma is inexhaustibleIn the same vein they do not consider whether or not they engage in union with the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas or with all other attainments up to and including omniscienceMoreover young manIf you ask why Subhūti it is because they are absolutely nonapprehensibleI may have the strength of concentration and supernatural knowledgeHe cherishes solitude but does not avoid mental and physical effortsSuch is the bodhisattvas fear of karmathey will move from buddhafield to buddhafieldrefraining from accumulating alms bowls Dharma robes and utensilsFrom their mouths will come the scent of the blue lotusThey drink hot water water leftover after washing rice water filtered through a blanket and dishwateravoiding formation by means of a preceding wisdom and being truly elevated throughout all lives without any evil It is the mode of peace complete peace total peace That mode does not dwell anywhereUtterly without compareThe conventional distinction between virtue and nonvirtue Is for ordinary people to be guarded in their mindsMonks I then went to rāḍa Kālāma and asked himThey do not mingle with them either on their walkways or in their templesWhat is being together with excellent beings It is attending upon buddhas bodhisattvas pratyekabuddhas and śrāvakasIt does not bring higher knowledge nor does it lead to complete awakeningThey sprinkle powder of sandalwood Of the best incenses and the powder of agarwood While moving like birds through the sky They have appropriately sprinkled them on the Lords of JinasIt is dualistic to say Buddha Dharma and SaṅghaHer eyes are like lotus petalsHe has the power to know all previous situations without attachment ThereforeThough his consciousness lacks form it makes various kinds of forms manifestIs eclipsed dimmed and shines no more than a pool of inkone does not run toward dharmasThough I roamed and searched in all the cardinal and intermediate directionsthe precise identity of feeling the source of feeling the cessation of feeling and the path leading to its cessationI have come to learn spiritual practices from you rāḍa Kālāma replied Gautama I shall give you a teaching through which a faithful person of good family can accomplish omniscience with very little hardshipIn the same wayAt that time King uddhodana had five hundred types of ornaments made by five hundred ākyasthe aggregate of liberation is still discernedPure luminescent beings with great merit stand by your doorA being may make offerings By filling as many buddha realms As there are grains of sand in the Ganges River With flowers for the protectors of the worldYour recollection has no outflowsSimilarly there is nobody at all who transmigrates from here after death and is born elsewhereThis entire ground having broken open Throughout all the four directionsThen Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara offered lotus flowers to the Bhagavat andWhether humans or guhyakas may hold up their swords and axesIs the second union of great blissYoung man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who have these four qualities will attain this samādhiI was even the guard at his doorWhat is the level of a noble being It is the state of bodhisattva trainingThe Blessed One surrounded by a retinue of many hundreds of thousands surveyed those before him and taught the Dharmaso instead I shall go forth among the ascetic sons

effort mindfulness and absorptionthus was he able to swiftly attain acceptance of the superknowledgesMay the Bhagavat also today bestow his favorwhereas other bodhisattvas do not possess anything like itThere will be many bodhisattvas with great power Who will turn the irreversible wheelThat color however was not present within the body of the seedand so they will consider leaving that placeBreaks should also be understood to be fourThe one who wishes to become a buddha a lord of the Dharma Who is adorned by the thirtytwo signsThus noble son bodhisattvas take on whatever form may be required to train a particular sentient beingout of sightHave no concept of a self no concept of being No concept of a soul and no concept of an individualDuring that time the lower existences have multiplied And rebirths as devas have diminishedEven should my skin flesh bones and marrow shrivel up right hereIn the same way one should do the practice of all beingswomen and menāriputra in that way the Tathāgata the Arhat the perfectly enlightened Buddha sees many millions of beings liberated from the three realms which are filled with danger fear terror and calamity These beings come out through the doorway of the tathāgatas teachings and are freed from danger fear terror and calamity and attain the bliss of nirvāṇaAnd obtain the peace of this stainless samādhiThe attainment of those who form the resolve set on unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening is a most excellent attainment indeedVenerable Lord How do those who have obsessively carried out and accrued unendurable deeds of speech carry out and accrue deeds that are destitute of the sacred doctrineOne emerges from the womb as a newbornThe same is to be said about the ears the nose the tongue and the body as wellMañjuśrī repliedWhen seven days have passed he or she should observe the procedure for worshipOne should cut the nail on ones index finger And smear the finger with the above substancesShe should surround the area With threads of five different colorsTaught this tantra for the sake of the worldTathāgata Padmottama extended his arm like an elephant extending its trunk and offered a hundred thousand precious strings of pearls to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraHe had achieved his goal and was elevated by his former aspirationsOne should chew up the root of rāmadūtī together with the leaves put this on the penis and make love Then she will dripMañjuśrī this tathāgata arhat perfectly complete buddha Stainless Light the Essence of the Sun was able to live for nine thousand eonsJārī and caṇḍālikā Snehamallī and ghee

sellers or pimpsmastery of life as ones lifespan is blessed to last for innumerable immeasurable eonsOne hundred hetvindriyas is called a samāptalambhathought Goodness is that Brahmā Or perhaps akra king of the gods or Vaiśravaṇa Or is it some kind of mountain godHigh bed grand bed And also eating at inappropriate timesDharmaśrī Glory of the DharmaBuddha defeated Māra And so the Dharma does to unrighteousnessLikewise These are the meditative concentrationsWith the four means of attracting disciples you gather beings And establish them on the path to perfect awakeningThose who offer flowers to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara will have aromatic bodies andhave been ripened for the highest complete enlightenmentAt a time when the King of Aṅga and his armies were dominantIf there are a hundred thousand aromas in one place they will smell them all and know them allNoble son this is how they worship and venerate the thusgone onesI am from the SouthHow blissful your body must be bearing the Perfect BeingTo their bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs Upāsakas and upāsikās And topknot jewels and necklaces Worth a hundred millionThe inner torment of the deluded attached dying person is sorrowthe one who is not stained by worldly concerns the protector of the worldI accurately understood the precise identity of name and form the source of name and form the cessation of name and form and the path leading to its cessationMaitreya you work for the benefit of many peopleThey approach with their hands held out and because they desire the food boiled in the cauldrons they open their mouths and swallow the copper and brassare all conceptual and specific instructionsThis completes the twentysixth chapter from The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled RejoicingSuch people prevent this sūtra from being written down and veneratedIn order to pay homage to all the buddhas and the bodhisattva great beings in all the infinite and limitless worlds in the ten directionsnor reflect upon itHow you may wonder are they free from impure acquisitionsThe nature is purityHe understood the mundane and transcendental sciences and esoteric practices yet always took pleasure in the delights of the DharmaNot dwelling upon worldly dharmasIt was an exquisite wheel adorned with all kinds of jewels gems and various other embellishments It had a hub a rim and a thousand spokessimilarly drives all those other attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasFor many hundred thousand quintillions of eons on this Vulture Peak MountainThe Lord of the World is completely beautiful With a body that is the color of goldSo they would regress and become degenerate if they were to engage in such deeds destitute of the sacred doctrine This is why bodhisattvas should restrain their verbal actionsSo come let us go and worship the Lord of MenUntil the date of the full moon they must keep a compassionate attitude toward all beingsthis āradvatīputra is the transcendent perfection of tolerance possessed by great bodhisattva beingsdo not waste what has been given in faith like Kāśyapas monksthey talk about the perfection of meditationSuch is the power speed strength and ability of a bodhisattva great being in his or her last existence immediately after birth do not have it committed to writing do not retain hold or master itThey had entered the unfathomable vehicleand likewise when they engage in union with the emptiness of the sensory element of sights and the sensory element of visual consciousnessand gum trees produce many flavorsNoble one you are our peer We grew up together playing in the dirt with youand similarly the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas of the world systems of the southern direction the western direction the northern direction and similarly of the four intermediate directionsāriputra the tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas who in the pastdo not take what is not givenThey know the motivations and conduct of other beings And they know what should be said to themSubhūti because the expanse of reality is not an entitySenior āradvatīputra physical forms are empty of the nature of physical forms and in that regard there is no birth nor is the emancipation of nirvāṇa apprehensibleThey will not degenerate from the noble eightfold pathand they will also know and behold many hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvas establishing in their discussions how omniscience should be attainedThat the eyeconsciousness does not perceive Mañjuśrī is signlessnessFor so long he has totally given up divisive talk and has not accepted advice that might lead to dispute shining with the complete harmony of concord He has criticized divisive talk and praised the qualities of getting along in complete harmony Therefore he is called the One with Forty Even TeethVenerable Lord The Tathāgata Arhat Genuinely Perfect Buddha has not yet spoken of all the qualities which sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage acquire when they hold maintain recite aloud master and are attentive to this transcendent perfection of wisdom in the right mannerIt entails the absorption in the four immeasurable aspirations through acceptance that phenomena are nonarisingWhy do you say that the designation of the sensory element of the eyes the sensory element of sights and the sensory element of visual consciousness does not constitute a bodhisattvaInside the city Is a garden with flowers in full bloomI am cultivating all other attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasHence with a wish not to relish or conceive of joy and bliss they raise their minds above the first concentrationNoble one I entrust this teaching to youWith that he became the venerable āriputras attendant apprentice and follower correct speechHe is adept in how things arise based on causes And how the cessation and termination of conditioned existence leads to the calm stateTheir minds fixed upon their games The children continue to be unawareIn the same vein they should not abide in the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThen the Bhagavān addressed the bodhisatva Jayamati as followsone hundred thousand gods felt joyous pleased and elatedVenerable nanda the term bodhisattva is a designation that functions as a basis for communicationVenerable Lord it is because the transcendent perfection of wisdom is nonconceptualThey were free of mental afflictions their minds were very calmnor is it past future or presentHe may follow the ways of hatred yet he feels no anger toward any living beingThey embody all the accumulations of merit and wisdomestablished in a state of blissthen said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva NakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijñaThe body is empty of a self and what belongs to a selfReverend āriputra did not the Tathāgata declare that all things have the nature of a magical creationthe transcendent perfection of generosity the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdomand master itSubhūti the real nature of feelings the essential nature of feelings and the defining characteristics of the essential nature of feelings and similarly the real nature of perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness the essential nature of consciousness and so forth and the defining characteristics of the essential nature of consciousness and so forthWhen one has accumulated karma through the conditions of the consciousnessesthat merchant or householder has equal concern for all the children He would therefore deliver them from the house whenever he encountered themHe thought It is because of the being who has entered her wombGreat King  Prince Sarvārthasiddha moves with the serene gait of an elephantSimilarly they perfect the other bodhisattva levels up to and including the tenth level without any longing for them arisingbe free of the workings of demonsThe noble ones pursuit is a nondualistic pursuitWith their wisdom they bring happiness to many Trillions of beings establishing them in the Dharma Likewise when the sunlike bodhisattvas shine all sorts of virtuous qualities become possibleLater that same day the monk arrived and the monks asked himBut Gopā knowing the intelligence and steadfastness of the BodhisattvaBut that seed is not transferred from the treetrunk to the treetop nor is the seed observable inside the treeOh no my sonHe will satisfy beings with the water of the Dharmaunsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is itself the emptiness of inherent existenceTherefore whoever has faith in me Shall eliminate the three lower realmsThey then addedWhile he behaves in accord with the world And conquers the afflictions of desire inside the womens quartersformative predispositions another thing consciousness another thing and the emptiness of inherent existence yet anotherand similarly when they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the aggregates from physical forms to consciousness are purifiedTo beings who are to be trained by means of the Hearers Vehicle they teach the path of the hearers and not the bodhisattva pathVenerable Lord Those great bodhisattva beings who strive toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and who wish to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment are engaged in a difficult task inasmuch as all things are empty of their own defining characteristicsthe training and the qualities will quickly display unending confidence of speechSome said She cares for me with sandalwood musk and camphorAlthough ultimately utterly unreal relatively they train in the path by means of not trainingThey will take refuge in me emptiness of nonentitiesThe symptoms of being afflicted by a yakṣa graha belonging to my entourage Venerable Blessed One are as followsThe same occurred in the southwest the same in the west the same in the northwest the same in the north the same in the northeast and in the downward directionThey appear in the form of friends and relatives And begin conversationHow wonderful it will be if I can perfectly realize supreme perfect enlightenment and become a buddha among themThe nāga daughters also joyfully and respectfully venerated the SageA nāga girl joyfully and devotedly erects a splendid throne On which the guide of the universe peacefully sitsIt accomplishes all activity even without practicethen encourage them through many such reasons to acquire the levels of the śrāvakas and the pratyekabuddhasWhen the calls of the crow and the donkey ring out It is wise to quickly retreatAs soon as they connect with this vision Belief in the transitory collection Ethical discipline in the form of extreme austerity And doubt are simultaneously cast off And they see the truths of the noble ones Thus they are called the most precious gem of the SaṅghaO King great fortune Your son has been born adorned with signsSubhūti do you think that the tathāgatas are sublime and without contaminantsWhen practicing generosity by giving away their skinultimately there is no attainmentapproached the man and askedThey develop a vast attraction to the buddhas And gain a vast inconceivable benefit And they will always be in the form of A donkey pig jackal or dogWhat are the tenIn the analogy a sprout arises and when it is the right season it produces flowersWhen their attributes are meditated on their nature is empty Know that all phenomena are like that Apart from focusing on omniscience they have no other wishHe will be unable to accept another bowl Lets go so that he can accept themHaving reflected on this silently for a moment they said to each other This is the power of the ThusGone OneThe other gods who are overcome by their pride will see us paying homage to the Bodhisattva and they will cast aside their pride haughtiness and arrogance A pleasing sense of modesty and selfrespect Speaking appropriate words knowledge of the worldThen the teacher the Vajra Holder The Great Glorious One stood up on his seatit is comparable to spaceKauśika physical forms are empty of physical formsSimilarly they discern through their minds endowed with omniscience that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are impermanent and do not focus on themall arhatsthe manifestation of this great miracle these earthquakes and this great rain of flowersUp in the air they vanished and appeared down on the groundHe stores the crystal money and pearls There inside this residenceVenerable Lord There would be many meritsthey do not associate with malice in order to desist from maliceSome are writing out documents And some are calculating interestHe establishes them in meditative concentration tolerance the dhāraṇīs and the groundsAjita this man this lord of generosity this lord of great generosity gives these gifts in that way for eighty yearsListen all of you just listen to this nonsenseBhagavān with regard to the essence of space it is thus Its particular characteristic is that it is not differentiated it is nonconceptual completely nonconceptual unmoving and lacking in substancealso praise the abstention from wrong views and the other nonvirtuous actionsThey will send emanations To make homage to millions of buddhas Mahauṣadhi the tip of a persons tongue senses bitter pungent sour sweet and salty tastesWhen they arrived there they bowed their heads to the Bhagavāns feetAnd today Lord we have obtained the result Of that good conduct we have previously practicedI gave away male and female servants riches and grain And also jewels pearls gold and silver Brother Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra Brother SubhūtiThrough attention at the time of his death his divine gaze will also see multistoried beautiful buildingsdivine princes it is because dreams magical displays and nirvāṇa are without duality and cannot be bisectedBrahmā going ahead expelled all untamed creaturesWhen noble disciples experience feelings which are neither pleasant nor painful then feelings of pleasure and pain come to a haltBearing their loads of wood they came to the house in which the teacher of brahmins livedTherefore everything is ignoranceThey are unblemishedVenerables prepare a sweatchamber for the saṅgha and for meso I will take some merchandise to sell in another landO Delusion Vajrī accept this flower Hū phaṭEven though he may be equal to buddhasMoreover those worlds do not harm each other and none of the beings within them will suffer any harmthe attributes of the śrāvakas are also gathered thereinNow swiftly manifest your strength and couragenot even a place the size of a mustard seed where he has not given up his own body for the sake of beingstheir burdens relinquishedDivine being moreover when bodhisattvas as they practice generosity give by relinquishing the gift the giver the recipient the context of giving and the purpose of the gift such bodhisattvas rely on nothing and do not remain fixed on anythingResiding there they give their approval saying Excellent excellent noble son You have acquired such a wishfulfilling jewel as this Seven generations of your descendants will attain liberation Noble son even all the beings who live in your stomach will become irreversible bodhisattvasSo if there should occur sufferingThe brahmin thoughtOwing to the fact that sentient beings are without essential natureShe is blue greatly exalted in meritThis completes the tantra of Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa called The Sole HeroChildren of noble family consider this analogyThey will all be golden and be born miraculouslyThey do not seek enlightenment as other than consciousnessshone at that time throughout the world realm VairocanaraśmipratimaṇḍitāUnderstanding the nature of concepts his mind does not engage in duality Such is the entrance into nondualityWho would like to increase His merit splendor power and renownAnointing ears and eyes with clarified butterThe tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas accomplish that which is extremely difficultIn it there are no lord buddhas no bodhisattvas and no śrāvakasA potter makes all bowls from clay equallyThis is the time to teach the DharmaThese are the dreams that appear to the daughter of the ākyasand to be unhindered in all actions while gaining realizationThe nature of consciousness is indeed nonarisingHe ends the terrors of beings in the lower realms In unfortunate existences and in the hellsthe other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities are neither heard nor seen owing to the nature of phenomena being inanimateVenerable Lord if the notion of sights as calm is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of sights as not calm become a bodhisattvaMay those in the womb be protected May children have wellbeingattain the state of great compassionIt is the giving of all accumulated roots of virtue to all living beingsFrom these ornaments the sound of melodious songs of the five qualities even more beautiful than divine music also emergedthe Blessed One received abundant savory food and drink robes alms bowlsNot only does that acceptance have no objectThose who ridicule and mock those who write out such a sūtra as this will have broken teethThe nature of omniscience is indeed nonarisingTherefore those eyes will be stainless Unpolluted and purelikewise all the aggregates up to and including consciousness are impermanentMahāmaudgalyāyana then took the two novices for their daily practiceA fine and beautiful elephant white as snow or silver More dazzling than the sun and the moon well proportioned With beautiful legs six great tusks and joints as firm as diamond Entered my wombplease listen to this storyI remember that many eons ago in the pastAt bedtime one should recite the mantra eight hundred timesjust as noncessation nonsignlessness nonaffliction nonpurification and nonconditioning neither come to rest nor do they not come to restThree young ākyas called Bhadrika Mahānāma and Aniruddha tried for a long time to lift the ornaments but they were unable to These ornaments were made for someone with a body as strong as Nārāyaṇa and so other people were not able to wear themSome like Brahmā have peaceful forms Their peaceful minds rest calmly and their concentration is firmOne billion seven hundred and sixty million townsO Prajñāpāramitā hū phaṭhonors it venerates it worships it and makes offerings to itOn this day my wishes have been fulfilledSmiling at one another the nāgas and their nāga womenJust so do I postulants name toothe Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and having greeted me saidOne whose mind is in equipoise Should prepare a pleasant seat First one should cultivate loving kindness Second compassion Third sympathetic joy And to complete the lot equanimitySubhūti when certain great bodhisattva beings lacking the transcendent perfection of wisdom offer donations to those who have entered the stream over eons equal in number to the sands of the River Ganges andOne hundred visaṃjñāgatis is called a sarvasaṃjñaon a human skullHis voice is not loudHe may follow the ways of the rich yet he is without acquisitiveness and often reflects upon the notion of impermanenceAt that time akra Brahmā and all the guardians of the world who were present in the gathering saidNoble one since I entered the ocean I have guided all these beings that have appeared hereJñānābala and Jñānaviśeṣaga Jñānābhibhū and Jñānasamudgataand do not say that which is anything other than trueRatnākaraAnd they sent down a rain of flowers Having come to see the Buddha the Lord of sages Part of the way into their voyage they and their seafaring ship were held up by nāgasYou should persevere in those teachings which actualize the fruit of entering the streamThose of great magical powers Will be as numerous as the grains of sand in the GangesSons of noble family you know that the time has come so please go aheadNonetheless Nārāyaṇa I will use an analogy in order to communicate this point and in order that the absorption that encapsulates all merit may be brought to perfection and in order that beings who desire merit may be granted a basis for obtaining that and in order that the great diligence of beings on the vehicle of bodhisattvas may be brought to perfectionnanda I was skillful in my means and soExcellent excellent said the Blessed One Thus it is noble sonThe nonperception of smell is to have no abodeMoreover Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom thinkI should be equipoised in such meditative concentrations     tWhen practicing generosity by giving away gold silver jewels pearls beryls conch shells moonstones coral and other precious substancesHaving become a bodhisattva you must complete the perfection of generositythe bodhisattva Mahāvikrāmin the bodhisattva AnantavikrāmiṇThey should meditate on the strength of patience rely on patience and promulgate patienceThe buddhas the supreme humans will know it And will expound this single yāna of mine These great bodhisattva beings have been exclusively foreordained by the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas to be irreversible in their attainment of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentof the great compassion consummated in the concentration of the holy Dharma on the liberation of all living beingsDesire anger and dullnessAll the composite phenomena there are And all the noncomposite phenomenaAnd quickly become compassionate Similarly you should not misconstrue unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as the emptiness of internal phenomena as the emptiness of external phenomena as the emptiness of both external and internal phenomena or as the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesSimilarly the transcendence of the eyes is not the eyesThey will never have the many different kinds of afflictionsAnd they follow that profound wisdom They do not preoccupy themselves with talk about the self sentient beings living creatures lives and the other superimposed notions of a subject up to and including knowers and viewersCompassion is a gateway to the light of the DharmaThey revel in countless absorptions retentions liberations superknowledges and magical abilitiesnanda you should train thinking in this wayThe continual reliance on good beings That is the nature of the Jinas teaching The bodhisattva mahāsattva Liberator from Fear came into the temple and when he saw the monk crumpled on the ground he asked himI was thinking about the wife of King Suvarṇapati of Suvarṇadvīpa When her husbands time had come she leapt onto his funeral pyreThe jinas to whom offerings have been made in the pastAt this point the bodhisattva mahāsattva Kṣemadatta developed the supreme intentionThen both of those dharmabhāṇakas Said to the king Listen KṣatriyaThose conceptions have been destroyed Naturally with their conceptions of women Be a holder of their supreme DharmaAnd they have no longing for food and no longing for clothes That is the uniqueness of this attainment of samādhi iLet him serve the One with Abundant Merit The Jewel Mine the One Who Bestows Fearlessness and BlissKing Ratnacchattra said to his sonsHis veins are not visibleThey discern that physical forms are signless and do not focus on themSince in a previous existence I offered alms bowlsthus actualizing the fruit of a streamentererMake offerings to himHaving reached stability on the eyes of the central figure They are to meditate on the thirtyseven features in fullWell then dear boy Kolita know that the time for such a change has comelest the outsider sectarians should hear your wordswe the four great kings will go there with our armies our young warriors and our retinues to hear the DharmaBodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara will come to this great monastery of Jetavana in order to see me to bow down to me to honor me

they might grasp or reject the transcendent perfection of generosity the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdomNoble son replied the Blessed One whoever has just one among these factors in a way that is flawless uncorrupted undefiled pure accomplished and perfect has noble son all the other factors as wellIf someone were to provide tathāgatas arhats and samyaksaṃbuddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in twelve Ganges Rivers with robes food bowls bedding seats necessary medicine and utensils for an eon the accumulation of merit that would come from serving those tathāgatas would only equal the merit of the tip of one hair on the body of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraHe must never leave usThis Maitreya is how the bodhisattvas have excellent givingProstrations to the bodhisattva SarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhintAt the same time many trillions of gods assembledNoble son you may wonder how bodhisattvas pacify wandering beings torments of afflictionI for my part have concealed it very wellFor many millions of years They never hear even the name of the tathāgatas Or the Dharma or my followersThey would not be able to describe even a fraction of it Let alone describe the benefit of studying it or of possessing it The ground was strewn with purple pink red and white lotus flowers as well as the flowers of goolar fig nīpa varśika taraṇi pāṭalā aśoka kuraṇṭaka nutmeg and

maintain this practice Will be ones who listen to this sūtra With your great majesty and beautiful voice Even the majesty of the king does not shine so brightly As I have faith in only what is perfect I shall go forth from home into homelessnessSimilarly since sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena are nonapprehensible it follows that socalled sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena are nothing but mere names or conventional termsWhat is coalescencethey should burn a finger or a toe or a limb or an armHis whole dwelling swayedI have suddenly come across this king or great ministerand similarly the fruit of arhatship and actual arhats are all discernedand also woodWhen the gentle profound melodious Speech of the Buddha filled me with joyHe handed them over to the former beggar and saidOn the other hand straying from the middle way you will not pass beyond sufferingNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities are specialists in the disciplineMonks as soon as the Bodhisattva had this thought a light known as the light which conquers all demonic congregations was emitted from the hair between his eyebrowsAll who see this lamp will danceThrough the factor of birth there is old age death misery wailing suffering unhappiness and disturbanceThose with the ten strengths in the past The sugatas of the present and the futureThe Bhagavān prophesied to them all that after four million eight hundred thousand countless eonsLike the moon he had perfected all pure qualitiesPressing his palms together he askedMoreover Subhūti one should know that space is limitless because sentient beings are limitlessA hundred two hundred three four or five hundred people lived in itThey are not attracted to religious robes alms bedding and seatsTo those who suffer

tolerance they think physical forms  feelings  perceptions  formative predispositions and  consciousnessto attain the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodIt is a wheel without

the jīvika with this verseSince there are no differences between theseFor example Subhūti space is neither material nor is it immaterialI will give them eyes that can see reality Saying this you have meditated on knowledgeSubhūti emancipation will be attained from the three world systems and consequently emancipation will be attained in omniscienceSpringtime is here the best of seasonsWhy Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings not become discouraged with regard to this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomthe radiant majesty of his merit shone brightly among gods and humans As the light of the moonso that this Dharma teaching is passed on from one to another until it reaches a fiftieth personTherefore I believed I had attained nirvāṇa But this was not what is called nirvāṇa in the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth and in arhatshipSimilarly the fruit of entering the stream and likewise the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth arhatship individual enlightenment and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment are all discerned in the worldhow could they possibly come or goJust as it is difficult to fill the oceans desires can never be fulfilled Like salty water objects of desire only make you thirstierThen once again the daughters of Māra spoke to their father in verseTheir prayers are fulfilledwhether its faculties are impaired or notI rang a bell and announced I will become the slave of anyone who will give me the highest Dharma and teach me its meaningOne should therefore meditate on CaṇḍamahāroṣaṇaWhen bodhisattvas see a donor or a benefactorYou may wonder noble son what these qualities from being a source of jewels through to being inexhaustible may implyThough a hundred spears strike them a third time they still will not dieAs the light appeared it illuminated all the infinite buddha realms within all the worlds in the ten directionsYoung man what is the cultivation of this

bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see sentient beings lacking the major marksYou are the delight of King uddhodanas kingdom Who has won its hearts and mindsthat the nature of the mental faculty is emptiness and that emptiness is indeed the mental facultyLikewise they will not become fixated on the four applications of mindfulness and similarly they will not become fixated on any of the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathBlessed One they do so to train such beings through those practices replied the bodhisattva SarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhinThese are called the faculties that will enable knowledge of all that is unknownThat is how the ordinands Dharma robes that have already been cut and sewn are

real nature of the sensory element of the eyes constitutes a bodhisattvaSubhūti great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdomMy diligence is indeed not directed at the transcendence of sufferingIt is because they conceive of all those phenomena which are actually unproducedIn accordance with the aspirations formed by the thusgone ones through this offering of the marrow of my bonesSubhūti because the altruistic thoughts cultivated by great bodhisattva beings from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment up to the time when they are

TathāgataThe sound of your voice does not go beyond your followers It cuts through everyones hundreds of doubtsAt first to renounce a householders concerns and go forth is hardThey have entered homelessness in my teaching And in future times when the supreme enlightenment is vanishingSuperior intention is a gateway to the light of the Dharmalikewise the earth element the water element the fire element the wind element the space element and the consciousness element are calm and voidand when birth old age sickness and death have become known that a bodhisattva enters his mothers womband seizes the mother because of motherly love received in ones former births and also for the sake of exquisite pleasureBut aspire to the Dharma of all the jinas These are distinctive qualities of the first patience He stood up from his seat joined his palms prostrated to the Bodhisattvas feetin the manner of nonaffliction and nonpurificationThe ear is outer formSome are greater due to pedigree Others because of age or richesThe Bodhisattva then said Monks in twelve years the Bodhisattva shall enter the womb of his mother At that time the gods from the pure realms ventured to Jambudvīpawho has attained the ultimate yogaanger and ignoranceFurthermore the element of consciousnessMañjuśrī whoever sees all phenomena as not unequal nondual and not dualistically distinguishable has right viewBefore him were assembled devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinnaras mahoragas humans and nonhumans who were gazing upon him andLikewise it will form a boundary one league to the westthe Blessed Buddha KāśyapaMañjuśrī are you this eloquent because you know and understand any phenomenon whatsoeverWhen those hopes were shown to be just that and the prince Rāhulabhadra became a renunciantSimilarly the remaining steps ensue when one achieves and abides in the formless absorptions from the sense field of infinite space to the cessation of all perceptions and feelingsand then encouraged secured and established sentient beings one hundred billion trillion in number in the transcendent perfection of wisdomBy bodhisattvas who have newly entered the yāna Those who have served many millions of buddhasMy body and mind were untouched by fatigueThe most important among them isOne should add the mantra Destroy such and such disease of such and such a personTherefore even those who aspire for the sixth Meditate on the complete fifth Preceded by the fourthInasmuch as consciousness neither arises from anywhere nor does it go anywhere butSubhūti these are the six extrasensory powers of great bodhisattva beingsMahāprajāpatī Gautamī replied Of course and dressed the prince lavishlySuppose a son or daughter of noble family comes to possess this excellent qualityor if that were the case that the practice of chastity would also become a nonentity the path of the bodhisattvas would become a nonentityA god offers him saffron robes of beautiful stainless clotheventually leading him back to his mother to whom the lads friend saidNoble son you may wonder about the character of the bodhisattvas skill in worshiping and venerating the thusgone ones Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections accordingly will perfect the six transcendent perfections and also approach omniscienceWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas excellent power of their retinue consist intTheir superknowledge is unimpaired and they achieve superknowledgeNamo buddhāya namo dharmāya namaḥ saṃghāya The insects remembered the words namo buddhāya namo dharmāya namaḥ saṃghāya and the thunderbolt of wisdom destroyed the mountain which has twenty peaks that is the view of the aggregates as a selfSelfBorn One that you now live in my country Is for me the greatest gift of allPhysical harm is to run race and let ones discipline become corrupted for the sake of acquiring thingsSubhūti great bodhisattva beings should don the armor of the transcendent perfection of generositySimilarly the nonarising nonaffliction and nonpurification of the ears nose tongue and body are without foundationIn the past for billions of eons You trained in concentration to purify the afflictionsSugata the merit that those noble men and noble women will have created on that basis will be greatI am thirsty for the Dharma so quench my thirst with the taste of the DharmaThis real nature is uncreatedhe has not followed the noble pathThen if appropriate he should give various Dharma teachingsSubhūti do you think that the real nature of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness can be terminated or abandoned or does it ceaseaccompanied by many adorned horses and elephants without riders that were being led alongThen the Licchavi Vimalakīrti saw the crown prince Mañjuśrī and addressed him thusFor example Subhūti suppose there was a heroic manBe gracious to me O motherthe samādhi named AspirationIt is pure having relinquished desire anger and bewildermentafter innumerable countless eons he will attain the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodBy means of the sūtra noose They are all bound by the five fetters Whoever wishes to realize the qualities of a buddha Which are inconceivable and beyond measureThe king invites you all to come insideThere will never be any darkness In their teaching of the enlightenment of buddhahood reveals the vision of the tathāgatas wisdom causes entry into the vision of the tathāgatas wisdomPrince Bimbisāra sent mounted emissaries in the four directions with the messageKnowing the heroism of those individuals Pure beings who have defeated the kleśasConditioned things are inert and emptyis reborn solely from the element of dharmasAnd for no fewer than fifty years In sorrow he searches the ten directionsBlessed One I have harbored doubtAnd someone were to worship as just explained With divine flowers and the most precious flowers of this worldand the left side of the divine palace had become completely filled with divine clothingHe thus gained this name of Yaśaskāma Which became renowned everywhereIf you ask what constitute the four unhindered discernments they compriseWhen the bodhisattvas had given their explanations they all addressed the crown prince Mañjuśrīthe nine planetsAs a comparison I can count how many atoms there are butThis concludes the twentyfifth chapter on exhortationnanda the wealth and enjoyments of sentient beings of this buddha field will be like those of the gods of the ThirtyThreewhereas the female form is nonexistenceOnce they had arrived the Bodhisattvas body began emitting light which manifested into lion thronesOn the tenth ground bodhisattvas attain the body of wisdomThe realm of phenomena neither increases nor decreases andwent to where the Blessed One was stayingShe is going to kill youIt is he we should protectthose things that are nonentities those that have an essential nature of nonentity and those that are empty of intrinsic defining characteristicsit is because the irreversible great bodhisattva beings do not require even a single demonstration of the sacred doctrineThey set out for perfect awakening beyond suffering And call out May all be successfulHe replied This is owing to the nondisintegration of all thingsThey had perfected the samādhi of glorious adornment They had perfected the samādhi of the essence of great brillianceMany hundreds of ākyas tried to revive him Sprinkling water from vases on him as he lay motionlessthey will know that this individual is a beginner bodhisattva practicing the transcendent perfection of generosity having just begun to set his or her mind on enlightenment and so onEmptiness is indeed consciousness The nature of consciousness is indeed emptinessWhen the Blessed one gave this teachingWherever they go there beings should honor venerate and make offerings to themAbout this state the noble ones have taught When one is mindful and blissful that is equanimityThey manifest in various forms As many as there are types of creatureshaving understood that all things are by nature but magical creationsEven your father mother friends and relatives Are not free from old age nor is any other class of peopleask him You are not a shapeshifter are youThey should have perfect generosity Through remaining in seclusion He did not renounce and let go of his spouse or his child village town city royal palace or retinueLooking at form one is never satisfiedwhether at first in the middle or in the endand therefore one physically engages in an ocean of nonvirtuous deedsand then the entire great caravan called out in one voice to Avalokiteśvara sayingThen Daṇḍapāṇi said to the ākya youths This has now been tested and witnessed Next let him demonstrate his skill in archerylistening to the Dharma from the Bhagavān for sixty eons The one whose mind is at rest in that nature Is always without desire anger and ignoranceYou may wonder noble son what these qualities may imply from the bodhisattvas being unstained through to their being protectedThrough this practice they make all manifest inner marks disappearBhagavān what they say would not be believed It would be difficult for the world to believe themThe Bodhisattva then went to the hermitage of a brahmin woman called ākīWhen the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class wishes to examine the precious jewelAnd the eight gods together with their akraswho has a sacred thread made of the nāga kings Nanda and UpanandaTo the bhikṣus bhikṣunīs upāsakas And upāsikās who were there at that time And who held the view of objective realityNo one can harm me here beneath this treeAs they concern themselves with form they do not observe any arising origin or cessation of formwill gain eight hundred qualities of the earsThe Blessed One was dwelling in Vaiśālī in the mansion in mrapālīs great grove  together with a great assembly of ten thousand monks All these monks were foedestroyers whose defilements were exhaustedAnd only these rites belong to the heart mantrasAnd the thoughts of all beingsAre known in a single instant It is the exhaustion of craving and it is cessation free of desire It is nirvāṇano need to mention the pieces of all the seedsNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities are the shelterlessEven the members of low castes and outcasts are fond of wealth they cherish it like it and enjoy itSo it is that great bodhisattva beings from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenmentwhen they then employ such skill in meansThoroughly burn with a blazing fireobtained the pleasures of the five sensesYour Majesty even if one man were to attain All the pleasures of the gods And everything desirable among humans It still would not suffice and he would search for moreHe has appeared out of the roots of virtue that were brought about by previous buddhasO Jayā Vijayā Ajitā Aparājitā svāhāThe surrounding environs of their land are like a desert with few groves lakes and ponds This is a primitive land like a remote villageThe sword is wisdom and the noose is skillful meansSomeone who recites one verse from this sūtra Where those kinds of wise people walkHe has put together a work known as Māṭharas TreatiseIt is the natural expression of all thingsthe faculty of wisdom These too should be cultivated without apprehending anythingNoble lady a woman may maintain diligence create merit for many thousands of eonswe will now proceed to Jewel WorldIt is just the same for the element of consciousnessOther than the Tathāgata no śrāvaka pratyekabuddha or bodhisattva can outshine your merit knowledge wisdom or samādhito have the conviction that all phenomena are the inexhaustible true naturewho commit this transcendent perfection of wisdom to writing and then retain hold masterNoble son because they possess ten qualities bodhisattvas are free of doubtIt is neither miraculous nor magicalhe would not be able to end his praise of this Dharma teachinghe dispatched bell ringers and made the following announcement to the people in his cityIn that life such was my name Such was my family Such was my social class Such was the food I ateWhile riding in the chariot I saw a bhikṣu Who was perfectly handsome and attractiveFriends whoever has this outlook and thinking that other sentient beings should receive this instruction teaches this Dharma teaching of The Play in Full elaboratelyit can carry pleasant smells and can carry bad smellstNoble son bodhisattva great beings do so by reflecting in this wayYoung man those are the ten benefits for the bodhisattva mahāsattvas from being devoted to meditationn the same way the element of consciousness after leaving the body behindAlso when any great bodhisattva beings without being separated from the attention associated with omniscienceand to develop bravery of mindVenerable Lord How is the transcendent perfection of wisdom absolutely pure because space is not apprehendedThey are large bodied and terrible Mighty and loud With ten necks and a thousand eyes Great grahas with red eyes Dispatching their retainershe is then asked Have your parents given you leave The ordinand responds They have given me leaveNext he meditated the fact that his own body was just like theirsshould be diligent without regard for life or bodySimilarly it is owing to the emptiness of external phenomena and the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities that the three vehicles have been extensively taught without apprehending anythingSome brought forth trees of beryl some trees of crystalWhen a person sees a mass of foam That is carried along in a riverFor hundreds of lives you trained in forbearanceHe asked Venerable Lord What is the immaturity that craves for the sacred doctrineThen the incarnated bodhisattva gave the vessel full of food to Vimalakīrtiand the transcendent perfection of generosityFail to appear and you too will soon find yourself in this statesome were made of silverlike the reincarnation of one who has attained ultimate liberationReject all the darkness of ignorance And become a lion among men delighting in peace so too the element of consciousness is gladdened by the status of sovereignty and is satisfied with its body as wellThe mind that would be equipoised in union with the transcendent perfection of wisdom is actually equipoised in union with spacephysical forms that have not been grasped are not physical formsOne will be able to perceive all smellsSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent compassionate patiencethe one who serves the world the one who knows the worldThen Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin beyond that pore last of all there is the pore named Dhvajārājait is because there is no opportunity for emptiness to impinge upon emptinesstThey do not partake of a Dharma versed in the ultimate nor of a Dharma concerned with nirvāṇaA full nine thousand of those with matted hair Followed behind the śrāvaka saṅghaHis private parts are well sheathedThose who have made statues of the sugatas They will all of them attain enlightenment Since this severely strict punishment Was uttered by all buddhasIt is insensate being driven like a windmill The hair of their heads is untangled  Their heart is excellently adorned with the śrīvatsa motifWhoever hears the meaning that is taught In this way will attain enlightenmentBlessed One who are the bodhisattvas who remain in hermitagesLet him serve this one possessing excellent qualitiesThey will go to the foot of the Bodhi tree in order to attain the enlightenment of buddhahoodgivingHow are their perfections of patienceThe purity of phenomena is profound due to the absolute purity of physical formsOne should cultivate the clear understanding of nonattachmentYoung man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who wish to attain quickly the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodOne should climb on to ones bed and holding ones penis with the left hand recite  timesnanda were your life to last an entire eon it would not be easy for you to understand thoroughly the extensive meaning and precise verbal significance of these three namesThese childish beings are exhausted like water running into the surface

karma and disturbing emotionsinvestigating the selfAfter hearing the Dharma they provided the visiting monks and wanderer monks with all the supplies they neededIt was enormous with a circumference of seven hundred milesWhy is that Because this Dharma is beyond all words beyond all statements beyond the entire domain of language and beyond any verbal expressionfollowed by the universal monarch and his four army divisionsFifth is dullness and stuporThe wonderful inconceivable Dharma of the jinas That is what is called the pure restraint of the mind Again āradvatīputra there are great bodhisattva beings whose minds are not without omnisciencein this way this entire great heap of suffering ceasesOne who when this Dharma teaching is being taughtLikewise they resort for refuge in mountains rivers sources of rivers lakes ponds pools oceans reservoirs lotus ponds and wells trees bushes vines grass tree trunks cow pens cemeteries crossroads where four roads meet and marketsLord in which buddhafield did the noble Vimalakīrti die before reincarnating in this buddhafieldBeyond that pore there is a pore named Amṛtabindu In that pore a million trillion devas liveBhikṣus those who have the vows of training should have the three Dharma robesLike the orb of the moon Like a conjurerthe hearers bodhisattvas the whole assembly andSometime later the monk matricide fell illYour Majesty they repliedHe is a peerless guide who illuminates the pathEach one has eighty thousand peaksSimilarly you should undertake perseveranceHeard in all three realms and by all beingsIn that manner exclusively

beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomwho in the presence of the Bhagavān were gazing upon the Bhagavān with tranquil minds placid minds and gentle mindsThen gradually he brings him into the house And for an entire twenty yearsin the same way the element of consciousness because it appropriates actions produces large and small formseach and every one of those bodhisattvas attends as many buddhas together with bodhisattvas and hearersWhen this is completedHe has never wavered in his firm resolve to teach the same Dharma to everyone Thereforeclothes a parasoland similarly why would they have a view concerning the sensory element of sights and in the same vein why would they have a view concerning other sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of mental phenomenaacts of service undertaken on behalf of a clan chieftainIn the east one should draw White AcalaIt is known by wise beings It is the knowledge of gentle beingsand those beings will serve and honor many buddhasBearing their loads of wood they came to the house in which the teacher of brahmins livedGods excellent Excellentwill the Bodhisattva Maitreya teach this transcendent perfection of wisdom having attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentHe also will not worship those who teach it write it down read it aloud memorize it disseminate it or

KapilavastuHe should stand in equanimity toward all living beingsnanda do monks grant ordination into the monkhood to persons who have not yet reached twenty yearsIt is strewn with divine flowers And scented with divine perfumes I will offer this spacious palaceit is not endowed with awarenessEach of those supreme humans liberated as many beings As there are grains of sand in the Ganges Even though we have tried and persisted for a long time in this way we have not been able to realize our goalMonks in this way while the Bodhisattva dwelt in his mothers womb he ripened  million gods and humans within the Three Vehiclesnot seen not heard not smelt not tasted not touchedthis transcendent perfection of wisdom is instructiveThus their buddhafield will become utterly purified by the excellence of exalted wisdomThey do not forsake the transcendent perfection of wisdom and they do not lack the transcendent perfection of wisdomImmeasurable one devoid of the skandhas Great hero we ask you to reveal to us Courageous one from where have come These bodhisattvas who have no fearferry them to the other shore of the ocean of saṃsāraDevas and humans as numerous as the Ganges sands Will constantly place their hands together in homage to himThey will be capable of warding off all heretical refutations and imputations that might ariseAnd the assemblies of gods all know my thoughts They know my discipline qualities restraint and carefulnessthis is to be cultivatedAt that moment too a wind called desiring nectar stirsOn the fourteenth and the thirteenth day Introduce the students to the activityand simultaneously in the same instant the same moment the same secondWhy did you smile Pray tell what was the reasonperceiving the individuals who explain the Dharma as teachers and regarding them as spiritual friendsTherefore the thusgone ones are said to possess the marks of inconceivable meritSimilarly it offers the prospect of rebirth among the gods of the Caturmahārājakāyika realmBodhisattva mahāsattvas who have the restraint of the mind do not associate with wrong views in order to desist from wrong viewsThe ripening of a large result is experienced from having performed a minor action Thus it entails the production of a large result from a small causeEndowed with the joy and happiness that arise from meditative concentration they then accomplish the second meditative absorption and maintain itWhen they die they will see a thousand buddhasAs another analogy a bee may stay for a long while on a flower because it clings to its taste but once it has partaken of that flower leaves it behind and moves on to anotherLikewise this Bodhisattva has no armyAfter putting water inside the flower it will dripAnd yet the particle neither fills up nor do the worlds diminishThrough miraculous power he came before the Jina Accompanied by eight hundred million beings he respectfully approached themClever curlews swans cuckoos and peacocks Are circumambulating the

separated from this transcendent perfection of wisdomit shuddered it shuddered strongly and it shuddered intenselyaversion will disappear and aversion will not ariseHowever at this moment the Bodhisattvas magnificence and power caused the fig tree itself to bow down and pay homage to himSimilarly the very nature of the other aggregates up to and including consciousness is the expanse of realitythey themselves do not have the capacity to display such a field of experience and the distinguishing qualities of his practiceThere is the meditative stability named Eradication of ReferentsDivine princes bodhisattvas should indeed train in all thesethey wish to disclose their root transgressionsOn waking on the sandy beach the group of six saidāradvatīputra the four applications of mindfulness are merely conceptualizedMonks during the six years that the Bodhisattva practiced austerities he was continually followed by Māra the evil oneall the karma they have generated by engaging in the five acts with immediate retribution will be completely exhaustedNot pass away without fulfilling his intention And thus leave this triple world suffering and without a defenderproviding for the suffering worldJust as the wind element carries both kinds of smell as it passesAs beings are so are their thoughts As are their thoughts so are the jinasthe bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśanas arm was restored as it was before which was due to the bodhisattva mahāsattvas having gained the power of wisdom and having gained the power of meritI will stay here and look after this milk porridge with honeyIt is just as you have saidWomen are the Buddha women are the Saṅgha Women are the Perfection of WisdomThey have trained in the way of definitive knowledge Have vast understanding and constantly have joyful wisdom The assembly of gods showed him great reverence honoring him as one who would leave their midst and take birth in the human worldAnd gods can see humansthey do not attain emancipation in omniscienceWho are theythey will delight in hearing this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomIt is a state of complete peace free of clinging free of grasping unobserved undemonstrable uncompounded beyond the six sense fieldsplaces that are delightful to move in and places that are nothing but peaceful Such are the places in which

repeatedly said I have realized this profound Dharma and It is difficult to know the intended meaning of the teachingPlease teach it to bring benefit and happinessAmong the audience of gods there were eight thousand who had previously refined the roots of virtue who now formed the resolve set on unsurpassed and completely perfect awakeningSince her form is like a magical emanation the word māyā meaning magically emanated was included in her nameIf you ask what is their fixation and on what they are fixatedWhen these peaceful methods are not sufficient With terrible weapons Set their homes ablazeI shall take refuge and adopt the precepts in the presence of the Blessed OneYour disciplined conduct and austerities are beyond compareJust as in space the limit of the past is nonapprehensible andTathāgata arhat perfectly complete buddhas will appear in the worldBy the power of the victorious ones the instruments call out these versesThe sense of smell has no form eitherIt seemed so to those who saw and heard themthat evening he sat in front of the Tathāgatas stūpa bound his right hand in cotton and immersed it in sesame oilHe is the one upon whose face the lord of the yakṣas gazesThe Dharma is primordially without a self without a being Although it is taught it does not cease and five thousand gods who held reference points all made this supplicationand the upper half extends upward for  yojanas Noble son if Sumeru were to become a mass of birch barkThey teach them the supreme eightfold path Of peace that is difficult to see By defaming the enlightenment of the buddhasThen Yamas guardians gathered their swords clubs short spears long spears maces discuses tridents and so on and taking all their Avīci utensils went to the Dharmarāja YamarājaOne will be cured even of the quartan fever and other recurring feversThen at that time the man thinksUttaramatithe samādhi named King of ArraysMore than five hundred physicians Diligently sought to cure that illnessThey should also recite the names of the four great kingsYou with infinite vision turn the wheelthe proficiency in mantra and yantra Which have been described as being of many typesMañjuśrī in the same manner the Tathāgata the Arhat the Perfect and Complete Buddha is emptyI pay homage to all the vajraḍākinīs Who cut the bonds of conceptual thought and descend to act in the worldwent to the mansion in mrapālīs great grove Thus due to such causes conditions and bases they will regard their preceptor as their teacher regardless of whether their preceptor has received little or abundant teaching is knowledgeable or ignorant or is disciplined or of inferior disciplineGive heed give heed to me kāśagarbha of great renown endowed with great compassion and intent on the welfare of

dhāraṇī called jayamatī that I received from the ThusGone One Jayaghoṣa when I was a bodhisattvaO blessed Hatred Vajrī you are an accomplished being Hū phaṭIf you ask how it is unobstructed it is unobstructed with regard to physical formsSo out of the great love and compassion he felt like a swan spreading its wings he flew up into the sky aboveHe teaches the Dharma in the form of a tathāgata to beings who are to be taught by a tathāgataWhat is not resting in the uncompoundedIn a timely manner they pay respect to disciplined mendicants and brahminsit is even more astonishing thatAnd I asked questions about this samādhi for A hundred and forty thousand million years and he listened as the Blessed One had directed himAccompanied by the pleasant sounds of thousands of cymbals The queen ascended and rested like a divine maidenThis great bodhisattva being in such and such a world system has donned the great armorAlso present were devas who were of the four classes of gandharvasManojña ManojñasvaraMonk as all phenomena are nonarising by nature they are entirely free from painPlace in a vajra hollow And grind with the worldprotectorBlessed One when I hear about the conduct of those wicked beings it almost makes me faintNoble sons the Tathāgatas intention is to relate a great Dharma teachingSubhūti if all things were apprehended not to be emptythen honors venerates and respects itDevelop wisdom completely pure wisdom And quickly become compassionate Their minds have no attachment to phenomena They practice with joy benefiting beings Rather divine son on the ultimate level ultimate truth transcends all conventionsand they should also encourage others to acquire the cultivation of the four applications of mindfulnessGopā with such good omens lay down and sleepIn this world I see no one Capable of disturbing my diligenceThey do not attach importance to the sentient beings who are to be brought to maturityThe wise who understand the composite and noncomposite Have ceased conceptualizing attributesThe six hundred million yakṣaswritingThere for the sake of renunciation The Bodhisattva persevered with continuous and stable strengthChildren of noble family if you know that the time has come to leave then do soHe accepted it along with a gift of water sesame and gold and then vanishedAll widows should indeed be attended uponditya and Candra came from his eyesBecause he has these signs Prince Sarvārthasiddha will not stay at home but will certainly develop renunciation and depart from his homeIn the cities of Indra Brahmā the Sun and the Moon there is no equal to himOn the relative level the correct conceptual workings of the mind are a gateway to nirvāṇaThe ministers then prostrated at the kings feet and askedWomen are heaven women are the DharmaEven the gods had done their best to decorate the forestnot despising the unlearned and respecting the learned as if they were the Teacher himselfand they have asked what is the bodhisattvas purification of the buddhafieldThen the blessed goddess of the Vajra Realm having entered the absorption of Hatred Vajrī said thisor of all tīrthikas such as the Carakas Parivrājakas and Nirgranthas and so forth or of any others down to the roots of what is wholesome of those stuck in what is wrong it is through having the Tathāgata as their basis and support that they grow and become sizeableāriputra the tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas have obtained that which is a great marvelArise bhikṣu and teach the supreme Dharma In the event that there is no majority within the saṅgha and he has been ordained the ordination is to be judged validThe entire assembly of ākyas was shocked and astonishedThereby swiftly attaining the groundsThey should also praise and rejoice in others who act in order to bring sentient beings to maturationāriputra this is the Dharma teaching that begins with a section on the sense pleasuresThrough practicing that conduct Millions of beings become ripenedthe sensory element of the body the sensory element of tangibles and the sensory element of tactile consciousnessConceived as four fingerwidths or a full thumblength above the central deityShould it be with lotus flowers perfume Flower garlands clothing Or perhaps with food and drinkand if fresh untarnished human flesh is prepared with various flavors and given to him to eat then this bhikṣu will be cured of his illnesswho spoke this panegyricThe one thousand two hundred Trāyastriṃśa devas assembled there to listen to the Dharma were made joyous and happy and made various divine offeringsAdorned by a plenitude of seats and beds That they donate directly to the sugatas They will not construe the notion that physical forms are calmWhen they dispense their gifts miserliness does not ariseIt is the bridge over the swamp of desireall attributes and attainments up to and including that which is termed omniscience are to be counted as imperishablewill be unable to bear the majesty the glory and the exaltedness of those eminently powerful gods endowed with great occult power and great miraculous abilitiesSince he cuts the stream of all formations he is not within the sphere of performancedo they then teach the Dharma Mañjuśrī saidContact is the causal condition of feelingDivine being the buddhas appear so that all features of the various views may be realizedThey sent rains with thunder released bolts of lightning caused a rain of hot iron sands gathered black clouds and made storms ariseyet relatively they are unharmed by the torments of attachmentPotalaka too was delighted He sat straight up raised his right hand and exclaimed with great joyThe colors yellow darkgreen white and black in the intermediary directionswho sees the realm of hatred as the sphere of nirvāṇa and who sees the realm of delusion as the sphere of nirvāṇa will attain purification from karmic obscurationsAs the lower realms are pacified As all beings feel joy He Who Will Establish Beings in Happiness The Bringer of Joy has been bornWhen thoughts become nonthought At that time there is nonthought They will strike with their hands and feet They will always engage in fun and playwithout establishing they established these beings in the teachingDivine son there isIf you ask why Subhūti it is because in a modality that is neither diminished nor enhanced going or coming is nonapprehensibleand those disciplined in that way are indeed well disciplinedthey will become wise in asking questions about the inconceivable Dharma of the BuddhaBhagavān I request that you teach this meaning I request that the Sugata teach itThey do not take possession of anything and they do not think in terms of wealth and ownershipThat pore is  yojanas wideHundreds of

basket of divine flowers that was the size of SumeruSimilarly Subhūti this vehicle is also neither blue nor yellow nor red nor white nor crimson nor pale yellow nor golden nor multicoloredMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see sentient beings correctly embarking on the vehicle of the śrāvakas the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas and the vehicle of the bodhisattvasAnd those I have brought to nirvāṇa To liberate them from the continuity of suffering Evil one I will not pass away into parinirvāṇa until the tradition of the Buddha his teaching and his community are well established in the world and until infinite bodhisattvas are prophesied to reach unexcelled perfect and complete awakeningThey cut through the creepers of doubt in

sacred doctrines of this most supreme vehicle of the bodhisattvas in the presence of those lord buddhasThey all dwell on the noble eightfold path and always aspire to the DharmaThose who felt malice toward that bodhisattva did not see a tathāgata nor hear the word Dharma nor hear the word saṅgha for twenty thousand million eonslike the erection of a eunuchThe splendorous appearance of this perfect man Will henceforth prevent any greed and quarrels Among beings in this sublime palaceāradvatīputra do you think that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness

arent a debtor are youI will turn the wheel of Brahmā which has not previously been turned in the world in conformity with the sacred doctrine by any virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon Brahmā or anyone elseVenerable Lord How wonderful is the Lord Buddhas eloquent exegesis of these aspects of attachment and nonattachment possessed by the sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who espouse the vehicle of the bodhisattvasWhy is that It is because you have all been practicing bodhisattva conduct andWhat is the practice It is the practice of the pathThese were the rites belonging to the mantra of the goddessI have obtained countless strengths Liberations and dhyānasnanda deluded persons who possess these four abandon this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomNoble son the single seat is the seat of omniscienceBhagavān through a skillful method you have bestowed upon us our inheritance of the Tathāgatas treasure of wisdomāradvatīputra so it is that great bodhisattva beings who seek to perfect the transcendent perfection of generosity should train in the transcendent perfection of wisdomI am absorbed in meditationWould it not be wonderful were youthful Mañjuśrī to deliver such a teaching The Blessed One knew in his mind what the god Ratnavara was thinking and so he said to youthful MañjuśrīI too having become unattached And seeking this peaceful samādhiIf I shall also be old how can I enjoy myself and play gamesthey will bring innumerable countless measureless sentient beings to final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where there is no residue of the psychophysical aggregatesAs the best senior heirs of the one with ten strengths They will for a long time make offerings to many jinas In the same vein they do not apprehend the designation of fundamental ignorance and they do not apprehend the designations of the other links of dependent origination up to and including the designation of aging and deathand the darkness endured while in the wombI transmit to you Maitreya this unexcelled perfect enlightenment which I attained only after innumerable millions of billions of eonsThrough it the highest perfect faith arose in me And I always honored it As soon as they sat down the monastery vanished and each of their begging bowls turned into iron clubs of different sortsHe has revenues interest from loans and similarly
