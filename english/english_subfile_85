realm and inspire awe in that BrahmāYes good sir replied SuddhāvāsaThen as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm they vanished from in front of the Buddha and appeared in that Brahmā realmThat Brahmā saw those Brahmās coming off in the distance and said to themWell now good sirs where have you come fromGood sir weve come from the presence of the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaShouldnt you go to attend on that Blessed OneWhen they had spoken that Brahmā refused to accept their advice He multiplied himself a thousand times and said to SubrahmāGood sir cant you see that I have such psychic powerI see that good sirSince I have such psychic power and might what other ascetic or brahmin should I go to and attend uponThen Subrahmā multiplied himself two thousand times and said to that BrahmāGood sir cant you see that I have such psychic powerI see that good sirThat Buddha has even more psychic power and might than you or meShouldnt you go to attend on that Blessed OneThen that Brahmā addressed Subrahmā in verseThere are three hundreds of phoenixes four of swans and five of eaglesThis palace belongs to him who

streamenterersfreed from rebirth in the animal realmAnd as for other peoplewho I think have shared in meritI couldnt even number themfor fear of speaking falselyLinked DiscoursesThe AppealWith BrahmadevaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time a certain brahmin lady had a son called Brahmadeva who had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the BuddhaThen Venerable Brahmadeva living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessHe understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceAnd Venerable Brahmadeva became one of the perfectedThen Brahmadeva robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for almsWandering indiscriminately for almsfood in Sāvatthī he approached his own mothers homeNow at that time Brahmadevas mother the brahmin lady was offering up a regular oblation to BrahmāThen Brahmā Sahampati thoughtThis Venerable Brahmadevas mother the brahmin lady offers up a regular oblation to BrahmāWhy dont I go and stir up a sense of urgency in herThen as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in the home of Brahmadevas motherThen Brahmā Sahampati while standing in the air addressed Brahmadevas mother in verseFar from here is the Brahmā realm madamto which you offer a regular oblationBut Brahmā doesnt eat that kind of foodWhy make invocations when you dont know the path to BrahmāThis Brahmadeva madamfree of attachments has surpassed the godsOwning nothing providing for no other a mendicanthas entered your house for almsHes worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods a knowledge master selfdevelopedHes worthy of a religious donation from gods and menHaving shunned all evils hes unsulliedCool at heart he wanders looking for foodHe has no before and afterpeaceful unclouded untroubled with no need for hopehe has laid down the rod for all creatures firm and frailSo let him enjoy your offering of choice almsWith peaceful mind he has left the crowdhe wanders like a tamed elephant unperturbedHes a mendicant fair in ethics with heart well freedSo let him enjoy your offering of choice almsWith unwavering confidence in himpresent your religious donation to one who is worthy of itNow that youve seen the sage who has crossed over madammake merit for the sake of future happinessWith unwavering confidence in himshe presented her religious donation to one who is worthy of itAfter seeing the sage who had crossed over the brahmin ladymade merit for the sake of future happinessLinked DiscoursesThe AppealThe Appeal of BrahmāSo I have heardAt one time when he was first awakened the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherds banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā RiverThen as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mindThis principle I have discovered is deep hard to see hard to understand peaceful sublime beyond the scope of logic subtle comprehensible to the astuteBut people like attachment they love it and enjoy itIts hard for them to see this thing that is specific conditionality dependent originationIts also hard for them to see this thing that is the stilling of all activities the letting go of all attachments the ending of craving fading away cessation extinguishmentAnd if I were to teach this principle others might not understand me which would be wearying and troublesome for meAnd then these verses which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past occurred to the BuddhaIve struggled hard to realize thisenough with trying to explain itThis principle is not easily understoodby those mired in greed and hateThose caught up in greed cant seewhats subtle going against the streamdeep hard to see and very finefor theyre shrouded in a mass of darknessAnd as the Buddha reflected like this his mind inclined to remaining passive not to teaching the DhammaThen Brahmā Sahampati knowing what the Buddha was thinking thoughtOh my goodness The world will be lost the world will perish For the mind of the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha inclines to remaining passive not to teaching the DhammaThen as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the BuddhaHe arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt with his right knee on the ground raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and saidSir let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma Let the Holy One teach the DhammaThere are beings with little dust in their eyes Theyre in decline because they havent heard the teachingThere will be those who understand the teachingThis is what Brahmā Sahampati said Then he went on to sayAmong the Magadhans there appeared in the pastan impure teaching thought up by those still stainedFling open the door to the deathlessLet them hear the teaching the immaculate one discoveredStanding high on a rocky mountainyou can see the people all aroundIn just the same way allseer wise onehaving ascended the Temple of Truthrid of sorrow look upon the peopleswamped with sorrow oppressed by rebirth and old ageRise hero Victor in battle leader of the caravanwander the world without obligationLet the Blessed One teach the DhammaThere will be those who understandThen the Buddha understanding Brahmās invitation surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha because of his compassion for sentient beingsAnd the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes and some with much dust in their eyes with keen faculties and with weak faculties with good qualities and with bad qualities easy to teach and hard to teach And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world while others did notIts like a pool with blue water lilies or pink or white lotuses Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it thriving underwater Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the waters surface And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to themIn the same way the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes and some with much dust in their eyes with keen faculties and with weak faculties with good qualities and with bad qualities easy to teach and hard to teach And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world while others did notWhen he had seen this he replied in verse to Brahmā SahampatiFlung open are the doors to the deathlessLet those with ears to hear decide their faithThinking it would be troublesome Brahmā I did not teachthe sophisticated sublime Dhamma among humansThen Brahmā Sahampati knowing that his request for the Buddha to teach the Dhamma had been granted bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before vanishing right thereLinked DiscoursesCorruptionsCravingAt SāvatthīMendicants desire and greed for craving for sightscraving for soundscraving for smellscraving for

the training and returned to a lesser life Most of them were youthsWhen Venerable nanda had wandered in the Southern Hills as long as he wished he set out for Rājagaha to the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding groundHe went up to Venerable Mahākassapa bowed and sat down to one side Mahākassapa said to himReverend nanda for how many reasons did the Buddha lay down a rule against eating in groups of more than three among familiesSir the Buddha laid down that rule for three reasonsFor keeping difficult persons in check and for the comfort of goodhearted mendicants To prevent those of wicked desires from taking sides and dividing the Saṅgha And out of consideration for familiesThese are the three reasons why the Buddha laid down that ruleSo what exactly are you doing wandering together with these junior mendicants They dont guard their sense doors they eat too much and theyre not committed to wakefulnessIts like youre wandering about wrecking crops and ruining familiesYour following is falling apart Reverend nandaand those just getting started are slipping awayYet this boy knows no boundsThough there are grey hairs on my headI still cant escape being called a boy by Venerable MahākassapaIts because you wander with these junior mendicants Your following is falling apart Reverend nandaand those just getting started are slipping awayYet this boy knows no boundsThe nun Thullanandā heard a rumor thatMaster Mahākassapa had rebuked Master nanda the Videhan sage by calling him a boyShe was upset and blurted outHow can Master Mahākassapa who formerly followed another path presume to rebuke Master nanda the Videhan sage by calling him a boyMahākassapa heard Thullanandā say these wordsand he said to nandaIndeed Reverend nanda the nun Thullanandā spoke rashly and without reflectionSince I shaved off my hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness I dont recall acknowledging any other teacher apart from the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaFormerly when I was still a layman I thoughtLiving in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide openIts not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shellWhy dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessAfter some time I made an outer robe of patches and in the name of the perfected ones in the world I shaved off my hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessnessWhen I had gone forth I traveled along the road between Rājagaha and Nālanda where I saw the Buddha sitting at the Bahuputta ShrineSeeing him I thoughtIf Im ever to see a Teacher it would be this Blessed OneIf Im ever to see a Holy One it would be this Blessed OneIf Im ever to see a fully awakened Buddha it would be this Blessed OneThen I bowed with my head at the Buddhas feet and saidSir the Buddha is my Teacher I am his discipleThe Buddha is my Teacher I am his discipleThe Buddha said to meKassapa if anyone was to say to such a wholehearted disciple that they know when they dont know or that they see when they dont see their head would explodeBut Kassapa when I say that I know and see I really do know and seeSo you should train like thisI will set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for

wholeheartedly and lend an ear to that teachingThats how you should trainAnd you should train like thisI will never neglect mindfulness of the body that is full of pleasureThats how you should trainAnd when the Buddha had given me this advice he got up from his seat and leftFor seven days I ate the nations almsfood as a debtor On the eighth day I was enlightenedAnd then the Buddha left the road and went to the root of a certain treeSo I spread out my outer robe of patches folded in four and said to himSir sit here That would be for my lasting welfare and happinessThe Buddha sat on the seat spread outand said to meKassapa this outer robe of patches is softSir please accept my outer robe of patches out of compassionIn that case Kassapa will you wear my wornout hempen rag robeI will wear it sirAnd so I presented my outer robe of patches to the Buddhaand the Buddha presented me with his wornout hempen rag robeFor if anyone should be rightly calledthe Buddhas trueborn child born
