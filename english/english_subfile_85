The Sixes
One Who Lives Negligently
Mendicants I will teach you who lives negligently and who lives diligently
And how does someone live negligently
When you live with the eye faculty unrestrained your mind becomes polluted when it comes to sights known by the eye
When the mind is polluted theres no joy
When theres no joy theres no rapture
When theres no rapture theres no tranquility
When theres no tranquility theres suffering
When one is suffering the mind does not become immersed in samādhi
When the mind is not immersed in samādhi principles do not become clear
Because principles have not become clear youre considered to live negligently
When you live with the ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind faculty unrestrained your mind becomes polluted when it comes to thoughts known by the mind
When the mind is polluted theres no joy
When theres no joy theres no rapture
When theres no rapture theres no tranquility
When theres no tranquility theres suffering
When one is suffering the mind does not become immersed in samādhi
When the mind is not immersed in samādhi principles do not become clear
Because principles have not become clear youre considered to live negligently
Thats how someone lives negligently
And how does someone live diligently
When you live with the eye faculty restrained your mind doesnt become polluted when it comes to sights known by the eye
When the mind isnt polluted joy springs up
Being joyful rapture springs up
When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil
When the body is tranquil one feels bliss
And when blissful the mind becomes immersed in samādhi
When the mind is immersed in samādhi principles become clear
Because principles have become clear youre considered to live diligently
When you live with the ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind faculty restrained your mind doesnt become polluted when it comes to thoughts known by the mind
When the mind isnt polluted joy springs up
Being joyful rapture springs up
When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil
When the body is tranquil one feels bliss
And when blissful the mind becomes immersed in samādhi
When the mind is immersed in samādhi principles become clear
Because principles have become clear youre considered to live diligently

Impermanence
The Interior as Impermanent
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants the eye is impermanent
Whats impermanent is suffering
Whats suffering is notself
And whats notself should be truly seen with right understanding like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
The ear is impermanent 
The nose is impermanent 
The tongue is impermanent 
The body is impermanent 
The mind is impermanent
Whats impermanent is suffering
Whats suffering is notself
And whats notself should be truly seen with right understanding like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
Seeing this a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye ear nose tongue body and mind
Being disillusioned desire fades away When desire fades away theyre freed When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence

The Question of Pañcasikha
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak Mountain
And then the fairy Pañcasikha went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one side and said to him
What is the cause sir what is the reason why some sentient beings arent fully extinguished in the present life
What is the cause sir what is the reason why some sentient beings are fully extinguished in the present life
Pañcasikha there are sights known by the eye 
thoughts known by the mind that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
If a mendicant approves welcomes and keeps clinging to them
their consciousness relies on that and grasps it
A mendicant with grasping does not become extinguished
Thats the cause thats the reason why some sentient beings arent fully extinguished in the present life
There are sights known by the eye 
thoughts known by the mind that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
If a mendicant doesnt approve welcome and keep clinging to them their consciousness doesnt rely on that and grasp it
A mendicant free of grasping becomes extinguished

Before My Awakening Interior
At Sāvatthī
Mendicants before my awakeningwhen I was still unawakened but intent on awakeningI thought
Whats the gratification the drawback and the escape when it comes to the eye 
and mind
Then it occurred to me
The pleasure and happiness that arise from the eye this is its gratification
That the eye is impermanent suffering and perishable this is its drawback
Removing and giving up desire and greed for the eye this is its escape
The pleasure and happiness that arise from the ear 
mind this is its gratification
That the mind is impermanent suffering and perishable this is its drawback
Removing and giving up desire and greed for the mind this is its escape
As long as I didnt truly understand these six interior sense fields gratification drawback and escape in this way for what they are I didnt announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans
But when I did truly understand these six interior sense fields gratification drawback and escape in this way for what they are I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans

Verahaccāni
At one time Venerable Udāyī was staying near Kāmaṇḍā in the brahmin Todeyyas mango grove
Then a boy who was a student of the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan went up to Udāyī and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
Udāyī educated encouraged fired up and inspired that student with a Dhamma talk
Then that student went to the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan and said to her
Please madam you should know this
The ascetic Udāyī teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Then student invite him in my name for tomorrows meal
Yes madam he replied He went to Udāyī and said
Sir may Master Udāyī please accept an offering of tomorrows meal from my teachers wife the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan
Udāyī consented in silence
Then when the night had passed Udāyī robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the brahmin ladys home and sat down on the seat spread out
Then the brahmin lady served and satisfied Udāyī with her own hands with a variety of delicious foods
When Udāyī had eaten and washed his hand and bowl she put on a pair of shoes sat on a high seat covered her head and said to him
Ascetic preach the Dhamma
There will be an occasion for that sister he replied then got up from his seat and left
For a second time that student went to Venerable Udāyī 
And for a second time that student went to the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan 
She said to him You keep praising the ascetic Udāyī like this
But when I asked him to preach the Dhamma he just said that there would be an occasion for that and then he got up and left
Madam thats because you put on a pair of shoes sat on a high seat and covered your head before inviting him to teach
For the masters respect the teaching
Then student invite him in my name for tomorrows meal
Yes madam he replied 
Then the brahmin lady served and satisfied Udāyī with her own hands with a variety of delicious foods
When Udāyī had eaten and washed his hand and bowl she took off her shoes sat on a low seat uncovered her head and said to him
Sir when what exists do the perfected ones declare that there is pleasure and pain When what doesnt exist do the perfected ones not declare that there is pleasure and pain
Sister when theres an eye the perfected ones declare that there is pleasure and pain When theres no eye the perfected ones dont declare that there is pleasure and pain
When theres an ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind the perfected ones declare that there is pleasure and pain When theres no mind the perfected ones dont declare that there is pleasure and pain
When he said this the brahmin lady said to Udāyī
Excellent sir Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Venerable Udāyī has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha

But thats not the ocean in the training of the Noble One
Thats just a large body of water a large sea of water

With Bhāradvāja

Then King Udena went up to Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to him
Master Bhāradvāja there are these young monks who are youthful blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of life and theyve never played around with sensual pleasures What is the cause what is the reason why they practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live maintaining it for a long time
Great king this has been stated by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Please monks think of women your mothers age as your mother Think of women your sisters age as your sister And think of women your daughters age as your daughter
This is a cause great king this is a reason why these young monks practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live maintaining it for a long time
But Master Bhāradvāja the mind is wanton
Sometimes thoughts of desire come up even for women your mothers age your sisters age or your daughters age
Is there another cause another reason why these young monks live the full and pure spiritual life for their entire life
Great king this has been stated by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Please monks examine your own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth
In this body there is head hair body hair nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs intestines mesentery undigested food feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease saliva snot synovial fluid urine
This is also a cause great king this is a reason why these young monks live the full and pure spiritual life for their entire life maintaining it for a long time
This is easy to do for those mendicants who have developed their physical endurance ethics mind and wisdom
But its hard to do for those mendicants who have not developed their physical endurance ethics mind and wisdom
Sometimes I plan to focus on something as ugly but only its beauty comes to mind
Is there another cause another reason why these young monks live the full and pure spiritual life for their entire life
Great king this has been stated by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Please monks live with sense doors guarded
When you see a sight with your eyes dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming
For this reason practice restraint protect the faculty of sight and achieve its restraint
When you hear a sound with your ears 
When you smell an odor with your nose 
When you taste a flavor with your tongue 
When you feel a touch with your body 
When you know a thought with your mind dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming
For this reason practice restraint protect the faculty of mind and achieve its restraint
This is also a cause great king this is a reason why these young monks practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live maintaining it for a long time
Its incredible Master Bhāradvāja its amazing
How well this was said by the Buddha
This is the real cause this is the reason why these young monks practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live maintaining it for a long time
For sometimes I too enter the harem with unprotected body speech mind mindfulness and sense faculties At those times powerful thoughts of desire get the better of me
But sometimes I enter the harem with protected body speech mind mindfulness and sense faculties At those times such thoughts of desire dont get the better of me

The Simile of the Vipers
The Simile of Six Animals
Mendicants suppose a person with wounded and festering limbs was to enter a thicket of thorny reeds
The kusa thorns would pierce their feet and the reed leaves would scratch their limbs
And that would cause that person to experience even more pain and distress
In the same way some mendicant goes to a village or a wilderness and gets scolded
This venerable acting like this behaving like this is a filthy village thorn
Understanding that theyre a thorn they should understand restraint and lack of restraint
And how is someone unrestrained
Take a mendicant who sees a sight with their eyes If its pleasant they hold on to it but if its unpleasant they dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted
And they dont truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left over
When they hear a sound with their ears 
When they smell an odor with their nose 
When they taste a flavor with their tongue 
When they feel a touch with their body 
When they know a thought with their mind if its pleasant they hold on to it but if its unpleasant they dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and a limited heart
And they dont truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left over
Suppose a person was to catch six animals with diverse territories and feeding grounds and tie them up with a strong rope
Theyd catch a snake
a crocodile
and a monkey
tie each up with a strong rope then tie a knot in the middle and let them loose
Then those six animals with diverse domains and territories would each pull towards their own domain and territory
The snake would pull one way thinking Im going into an anthill The crocodile would pull another way thinking Im going into the water The bird would pull another way thinking Im flying into the sky The dog would pull another way thinking Im going into the village The jackal would pull another way thinking Im going into the charnel ground The monkey would pull another way thinking Im going into the jungle
When those six animals became exhausted and worn out the strongest of them would get their way and theyd all have to submit to their control
In the same way when a mendicant has not developed or cultivated mindfulness of the body their eye pulls towards pleasant sights but is put off by unpleasant sights Their ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind pulls towards pleasant thoughts but is put off by unpleasant thoughts
This is how someone is unrestrained
And how is someone restrained
Take a mendicant who sees a sight with their eyes If its pleasant they dont hold on to it and if its unpleasant they dont dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart
And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left over
They hear a sound  smell an odor  taste a flavor  feel a touch 
know a thought with their mind If its pleasant they dont hold on to it and if its unpleasant they dont dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart

Suppose a person was to catch six animals with diverse territories and feeding grounds and tie them up with a strong rope
Theyd catch a snake
a crocodile
and a monkey
tie each up with a strong rope then tether them to a strong post or pillar
Then those six animals with diverse domains and territories would each pull towards their own domain and territory
The snake would pull one way thinking Im going into an anthill The crocodile would pull another way thinking Im going into the water The bird would pull another way thinking Im flying into the sky The dog would pull another way thinking Im going into the village The jackal would pull another way thinking Im going into the charnel ground The monkey would pull another way thinking Im going into the jungle
When those six animals became exhausted and worn out theyd stand or sit or lie down right by that post or pillar
In the same way when a mendicant has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body their eye doesnt pull towards pleasant sights and isnt put off by unpleasant sights Their ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind doesnt pull towards pleasant thoughts and isnt put off by unpleasant thoughts
This is how someone is restrained
A strong post or pillar is a term for mindfulness of the body
So you should train like this
We will develop mindfulness of the body Well cultivate it make it our vehicle and our basis keep it up consolidate it and properly implement it

Mendicants gods and humans like sights they love them and enjoy them
But when sights perish fade away and cease gods and humans live in suffering
Gods and humans like sounds

touches and thoughts the lot of them

In all the world with its gods
this is reckoned as happiness

is the cessation of identity

contradict the whole world
What others say is happiness

Listening In
At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house
Then while the Buddha was in private retreat he spoke this exposition of the teaching
Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights
The meeting of the three is contact
Contact is a condition for feeling
Feeling is a condition for craving
Craving is a condition for grasping
Grasping is a condition for continued existence
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth
Rebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
Ear  nose  tongue  body 
Mind consciousness arises dependent on the mind and thoughts
The meeting of the three is contact
Contact is a condition for feeling
Feeling is a condition for craving
Craving is a condition for grasping
Grasping is a condition for continued existence
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth
Rebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights
The meeting of the three is contact
Contact is a condition for feeling
Feeling is a condition for craving
When that craving fades away and ceases with nothing left over grasping ceases
When grasping ceases continued existence ceases
When continued existence ceases rebirth ceases
When rebirth ceases old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress cease
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases

Now at that time a certain monk was standing listening in on the Buddha
The Buddha saw him
Monk did you hear that exposition of the teaching
Yes sir

and remember it
That exposition of the teaching is beneficial and relates to the fundamentals of the spiritual life

And then Venerable Puṇṇa went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief When Ive heard it Ill live alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute
Puṇṇa there are sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
If a mendicant approves welcomes and keeps clinging to them
this gives rise to relishing
Relishing is the origin of suffering I say
There are sounds  smells  tastes  touches 
There are thoughts known by the mind that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing

Puṇṇa now that Ive given you this brief advice what country will you live in
Sir theres a country called Sunāparanta I will live there
The people of Sunāparanta are wild and rough Puṇṇa
If they abuse and insult you what will you think of them
If they abuse and insult me I will think
These people of Sunāparanta are gracious truly gracious since they dont hit me with their fists
Thats what Ill think Blessed One

There are disciples of the Buddha who looked for someone to assist with slitting their wrists because they were horrified repelled and disgusted with the body and with life And I have found this without looking
Thats what Ill think Blessed One
Thats what Ill think Holy One
Good good Puṇṇa
Having such selfcontrol and peacefulness you will be quite capable of living in Sunāparanta
Now Puṇṇa go at your convenience
And then Puṇṇa welcomed and agreed with the Buddhas words He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right Then he set his lodgings in order and taking his bowl and robe set out for Sunāparanta
Traveling stage by stage he arrived at Sunāparanta
and stayed there
Within that rainy season he confirmed around five hundred male and five hundred female lay followers And within that same rainy season he realized the three knowledges
And within that same rainy season he became completely extinguished
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha  and asked him
Sir the gentleman named Puṇṇa who was advised in brief by the Buddha has passed away
Where has he been reborn in his next life
Mendicants Puṇṇa was astute He practiced in line with the teachings and did not trouble me about the teachings
Puṇṇa has become completely extinguished

First Sick
At Sāvatthī
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha and said to him
Sir in such and such a monastery theres a mendicant who is junior and not wellknown Hes sick suffering gravely ill
Please go to him out of compassion
When the Buddha heard that the mendicant was junior and ill understanding that he was not wellknown he went to him
That mendicant saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
and tried to rise on his cot
The Buddha said to that monk
Its all right mendicant dont get up
There are some seats spread out I will sit there
He sat on the seat spread out
and said to the mendicant
I hope youre keeping well mendicant I hope youre alright I hope that your pain is fading not growing that its fading is evident not its growing
Sir Im not keeping well Im not alright The pain is terrible and growing not fading its growing is evident not its fading
I hope you dont have any remorse or regret
Indeed sir I have no little remorse and regret
I hope you have no reason to blame yourself when it comes to ethical conduct
No sir I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct
In that case mendicant why do you have remorse and regret
Because I understand that the Buddha has not taught the Dhamma merely for the sake of ethical purity
If that is so what exactly do you understand to be the purpose of teaching the Dhamma
I understand that the Buddha has taught the Dhamma for the purpose of the fading away of greed
Good good mendicant
Its good that you understand that Ive taught the Dhamma for the purpose of the fading away of greed
For that is indeed the purpose
What do you think mendicant
Is the eye permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir 
mind permanent or impermanent

The Exposition on Burning
Mendicants I will teach you an exposition of the teaching on burning
And what is the exposition of the teaching on burning
Youd be better off mutilating your eye faculty with a redhot iron nail burning blazing and glowing than getting caught up in the features by way of the details in sights known by the eye
For if you die at a time when your consciousness is still tied to gratification in the features or details its possible youll go to one of two destinations
hell or the animal realm
I speak having seen this drawback
Youd be better off mutilating your ear faculty with a sharp iron spike 
Youd be better off mutilating your nose faculty with a sharp nail cutter 
Youd be better off mutilating your tongue faculty with a sharp razor 
Youd be better off mutilating your body faculty with a sharp spear burning blazing and glowing than getting caught up in the features by way of the details in touches known by the body
For if you die at a time when your consciousness is still tied to gratification in the features or details its possible youll go to one of two destinations

Youd be better off sleeping
For I say that sleep is useless fruitless and unconsciousness for the living But while youre asleep you wont fall under the sway of such thoughts that would make you create a schism in the Saṅgha
I speak having seen this drawback
A noble disciple reflects on this
Forget mutilating the eye faculty with a redhot iron nail burning blazing and glowing

the eye sights eye consciousness and eye contact are impermanent And the painful pleasant or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact is also impermanent

The Simile of the Vipers
The Sheaf of Barley
Mendicants suppose a sheaf of barley was placed at a crossroads
Then six people would come along carrying flails
and started threshing the sheaf of barley
So that sheaf of barley would be thoroughly threshed by those six flails
Then a seventh person would come along carrying a flail
and theyd give the sheaf of barley a seventh threshing
So that sheaf of barley would be even more thoroughly threshed by that seventh flail
In the same way an uneducated ordinary person is struck in the eye by both pleasant and unpleasant sights
Theyre struck in the ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind by both pleasant and unpleasant thoughts
And if that uneducated ordinary person has intentions regarding rebirth into a new state of existence in the future that foolish person is even more thoroughly struck like that sheaf of barley threshed by the seventh person
Once upon a time a battle was fought between the gods and the demons
Then Vepacitti lord of demons addressed the demons
My good sirs if the demons defeat the gods in this battle bind Sakka the lord of gods by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the castle of demons
Meanwhile Sakka lord of gods addressed the gods of the ThirtyThree
My good sirs if the gods defeat the demons in this battle bind Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods
In that battle the gods won and the demons lost
So the gods of the ThirtyThree bound Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and brought him to Sakkas presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods
And there Vepacitti remained bound by his limbs and neck
That is until he thought
Its the gods who are principled while the demons are unprincipled Now I belong right here in the castle of the gods
Then he found himself freed from the bonds on his limbs and neck He entertained himself supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation
But when he thought
Its the demons who are principled while the gods are unprincipled Now I will go over there to the castle of the demons
he found himself bound by his limbs and neck and the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation disappeared
Thats how subtly Vepacitti was bound
But the bonds of Māra are even more subtle than that
When you identify youre bound by Māra Not identifying youre free from the Wicked One
These are all forms of identifying I am I am this I will be I will not be I will have form I will be formless I will be percipient I will be nonpercipient I will be neither percipient nor nonpercipient

The Explanation on the Corrupt
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery
Now at that time a new town hall had recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all
Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir a new town hall has recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all
May the Buddha be the first to use it
and only then will the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu use it
That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu
The Buddha consented in silence
Knowing that the Buddha had consented the Sakyans got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right Then they went to the new town hall where they spread carpets all over prepared seats set up a water jar and placed a lamp Then they went back to the Buddha and told him of their preparations saying
Please sir come at your convenience
Then the Buddha robed up and taking his bowl and robe went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east
The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet entered the town hall and sat against the west wall facing east with the Buddha right in front of them
The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also washed their feet entered the town hall and sat against the east wall facing west with the Buddha right in front of them
The Buddha spent most of the night educating encouraging firing up and inspiring the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk Then he dismissed them saying
The night is getting late Gotamas
Please go at your convenience
Yes sir replied the Sakyans They got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on their right before leaving
And then soon after the Sakyans had left the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna
Moggallāna the Saṅgha of mendicants is rid of dullness and drowsiness
Give them some Dhamma talk as you feel inspired
My back is sore
Ill stretch it
Yes sir Mahāmoggallāna replied
And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lions postureon the right side placing one foot on top of the othermindful and aware and focused on the time of getting up
There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants
Reverends mendicants
Reverend they replied
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this
I will teach you the explanation of the corrupt and the uncorrupted
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes reverend they replied
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this
And how is someone corrupt
Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye If its pleasant they hold on to it but if its unpleasant they dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted
And they dont truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left over
They hear a sound  smell an odor  taste a flavor  feel a touch 
know a thought with the mind If its pleasant they hold on to it but if its unpleasant they dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and a limited heart
And they dont truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left over
This is called a mendicant who is corrupt when it comes to sights known by the eye
sounds  smells  tastes  touches 
thoughts known by the mind
When a mendicant lives like this if Māra comes at them through the eye he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them
If Māra comes at them through the ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them
Suppose there was a house made of reeds or straw that was dried up withered and decrepit
If a person came to it with a burning grass torch from the east
or from anywhere the fire would find a vulnerability it would get a foothold
In the same way when a mendicant lives like this if Māra comes at them through the eye he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them
If Māra comes at them through the ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them
When a mendicant lives like this theyre mastered by sights
and thoughts they dont master these things
This is called a mendicant who has been mastered by sights sounds smells tastes touches and thoughts Theyre mastered not a master Bad unskillful qualities have mastered them which are defiled leading to future lives hurtful and resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and death
Thats how someone is corrupt
And how is someone uncorrupted
Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye If its pleasant they dont hold on to it and if its unpleasant they dont dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart
And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left over
They hear a sound  smell an odor  taste a flavor  feel a touch 
know a thought with the mind If its pleasant they dont hold on to it and if its unpleasant they dont dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart

When a mendicant lives like this if Māra comes at them through the eye he doesnt find a vulnerability or get hold of them
If Māra comes at them through the ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind he doesnt find a vulnerability or get hold of them
Suppose there was a bungalow or hall made of thick clay with its plaster still wet
If a person came to it with a burning grass torch from the east
or from anywhere the fire wouldnt find a vulnerability it would get no foothold
In the same way when a mendicant lives like this if Māra comes at them through the eye he doesnt find a vulnerability or get hold of them

Thats how someone is uncorrupted
Then the Buddha got up and said to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna
Good good Moggallāna
Its good that youve taught this explanation of the corrupt and the uncorrupted
This is what Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said
and the teacher approved
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what Mahāmoggallāna said

With Kāmabhū
At one time the venerables nanda and Kāmabhū were staying near Kosambi in Ghositas Monastery
Then in the late afternoon Venerable Kāmabhū came out of retreat went to Venerable nanda and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to nanda
Reverend nanda which is it Is the eye the fetter of sights or are sights the fetter of the eye
Is the ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind the fetter of thoughts or are thoughts the fetter of the mind
Reverend Kāmabhū the eye is not the fetter of sights nor are sights the fetter of the eye
The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them
The ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind is not the fetter of thoughts nor are thoughts the fetter of the mind
The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them
Suppose there was a black ox and a white ox yoked by a single harness or yoke
Would it be right to say that
the black ox is the yoke of the white ox or the white ox is the yoke of the black ox
No reverend
The black ox is not the yoke of the white ox nor is the white ox the yoke of the black ox
The yoke there is the single harness or yoke that theyre yoked by
In the same way the eye is not the fetter of sights nor are sights the fetter of the eye
The ear  nose  tongue  body

The Simile of the Vipers
First The Simile of the Tree Trunk
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi on the bank of the Ganges river
Seeing a large tree trunk being carried along by the current
he addressed the mendicants
Mendicants do you see that large tree trunk being carried along by the current of the Ganges river
Yes sir
Mendicants assume that that tree trunk doesnt collide with the near shore or the far shore or sink in the middle or get stranded on high ground And assume that it doesnt get taken by humans or nonhumans or caught up in a whirlpool and that it doesnt rot away
In that case that tree trunk will slant slope and incline towards the ocean
Why is that
Because the current of the Ganges river slants slopes and inclines towards the ocean
In the same way assume that you dont collide with the near shore or the far shore or sink in the middle or get stranded on high ground And assume that you dont get taken by humans or nonhumans or caught up in a whirlpool and that you dont rot away
In that case you will slant slope and incline towards extinguishment
Why is that
Because right view slants slopes and inclines towards extinguishment
When he said this one of the mendicants asked the Buddha
But sir whats the near shore and whats the far shore Whats sinking in the middle Whats getting stranded on high ground Whats getting taken by humans or nonhumans Whats getting caught up in a whirlpool And whats rotting away
The near shore mendicant is a term for the six interior sense fields
The far shore is a term for the six exterior sense fields
Sinking in the middle is a term for greed and relishing
Stranded on high ground is a term for the conceit I am
And whats getting taken by humans
Its when someone mixes closely with laypeople sharing their joys and sorrowshappy when theyre happy and sad when theyre sadand getting involved in their business
Thats called getting taken by humans
And whats getting taken by nonhumans
Its when someone leads the spiritual life wishing to be reborn in one of the orders of gods
By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life may I become one of the gods
Thats called getting taken by nonhumans
Caught up in a whirlpool is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation
And whats rotting away
Its when some person is unethical of bad qualities filthy with suspicious behavior underhand no true ascetic or spiritual practitionerthough claiming to be onerotten inside corrupt and depraved
This is called rotting away
Now at that time Nanda the cowherd was sitting not far from the Buddha
Then he said to the Buddha
I wont collide with the near shore or the far shore or sink in the middle or get stranded on high ground And I wont get taken by humans or nonhumans or caught up in a whirlpool and I wont rot away
Sir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Well then Nanda return the cows to their owners
Sir the cows will go back by themselves since they love their calves
Still Nanda you should return them to their owners
Then Nanda after returning the cows to their owners went up to the Buddha and said to him
Sir I have returned the cows to their owners
May I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
And the cowherd Nanda received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Not long after his ordination
Venerable Nanda became one of the perfected

that lead the unrestrained to suffering
Those who understand how to restrain them
live with faith as partner uncorrupted
When youve seen pleasant sights
and unpleasant ones too
get rid of all manner of desire for the pleasant
without hating what you dont like
When youve heard sounds both liked and disliked
dont fall under the thrall of sounds you like
get rid of hate for the unliked
and dont hurt your mind by thinking of what you dont like
When youve smelled a pleasant fragrant scent
and one thats foul and unpleasant
get rid of repulsion for the unpleasant
while not yielding to desire for the pleasant
When youve enjoyed a sweet delicious taste
and sometimes those that are bitter
dont be attached to enjoying sweet tastes
and dont despise the bitter
Dont be intoxicated by a pleasant touch
and dont tremble at a painful touch
Look with equanimity at the duality of pleasant and painful contacts
without favoring or opposing anything
People generally let their perceptions proliferate
perceiving and proliferating they are attracted
When youve rejected all thoughts of the lay life
wander intent on renunciation
When the mind is well developed like this regarding the six
it doesnt waver at contacts at all

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near the Sakyan town named Devadaha
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
When it comes to the six fields of contact mendicants I dont say that all mendicants have work to do with diligence nor do I say that none of them have work to do with diligence
I say that when it comes to the six fields of contact mendicants dont have work to do with diligence if they are perfected with defilements ended having completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and become rightly freed through enlightenment
Why is that
Theyve done their work with diligence and are incapable of negligence
I say that when it comes to the six fields of contact mendicants do have work to do with diligence if they are trainees who havent achieved their hearts desire but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary
Why is that
There are sights known by the eye that are pleasant and also those that are unpleasant
Though experiencing them again and again they dont occupy the mind
Their energy is roused up and unflagging their mindfulness is established and lucid their body is tranquil and undisturbed and their mind is immersed in samādhi
Seeing this fruit of diligence I say that those mendicants have work to do with diligence when it comes to the six fields of contact

Householders
With Hāliddikāni
At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in the land of the Avantis near Kuraraghara on Steep Mountain
Then the householder Hāliddikāni went up to Venerable Mahākaccāna  and asked him
Sir this was said by the Buddha
Diversity of elements gives rise to diversity of contacts and diversity of contacts gives rise to diversity of feelings
How does diversity of elements give rise to diversity of contacts and diversity of contacts gives rise to diversity of feelings
Householder its when a mendicant sees a sight and understands it to be agreeable
There is eye consciousness and pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant
Then they see a sight and understand it to be disagreeable
There is eye consciousness and painful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful
Then they see a sight and understand it to be a basis for equanimity
There is eye consciousness and neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral
Furthermore a mendicant hears a sound with the ear 
smells an odor with the nose 
tastes a flavor with the tongue 
feels a touch with the body 
knows a thought with the mind and understands it to be agreeable
There is mind consciousness and pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant
Then they know a thought and understand it to be disagreeable
There is mind consciousness and painful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful
Then they know a thought and understand it to be a basis for equanimity
Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral
Thats how diversity of elements gives rise to diversity of contacts and diversity of contacts gives rise to diversity of feelings

Mendicants before my awakeningwhen I was still unawakened but intent on awakeningI thought
My mind might often stray towards the five kinds of sensual stimulation that I formerly experiencedwhich have passed ceased and perishedor to those in the present or in the future a little
Then it occurred to me
In my own way I should practice diligence mindfulness and protecting the mind regarding the five kinds of sensual stimulation that I formerly experiencedwhich have passed ceased and perished
So mendicants your minds might also often stray towards the five kinds of sensual stimulation that you formerly experiencedwhich have passed ceased and perishedor to those in the present or in the future a little
So in your own way you should practice diligence mindfulness and protecting the mind regarding the five kinds of sensual stimulation that I formerly experiencedwhich have passed ceased and perished
So you should understand that dimension where the eye ceases and perception of sights fades away
You should understand that dimension where the ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind ceases and perception of thoughts fades away

The Simile of the Vipers
The Simile of the Parrot Tree
Then one mendicant went up to another mendicant and asked
Reverend at what point is a mendicants vision well purified
When a mendicant truly understands the origin and ending of the six sense fields at that point their vision is well purified
Not content with that answer that mendicant went up to a series of other mendicants and received the following answers
When a mendicant truly understands the origin and ending of the five grasping aggregates at that point their vision is well purified
When a mendicant truly understands the origin and ending of the four primary elements at that point their vision is well purified
When a mendicant truly understands that everything that has a beginning has an end at that point their vision is well purified
Not content with any of those answers that mendicant went up to the Buddha and told him what had happened Then he asked
Sir at what point is a mendicants vision well purified
Mendicant suppose a person had never seen a parrot tree
Theyd go up to someone who had seen a parrot tree and ask them
Mister whats a parrot tree like
Theyd say
A parrot tree is blackish like a charred stump
Now at that time a parrot tree may well have been just as that person saw it
Not content with that answer that person would go up to a series of other people and receive the following answers
A parrot tree is reddish like a lump of meat
A parrot tree has flaking bark and burst pods like an acacia
A parrot tree has luxuriant shady foliage like a banyan
Now at each of those times a parrot tree may well have been just as those people saw them
In the same way those good people each answered according to what they were focused on when their vision was well purified
Suppose there was a kings frontier citadel with fortified embankments ramparts and arches and six gates
And it has a gatekeeper who is astute competent and clever He keeps strangers out and lets known people in
A swift pair of messengers would arrive from the east and say to the gatekeeper
Mister where is the lord of the city
Theyd say
There he is sirs seated at the central square
Then that swift pair of messengers would deliver a message of truth to the lord of the city and depart the way they came
A swift pair of messengers would come from the west 
deliver a message of truth to the lord of the city and depart the way they came
Ive made up this simile to make a point
And this is the point
City is a term for this body made up of the four primary elements produced by mother and father built up from rice and porridge liable to impermanence to wearing away and erosion to breaking up and destruction
Six gates is a term for the six interior sense fields
Gatekeeper is a term for mindfulness
A swift pair of messengers is a term for serenity and discernment
The lord of the city is a term for consciousness
The central square is a term for the four primary elements
the elements of earth water fire and air

Advice to Rāhula
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind
The qualities that ripen in freedom have ripened in Rāhula
Why dont I lead him further to the ending of defilements
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe wandered for alms in Sāvatthī
After the meal on his return from almsround he addressed Venerable Rāhula
Rāhula get your sitting cloth
Lets go to the Dark Forest for the days meditation
Yes sir replied Rāhula Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha
Now at that time many thousands of deities followed the Buddha thinking
Today the Buddha will lead Rāhula further to the ending of defilements
Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out
Rāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to him
What do you think Rāhula
Is the eye permanent or impermanent

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Now at that time the venerables Sāriputta Mahācunda and Channa were staying on the Vultures Peak Mountain
Now at that time Venerable Channa was sick suffering gravely ill
Then in the late afternoon Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat went to Venerable Mahācunda and said to him
Come Reverend Cunda lets go to see Venerable Channa and ask about his illness
Yes reverend replied Mahācunda
And then Sāriputta and Mahācunda went to see Channa and sat down on the seats spread out
Sāriputta said to Channa
I hope youre keeping well Reverend Channa I hope youre alright I hope that your pain is fading not growing that its fading is evident not its growing
Reverend Sāriputta Im not keeping well Im not alright The pain is terrible and growing not fading its growing is evident not its fading
The winds piercing my head are so severe it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point
The pain in my head is so severe it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head
The winds piercing my belly are so severe it feels like a deft butcher or their apprentice is slicing my belly open with a meat cleaver
The burning in my body is so severe it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals
Im not keeping well Im not alright The pain is terrible and growing not fading its growing is evident not its fading
Reverend Sāriputta I will slit my wrists I dont wish to live
Please dont slit your wrists
Venerable Channa keep going We want you to keep going
If you dont have any suitable food well find it for you
If you dont have suitable medicine well find it for you
If you dont have a capable carer well find one for you
Please dont slit your wrists
Venerable Channa keep going We want you to keep going
Reverend Sāriputta its not that I dont have suitable food
I do have suitable food
Its not that I dont have suitable medicine
I do have suitable medicine
Its not that I dont have a capable carer
I do have a capable carer
Moreover for a long time now I have served the Teacher with love not without love
For it is proper for a disciple to serve the Teacher with love not without love
You should remember this The mendicant Channa slit his wrists blamelessly
Id like to ask Venerable Channa about a certain point if youd take the time to answer
Ask Reverend Sāriputta When Ive heard it Ill know
Reverend Channa do you regard the eye eye consciousness and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way This is mine I am this this is my self
Do you regard the ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind mind consciousness and things knowable by mind consciousness in this way This is mine I am this this is my self
Reverend Sāriputta I regard the eye eye consciousness and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
I regard the ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind mind consciousness and things knowable by mind consciousness in this way This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
Reverend Channa what have you seen what have you directly known in these things that you regard them in this way This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
Reverend Sāriputta after seeing cessation after directly knowing cessation in these things I regard them in this way This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
When he said this Venerable Mahācunda said to Venerable Channa
So Reverend Channa you should pay close attention to this instruction of the Buddha whenever you can
For the dependent there is agitation For the independent theres no agitation
When theres no agitation there is tranquility
When theres tranquility theres no inclination
When theres no inclination theres no coming and going
When theres no coming and going theres no passing away and reappearing
When theres no passing away and reappearing theres no this world or world beyond or between the two
Just this is the end of suffering
And when the venerables Sāriputta and Mahācunda had given Venerable Channa this advice they got up from their seat and left
Not long after those venerables had left Venerable Channa slit his wrists
Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir Venerable Channa has slit his wrists
Where has he been reborn in his next life
Sāriputta didnt the mendicant Channa declare his blamelessness to you personally
Sir there is a Vajjian village named Pubbavijjhana
where Channa had families with whom he was friendly intimate and familiar
The mendicant Channa did indeed have such families Sāriputta
But this is not enough for me to call someone blameworthy
When someone lays down this body and takes up another body I call them blameworthy
But the mendicant Channa did no such thing
You should remember this The mendicant Channa slit his wrists blamelessly

The Simile of the Vipers
Mendicants suppose there were four lethal poisonous vipers
Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesnt want to die who wants to be happy and recoils from pain
Theyd say to him
Mister here are four lethal poisonous vipers They must be periodically picked up washed fed and put to sleep
But when one or other of these four poisonous vipers gets angry with you youll meet with death or deadly pain
So then mister do what has to be done
Then that man terrified of those four poisonous vipers would flee this way or that
Theyd say to him
Mister there are five deadly enemies chasing you thinking When we catch sight of him well murder him right there
So then mister do what has to be done
Then that man terrified of those four poisonous vipers and those five deadly enemies would flee this way or that
Theyd say to him
Mister theres a sixth hidden killer chasing you with a drawn sword thinking When I catch sight of him Ill chop off his head right there
So then mister do what has to be done
Then that man terrified of those four poisonous vipers and those five deadly enemies and the hidden killer would flee this way or that
Hed see an empty village
But whatever house he enters is vacant deserted and empty
And whatever vessel he touches is vacant hollow and empty
Theyd say to him
Mister there are bandits who raid villages and theyre striking now
So then mister do what has to be done
Then that man terrified of those four poisonous vipers and those five deadly enemies and the hidden killer and the bandits would flee this way or that
Hed see a large deluge whose near shore is dubious and perilous while the far shore is a sanctuary free of peril
But theres no ferryboat or bridge for crossing over
Then that man thought
Why dont I gather grass sticks branches and leaves and make a raft Riding on the raft and paddling with my hands and feet I can safely reach the far shore
And so that man did exactly that Having crossed over and gone beyond the brahmin stands on the far shore
Ive made up this simile to make a point
And this is the point
Four lethal poisonous vipers is a term for the four primary elements
the elements of earth water fire and air
Five deadly enemies is a term for the five grasping aggregates that is

The sixth hidden killer with a drawn sword is a term for relishing and greed

If an astute competent clever person investigates this in relation to the ear  nose  tongue  body

Bandits who raid villages is a term for the six exterior sense fields
The eye is struck by both agreeable and disagreeable sights
mind is struck by both agreeable and disagreeable thoughts
Large deluge is a term for the four floods
the floods of sensual pleasures desire to be reborn views and ignorance
The near shore thats dubious and perilous is a term for identity
The far shore a sanctuary free of peril is a term for extinguishment
The raft is a term for the noble eightfold path that is
right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion

Second Sick
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha  and asked him
Sir in such and such a monastery theres a mendicant who is junior and not wellknown Hes sick suffering gravely ill
Please go to him out of compassion
When the Buddha heard that the mendicant was junior and ill understanding that he was not wellknown he went to him
That mendicant saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
and tried to rise on his cot
Then the Buddha said to that monk
Its all right mendicant dont get up
There are some seats spread out I will sit there
He sat on the seat spread out and said to the mendicant
I hope youre keeping well mendicant I hope youre alright I hope that your pain is fading not growing that its fading is evident not its growing
Sir Im not keeping well Im not alright 
I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct
In that case mendicant why do you have remorse and regret
Because I understand that the Buddha has not taught the Dhamma merely for the sake of ethical purity
If that is so what exactly do you understand to be the purpose of teaching the Dhamma
I understand that the Buddha has taught the Dhamma for the purpose of complete extinguishment by not grasping
Good good mendicant
Its good that you understand that Ive taught the Dhamma for the purpose of complete extinguishment by not grasping
For that is indeed the purpose
What do you think mendicant
Is the eye permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir 
mind consciousness 
mind contact 
The pleasant painful or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact is that permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and liable to fall apart is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
Seeing this a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye  ear  nose  tongue  body 
mind consciousness 
mind contact 
They grow disillusioned with the painful pleasant or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact
Being disillusioned desire fades away When desire fades away theyre freed When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied that mendicant was happy with what the Buddha said
And while this discourse was being spoken the mind of that mendicant was freed from defilements by not grasping

Second A Duality
Mendicants consciousness exists dependent on a duality

Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights
The eye is impermanent perishing and changing
Sights are impermanent perishing and changing
So this duality is tottering and toppling its impermanent perishing and changing
Eye consciousness is impermanent perishing and changing
And the causes and conditions that give rise to eye consciousness are also impermanent perishing and changing
But since eye consciousness has arisen dependent on conditions that are impermanent how could it be permanent
The meeting coming together and joining together of these three things is called eye contact
Eye contact is also impermanent perishing and changing
And the causes and conditions that give rise to eye contact are also impermanent perishing and changing
But since eye contact has arisen dependent on conditions that are impermanent how could it be permanent
Contacted one feels intends and perceives
So these things are tottering and toppling theyre impermanent perishing and changing

Then Kokālika got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leaving
Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds
The boils grew to the size of mung beans then chickpeas then jujube seeds then jujubes then myrobalans then unripe wood apples then ripe wood apples
Finally they burst open and pus and blood oozed out
Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness
He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna
Then late at night the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati lighting up the entire Jetas Grove went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one side and said to him
Sir the mendicant Kokālika has passed away
He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna
Thats what Brahmā Sahampati said
Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right side before vanishing right there
Then when the night had passed the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened
When he said this one of the mendicants asked the Buddha
Sir how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell
Its long mendicant
Its not easy to calculate
how many years how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts
But sir is it possible to give a simile
Its possible said the Buddha
Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed
And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it
By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell
Now twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell
Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell
Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell
Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell
Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell
Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the SweetSmelling hell
Twenty lifetimes in the SweetSmelling hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell
Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell
Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell
The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
A man is born
with an axe in his mouth
A fool cuts themselves with it
when they say bad words
When you praise someone worthy of criticism
or criticize someone worthy of praise
you choose bad luck with your own mouth
youll never find happiness that way
Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing
if all you lose is your money
and all you own even yourself
Whats really terrible luck
is to hate the holy ones
For more than two quinquadecillion years
and another five quattuordecillion years
a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell
having aimed bad words and thoughts at them

The Appeal
With Baka the Brahmā
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time Baka the Brahmā had the following harmful misconception
This is permanent this is everlasting this is eternal this is whole this is imperishable For this is where theres no being born growing old dying passing away or being reborn And theres no other escape beyond this
Then the Buddha knew what Baka the Brahmā was thinking As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from Jetas Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm
Baka the Brahmā saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
and said to him
Come good sir Welcome good sir
Its been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here
For this is permanent this is everlasting this is eternal this is complete this is imperishable
For this is where theres no being born growing old dying passing away or being reborn And theres no other escape beyond this
When he had spoken the Buddha said to him
Alas Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance Alas Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance
Because what is actually impermanent not lasting transient incomplete and perishable he says is permanent everlasting eternal complete and imperishable
And where there is being born growing old dying passing away and being reborn he says that
theres no being born growing old dying passing away or being reborn
And although there is another escape beyond this he says that theres no other escape beyond this
Gotama we seventytwo meritmakers are now wielders of power
having passed beyond rebirth and old age
This is our last rebirth as Brahmā knowledgemaster
And now many people pray to us
But Baka the life span here is short not long
though you think its long
I know that your life span
is two quinquadecillion years Brahmā
Blessed One I am the one of infinite vision
who has gone beyond rebirth and old age and sorrow
What precepts and observances did I practice in the past
Explain to me so I can understand
You gave drink to many people
who were oppressed by thirst and heat
Theyre the precepts and observances you practiced in the past
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep
When people at Deer River Bank were seized
you released the captives as they were led away
Thats the precepts and observances you practiced in the past
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep
When a boat on the Ganges River was seized
by a fierce dragon desiring human flesh
you freed it wielding mighty force
Thats the precepts and observances you practiced in the past
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep
I used to be your servant named Kappa
You thought he was intelligent and loyal
Thats the precepts and observances you practiced in the past
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep
You certainly understand this life span of mine
And others too you know thats why youre the Buddha
And thats why your blazing glory
lights up even the Brahmā realm

A Certain Brahmā
At Sāvatthī
Now at that time a certain Brahmā had the following harmful misconception
No ascetic or brahmin can come here
Then the Buddha knew what that Brahmā was thinking As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from Jetas Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm
Then the Buddha sat crosslegged in the air above that Brahmā having entered upon the fire element
Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought
Where is the Buddha staying at present
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman he saw the Buddha seated crosslegged in the air above that Brahmā having entered upon the fire element
Then as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from Jetas Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm

Sir do you still have the same view

Or do you see the radiance
transcending the Brahmā realm
Good sir I dont have that view

I see the radiance
transcending the Brahmā realm
So how could I say today
that I am permanent and eternal
Having inspired a sense of awe in the Brahmā as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm the Buddha vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in Jetas Grove
Then that Brahmā addressed a member of his retinue
Please good sir go up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and say to him
Moggallāna my good sir are there any other disciples of the Buddha who have power and might
comparable to the masters Moggallāna Kassapa Kappina and Anuruddha
Yes good sir replied that retinue member He went to Moggallāna and asked as instructed
Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that member of Brahmās retinue in verse
There are many disciples of the Buddha
who have the three knowledges
and have attained psychic power expert in reading minds
theyre perfected ones with defilements ended
Then that member of Brahmās retinue having approved and agreed with what Mahāmoggallāna said went to that Brahmā and said to him

Respect
So I have heard
At one time when he was first awakened the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherds banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind
Its unpleasant to live without respect and reverence What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on
Then it occurred to him
Id honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of ethics if it were incomplete
But I dont see any other ascetic or brahmin in this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humanswho is more accomplished than myself in ethics who I should honor and respect and rely on
Id honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of immersion if it were incomplete

Why dont I honor and respect and rely on the same Dhamma to which I was awakened
Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha
He arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said
Thats so true Blessed One Thats so true Holy One
All the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past honored and respected and relied on this same teaching
All the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will honor and respect and rely on this same teaching
May the Blessed One who is the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha at present also honor and respect and rely on this same teaching
This is what Brahmā Sahampati said Then he went on to say
All Buddhas in the past
the Buddhas of the future
and the Buddha at present
destroyer of the sorrows of many
respecting the true teaching
they did live they do live
and they also will live
This is the nature of the Buddhas
Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare

About Aruṇavatī
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī
There he addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Once upon a time mendicants there was a king named Aruṇavā
He had a capital named Aruṇavatī
Sikhī the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha lived supported by Aruṇavatī
Sikhī had a fine pair of chief disciples named Abhibhū and Sambhava
Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū
Come brahmin lets go to one of the brahmā realms until its time for our meal
Yes sir replied Abhibhū
Then as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm they vanished from Aruṇavatī and appeared in that Brahmā realm
Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū
Brahmin teach the Dhamma as you feel inspired for that Brahmā his assembly and the members of his retinue
Yes sir replied Abhibhū Then he educated encouraged fired up and inspired them with a Dhamma talk
But the Brahmā his assembly and his retinue complained grumbled and objected
Its incredible its amazing How on earth can a disciple teach Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher
Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū
Brahmin Brahmā his assembly and his retinue are complaining
that a disciple teaches Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher
Well then brahmin stir them up even more
Yes sir replied Abhibhū Then he taught Dhamma with his body visible with his body invisible with the lower half visible and the upper half invisible and with the upper half visible and the lower half invisible
And the Brahmā his assembly and his retinue their minds full of wonder and amazement thought
Its incredible its amazing The ascetic has such psychic power and might
Then Abhibhū said to the Buddha Sikhī
Sir I recall having said this in the middle of the Saṅgha
Standing in the Brahmā realm I can make my voice heard throughout the galaxy
Now is the time brahmin Now is the time brahmin
Standing in the Brahmā realm make your voice heard throughout the galaxy
Yes sir replied Abhibhū Standing in the Brahmā realm he recited this verse
Rouse yourselves Try harder
Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha
Crush the army of Death
as an elephant a hut of reeds
Whoever will live diligently
in this teaching and training
giving up transmigration through rebirths
will make an end of suffering
Having inspired that Brahmā his assembly and his retinue with a sense of awe
as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm Sikhī and Abhibhū vanished from that Brahmā realm and appeared in Aruṇavatī
Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicants
Mendicants did you hear the mendicant Abhibhū speaking a verse while standing in a Brahmā realm
We did sir
But what exactly did you hear
This is what we heard sir
Rouse yourselves Try harder
Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha
Crush the army of Death
as an elephant a hut of reeds

Final Extinguishment
At one time the Buddha was staying between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā at the time of his final extinguishment
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants
Come now mendicants I say to you all
Conditions fall apart Persist with diligence
These were the Realized Ones last words
Then the Buddha entered the first absorption
Emerging from that he entered the second absorption
Emerging from that he successively entered into and emerged from the third absorption the fourth absorption the dimension of infinite space the dimension of infinite consciousness the dimension of nothingness and the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Then he entered the cessation of perception and feeling
Then he emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling and entered the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Emerging from that he successively entered into and emerged from the dimension of nothingness the dimension of infinite consciousness the dimension of infinite space the fourth absorption the third absorption the second absorption and the first absorption
Emerging from that he successively entered into and emerged from the second absorption and the third absorption
Then he entered the fourth absorption
Emerging from that the Buddha immediately became fully extinguished
When the Buddha became fully extinguished along with the full extinguishment Brahmā Sahampati recited this verse
All creatures in this world
must lay down this bag of bones
For even a Teacher such as this
unrivaled in the world
the Realized One attained to power
the Buddha became fully extinguished
When the Buddha became fully extinguished Sakka lord of gods recited this verse
Oh Conditions are impermanent
their nature is to rise and fall
having arisen they cease
their stilling is true bliss
When the Buddha became fully extinguished Venerable nanda recited this verse
Then there was terror
Then they had goosebumps
When the Buddha endowed with all fine qualities
became fully extinguished
When the Buddha became fully extinguished Venerable Anuruddha recited this verse
There was no more breathing
for the poised one of steady heart
Imperturbable committed to peace
the seer became fully extinguished
He put up with painful feelings
without flinching
The liberation of his heart
was like the extinguishing of a lamp

But Subrahmā said to Suddhāvāsa
Good sir its the wrong time to pay homage to the Buddha
He has gone into retreat for the days meditation
But such and such Brahmā realm is successful and prosperous while the Brahmā living there is negligent
Come lets go to that Brahmā realm and inspire awe in that Brahmā
Yes good sir replied Suddhāvāsa
Then as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm they vanished from in front of the Buddha and appeared in that Brahmā realm
That Brahmā saw those Brahmās coming off in the distance and said to them
Well now good sirs where have you come from
Good sir weve come from the presence of the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Shouldnt you go to attend on that Blessed One
When they had spoken that Brahmā refused to accept their advice He multiplied himself a thousand times and said to Subrahmā
Good sir cant you see that I have such psychic power
I see that good sir
Since I have such psychic power and might what other ascetic or brahmin should I go to and attend upon
Then Subrahmā multiplied himself two thousand times and said to that Brahmā
Good sir cant you see that I have such psychic power
I see that good sir
That Buddha has even more psychic power and might than you or me
Shouldnt you go to attend on that Blessed One
Then that Brahmā addressed Subrahmā in verse
There are three hundreds of phoenixes four of swans and five of eagles
This palace belongs to him who practiced absorption
It shines Brahmā

One should frequent secluded lodgings
and practice to be released from fetters
If you dont find enjoyment there
live in the Saṅgha guarded and mindful
Walking for alms from family to family
with senses guarded alert and mindful
One should frequent secluded lodgings
free of fear freed in the fearless
Where dreadful serpents slither
where the lightning flashes and the sky thunders
in the dark of the night
there meditates a mendicant free of goosebumps
For this has in fact been seen by me
it isnt just what the testament says
Within a single spiritual dispensation
a thousand are destroyers of Death
And of trainees there are more than five hundred
and ten times ten tens
all are streamenterers
freed from rebirth in the animal realm
And as for other people
who I think have shared in merit
I couldnt even number them

With Brahmadeva
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time a certain brahmin lady had a son called Brahmadeva who had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the Buddha
Then Venerable Brahmadeva living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
He understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
And Venerable Brahmadeva became one of the perfected
Then Brahmadeva robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for alms
Wandering indiscriminately for almsfood in Sāvatthī he approached his own mothers home
Now at that time Brahmadevas mother the brahmin lady was offering up a regular oblation to Brahmā
Then Brahmā Sahampati thought
This Venerable Brahmadevas mother the brahmin lady offers up a regular oblation to Brahmā
Why dont I go and stir up a sense of urgency in her
Then as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in the home of Brahmadevas mother
Then Brahmā Sahampati while standing in the air addressed Brahmadevas mother in verse
Far from here is the Brahmā realm madam
to which you offer a regular oblation
But Brahmā doesnt eat that kind of food
Why make invocations when you dont know the path to Brahmā
This Brahmadeva madam
free of attachments has surpassed the gods
Owning nothing providing for no other a mendicant
has entered your house for alms
Hes worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods a knowledge master selfdeveloped
Hes worthy of a religious donation from gods and men
Having shunned all evils hes unsullied
Cool at heart he wanders looking for food
He has no before and after
peaceful unclouded untroubled with no need for hope
he has laid down the rod for all creatures firm and frail
So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms
With peaceful mind he has left the crowd
he wanders like a tamed elephant unperturbed
Hes a mendicant fair in ethics with heart well freed
So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms
With unwavering confidence in him
present your religious donation to one who is worthy of it
Now that youve seen the sage who has crossed over madam
make merit for the sake of future happiness
With unwavering confidence in him
she presented her religious donation to one who is worthy of it

The Appeal of Brahmā
So I have heard
At one time when he was first awakened the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherds banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind
This principle I have discovered is deep hard to see hard to understand peaceful sublime beyond the scope of logic subtle comprehensible to the astute
But people like attachment they love it and enjoy it
Its hard for them to see this thing that is specific conditionality dependent origination
Its also hard for them to see this thing that is the stilling of all activities the letting go of all attachments the ending of craving fading away cessation extinguishment
And if I were to teach this principle others might not understand me which would be wearying and troublesome for me
And then these verses which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past occurred to the Buddha
Ive struggled hard to realize this
enough with trying to explain it
This principle is not easily understood
by those mired in greed and hate
Those caught up in greed cant see
whats subtle going against the stream
deep hard to see and very fine
for theyre shrouded in a mass of darkness
And as the Buddha reflected like this his mind inclined to remaining passive not to teaching the Dhamma
Then Brahmā Sahampati knowing what the Buddha was thinking thought
Oh my goodness The world will be lost the world will perish For the mind of the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha inclines to remaining passive not to teaching the Dhamma
Then as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha
He arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt with his right knee on the ground raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said
Sir let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma
There are beings with little dust in their eyes Theyre in decline because they havent heard the teaching
There will be those who understand the teaching
This is what Brahmā Sahampati said Then he went on to say
Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past
an impure teaching thought up by those still stained
Fling open the door to the deathless
Let them hear the teaching the immaculate one discovered
Standing high on a rocky mountain
you can see the people all around
In just the same way allseer wise one
having ascended the Temple of Truth
rid of sorrow look upon the people
swamped with sorrow oppressed by rebirth and old age
Rise hero Victor in battle leader of the caravan
wander the world without obligation
Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma
There will be those who understand
Then the Buddha understanding Brahmās invitation surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha because of his compassion for sentient beings
And the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes and some with much dust in their eyes with keen faculties and with weak faculties with good qualities and with bad qualities easy to teach and hard to teach And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world while others did not
Its like a pool with blue water lilies or pink or white lotuses Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it thriving underwater Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the waters surface And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them
In the same way the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes and some with much dust in their eyes with keen faculties and with weak faculties with good qualities and with bad qualities easy to teach and hard to teach And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world while others did not
When he had seen this he replied in verse to Brahmā Sahampati
Flung open are the doors to the deathless
Let those with ears to hear decide their faith
Thinking it would be troublesome Brahmā I did not teach
the sophisticated sublime Dhamma among humans
Then Brahmā Sahampati knowing that his request for the Buddha to teach the Dhamma had been granted bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before vanishing right there

A Single Person
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak Mountain
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants transmigration has no known beginning 
One person roaming and transmigrating for an eon would amass a heap of bones the size of this Mount Vepulla if they were gathered together and not lost
Why is that
Transmigration has no known beginning 
This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned dispassionate and freed regarding all conditions
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
If the bones of a single person
for a single eon were gathered up
theyd make a pile the size of a mountain
so said the great hermit
And this is declared to be
as huge as Mount Vepulla
higher than the Vultures Peak
in the Magadhan mountain range
But then with right understanding
a person sees the noble truths
suffering sufferings origin
sufferings transcendence
and the noble eightfold path
that leads to the stilling of suffering
After roaming on seven times at most
that person
makes an end of suffering
with the ending of all fetters

A Mountain
At Sāvatthī
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and asked him
Sir how long is an eon
Mendicant an eon is long
Its not easy to calculate how many years how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts
But sir is it possible to give a simile
Its possible said the Buddha
Suppose there was a huge stone mountain a league long a league wide and a league high with no cracks or holes one solid mass
And as each century passed someone would stroke it with a fine cloth from Kāsī
By this means the huge stone mountain would be worn away before the eon comes to an end
Thats how long an eon is
And weve transmigrated through many such eons many hundreds many thousands many hundreds of thousands

The Ganges
Near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove
Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and asked the Buddha
Sir how many eons have passed
Brahmin many eons have passed
Its not easy to calculate
how many eons have passed how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of eons
But sir can you give a simile
I can said the Buddha
Consider the Ganges river from where it originates to where it enters the ocean Between these places its not easy to calculate
how many grains of sand there are how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of grains of sand
The eons that have passed are more than this
Its not easy to calculate
how many eons have passed how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of eons
Why is that
Transmigration has no known beginning
No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
For such a long time you have undergone suffering agony and disaster swelling the cemeteries
This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned dispassionate and freed regarding all conditions
When he said this the brahmin said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent 
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life

Mount Vepulla
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak Mountain
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants transmigration has no known beginning
No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
Once upon a time mendicants this Mount Vepulla was known as Pācīnavasa
And at that time people were known as Tivaras
The lifespan of the Tivaras was  years
It took them four days to climb Mount Vepulla and four days to descend
At that time Kakusandha the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world
Kakusandha had a fine pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sañjīva
See mendicants This mountains name has vanished those people have passed away and that Buddha has become fully extinguished
So impermanent are conditions
so unstable are conditions
so unreliable are conditions
This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned dispassionate and freed regarding all conditions
Once upon a time this Mount Vepulla was known as Vaṅkaka
And at that time people were known as Rohitassas
The lifespan of the Rohitassas was  years
It took them three days to climb Mount Vepulla and three days to descend
At that time Koṇāgamana the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world
Koṇāgamana had a fine pair of chief disciples named Bhiyyosa and Uttara
See mendicants This mountains name has vanished those people have passed away and that Buddha has become fully extinguished
So impermanent are conditions 
Once upon a time this Mount Vepulla was known as Supassa
And at that time people were known as Suppiyas
The lifespan of the Suppiyas was  years
It took them two days to climb Mount Vepulla and two days to descend
At that time Kassapa the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world
Kassapa had a fine pair of chief disciples named Tissa and Bhāradvāja
See mendicants This mountains name has vanished those people have passed away and that Buddha has become fully extinguished
So impermanent are conditions 
These days this Mount Vepulla is known as Vepulla
And these people are known as Magadhans
The lifespan of the Magadhans is short brief and fleeting
A long life is a hundred years or a little more
It takes the Magadhans an hour to climb Mount Vepulla and an hour to descend
And now I am the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha who has arisen in the world
I have a fine pair of chief disciples named Sāriputta and Moggallāna
There will come a time when this mountains name will vanish those people will die and I will be fully extinguished
So impermanent are conditions
so unstable are conditions
so unreliable are conditions
This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned dispassionate and freed regarding all conditions
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
For the Tivaras it was Pācīnavasa
for the Rohitassa Vaṅkaka

and Vepulla for the Magadhans

Suppose there was an iron city a league long a league wide and a league high full of mustard seeds pressed into balls
And as each century passed someone would remove a single mustard seed
By this means the huge heap of mustard seeds would be used up before the eon comes to an end
Thats how long an eon is

Near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove
Then thirty mendicants from Pāvā went to the Buddha All of them lived in the wilderness ate only almsfood wore rag robes and owned just three robes yet they all still had fetters They bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side
Then it occurred to the Buddha
These thirty mendicants from Pāvā live in the wilderness eat only almsfood wear rag robes and own just three robes yet they all still have fetters
Why dont I teach them the Dhamma in such a way that their minds are freed from defilements by not grasping while sitting in this very seat
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants transmigration has no known beginning
No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving
What do you think Which is more the flow of blood youve shed when your head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating for such a very long time or the water in the four oceans
As we understand the Buddhas teaching the flow of blood weve shed when our head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating is more than the water in the four oceans
Good good mendicants Its good that you understand my teaching like this
The flow of blood youve shed when your head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating is indeed more than the water in the four oceans
For a long time youve been cows and the flow of blood youve shed when your head was chopped off as a cow is more than the water in the four oceans
For a long time youve been buffalo 
chickens 
For a long time youve been bandits arrested for raiding villages
highway robbery

This monk gets the four absorptionsblissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mindwhen he wants without trouble or difficulty He has realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life and lives having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
That is what the Buddha said

Not by being slack
or with little strength
is extinguishment realized
the freedom from all suffering
This young monk
this best of men

At Sāvatthī
Then Venerable Tissathe Buddhas cousin on his fathers sidewent to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
He was miserable and sad with tears flowing Then the Buddha said to him
Tissa why are you sitting there so miserable and sad with tears flowing
Sir its because the mendicants on all sides provoke me with barbed words
Thats because you admonish others but dont accept admonition yourself
As a gentleman who has gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness its not appropriate for you to admonish others without accepting admonition yourself
Its appropriate for you to
admonish others and accept admonition yourself
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
Why are you angry Dont be angry
Its better to not be angry Tissa
For this spiritual life is lived

There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants
Reverends mendicants
Reverend they replied
Sāriputta said this
Just now reverends as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind
Is there anything in the world whose changing and perishing would give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress in me
It occurred to me
There is nothing in the world whose changing and perishing would give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress in me
When he said this Venerable nanda said to him
Even if the Teacher were to decay and perish Wouldnt that give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress in you
Even if the Teacher were to decay and perish that wouldnt give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress in me Still I would think
Alas the illustrious Teacher so mighty and powerful has vanished
If the Buddha was to remain for a long time that would be for the welfare and happiness of the people for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humans
That must be because Venerable Sāriputta has long ago totally eradicated ego possessiveness and the underlying tendency to conceit
So even if the Teacher were to decay and perish it wouldnt give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress in him

A Mound of Salt
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
At that time Venerables Sāriputta and Moggallāna were staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Then in the late afternoon Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat went to Venerable Moggallāna and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over Sāriputta sat down to one side and said to Mahāmoggallāna
Reverend Moggallāna your faculties are so very clear and your complexion is pure and bright
Have you spent the day in a peaceful meditation
Reverend Ive spent the day in a coarse meditation
But I have had some Dhamma talk
Who did you have a Dhamma talk with
With the Buddha
But Reverend the Buddha is far away Hes staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Did you go to him with your psychic power
or did he come to you
No reverend I didnt go to him with my psychic power
nor did he come to me
Rather the Buddha cleared his clairvoyance and clairaudience towards me
and I cleared my clairvoyance and clairaudience towards him
But what manner of Dhamma talk did you have together
Well reverend I said to the Buddha
Sir they speak of one who is energetic
How is an energetic person defined
When I said this the Buddha said
Moggallāna its when a mendicant lives with energy roused up
Gladly let only skin sinews and bones remain Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength energy and vigor
Thats how a person is energetic
Thats the Dhamma talk I had together with the Buddha
Reverend next to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna Im like a few pieces of gravel next to the Himalayas the king of mountains
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is so mighty and powerful he could if he wished live on for the eon
Reverend next to Venerable Sāriputta Im like a few grains of salt next to a mound of salt
Venerable Sāriputta has been commended complimented and praised by the Buddha
In wisdom

any mendicant who has crossed over
can at best equal Sāriputta

Yes sir
But in what way do you live alone and praise living alone
Well sir I enter the village for alms alone return alone sit in private alone and concentrate on walking mindfully alone
Thats how I live alone and praise living alone
That is a kind of living alone I dont deny it
But as to how living alone is fulfilled in detail

Yes sir he replied
And how Senior is living alone fulfilled in detail
Its when whats in the past is given up whats in the future is relinquished and desire and greed for present incarnations is eliminated
Thats how living alone is fulfilled in detail
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say

Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this
Just now reverends as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind

As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
This is called noble silence
And so as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled I was entering and remaining in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
While I was in that meditation perceptions and attentions accompanied by placing the mind beset me
Then the Buddha came up to me with his psychic power and said
Moggallāna Moggallāna Dont neglect noble silence brahmin Settle your mind in noble silence unify your mind and bring it to immersion in noble silence

Rooted in Contact
Mendicants these three feelings are born rooted sourced and conditioned by contact
What three
Pleasant painful and neutral feeling
Pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops
Painful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as painful the corresponding painful feeling ceases and stops
Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops
When you rub two sticks together heat is generated and fire is produced
But when you part the sticks and lay them aside any corresponding heat ceases and stops
In the same way these three feelings are born rooted sourced and conditioned by contact

Master Gotama there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view
Everything this individual experiencespleasurable painful or neutralis because of past deeds
What does Master Gotama say about this
Sīvaka some feelings stem from bile disorders
You can know this from your own personal experience
and it is generally agreed to be true
Since this is so the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that
everything an individual experiences is because of past deeds
go beyond personal experience and beyond what is generally agreed to be true
So those ascetics and brahmins are wrong I say
Some feelings stem from phlegm disorders

An Arrow
Mendicants an uneducated ordinary person feels pleasant painful and neutral feelings
An educated noble disciple also feels pleasant painful and neutral feelings
What then is the difference between an ordinary uneducated person and an educated noble disciple
Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha 
When an uneducated ordinary person experiences painful physical feelings they sorrow and wail and lament beating their breast and falling into confusion
They experience two feelings
physical and mental
Its like a person who is struck with an arrow
only to be struck with a second arrow
That person experiences the feeling of two arrows
In the same way when an uneducated ordinary person experiences painful physical feelings they sorrow and wail and lament beating their breast and falling into confusion
They experience two feelings
physical and mental
When theyre touched by painful feeling they resist it
The underlying tendency for repulsion towards painful feeling underlies that
When touched by painful feeling they look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures
Why is that
Because an uneducated ordinary person doesnt understand any escape from painful feeling apart from sensual pleasures
Since they look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures the underlying tendency to greed for pleasant feeling underlies that
They dont truly understand feelings origin ending gratification drawback and escape
The underlying tendency to ignorance about neutral feeling underlies that
If they feel a pleasant feeling they feel it attached
If they feel a painful feeling they feel it attached
If they feel a neutral feeling they feel it attached
Theyre called an uneducated ordinary person who is attached to rebirth old age and death to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress I say
When an educated noble disciple experiences painful physical feelings they dont sorrow or wail or lament beating their breast and falling into confusion
They experience one feeling
physical not mental
Its like a person who is struck with an arrow
but was not struck with a second arrow
That person would experience the feeling of one arrow
In the same way when an educated noble disciple experiences painful physical feelings they dont sorrow or wail or lament beating their breast and falling into confusion
They experience one feeling
physical not mental
When theyre touched by painful feeling they dont resist it
Theres no underlying tendency for repulsion towards painful feeling underlying that
When touched by painful feeling they dont look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures
Why is that
Because an educated noble disciple understands an escape from painful feeling apart from sensual pleasures
Since they dont look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures theres no underlying tendency to greed for pleasant feeling underlying that
They truly understand feelings origin ending gratification drawback and escape
Theres no underlying tendency to ignorance about neutral feeling underlying that
If they feel a pleasant feeling they feel it detached
If they feel a painful feeling they feel it detached
If they feel a neutral feeling they feel it detached
Theyre called an educated noble disciple who is detached from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress I say
This is the difference between an educated noble disciple and an uneducated ordinary person
A wise and learned person isnt affected
by feelings of pleasure and pain
This is the great difference in skill
between the wise and the ordinary
A learned person who has appraised the teaching
discerns this world and the next
Desirable things dont disturb their mind
nor are they repelled by the undesirable
Both favoring and opposing
are cleared and ended they are no more
Knowing the stainless sorrowless state
they understand rightly going beyond rebirth

Why is that
Because there is another pleasure that is finer than that
And what is that pleasure
Its when a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling
This is a pleasure that is finer than that
Its possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say
The ascetic Gotama spoke of the cessation of perception and feeling and he includes it in happiness
Whats up with that
When wanderers who follow other paths say this you should say to them
Reverends when the Buddha describes whats included in happiness hes not just referring to pleasant feeling
The Realized One describes pleasure as included in happiness wherever its found and in whatever context

First The Infirmary
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
Then in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the infirmary where he sat down on the seat spread out
and addressed the mendicants
Mendicants a mendicant should await their time mindful and aware
This is my instruction to you
And how is a mendicant mindful
Its when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings 
They meditate observing an aspect of the mind 
They meditate observing an aspect of principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
Thats how a mendicant is mindful
And how is a mendicant aware
Its when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back when looking ahead and aside when bending and extending the limbs when bearing the outer robe bowl and robes when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting sleeping waking speaking and keeping silent
Thats how a mendicant acts with situational awareness
A mendicant should await their time mindful and aware
This is my instruction to you
While a mendicant is meditating like thismindful aware diligent keen and resoluteif pleasant feelings arise they understand
A pleasant feeling has arisen in me
Thats dependent not independent
Dependent on what
Dependent on my own body
But this body is impermanent conditioned dependently originated
So how could a pleasant feeling be permanent since it has arisen dependent on a body that is impermanent conditioned and dependently originated
They meditate observing impermanence vanishing dispassion cessation and letting go in the body and pleasant feeling
As they do so they give up the underlying tendency for greed for the body and pleasant feeling
While a mendicant is meditating like thismindful aware diligent keen and resoluteif painful feelings arise they understand
A painful feeling has arisen in me
Thats dependent not independent
Dependent on what
Dependent on my own body
But this body is impermanent conditioned dependently originated
So how could a painful feeling be permanent since it has arisen dependent on a body that is impermanent conditioned and dependently originated
They meditate observing impermanence vanishing dispassion cessation and letting go in the body and painful feeling
As they do so they give up the underlying tendency for repulsion towards the body and painful feeling
While a mendicant is meditating like thismindful aware diligent keen and resoluteif neutral feelings arise they understand
A neutral feeling has arisen in me
Thats dependent not independent
Dependent on what
Dependent on my own body
But this body is impermanent conditioned dependently originated
So how could a neutral feeling be permanent since it has arisen dependent on a body that is impermanent conditioned and dependently originated
They meditate observing impermanence vanishing dispassion cessation and letting go in the body and neutral feeling
As they do so they give up the underlying tendency for ignorance towards the body and neutral feeling
If they feel a pleasant feeling they understand that its impermanent that theyre not attached to it and that they dont take pleasure in it
If they feel a painful feeling they understand that its impermanent that theyre not attached to it and that they dont take pleasure in it
If they feel a neutral feeling they understand that its impermanent that theyre not attached to it and that they dont take pleasure in it
If they feel a pleasant feeling they feel it detached
If they feel a painful feeling they feel it detached
If they feel a neutral feeling they feel it detached
Feeling the end of the body approaching they understand I feel the end of the body approaching Feeling the end of life approaching they understand I feel the end of life approaching
They understand When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end everything thats felt since I no longer take pleasure in it will become cool right here
Suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn
As the oil and the wick are used up it would be extinguished due to lack of fuel
In the same way feeling the end of the body approaching a mendicant understands I feel the end of the body approaching Feeling the end of life approaching a mendicant understands I feel the end of life approaching
They understand When my body breaks up and my life is over everything thats felt since I no longer take pleasure in it will become cool right here

And what is feelings gratification drawback and escape
Mendicants there are these three feelings

Feeling originates from contact
When contact ceases feeling ceases
The practice that leads to the cessation of feelings is simply this noble eightfold path that is
right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion
The pleasure and happiness that arise from feeling this is its gratification
That feeling is impermanent suffering and perishable this is its drawback

Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to him
Kassapa advise the mendicants
Give them a Dhamma talk
Either you or I should advise the mendicants
and give them a Dhamma talk
Sir the mendicants these days are hard to admonish having qualities that make them hard to admonish Theyre impatient and dont take instruction respectfully
Take the monk called Bhaṇḍa nandas pupil Hes been competing in studies with the monk called Abhiñjika Anuruddhas pupil They say
Come on monk who can recite more Who can recite better Who can recite longer
So the Buddha addressed a certain monk
Please monk in my name tell the monk called Bhaṇḍa nandas pupil and the monk called Abhiñjika Anuruddhas pupil that
the teacher summons them
Yes sir that monk replied He went to those monks and said
Venerables the teacher summons you
Yes reverend those monks replied
They went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side The Buddha said to them
Is it really true monks that youve been competing in studies saying
Come on monk who can recite more Who can recite better Who can recite longer
Yes sir
Have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma like this
Please mendicants compete in studies to
see who can recite more and better and longer
No sir
If youve never known me to teach the Dhamma like this then what exactly do you know and see you foolish men that after going forth in such a well explained teaching and training youd compete in studies to
see who can recite more and better and longer
Then those monks bowed with their heads at the Buddhas feet and said
We have made a mistake sir It was foolish stupid and unskillful of us in that after going forth in such a well explained teaching and training we competed in studies to
see who can recite more and better and longer
Please sir accept our mistake for what it is so we will restrain ourselves in future
Indeed monks you made a mistake It was foolish stupid and unskillful of you to act in that way
But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is and have dealt with it properly I accept it
For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is deal with it properly and commit to restraint in the future

Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to him
Youre old now Kassapa Those wornout hempen rag robes must be a burden for you
So Kassapa you should wear clothes given by householders accept invitations for the meal and stay in my presence
For a long time sir Ive lived in the wilderness eaten only almsfood worn rag robes and owned just three robes and Ive praised these things Ive been one of few wishes content secluded aloof and energetic and Ive praised these things
But seeing what benefit Kassapa have you long practiced these things
Sir seeing two benefits I have long practiced these things
I see a happy life for myself in the present And I have compassion for future generations thinking
Hopefully those who come after might follow my example
For they may think It seems that the awakened disciples of the Buddha for a long time lived in the wilderness ate only almsfood wore rag robes and owned just three robes and they praised these things They were of few wishes content secluded aloof and energetic and they praised these things
Theyll practice accordingly which will be for their lasting welfare and happiness
Seeing these two benefits I have long practiced these things

Youre acting for the welfare and happiness of the people for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humans

Absorptions and Insights

Mendicants whenever I want quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
And so does Kassapa
Whenever I want as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled I enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
And so does Kassapa
Whenever I want with the fading away of rapture I enter and remain in the third absorption where I meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss

Whenever I want with the giving up of pleasure and pain and the ending of former happiness and sadness I enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
And so does Kassapa
Whenever I want going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space
And so does Kassapa
Whenever I want going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness
And so does Kassapa
Whenever I want going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all I enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness
And so does Kassapa
Whenever I want going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness I enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
And so does Kassapa
Whenever I want going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception I enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling

Whenever I want I wield the many kinds of psychic power multiplying myself and becoming one again going unimpeded through a wall a rampart or a mountain as if through space diving in and out of the earth as if it were water walking on water as if it were earth flying crosslegged through the sky like a bird touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon so mighty and powerful I control the body as far as the Brahmā realm
And so does Kassapa
Whenever I want with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman I hear both kinds of sounds human and divine whether near or far
And so does Kassapa
Whenever I want I understand the minds of other beings and individuals having comprehended them with my mind

Imprudent
So I have heard
At one time Venerable Mahākassapa and Venerable Sāriputta were staying near Benares in the deer park at Isipatana
Then in the late afternoon Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat went to Venerable Mahākassapa and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to Mahākassapa
Reverend Kassapa its said that without being keen and prudent you cant achieve awakening extinguishment and the supreme sanctuary
But if youre keen and prudent you can achieve awakening extinguishment and the supreme sanctuary
To what extent is this the case
Reverend take a mendicant who doesnt foster keenness by thinking If unarisen unskillful qualities arise in me theyll lead to harm If I dont give up arisen unskillful qualities theyll lead to harm If I dont give rise to unarisen skillful qualities theyll lead to harm If arisen skillful qualities cease in me theyll lead to harm

Visiting Families
At Sāvatthī
What do you think mendicants
What kind of mendicant is worthy of visiting families And what kind of mendicant is not worthy of visiting families
Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha 
The Buddha said this
Whoever visits families with the thought
May they give to me may they not fail to give
May they give a lot not a little
May they give me fine things not coarse
May they give quickly not slowly
May they give carefully not carelessly
If a mendicant with such a thought approaches a family and they dont give the mendicant feels slighted And they experience pain and sadness because of that
If they give only a little 
if they give coarse things 
if they give slowly 
if they give carelessly the mendicant feels slighted And they experience pain and sadness because of that
That kind of mendicant is not worthy of visiting families
Whoever visits families with the thought
When among other families how could I possibly think
May they give to me may they not fail to give
May they give a lot not a little
May they give me fine things not coarse
May they give quickly not slowly
May they give carefully not carelessly
If a mendicant with such a thought approaches a family and they dont give the mendicant doesnt feel slighted And they dont experience pain and sadness because of that
If they give only a little 
if they give coarse things 
if they give slowly 
if they give carelessly the mendicant doesnt feel slighted And they dont experience pain and sadness because of that
That kind of mendicant is worthy of visiting families
Kassapa visits families with the thought
When among other families how could I possibly think
May they give to me may they not fail to give
May they give a lot not a little
May they give me fine things not coarse
May they give quickly not slowly
May they give carefully not carelessly
With such a thought if he approaches a family and they dont give he doesnt feel slighted And he doesnt experience pain and sadness because of that
If they give only a little 
if they give coarse things 
if they give slowly 
if they give carelessly he doesnt feel slighted And he doesnt experience pain and sadness because of that
I will exhort you with the example of Kassapa or someone like him
You should practice accordingly

The Realized One After Death
At one time Venerable Mahākassapa and Venerable Sāriputta were staying near Benares in the deer park at Isipatana
Then in the late afternoon Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat went to Venerable Mahākassapa and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to Mahākassapa
Reverend Kassapa does a Realized One exist after death
Reverend this has not been declared by the Buddha
Well then does a Realized One not exist after death
This too has not been declared by the Buddha
Well then does a Realized One both exist and not exist after death
This too has not been declared by the Buddha
Well then does a Realized One neither exist nor not exist after death
This too has not been declared by the Buddha
And why has this not been declared by the Buddha
Because its not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life It doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment
Thats why it has not been declared by the Buddha
So what now has been declared by the Buddha
This is suffering has been declared by the Buddha
This is the origin of suffering 
This is the cessation of suffering 
This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering has been declared by the Buddha
And why has this been declared by the Buddha
Because its beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life It leads to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment
Thats why it has been declared by the Buddha

At one time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Now at that time Venerable nanda was wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
And at that time thirty of nandas mendicant pupils resigned the training and returned to a lesser life Most of them were youths
When Venerable nanda had wandered in the Southern Hills as long as he wished he set out for Rājagaha to the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
He went up to Venerable Mahākassapa bowed and sat down to one side Mahākassapa said to him
Reverend nanda for how many reasons did the Buddha lay down a rule against eating in groups of more than three among families
Sir the Buddha laid down that rule for three reasons
For keeping difficult persons in check and for the comfort of goodhearted mendicants To prevent those of wicked desires from taking sides and dividing the Saṅgha And out of consideration for families
These are the three reasons why the Buddha laid down that rule
So what exactly are you doing wandering together with these junior mendicants They dont guard their sense doors they eat too much and theyre not committed to wakefulness
Its like youre wandering about wrecking crops and ruining families
Your following is falling apart Reverend nanda
and those just getting started are slipping away
Yet this boy knows no bounds
Though there are grey hairs on my head
I still cant escape being called a boy by Venerable Mahākassapa
Its because you wander with these junior mendicants 
Your following is falling apart Reverend nanda
and those just getting started are slipping away
Yet this boy knows no bounds
The nun Thullanandā heard a rumor that
Master Mahākassapa had rebuked Master nanda the Videhan sage by calling him a boy
She was upset and blurted out
How can Master Mahākassapa who formerly followed another path presume to rebuke Master nanda the Videhan sage by calling him a boy
Mahākassapa heard Thullanandā say these words
and he said to nanda
Indeed Reverend nanda the nun Thullanandā spoke rashly and without reflection
Since I shaved off my hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness I dont recall acknowledging any other teacher apart from the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Formerly when I was still a layman I thought
Living in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide open
Its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shell
Why dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
After some time I made an outer robe of patches and in the name of the perfected ones in the world I shaved off my hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness
When I had gone forth I traveled along the road between Rājagaha and Nālanda where I saw the Buddha sitting at the Bahuputta Shrine
Seeing him I thought
If Im ever to see a Teacher it would be this Blessed One
If Im ever to see a Holy One it would be this Blessed One
If Im ever to see a fully awakened Buddha it would be this Blessed One
Then I bowed with my head at the Buddhas feet and said
Sir the Buddha is my Teacher I am his disciple
The Buddha is my Teacher I am his disciple
The Buddha said to me
Kassapa if anyone was to say to such a wholehearted disciple that they know when they dont know or that they see when they dont see their head would explode
But Kassapa when I say that I know and see I really do know and see
So you should train like this
I will set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for seniors juniors and those in the middle
Thats how you should train
And you should train like this
Whenever I hear a teaching connected with whats skillful I will pay heed pay attention engage wholeheartedly and lend an ear to that teaching
Thats how you should train
And you should train like this
I will never neglect mindfulness of the body that is full of pleasure
Thats how you should train
And when the Buddha had given me this advice he got up from his seat and left
For seven days I ate the nations almsfood as a debtor On the eighth day I was enlightened
And then the Buddha left the road and went to the root of a certain tree
So I spread out my outer robe of patches folded in four and said to him
Sir sit here That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness
The Buddha sat on the seat spread out
and said to me
Kassapa this outer robe of patches is soft
Sir please accept my outer robe of patches out of compassion
In that case Kassapa will you wear my wornout hempen rag robe
I will wear it sir
And so I presented my outer robe of patches to the Buddha
and the Buddha presented me with his wornout hempen rag robe
For if anyone should be rightly called
the Buddhas trueborn child born from his mouth born of the teaching created by the teaching heir to the teaching and receiver of his wornout hempen rag robes its me
Whenever I want quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected 
The nine progressive meditations and the five insights should be treated in full
I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements
Reverend you might as well think to hide a bull elephant thats three or three and a half meters tall behind a palm leaf as to hide my six insights
But the nun Thullanandā fell from the spiritual life

Third Advice
Near Rājagaha in the squirrels feeding ground
Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to him
Kassapa advise the mendicants
Give them a Dhamma talk
Either you or I should advise the mendicants
and give them a Dhamma talk
Sir the mendicants these days are hard to admonish having qualities that make them hard to admonish Theyre impatient and dont take instruction respectfully
Kassapa thats because formerly the senior mendicants lived in the wilderness ate only almsfood wore rag robes and owned just three robes and they praised these things They were of few wishes content secluded aloof and energetic and they praised these things
The senior mendicants invite such a mendicant to a seat saying
Welcome mendicant What is this mendicants name This mendicant is goodnatured he really wants to train Please mendicant take a seat
Then the junior mendicants think
It seems that when a mendicant lives in the wilderness  and is energetic and praises these things senior mendicants invite them to a seat 
They practice accordingly
That is for their lasting welfare and happiness
But these days Kassapa the senior mendicants dont live in the wilderness  and arent energetic and they dont praise these things
When a mendicant is wellknown and famous a recipient of robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick senior mendicants invite them to a seat
Welcome mendicant What is this mendicants name This mendicant is goodnatured he really likes his fellow monks Please mendicant take a seat
Then the junior mendicants think
It seems that when a mendicant is wellknown and famous a recipient of robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick senior mendicants invite them to a seat 
They practice accordingly
That is for their lasting harm and suffering
And if it could ever be rightly said that
spiritual practitioners are imperiled by the peril of a spiritual practitioner and vanquished by the vanquishing of a spiritual practitioner it is these days that this could be rightly said

He doesnt try to get hold of a robe in an improper way He doesnt get upset if he doesnt get a robe And if he does get a robe he uses it untied uninfatuated unattached seeing the drawback and understanding the escape
Kassapa is content with any kind of almsfood 
Kassapa is content with any kind of lodging 
Kassapa is content with any kind of medicines and supplies for the sick 
So you should train like this
We will be content with any kind of robe and praise such contentment We wont try to get hold of a robe in an improper way
We wont get upset if we dont get a robe And if we do get a robe well use it untied uninfatuated unattached seeing the drawback and understanding the escape

The Nuns Quarters
So I have heard
At one time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then Venerable nanda robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to Mahākassapa and said
Kassapa come sir Lets go to one of the nuns quarters
You go Reverend nanda You have many duties and responsibilities
And a second time 
And a third time nanda said
Kassapa come sir Lets go to one of the nuns quarters
Then Venerable Mahākassapa robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went with Venerable nanda as his second monk to one of the nuns quarters where he sat on the seat spread out
And then several nuns went up to Mahākassapa bowed and sat down to one side
Mahākassapa educated encouraged fired up and inspired those nuns with a Dhamma talk
after which he got up from his seat and left
But the nun Thullatissā was upset and blurted out
What is Master Mahākassapa thinking that hed teach Dhamma in front of Master nanda the Videhan sage
Hes like a needle seller who thinks they can sell a needle to a needle maker
Mahākassapa heard Thullatissā say these words
and he said to nanda
Is that right Reverend nanda Am I the needle seller and you the needle maker
Or am I the needle maker and you the needle seller
Forgive her sir The womans a fool
Hold on Reverend nanda Dont make the Saṅgha investigate you further
What do you think Reverend nanda
Was it you who the Buddha brought up before the Saṅgha of mendicants saying
Mendicants whenever I want quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
And so does nanda
No sir
I was the one the Buddha brought up before the Saṅgha of mendicants saying

The Counterfeit of the True Teaching
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
What is the cause sir what is the reason why there used to be fewer training rules but more enlightened mendicants
And what is the cause what is the reason why these days there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants
Thats how it is Kassapa When sentient beings are in decline and the true teaching is disappearing there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants
The true teaching doesnt disappear as long the counterfeit of the true teaching hasnt appeared in the world
But when the counterfeit of the true teaching appears in the world then the true teaching disappears
Its like true gold which doesnt disappear as long as counterfeit gold hasnt appeared in the world
But when counterfeit gold appears in the world then real gold disappears
In the same way the true teaching doesnt disappear as long the counterfeit of the true teaching hasnt appeared in the world
But when the counterfeit of the true teaching appears in the world then the true teaching disappears
Its not the elements of earth water fire or air that make the true teaching disappear
Rather its the foolish people who appear right here that make the true teaching disappear
The true teaching doesnt disappear like a ship that sinks all at once
There are five detrimental things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching
What five
Its when the monks nuns laymen and laywomen lack respect and reverence for the Teacher the teaching the Saṅgha the training and immersion
These five detrimental things lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching
There are five things that lead to the continuation persistence and enduring of the true teaching

The Brahmin Uṇṇābha
So I have heard
At one time Venerable nanda was staying near Kosambi in Ghositas Monastery
Then Uṇṇābha the brahmin went up to Venerable nanda and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to him
Master nanda whats the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama
The purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha brahmin is to give up desire
But is there a path and a practice for giving up that desire
There is
What is that path
Its when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm 
mental development 
inquiry and active effort
This is the path and the practice for giving up that desire
This being the case Master nanda the path is endless not finite
For its not possible to give up desire by means of desire
Well then brahmin Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think brahmin
Have you ever had a desire to walk to the park
but when you arrived at the park the corresponding desire faded away
Yes sir
Have you ever had the energy to walk to the park
but when you arrived at the park the corresponding energy faded away
Yes sir
Have you ever had the idea to walk to the park
but when you arrived at the park the corresponding idea faded away
Yes sir
Have you ever inquired regarding a walk to the park
but when you arrived at the park the corresponding inquiry faded away
Yes sir
In the same way take a mendicant who is perfectedwith defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenment They formerly had the desire to attain perfection but when they attained perfection the corresponding desire faded away
They formerly had the energy to attain perfection but when they attained perfection the corresponding energy faded away
They formerly had the idea to attain perfection but when they attained perfection the corresponding idea faded away
They formerly inquired regarding attaining perfection but when they attained perfection the corresponding inquiry faded away
What do you think brahmin
This being the case is the path endless or finite
Clearly Master nanda this being the case the path is finite not endless
Excellent Master nanda Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master nanda has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master nanda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life

Now at that time several mendicants were staying beneath the longhouse They were restless insolent fickle scurrilous loosetongued unmindful lacking situational awareness and immersion with straying minds and undisciplined faculties
Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna
These spiritual companions of yours staying beneath the longhouse are restless insolent fickle scurrilous loosetongued unmindful lacking situational awareness and immersion with wandering mind and undisciplined faculties
Go Moggallāna and strike awe in those mendicants
Yes sir replied Mahāmoggallāna Then he used his psychic power to make the longhouse shake and rock and tremble with his toe
Then those mendicants stood to one side shocked and awestruck
Its incredible its amazing
Theres no wind at all and this stilt longhouse of Migāras mother has deep foundations Its firmly embedded imperturbable and unshakable And yet it shakes and rocks and trembles

The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power made them a vehicle and a basis kept them up consolidated them and properly implemented them
If he wished the Realized One could live on for the eon or whats left of the eon
But nanda didnt get it even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint such a clear sign
He didnt beg the Buddha
Sir may the Blessed One please remain for the eon May the Holy One please remain for the eon That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humans For his mind was as if possessed by Māra
For a second time 
and for a third time the Buddha said to nanda
nanda Vesālī is lovely And the Udena Gotamaka Sattamba Bahuputta Sārandada and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely
Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic powermade them a vehicle and a basis kept them up consolidated them and properly implemented themmay if they wish live on for the eon or whats left of the eon
The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power made them a vehicle and a basis kept them up consolidated them and properly implemented them
If he wished the Realized One could live on for the eon or whats left of the eon
But nanda didnt get it even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint such a clear sign
He didnt beg the Buddha
Sir may the Blessed One please remain for the eon May the Holy One please remain for the eon That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humans For his mind was as if possessed by Māra
Then the Buddha said to him
Go now nanda
at your convenience
Yes sir replied nanda He rose from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before sitting at the root of a tree close by
And then not long after nanda had left Māra the Wicked went up to the the Buddha and said to him
Sir may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished May the Holy One now become fully extinguished Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished
Sir you once made this statement
Wicked One I will not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent educated assured learned have memorized the teachings and practice in line with the teachings Not until they practice properly living in line with the teaching Not until theyve learned their teachers doctrine and explain teach assert establish disclose analyze and make it clear Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up and teach with a demonstrable basis
Today you do have such monk disciples
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished May the Holy One now become fully extinguished Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished
Sir you once made this statement
Wicked One I will not become fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent educated assured learned  
Today you do have such nun disciples
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished May the Holy One now become fully extinguished Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished
Sir you once made this statement
Wicked One I will not become fully extinguished until I have layman disciples 
and laywoman disciples who are competent educated assured learned  
Today you do have such layman
and laywoman disciples
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished May the Holy One now become fully extinguished Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished
Sir you once made this statement
Wicked One I will not become fully extinguished until my spiritual life is successful and prosperous extensive popular widespread and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans
Today your spiritual life is successful and prosperous extensive popular widespread and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished May the Holy One now become fully extinguished Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished
When this was said the Buddha said to Māra
Relax Wicked One
The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon
Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished
So at the Cāpāla tree shrine the Buddha mindful and aware surrendered the life force
When he did so there was a great earthquake aweinspiring and hairraising and thunder cracked the sky
Then knowing the meaning of this on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment
Weighing up the incomparable against an extension of life
the sage surrendered the life force
Happy inside serene
he burst out of this selfmade chain like a suit of armor

The Nuns Quarters
Then Venerable nanda robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the nuns quarters and sat down on the seat spread out
Then several nuns went up to Venerable nanda bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir nanda several nuns meditate with their minds firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation They have realized a higher distinction than they had before
Thats how it is sisters Thats how it is sisters
Any monk or nun who meditates with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation can expect to

Then nanda educated encouraged fired up and inspired those nuns with a Dhamma talk after which he got up from his seat and left
Then nanda wandered for alms in Sāvatthī
After the meal on his return from almsround he went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
Thats so true nanda Thats so true

What four
Its when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
As they meditate observing an aspect of the body based on the body there arises physical tension or mental sluggishness or the mind is externally scattered
That mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation
As they do so joy springs up
Being joyful rapture springs up
When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil
When the body is tranquil one feels bliss
And when blissful the mind becomes immersed in samādhi
Then they reflect
I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind
Let me now pull back
They pull back and neither place the mind nor keep it connected
They understand Im neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected Mindful within myself Im happy
Furthermore a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings 
principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
As they meditate observing an aspect of principles based on principles there arises physical tension or mental sluggishness or the mind is externally scattered
That mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation
As they do so joy springs up
Being joyful rapture springs up
When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil
When the body is tranquil one feels bliss
And when blissful the mind becomes immersed in samādhi
Then they reflect
I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind
Let me now pull back
They pull back and neither place the mind nor keep it connected
They understand Im neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected Mindful within myself Im happy
Thats how there is directed development
And how is there undirected development
Not directing their mind externally a mendicant understands My mind is not directed externally
And they understand Over a period of time its unconstricted freed and undirected
And they also understand I meditate observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware mindful I am happy
Not directing their mind externally a mendicant understands My mind is not directed externally
And they understand Over a period of time its unconstricted freed and undirected
And they also understand I meditate observing an aspect of feelingskeen aware mindful I am happy
Not directing their mind externally a mendicant understands My mind is not directed externally

Out of compassion Ive done what a teacher should do who wants whats best for their disciples
Here are these roots of trees and here are these empty huts

In Ambapālīs Wood
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the little village of Beluva
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants please enter the rainy season residence with whatever friends or acquaintances you have around Vesālī
Ill commence the rainy season residence right here in the little village of Beluva
Yes sir those mendicants replied They did as the Buddha said
while the Buddha commenced the rainy season residence right there in the little village of Beluva
After the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence he fell severely ill struck by dreadful pains close to death
But he endured unperturbed with mindfulness and situational awareness
Then it occurred to the Buddha
It would not be appropriate for me to become fully extinguished before informing my attendants and taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha
Why dont I forcefully suppress this illness stabilize the life force and live on
So that is what he did
Then the Buddhas illness died down
Soon after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness he left his dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread out
Then Venerable nanda went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir its fantastic that the Buddha is comfortable
that hes well
and that hes alright
Because when the Buddha was sick my body felt like it was drugged I was disorientated and the teachings didnt spring to mind
Still at least I was consoled by the thought that
the Buddha wont become fully extinguished without making some statement regarding the Saṅgha of mendicants
But what could the mendicant Saṅgha expect from me now nanda
Ive taught the Dhamma without making any distinction between secret and public teachings
The Realized One doesnt have the closed fist of a teacher when it comes to the teachings
If theres anyone who thinks
Ill take charge of the Saṅgha of mendicants or the Saṅgha of mendicants is meant for me let them make a statement regarding the Saṅgha
But the Realized One doesnt think like this
so why should he make some statement regarding the Saṅgha
Now I am old elderly and senior Im advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life
Im currently eighty years old
Just as a decrepit cart keeps going by relying on straps
in the same way the Realized Ones body keeps going by relying on straps or so youd think
Sometimes the Realized One not focusing on any signs and with the cessation of certain feelings enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart Only then does the Realized Ones body become more comfortable
So nanda be your own island your own refuge with no other refuge Let the teaching be your island and your refuge with no other refuge
And how does a mendicant do this
Its when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings 
principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world

The Path
At Sāvatthī
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants at one time when I was first awakened I was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherds banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River
As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence They are in order to purify sentient beings to get past sorrow and crying to make an end of pain and sadness to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishment
What four
A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
Or theyd meditate observing an aspect of feelings 
or principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence They are in order to purify sentient beings to get past sorrow and crying to make an end of pain and sadness to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishment
And then Brahmā Sahampati knowing what I was thinking as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of me
He arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said
Thats so true Blessed One Thats so true Holy One
Sir the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence They are in order to purify sentient beings to get past sorrow and crying to make an end of pain and sadness to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishment
What four
A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world

The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence They are in order to purify sentient beings to get past sorrow and crying to make an end of pain and sadness to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishment
Thats what Brahmā Sahampati said
Then he went on to say
The compassionate one who sees the utter ending of rebirth
understands the path to convergence
By this path people crossed over before
will cross over and are crossing over

At Nālandā
At Ukkacelā
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjīs near Ukkacelā on the bank of the Ganges river together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants It was not long after Sāriputta and Moggallāna had become fully extinguished
Now at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks
Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks who were silent He addressed them
Mendicants this assembly seems empty to me now that Sāriputta and Moggallāna have become fully extinguished
When Sāriputta and Moggallāna were alive my assembly was never empty I had no concern for any region where they stayed
The Buddhas of the past or the future have pairs of chief disciples who are no better than
Sāriputta and Moggallāna were to me
Its an incredible and amazing quality of such disciples
that they fulfill the Teachers instructions and follow his advice And theyre liked and approved respected and admired by the four assemblies
And its an incredible and amazing quality of the Realized One
that when such a pair of disciples becomes fully extinguished he does not sorrow or lament
How could it possibly be so that what is born created conditioned and liable to fall apart should not fall apart
That is not possible
Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood and the largest branches fell off
In the same way in the great Saṅgha that stands with heartwood Sāriputta and Moggallāna have become fully extinguished
How could it possibly be so that what is born created conditioned and liable to fall apart should not fall apart
That is not possible
So mendicants be your own island your own refuge with no other refuge Let the teaching be your island and your refuge with no other refuge

Mendicants suppose that on hearing The finest lady in the land The finest lady in the land a large crowd would gather
And the finest lady in the land would dance and sing in a most thrilling way
On hearing The finest lady in the land is dancing and singing The finest lady in the land is dancing and singing an even larger crowd would gather
Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesnt want to die who wants to be happy and recoils from pain
Theyd say to him
Mister this is a bowl full to the brim with oil You must carry it in between this large crowd and the finest lady in the land
And a man with a drawn sword will follow right behind you
Wherever you spill even a drop hell chop off your head right there
What do you think mendicants
Would that person lose focus on that bowl and negligently get distracted outside
No sir
Ive made up this simile to make a point
And this is what it means
A bowl of oil filled to the brim is a term for mindfulness of the body
So you should train like this

I have such confidence in the Buddha that

what exactly are you doing making such a grand and dramatic statement roaring such a definitive categorical lions roar
Sir though I dont comprehend the minds of Buddhas past future and present
still I understand this by inference from the teaching
Suppose there was a kings frontier citadel with fortified embankments ramparts and arches and a single gate
And it has a gatekeeper who is astute competent and intelligent He keeps strangers out and lets known people in
As he walks around the patrol path he doesnt see a hole or cleft in the wall not even one big enough for a cat to slip out
He thinks
Whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel all of them do so via this gate
In the same way I understand this by inference from the teaching
All the perfected ones fully awakened Buddhaswhether past future or presentgive up the five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation They correctly develop the seven awakening factors And they wake up to the supreme perfect awakening

At Nālandā
With Brahmā
At one time when he was first awakened the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherds banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence They are in order to purify sentient beings to get past sorrow and crying to make an end of pain and sadness to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishment
What four
A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
Or theyd meditate observing an aspect of feelings 
or principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence They are in order to purify sentient beings to get past sorrow and crying to make an end of pain and sadness to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishment
Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha
He arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said
Thats so true Blessed One Thats so true Holy One
Sir the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence They are in order to purify sentient beings to get past sorrow and crying to make an end of pain and sadness to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishment

Once upon a time mendicants a hawk suddenly swooped down and grabbed a quail
And as the quail was being carried off he wailed
Im so unlucky so unfortunate to have roamed out of my territory into the domain of others
If today Id roamed within my own territory the domain of my fathers this hawk wouldnt have been able to beat me by fighting
So quail what is your own territory the domain of your fathers
Its a ploughed field covered with clods of earth
Confident in her own strength the hawk was not daunted or intimidated She released the quail saying
Go now quail But even there you wont escape me
Then the quail went to a ploughed field covered with clods of earth He climbed up a big clod and standing there he said to the hawk
Come get me hawk Come get me hawk
Confident in her own strength the hawk was not daunted or intimidated She folded her wings and suddenly swooped down on the quail
When the quail knew that the hawk was nearly there he slipped under that clod
But the hawk crashed chestfirst right there
Thats what happens when you roam out of your territory into the domain of others

A Monkey
Mendicants in the Himalayas there are regions that are rugged and impassable In some such regions neither monkeys nor humans can go
while in others monkeys can go but not humans
There are also level pleasant places where both monkeys and humans can go
There hunters lay snares of tar on the monkey trails to catch the monkeys
The monkeys who are not foolhardy and reckless see the tar and avoid it from afar
But a foolish and reckless monkey goes up to the tar and grabs it with a hand
He gets stuck there
Thinking to free his hand he grabs it with his other hand
He gets stuck there
Thinking to free both hands he grabs it with a foot
He gets stuck there
Thinking to free both hands and foot he grabs it with his other foot
He gets stuck there
Thinking to free both hands and feet he grabs it with his snout
He gets stuck there
And so the monkey trapped at five points just lies there screeching Hed meet with tragedy and disaster and the hunter can do what he wants with him
The hunter spears him pries him off that tarred block of wood and goes wherever he wants

Regarding the Brahmin Jāṇussoṇi
At Sāvatthī
Then Venerable nanda robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for alms
He saw the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi driving out of Sāvatthī in a splendid allwhite chariot drawn by mares
The yoked horses were pure white as were the ornaments chariot upholstery reins goad and canopy And his turban robes sandals were white as was the chowry fanning him
When people saw it they exclaimed
Wow Thats a Brahmā vehicle
Its a vehicle fit for Brahmā
Then nanda wandered for alms in Sāvatthī
After the meal on his return from almsround he went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened adding
Sir can you point out a Brahmā vehicle in this teaching and training
I can nanda said the Buddha

Conscience is its pole mind its strap
and mindfulness its careful driver
The chariots equipped with ethics
its axle is absorption and energy its wheel
Equanimity and immersion are the carriageshaft

Yes sir replied those mendicants And noone approached him except for the one who brought the almsfood
Then after three months had passed the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants
Mendicants Ive been practicing part of the meditation I practiced when I was first awakened
I understand that
theres feeling conditioned by wrong view
and by the stilling of wrong view
by right view
and by the stilling of right view 
Theres feeling conditioned by wrong immersion
and by the stilling of wrong immersion by right immersion
and by the stilling of right immersion
Theres feeling conditioned by desire
and by the stilling of desire
by thought
and by the stilling of thought
by perception
and by the stilling of perception
As long as desire thought and perception are not stilled there is feeling conditioned by that
When desire thought and perception are stilled there is feeling conditioned by that
There is effort to attain the unattained When that state has been attained there is also feeling conditioned by that
