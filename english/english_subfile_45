Because the brahmanas are weak they enjoy the class of the ksatriyas That is why the brahmanas state that taking ones own things is blameless and it is because at the moment of this taking the conceptual identification of thing of someone else is made that this is called taking what is not given either regarding that which is enjoyed by others and that which one enjoys oneself or because of property When it is no greed as preparation then it is produced from hatred that which is experienced in relation to an eneActions  my or in relation to a friend who has chosen the side of the enemy Improper sensitivity out of delusion is as has been said concerning bridge boat wilderness field flower fruit road and woman all beings should be able to enjoy them Just as the brahmanas say that brahmanas should have four wives that the ksatriyas should have three that the vaigyas should have two and that the sadras should have only one It should be known that when verbal action is produced from greed it is arisen from greed it should be known that when it is produced from hatred it is arisen from hatred it should be known that when it is produced from delusion it is arisen from delusion When covetousness is produced successively to covetousness it exactly is arisen from covetousness when produced from hatred it is arisen from hatred when produced from noncognisance it is arisen from noncognisance The same applies to malice and to false view Question Which path of action is fixed as either manifesting or unmanifesting or neither Answer Fundamental action is unmanifesting or it is further said to be manifesting The preparation and the consecutive are different They are equally produced from greed and from absence of greed Fundamental action is unmanifesting or it is further said to be manifesting The seven paths of action with the specific nature of matter are fixed as unmanifesting or  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya further as manifesting Improper sensitivity is fixed as manifesting because it is accomplished from oneself and not from someone else The other paths of action are unfixed When done by oneself then they are manifesting letting someone else do them they are absolutely unmanifesting Question Is there somehow that which is not bodily manifesting that acquires taking life Answer that which is verbal manifesting Is there somehow that which is not verbal manifesting that acquires lying Answer that which is bodily manifesting Is there somehow that which is neither bodily nor verbal manifesting that acquires the two kinds of blameworthiness production of bad awarenesses by a wise recluse the fact of the posadha Good paths of action with the nature of matter in the realm of sexual passion are fixed as manifesting and as unmanifesting The one of trance and pure restraint are only unmanifesting and not manifesting because they are depending on awarenesses The preparation is manifesting When serene awarenesses and extreme fetters are manifesting there is that which is unmanifesting when disfavorable awarenesses and nonextreme fetters are manifesting there only is that which is manifesting and not that which is unmanifesting Answer The preparation of killing is the slaughterer of sheep whether grasping or buying or pulling  or one beat or two beats up to death this is all called preparation The moment of abandoning life is manifesting during one ksana and the fundamental path of action is unmanifesting Later that which is both bad bodily manifesting and unmanifesting regarding this fact is the consecutive of taking life The same applies to frivolity This is called the consecutive Covetousness malice and false view are without preparation when present they are produced by the fundamental ones Some say that the bodily and the verbal paths of action have all ten actions as preparation and as consecutive How is this Just as when wanting to kill these beings killing these beings is taken as cause and later one either kills them or when taking life one asks for help to kill them either the fact of killing someone else because of property when lacking wealth or when having improper sensitivity in relation to the one who is loved by someone else having the master killed or lying harsh words and double talk in relation to friends frivolity to separate oneself from ones friend or being greedy for ones property or hating someone or when producing false view developing the factor killing Everything has to be known in this way They are equally produced from greed and from absence of greed The bad paths of action have greed hatred and delusion as preparation and also as consecutive the good paths of action are produced from absence of greed absence of hatred and understanding Abandoning the preparation of the bad paths of action exactly is the preparation of the good paths of action abandoning the fundamental ones exactly concerns the fundamental ones abandoning the consecutive exactly concerns the consecutive Question How is this entering the place of moral precept completely reverencing the samgha asking for a teacher accepting dress and bowl the first of the fourfold proposal to the order up to the second one of a ramanera are all the preparation the fundamental path of action is that which is manifesting and unmanifesting during the one ksana of the third proposal subsequently the fourfold confidence In this way up to that which is bodily and verbal manifesting and unmanifesting regarding this fact is called the consecutive Question Which residence has how many paths of action Answer Hell is with five paths of action Uttarakuru is with the last four Actions  The other directions all have ten Hell is with five paths of action Beings of hell have five bad paths of action harsh words frivolity covetousness malice and false view Because they do not kill each other there is no killing as path of action because there is no enjoying of property there is no taking what is not given because there is no taking of women there is no improper sensitivity Speaking while having another conceptual identification is therefore called lying because they are without difference with conceptual identification there is no lying because they permanently are free from it there is no double talk Because they are suppressed by frustration there are harsh words because they have inopportunious speech there is frivolity Covetousness and false view are accomplished but not committed malice has both Uttarakuru is with the last four There are the last four bad paths of action Because the part of duration of life is fixed there is no c taking life because there is no enjoyment of property there is no taking what is not given because there is no taking of women there is no improper sensitivity At the moment of desire to commit sensual pleasure one leads this woman and walks until under a tree the tree moves with its branches and covers her later there is committing sensual pleasure After having gone one returns When the tree does not cover her there is modesty and one parts Because of not deceiving others there is no lying because of permanently being in harmony there  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya is no double talk because of being smooth coarse words Because there is singing there is frivolity Although the mental paths of action are accomplished they are not committed The other directions all have ten Exception made for Uttarakuru the other three directions have the ten paths of action They either are that which is included in nonrestraint or that which is included in what is free from nonrestraint And the other woeful courses and the gods Animal birth ghosts  and the gods of the realm of sexual passion have the ten paths of action and are free from nonrestraint Although gods do not harm gods they harm other courses Moreover it is said that when the hands and the feet are cut off with gods they grow again but when their heads are cut off or when they are cut into two they die The proceeding of such as stealing from each other and up to the ten paths of action all exist The gods of the one of form and of the one of formlessness do not have bad paths of action  there are no Question In which residence are how many good paths of action Answer Hell and Uttarakuru have three good paths of action They are equally present in the one of formlessness These nobles accomplish the ten Hell and Uttarakuru have three good paths of acActions  tion Hell has covetousness absence of malice and right view The same is true for Uttarakuru They are equally present in the one of formlessness In the realm of formlessness exactly these three proceed when present These nobles accomplish the ten Noble persons of the realm of formlessness accomplish the pure ten good paths of action In this way there further is difference restraint of the realm of form Animal birth and ghosts are different In this way the rest is also different In this way there further is difference restraint of the realm of form All ten good paths of action that are included in restraint of trance of the realm of form are both accomplished and present When the noble persons make them arise these have the pure paths of action Animal birth and ghosts are different Also animal birth and ghosts have the ten good paths of action they are free from restraint and also free from nonrestraint In this way the rest is also different Jambudvipa Piirvavideha Godaniya and the gods of the realm of sexual passion are said to be the rest These have the ten good paths of action These are what is included in restraint or what is free from restraint Gods of the realm of sexual passion only have the one of trance and pure restraint Questicn How many bad paths of action proceed simultaneously together with thinking Answer  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  When producing bad paths of action one proceeds together with thinking It should be known that two three up to eight increase successively Those three bad paths of action that have the specific nature of the body one by one proceed together with thinking taking life taking what is not given and improper sensitivity Two that proceed together are killing other beings and taking what is not given Three that proceed together are committing improper sensitivity oneself after having neglected two contaminants because this conduct is accomplished by oneself and not by others When these kinds are combined they are all accomplished together One that proceeds together of the verbal paths of action is frivolity Two that proceed together are that which is included in lying and inopportuniously uttered frivolity that which is included in desire for uttering double talk and inopportuniously uttered frivolity that which is included in uttering harsh words and inopportuniously uttered frivolity Three that proceed together are that which is included in desire for uttering double talk lying and inopportuniously uttered frivolity that which is included in harsh words lying and inopportuniously uttered frivolity that which is included in harsh words desire for uttering double talk and inopportuniously uttered frivolity Four that proceed together are that which is included in desire for double talk lying harsh words and inopportuniously uttered frivolity The mental paths of action one by one proceed together Actions  Because of different aspects  there are no two In this way five six seven and eight proceed together committing improper sensitivity oneself after having neglected six contaminants because of not depending on others When these forms are combined they are simultaneously accomplished together and they are present according to greed In this way eight bad paths of action proceed together with thinking Question How many good paths of action proceed simultaneously together with thinking Answer  Of the socalled good paths of action two three and four six seven nine and ten proceed simultaneously together with thinking When the group of good five forms of consciousness of the realm of sexual passion three forms of consciousness of the stage of the first trance and the knowledge of destruction and the knowledge of nonorigination that depend on the immaterial ones are present these two good paths of action proceed together with thinking noncovetousness and absence of malice of the realm of sexual passion is present not concentrated awarenesses of the realm of form and of the realm of formlessness and also pure right view that depends on the immaterial ones there are three things that proceed together with thinking With defiled and neutral awarenesses of the updsaka and of the Sramanera and taking restraint thereare four Exactly when abiding in these good five forms of con Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya sciousness there are six Exactly when abiding in good consciousness of the mind and in defiled and neutral awarenesses and wrong awarenesses of the bhiksu there are seven When abiding in the five good forms of consciousness of the bhiksu and when depending on trance there are awarenesses that are together with knowledge of destruction and with knowledge of nonorigination there are nine Exactly when abiding in good consciousness of the mind of the bhiksu and concentrated awarenesses of the realm of form and pure right view that is present depending on trance the ten good paths of action proceed together with thinking Question Which path of action has how many fruits Answer Their fruits are one by one threefold the socalled fruit of retribution the natural fruit and the dominant one These are called the fruits of the paths of action All paths of action one by one have three fruits the fruit of retribution the natural fruit and the dominant fruit When these paths of action are practised assiduously or much practised one is born in hell This is the fruit of retribution Being born with humans when coming from hell is receiving a similar fruit taking life is with a short duration of life taking what is not given is with losing property improper sensitivity is with the wife who is unchaste lying is with slandering with bad words double talk is with separating oneself from ones friends harsh words is with often Actions  hearing bad sounds frivolity is with improper speech covetousness is with increase of greed malice is with increase of hatred false view is with increase of delusion These are the natural fruits The dominant fruit of these paths of action is that because of being coarse and bad things are not magnificent lots of frost and hail is met with taint dirt stench and impurity the abode is inaccessible because of prickles and thorns the fruits have no leaves are few and subtle and are extremely bitter and sour having no blossoms Question Which fruit is similar Answer  Giving someone else frustration is with the Srustration of woeful courses When harming the duration of life life is made short When the outward things are not magnificent it is because their magnificence has been broken  Giving someone else frustration is with the frustration of woeful courses Taking life is making someone else experience frustration and achieves the frustration of woeful courses This is the similar one Question Which aggregates are killed Is it the aggregate matter Is it the five aggregates Answer Some say that it is the aggregate matter because matter can be broken and four aggregates are untouchable Some say that it is the five aggregates although four aggregates are untouchable they depend on the aggregate matter when proceeding and when the aggregate matter is  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya killed also these are killed just as when a bottle is broken the milk is lost Question Is it killing of that which is neutral or is it threefold Answer Some say that it concerns that which is neutral because that which is neutral experiences knife and stick The other two are untouchable Moreover it is said that it concerns all three forms as has been said previously Question Which aggregates are killed The ones of the past or the ones of the future or of the present The ones of the past have already disappeared the ones of the future cannot be acquired with the ones of the present it is so that this duration of a ksana does not abide Answer Some say that it concerns the ones of the future When abiding in the present time the future combination is broken Moreover it is said that it concerns the ones of the future and of the present because if knife and stick are experienced in the present the aggregates do not disappear successively When harming the duration of life life is made short Because the killer breaks this life a shorter duration of life is achieved When the outward things are not magnificent it is because their magnificence has been broken Because the killer breaks this magnificence all things that are acquired are not magnificent All paths of action should be known according to what is proper Although taking what is not given and improper sensitivity do not give frustration to someone else it is because they abandon the hope just as what is no double talk Actions  is also called double talk although no spite is given  this is also called harsh words The part of the paths of action has already been spoken of Their differentiation shall now be spoken of There is action to be felt in this life or it is to be felt as fruit successively when rearising The same is further true for a later fruit It should be known that each moment is fixed The three action are the one to be felt in this life the one to be felt when rearising and the one to be felt later Action to be felt in this life is when action is done in this life and is mature in exactly this life This is called to be felt in this life When mature in a second life it is called to be felt when rearisng When mature after a second life it is called to be felt later Some want that there are four actions the previous three and the one to be felt in an unfixed time The previous three do not proceed and the unfixed one proceeds Proceeding is because of fully taking the moral precepts and preserving them The Darstantikas say that all actions proceed up to the one without intervals They say that if the one without intervals would not proceed there also would be no transgressing of the summit of existence Because there is transgressing of the summit of existence one knows that also proximate action proceeds Action to be felt in this  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya life does not have to be mature with the present retribution Spoken of in this way eight actions should be spoken of retribution in the present either is fixed or unfixed the same applies up to action to be felt in an unfixed time That is why they say that the moment is fixed but the maturity is unfixed Four sentences have to be made Sometimes the moment is fixed but the maturity is unfixed Sometimes the maturity is fixed but the moment is unfixed Sometimes both the moment is fixed and the maturity is fixed Sometimes neither the moment is fixed nor the maturity is fixed Question How many of these four actions are of the kind of the homogeneityforce Answer exception made for the one to be felt in this life The realm of sexual passion has four kinds of the forms of actions the same applies to the realm of form and to the one of formlessness The course hell is with the four kinds of the forms of bad action the good one is threefold exception made for the action to be felt in this life The other courses have all four kinds Since the worldling who is born in the realm of sexual passion has not ended craving for sensual pleasure yet there are the four kinds in the realm of sexual passion When craving for sensual pleasure has been ended craving of the brahmaheaven has not ended yet Also the brahmaheaven is with three kinds exception made for the one to be felt in this life When one falls back of the manifold natures the brahmaheaven is as has been said previously The realm of sexual passion is with the four kinds of the forms of good action In this way the worldling and the noble person born are in all stages according to their meanings also to be explained in this way Such as having to be felt in this life have already been spoken of The pleasant feeling shall now be spoken of  It is said that good action in the realm of sexual passion and in three stages of the realm of form is called with pleasant feeling Also for this one it is fixed or unfixed It is said that good action in the realm of sexual passion and in three stages of the realm of form is called with pleasant feeling Good action of the realm of sexual passion acquires a pleasant feeling and retribution with provi  sions Action of the realm of form up to the third trance all ac quires a pleasant retribution Question Which kind of retribution does action of the intermediate trance acquire Answer Some say that it is the pleasant retribu Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya tion of the first trance This is a wrong statement Because the Abhidharma says Is there action that acquires mental experience and no bodily one Answer good action without initial thought Moreover it is said that the action of the intermediate trance does not acquire a retribution there only is matter and formations dissociated from awarenesses Question Is this moment also fixed Answer Also for this one it is fixed or unfixed Whether fixed or unfixed in these four stages the good one all has a pleasant retribution What acquires the neitherpleasantnorunpleasant one is said to be the good one of the higher ones When an unpleasant retribution is felt it is said to be bad action What acquires the neitherpleasantnorunpleasant one is said to be the good one of the higher ones Good action of the stage of the fourth trance and good action of the stages of the immaterial ones is said to be with a neitherpleasantnorunpleasant retribution because this acquires a neitherpleasantnorunpleasant feeling and provisions Question Why is it that in lower stages there is no neitherpleasantnorunpleasant retribution Answer Some say that it is because the lower stages are coarse and this feeling is subtle because the lower stages are not appeased and this feeling is appeased When doing good action in lower stages all are without seeking for a neitherpleasantnorunpleasant feeling beActions  cause of being with a pleasant feeling Although not seeking for an unpleasant retribution one does misconduct because one seeks for the pleasant one That is why one feels an unpleasant retribution although one does not seek for it When an unpleasant retribution is felt it is said to be bad action Bad action is said to be with an unpleasant retribution because its fruit is unpleasant feeling It is not only action that feels retribution four aggregates and the five aggregates also feel retribution but because action is superior feeling of retribution of action is spoken of It should be known that also for this it is fixed or unfixed Question Of how many forms is feeling Answer Socalled feeling of the specific nature feeling of what is associated and of the retribution of being present and of the supporting object This is said to be the fivefold feeling The fivefold feeling is the feeling of the specific nature the feeling of what is associated the feeling of the retribution the feeling of being present and the feeling of the supporting object The feeling of the specific nature is feeling The feeling of what is associated is feeling associated factors The feeling of the retribution is action with such feelings as the pleasant one The feeling of being present is feeling what is present As has been said in the Mahdnidanasitra At the moment  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the pleasant feeling is present two feelings have disappeared The feeling of the supporting object is feeling matter when wakefulness of contact of the eye arises It should be known that of these five kinds of feeling only feeling of the retribution has been spoken of Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking about such four actions as the one with black retribution How are these established Answer In the one of form there is good action it is white and has a white retribution Blackwhite abides in the one of sexual passion Both black is said to be unclean In the one of form there is good action it is white and has a white retribution Good action of the realm of form absolutely is with absence of hatred and is free from blackness Question Is the action of the realm of formlessness since it is superior not as the realm of form Why then is it not spoken of Answer Because of two retributions The realm of form experiences the intermediate existence and the existence at rearising the realm of formlessness only has the existence at rearising In this way there is the feeling of that which is material and of that which is immaterial as retribution of that which is visible and of that which is invisible of that which is resisting and of that which is unActions  resisting Moreover it is spoken of because this one has feeling of the retribution of the three actions the five aggregates and the ten good paths of action Blackwhite abides in the one of sexual passion Because good action of the realm of sexual passion is mingled with bad action it is therefore said to be blackwhite Moreover in one body two kinds of action and also two kinds of retribution can be acquired That is why it is spoken of in this way That which is not black exactly is white because that which is black has different characteristic marks Both black is said to be unclean Bad action is said to be black This has a black retribution Its cause is defiled Because of being defiled it is said to be black and because that which is inferior is very bad it is said to be with a black retribution It only is inferior black not defiled black because it is undefiled  When there is thinking that can break them these actions are without rest This is said to be the proximate path the fourth action When a path can make these three actions disappear the thinking that is associated with this path is the fourth action Because this action is undefiled it is not black because it is not loved it is not white because it does not fall in the realms it is without retribution Question Which action is to be abandoned by how many forms of thinking Answer  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  It is said that there are twelve forms of thinking that abandon regarding action with black retribution Four forms of thinking can abandon the white one One form of thinking frees from two Tt is said that there are twelve forms of thinking that abandon regarding action with black retribution Black action is to be abandoned by twelve forms of thinking the forms of thinking associated with the four forms of patience of the path of vision and the forms of thinking associated with the eight proximate paths free from attachment of the realm of sexual passion Four forms of thinking can abandon the white one Four forms of thinking abandon the white action the forms of thinking associated with the ninth proximate path of the first trance with nonattachment and so up to of the fourth trance with nonattachment because goodimpure factors are abandoned through the very last proximate path One form of thinking frees from two Thinking associated with the ninth proximate path of the realm of sexual passion with nonattachment makes black action and blackwhite action disappear Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of crookedness filthiness and fault How are these Answer Filthiness arises from hatred What arises from attachment is fault This is what the Worldhonoured One has said Actions  Crookedness is produced from craftiness Craftiness is said to be crookedness Because of not being upright craftiness is called crookedness Because craftiness is that which obstructs it is hard to get free from transmigration and it is hard to enter nirvana it is to be compared with a crooked tree Filthiness arises from hatred Because of the filthiness of ones own person and of someone elses person there are two forms of filthiness Hatred is called filthiness Action that is produced from the factor with the characteristic marks of filthiness is called filthiness  because of being its fruit What arises from attachment is fault This is what the Worldhonoured One has said Because attachment is with the nature of colouring it is called fault When action is produced from attachment it is called fault because of being its fruit and the fruit is said to be similar to the cause  Question Of how many forms is the arouser Answer  There is a twofold arouser the cause ard that ksana As for the one that proceeds Jirst the same is true for the one that proceeds subsequently when the mind abides in doing this action Question Which of these two arousers is the one that proceeds and which is the one that proceeds subsequenty Answer The one that proceeds is the first the arouser in that ksana is said to be the one that proceeds subsequently Question Which of the group of the six forms of consciousness are the ones that proceed and which are the ones that proceed subsequently Answer  When consciousness is to be abandoned through the spiritual path it abides in what is neutral and there are two forms Five kinds of awarenesses are said to be one The rest is then said to be impure When consciousness is to be abandoned through the spiritual path it abides in what is neutral and there are two forms Consciousness of the mind to be abandoned through the spiritual path is both that which proceeds and that which proceeds subsequently because these both can produce action Also this is good bad and neutral that which proceeds is good that which proceeds subsequently exactly is good The same is true for what is bad and for what is neutral Actions  Neutral is what is relating to deportment and craftsmanship It is not right that when good ard defiled awarenesses are present they part because of yuk production just as the turning of a wheel of fire The same applies to the awarenesses of craftsmanship  That awarenesses arisen by retribution do not produce bodily and verbal action has already been said previously Five kinds of awarenesses are said to be one The group of five kinds of consciousness is said to be that which proceeds subsequently because of feeling what one has done oneself because there is no indecision The rest is then said to be impure Awarenesses to be abandoned through the path of vision are said to be the rest These are that which proceeds because they can be the causal arouser They are not that which proceeds subsequently there is no production of bodily and verbal action with awarenesses to be abandoned through the path of vision because of being subtle and because of being oriented inwardly When awarenesses to be abandoned through the path of vision further were to produce bodily and verbal action this action would have to be abandoned through the path of vision or to be abandoned through the spiritual path or to be abandoned through both paths When stating that it is to be abandoned through the path of vision there is no matter to be abandoned through the path of vision because understanding and ignorance are opposed to one another When stating that it is to be abandoned through the spiritual path factors should be abandoned through the spiritual path but awarenesses to be abandoned through the path of vision are  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the arouser and this then is not proper When stating that it is to be abandoned through both then there is that which is to be differentiated This is also not right just as the scriptural texts say that bodily and verbal action of the person with false view is said to be view Also this is said to be the causal arouser Question What is integrity Answer  All active good conduct is integrity That which is bodily and verbal of the adept is mauneya Socalled mental mauneya exactly are the awarenesses of the adept All active good conduct is integrity All active good conduct there is is all said to be integrity When it concems bodily active good conduct this is said to be bodily integrity it is to be compared in this way Question Impure factors are with impurity How are they said to be integrity Answer Because they are contrary to defilement and induce the highest integrity Question What is mauneya Answer That which is bodily and verbal of the adept Bodily and verbal active good conduct of the adept is said to be mauneya The awarenesses of the adept are said to be mental mauneya because of the characteristic marks of a muni Actions  Question Why is it that only the aggregate matter and the aggregate consciousness are said to be mauneya Answer Because of being coarse and subtle mind is the highest maunya it is to be known through comparison with bodily and verbal action Because of the might of being appeased because of not being destroyed by the heat of defilement and because mind and speech are unmingled only the arhat is therefore said to be mauneya Question What is the difference between active good conduct integrity and mauneya Answer Because of what is to be done active good conduct is spoken of because of being clean integrity is spoken of because of the muni mauneya is spoken of Furthermore because of the desired fruit active good conduct is spoken of because of being free from defilement integrityis spoken of because of being free from delusion mauneya is spoken of Action has already been spoken of The fruit of action shall now be spoken of  What is similar is said to be the natural fruit The retribution is dissimilar The clean and unclean fruit are said to be the retribution The natural fruit is that which is good that makes that which is good arise Compared in this way it should be known the homogeneous cause is spoken of The fruit of retribution is the clean and unclean fruit as  Samyuktabhidharmahydaya has been said previously When the cause of retribution is with a similar fruit it is the natural fruit What is dissimilar is a good or a bad cause with a neutral fruit The socalled fruit of disjunction is said to be true vision with nonattachment What is acquired by human effort is said to be the fruit of human effort The socalled fruit of disjunction is said to be true vision with nonattachment The fruit of disjunction is annihilation What is acquired by human effort is said to be the fruit of human effort When the fruit is incited and annihilated by human effort it is said to be fruit of human effort  Of factors with manifold characteristic marks their fruits only have one characteristic mark this is said to be dominant fruit Exception made for the factors that were produced previously When factors with manifold characteristic marks similar or dissimilar only are with one fruit it is the dominant fruit the efficient cause Exception made for the factors that were produced previously Exception made for what has arisen previously this is no fruit for what has arisen later Question What is the difference between the dominant fruit and the fruit of human effort Actions  Answer The thing that is made is settled to be the fruit of human effort what enjoys is the dominant fruit The one who plants a tree has two fruits the one who enjoys has the dominant fruit The fruits have already been spoken of in general Whether a certain fruit is what a certain action has shall now be spoken of ad  Of the impure action for abandoning fetters being with fruit is five fruits The pure path for abandoning fetters has four fruits Of the impure action for abandoning fetters being with fruit is five fruits This action of the worldly path for abandoning fetters has five fruits what is later similar and dominant is the natural fruit the retribution of this action is the fruit of retribution the abandonment of these fetters is the fruit of disjunction what is incited and annihilated is the fruit of human effort exception made for oneself all other factors are the dominant fruit The pure path for abandoning fetters has four fruits This action of the pure path for abandoning fetters has four fruits exception made for the fruit of retribution the other fruits are as has been said previously  Bad action is with four fruits This also goes for the other goodimpure one The other pure one has three The same is true for neutral action Bad action is with four fruits This also goes for the other goodimpure one Bad action is with four fruits Ex Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya ception made for the path for abandoning fetters the other goodirapure action is the path of preparation the path of liberation the superior path and such wisdom as the one through learning This action also has four fruits exception made for the fruit of disjunction The same is true for neutral action Exception made for the pure one for abandoning fetters the other pure action and the neutral action have three fruits exception made for the fruit of retribution and for the fruit of disjunction  Fourtwo and three fruits Three four and further also two Three two and three are clean These are said to be the fruits of action In relation to good action good factors are taken to be four fruits exception made for the fruit of retribution bad ones are taken to be two fruits the fruit of human effort and the dominant fruit neutral ones are taken to be three fruits exception made for the natural fruit and for the fruit of disjunction In relation to bad action bad factors are taken to be three fruits exception made for the fruit of retribution and for the fruit of disjunction neutral factors are taken to be four fruits exception made for the fruit of disjunction in relation to the homogeneous cause and the pervasive cause neutral factors as belief in a self and extreme view of the realm of sexual passion are the natural fruit good ones are taken to be two fruits the fruit of human effort and the dominant fruit the natural fruit the fruit of human effort and Actions  the dominant fruit good ones are taken to be two fruits the fruit of human effort and the dominant fruit bad ones are taken to be three fruits exception made for the fruit of retribution and for the fruit of disjunction  The past one is with four in relation to all The same is true for the intermediate one in relation to the future ones The intermediate ones are said to be two regarding the intermediate one The future ones are three in relation to the future one The past one is with four in relation to all In relation to past action all factors of the three periods of time are taken to be four fruits exception made for the fruit of disjunction because of not falling in the periods of time The same is true for the intermediate one in relation to the future ones In relation to present action future factors are taken to be four fruits as has been said previously In relation to present action present factors are taken to be two fruits the fruit of human effort and the dominant fruit The future ones are three in relation to the future one In relation to future action future factors are taken to be three fruits the fruit of retribution the fruit of human effort and the dominant fruit  The ones of the specific stage are four in relation to the one of the specific stage or two in relation to the one of another stage With the stage of right conceptualising there also is the fruit of disjunction  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The ones of the specific stage are four in relation to the one of the specific stage In relation to the action of the specific stage factors of the specific stage are taken to be four fruits exception made for the fruit of disjunction Up to those of neitheridentificationnornonidentification the same applies as to those bound to the realm of sexual passion in relation to the one bound to the realm of sexual passion Or two in relation to the one of another stage In relation to the action of another stage factors of another stage are taken to be two fruits the fruit of human effort and the dominant fruit With pure action the pure ones of another stage are taken to be the natural fruit With the stage of right conceptualising  there also is the fruit of disjunction In the stage of trance  there sometimes is the fruit of disjunction that which is included in the proximate paths   All are three in relation to all three two and one further five two and two are spoken of successively actions such as the one of the seeker the natural fruit the fruit of human effort and the dominant fruit the same applies to having no more learning to do that is taken to be three fruits Neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do js taken to be three fruits the fruit of disjunction the fruit of human effort and the dominant fruit the natural fruit the fruit of human effort and the dominant fruit neither stil having learning to do nor having no more learning to do is taken to be two fruits the fruit of human effort and the dominant fruit still having learning to do is taken to be one fruit the dominant fruit In relation to the action of neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do is taken to be the five fruits still having learning to do is taken to be two fruits the fruit of human effort and the dominant fruit the same applies to having no more learning to do that is taken to be two fruits  Three four and one are spoken of Four three and two Four further one and also two These are said to be such actions as the one of vision In relation to action to be abandoned through the path of vision factors to be abandoned through the path of vision are taken to be three fruits the natural fruit the fruit of human effort and the dominant fruit factors to be abandoned through the spiritual path are taken to be four fruits exception made for the fruit of disjunction factors not to be abandoned are taken to be one fruit the dominant fruit In relation to action to be abandoned through the spiritual path factors to be abandoned through the spiritual path are taken to be four fruits exception made for the fruit of disjunction factors not to be abandoned are taken to be three fruits the fruit of disjunction the fruit of human effort and the dominant fruit factors to be abandoned through vision are taken to be two fruits the fruit of human effort  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya and the dominant fruit In relation to action not to be abandoned factors not to be abandoned are taken to be four fruits exception made for the fruit of retribution factors to be abandoned through vision are taken to be one fruit the dominant fruit factors to be abandoned through the spiritual path are taken to be two fruits the fruit of human effort and the dominant fruit Action that is with fruit has already been spoken of That bodily action and verbal action are formed by the four elements shall now be spoken of When there are the elements in the specific stage it is that on which bodily and verbal action depend The pure one is achieved according to power and exactly is their fruit When there are the elements in the specific stage it is that on which bodily and verbal action depend Bodily and verbal action of the realm of sexual passion exactly is formed by the four elements of the realm of sexual passion Bodily and verbal action of the stage of the first trance of the realm of form exactly is formed by the four elements of the first trance The same applies up to the fourth trance because of falling in the realms and because of being combined with defilement The pure one is achieved according to power and exactly is their fruit Pure bodily and verbal action is achieved depending on the power of the one on which it depends and exactly is formed by the four elements of this stage When arising in the realm of sexual passion the bodily and the verbal action of pure meditative attainment Actions  of the first trance up to of the fourth trance are exactly formed by the four elements of the realm of sexual passion The same applies to arising in all stages because of not falling in the realms and because of not being combined with defilement When the fruits of srotadpannaship of sakrdagaminship and of andgaminship and going to them the classes of knowledge of the law and of subsequent knowledge of Buddha of the pratyekabuddha and of the sravaka who develops the paramitas are present depending on the realm of sexual passion as group all these actions are formed by the four elements of the realm of sexual passion When present depending on the realm of form as group all these actions are formed by the four elements of the realm of form When the seeker is born in the realm of formlessness future moral precept is accomplished depending on five stages when first the pure path was produced in this stage it exactly depends on the past of this stage When the fruit of arhatship is acquired restraint of the seeker is abandoned and moral precept of the adept that depends on the future five stages is acquired Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of the three obstructions How are these Answer Proximate and irredeemable actions widely arisen defilement and bad retribution experienced in woeful courses should be known as obstructions The three obstructions are the obstruction action the ob Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya struction defilement and the obstruction retribution Because they obstruct the noble path and the preparation of the noble path they are said to be obstruction Although exception made for these three obstructions other factors are obstruction these three obstructions are easy to be seen and easy to be known because of five reasons the socalled residence course birth fruit and person This obstruction action is the five proximate actions the socalled parricide matricide injuring the arhat introduction of disunity in the councils of the samgha and striking a Buddha with malicious intent and with such force as to draw blood The retribution of these actions is having to be born in hell proximately the meaning of ungratefulness and of breaking the field of merit This parricide and matricide are the proximity of ungratefulness the rest are the proximity of breaking the field of merit The greatest blameworthiness is the socalled introduction of disunity in the councils of the samgha next striking a Buddha with malicious intent and with such force as to draw blood next injuring thearhat next matricide and next parricide This meaning shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Miscellany ou The obstruction defilement is energetic and zealous defilement About defilement of beings that is energetic and not zealous four sentences have to be made Energetic but not zealous minor defilement that proceeds repeatedly Zealous but not energetic excessive defilement that does Actions  not proceed repeatedly Both energetic and zealous excessive defilement that proceeds repeatedly Neither energetic nor zealous minor defilement that does not proceed repeatedly This minor defilement that is not zealous is said to be the obstruction defilement because when depending on minor fetters there are middle ones depending on middle ones there are excessive ones When zealous defilement is not energetic it is no obstruction because of not proceeding repeatedly When both it is everything that is evil When neither everything is superior Know that the same applies to the roots of merit Because of forming defilement obstruction is established it is not accomplished because all beings equally accomplish defilement according to what is proper It should be known that this obstruction defilement is with the eunuch and with such as Vaspa and Piranakasyapa Moreover it is said to be Nanda Angulimala and Uruvilvakasyapa Such as Sariputra The obstruction retribution is woeful courses as residence Uttarakuru and the gods who do not conceptually identify as residence Question Which of these obstructions is worst Answer The socalled obstruction defilement is said to be worst  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Proximate actions are the middle one The obstruction retribution is minor Among the three obstructions the obstruction defilement is worst next the obstruction action and next the obstruction retribution because the obstruction defilement can proceed in relation to the obstruction action and the obstruction action proceeds in relation to the obstruction retribution Moreover it is said that the obstruction retribution is worst because everything can proceed at the moment of the cause and cannot proceed at the moment of the fruit This is not right With this there either is accomplishment of the obstruction defilement or of the obstruction action or of the obstruction retribution or of the obstruction defilement and of the obstruction action or of the obstruction defilement and of the obstruction retribution This obstruction action is with three directions the obstruction defilement and the obstruction retribution are with the five courses Question As has been said the blameworthiness of proximate action is the greatest with the introduction of disunity in the councils of the samgha Which nature does the introduction of disunity in the councils of the samgha have Answer Actions   That which is not harmonious by nature should be known as schism of the samgha It is nonobscuredneutral and a dissociated formation Schism of the samgha is with the nature of not being harmonious is nonobscuredneutral and is included in the aggregate dissociated formations The blameworthiness of the introduction of disunity in the councils of the samgha is lying Question What is accomplished by whom Answer The samgha is broken The person who breaks the samgha is with blameworthiness He experiences a retribution of one kalpa in Avicihell The samgha is broken The person who breaks the samgha is with blameworthiness Breaking is accomplished in relation to the samgha blameworthiness is accomplished by the person who breaks the samgha He experiences a retribution of one kalpa in Avicihell The blameworthiness of introduction of disunity in the councils of the samgha is with experiencing one kalpa in Avicihell as retribution Doing other forms of misconduct is with a retribution in other hells sometimes it is Avici Later the samgha cannot be broken When after the introduction of disunity in the councils of the samgha other misconduct is done it all is with Avicihell as fruit When often doing misconduct the body one receives is big and smooth and  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya one often experiences manifold frustration This is impossible after other proximate actions The one who breaks the samgha may be of a respectable lineage and an eloquent orator Such persons can break the samgha because they establishes themselves as great instructors Negligence in relation to moral precepts is not dominant Question How is the samgha broken Answer  A great instructor and the right path and the different forms of patience of bhiksus bring a schism to the harmonious samgha It is socalled conduct of views A great instructor and the right path and the different forms of patience of bhiksus bring a schism to the harmonious samgha It should be known that when a bhiksu produces an engagement such as Devadatta is my great instructor not Gautama The five factors he settled are the right path not the eightfold noble this is introduction of disunity in the councils of the samgha Moreover it is said that accepting the sticks Which person breaks the samgha Answer Dominance of conduct of views bad engagement a person with conduct of views breaks the samgha Because of light energy it is not a person with conduct of craving Because of  Question s it the person living in ones house who Actions  breaks the samgha or is it the one who has left home to become a religious mendicant Answer It is the bhiksu The bhiksu with the act of entering into the order of monks breaks the samgha it is not the one living in ones house not the Sramanera not the bhiksuni When their mind abides in breaking the samgha it exactly is this awareness that is with that fruit To sensation of the introduction of disunity in the councils of the samgha the same applies as to the group of six forms of consciousness that are present one by one Question Where and by how many persons is the samgha broken Answer In three directions schism in karman is with minimum eight Jn Jambudvipa it is when reaching nine This is the schism of the wheel of the doctrine In three directions schism in karman is with minimum eight In three worlds there is schism in the karman of the samgha Minimum eight because with four persons something is called samgha not with three It should be known that when in the sphere of one state two divisions of the samgha each do the posadhakarman in a different way the samgha is broken Question Where and by how many persons is the wheel of the doctrine broken Answer In Jambudvipa it is when reaching nine This is the schism of the wheel of the doctrine Only in Jambu Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya dyipa there is the schism of the wheel of the doctrine When there is a path there then it is another path when there is a great instructor there then it is another instructor The minimum is reached with nine persons reaching two divisions that each are different When there is one person who agrees with the samgha it is the one who instructs the samgha and who follows the samgha The division that instructs shamelessness and disregard is Devadatta Question Is it breaking the samgha of the nobles or the samgha of the worldlings Answer It is breaking the one of the worldlings not the one of the noble persons because of the group fixed in truth because of perfect faith Moreover it is said that also the one of those worldlings who have acquired patience is not broken because they already go in a certain direction and the samgha of nobles and the Worldhonoured One are the unmingled group b uestion W hen is the sam ha not broken Answer When there is no depository of rules of morality before and after when the Muni is already in nirvana at the moment the carbuncle is not produced yet and when there is no first couple at these six moments the wheel of the doctrine is not broken There are six moments at which the samgha is not broken when there is no depository of rules of morality  the Actions  reasons for the depository of rules of morality have already been spoken of previously Neither before nor after because at these two moments the samgha is in unity Neither is it after parinirvana of the Great Instructor because there is no other instructor  Neither is it when the carbuncle of bad moral precepts and of bad views is not produced yet Neither is it when the first couple is not established yet because before the broken samgha lasts in division for one night the first couple is there for reuniting Some want that there are seven reasons for not breaking  the Great Instructor who stays in the order because one would have no magnificence Not all buddhas have the introduction of disunity in the councils of the samgha Which one of these five proximate actions is worst Answer   When lying breaks the samgha it is the worst of all actions Thinking in the summit of existence is said to be with the greatest fruit When lying breaks the samgha it is the worst of all actions Lying that breaks the samgha is the worst because of proceeding in the doctrinal body The doctrine is what is esteemed by Buddha It is because of proceeding when widely practised and because the introduction of disunity in the councils of the samgha causes distraction in the order  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya When the one who breaks the samgha has not arisn free from beings yet he will not arise free from beings acquisition of a fruit sitting in trance erudition and the action indecision also will not arise and in a trichiliocosm the wheel of the doctrine will not proceed When the samgha is reunited the one who has not arisen free from beings yet will arise free from beings acquisition of a fruit nonattachment destruction of impure influence sitting in trance erudition and the action indecision will arise and the wheel of the doctrine will proceed again in a trichiliocosm Question This says lying is the greatest blameworthiness but moreover it is said elsewhere that it is mental action and false view What is the difference between these forms of greatest blameworthiness Answer Of the five forms of proximate blameworthiness lying is the worst of the three actions mental action is the worst of the five views false view  is the worst Furthermore lying is the worst blameworthiness because its retribution is wide because it brings distraction to the order mental action is the worst blameworthiness because of cutting away the roots of merit false view is the worst blameworthiness Question Which action is with the greatest fruit Answer Thinking in the summit of existence is said to be with the greatest fruit By means of this thinking there is a duration of life of eighty times one thousand kalpas in the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification because of retribution as fruit When said to be the fruit of disjunction thinking associated with vajropamasaActions  madhi is said to be with the greatest  because this thinking cuts away ali defilement eternally as acquisition of a fruit Moreover it is said that one form of thinking as seed is with eighty times one thousand kalpas  and later many forms of thinking are fulfilled just as a painter first makes with one colour and later with a multitude of colours Moreover it is said that in one aspect and one supporting object of meditative attainment at one moment a multitude of forms of thinking is present Among them there sometimes is experiencing a duration of life of ten times one thousand kalpas because of thinking sometimes it is a duration of life of thirty times one thousand kalpas or forty times one thousand kalpas This is said to be a number of great kalpas Heart of Scholasticism with Miscellaneous Additions volume three  Q a  rot ae Heart of Scholasticism with Miscellaneous Additions Volume Four Chapter Four Contaminants Composed by the venerable Dharmatrata Translated by the Indian Tripitaka Samghavarman of the Sung and others Actions have already been spoken of elaborately Since their companion is defilement these actions arise in man ifold ways they are not free from defilement Defilement shall now be spoken of As root of existence the action make all forms of frustration arise as companion There are seven of these contaminants This is what the Muni has said Think about it Sensual existence material existence and immaterial exis tence have such seven contaminants as the attachment to  Sensual pleasure as seed Because of defilement there is action because of action there is rearising This defiled action makes all forms of frustration At the moment defilement proceeds ten things are made the socalled solidity of the faculty the parts that are successive the production of a field the arising of the natural fruit sowing of action adherence to specific  Samyuktabhidharmahydaya provisions ignorance regarding the supporting object inducing a stream of consciousness transgressing good action and the meaning of quick attachment that does not permit the effort with which to transgress a sphere is made The one who has this knowledge should know its meaning That such seven contaminants form ninetyeight shall now be spoken of Differentiated as to realm aspect and mode ninetyeight are spoken of Ten kinds are to be abandoned through the spiritual paths the rest are to be abandoned through the path of vision Differentiated as to realm aspect and mode these seven contaminants form ninetyeight contaminants Of the ninetyeight contaminants the contaminant attachment to sensual pleasure among these seven contaminants is of five forms because of difference in mode The same applies to the contaminant repugnance  Differentiated as to realm and mode the contaminant attachment to existence is of ten forms Differentiated as to realm and mode the contaminant pride is of fifteen forms The same applies to the contaminant ignorance  Differentiated as to aspect the contaminant views is of five forms differentiated as to aspect and mode of twelve forms and differentiated as to realm aspect and mode of thirtysix forms Differentiated as to realm and mode the contaminant perplexity is of twelve forms These are the seven contaminants differentiated to ninetyContaminants  eight Question How many of these ninetyeight contaminants are to be abandoned through vision and how many are to be abandoned through spiritual practice Answer Ten kinds are to be abandoned through the spiritual path the rest are to be abandoned through the path of vision Differentiated as to realm attachment pride and ignorance are of nine forms Repugnance is the tenth The other eightyeight contaminants are to be abandoned through the path of vision When there is sudden vision regarding the truths they are abandoned That is why the path of vision is spoken of Since there is abandonment when the path is practised repeatedly the spiritual path is therefore spoken of When to be abandoned through the path of vision to be abandoned through vision is spoken of when to be abandoned through the spiritual path to be abandoned through spiritual practice is spoken of This applies to both conscious awarenesses and unconscious awarenesses Nine forms are of one form nine forms are of nine forms There is annihilation through the effort with which one breaks a stone and through the effort with which one pulls a silk thread there is observing with which one does not see jreyam yet and observing with which one already sees jfieyam When at the moment of this annihilation the path with four aspects is developed something is to be abandoned through the path of vision when at the moment of this annihilation the path with the sixteen aspects is developed something is to be abandoned through the spiritual path  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The same applies to curing what is insubstantial and to curing what is substantial The difference in antidote of the contaminants has already been spoken of Their difference in mode shall now be spoken of Twentyeight of the contaminants obstruct the vision of frustration These shall be abandoned eternally and completely at the moment of vision of frustration Twentyeight of the eightyeight contaminants to be abandoned through vision are to be abandoned through the vision of frustration because they obstruct the vision of frustration The meaning of annihilation shall be spoken of later in this chapter  Nineteen are to be abandoned through the vision of the origin It should be known that the same is true for cessation Add three for the ones to be abandoned through the vision of the path Ten are said to be abandoned through the spiritual path Nineteen contaminants are to be abandoned through the vision of the origin because they obstruct the vision of the origin they are to be abandoned through the vision of the origin Tt should be known that the same is true for cessation The same applies to the nineteen contaminants to be abandoned through the vision of cessation Contaminants  Add three for the ones to be abandoned through the vision of the path Twentytwo contaminants are to be abandoned through the vision of the path Ten contaminants are to be abandoned through the spiritual path as has been said previously The difference in mode of the contaminants has already been spoken of Their difference in realm shall now be spoken of  Of the first form of defilement ten are to be known as abiding in the one of sexual passion Of two forms of modes there are seven The other eight are to be abandoned through the vision of the path Of the first form of defilement ten are to be known as abiding in the one of sexual passion Of the first form of defilement to be abandoned through the vision of frustration as it has been spoken of previously ten are contaminants bound to the realm of sexual passion Of two forms of modes there are seven To be abandoned through the vision of the origin and through the vision of cessation are each seven contaminants bound to the realm of sexual passion The other eight are to be abandoned through the vision of the path Eight contaminants to be abandoned through the vision of the path are bound to the realm of sexual passion  It should be known that in the realm of sexual passion  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya four are to be abandoned through the spiritual path The rest are in the higher two realms It should be known that they are to be acquired in the same way Tt should be known that in the realm of sexual passion four are to be abandoned through the spiritual path Of defilement to be abandoned through the spiritual path four are bound to the realm of sexual passion In this way thirtysix contaminants are spoken of in the realm of sexual passion The rest are in the higher two realms The other sixtytwo contaminants abide in the realm of form and in the one of formlessness Question How many are bound to the realm of form and how many are bound to the realm of formlessness Answer It should be known that they are to be acquired in the same way Of these thirtyone contaminants are bound to the realm of form and thirtyone contaminants are bound to the realm of formlessness The difference in realm and mode has already been spoken of The specific characteristic marks of the contaminants shall now be spoken of  It should be known that the socalled belief in a self extreme view false view and two adherences these five are said to be called views  Formations are produced from conditions and the ignorant fool with disturbed awarenesses produces a self Contaminants  and what belongs to a self regarding the five appropriating aggregates whether specific or general  and counts on them positively This is called belief in a self Accepting annihilation and permanence regarding formations and counting on them positively is called extreme view Denying what has been taught tively is called false view Accepting impure factors as the extreme and counting on it positively is adherence to such things as particular views Because of excluding such things as it is called adherence to particular views  B Accepting impure formations as such as clean  and counting on it positively i is adherence to such things as moral precepts and vows Because of excluding such things as it is called adherence to moral precepts and vows nu Because these five defilements are judgements   they are said to be views because of wrong judgements they are the one false view because of difference in aspect they are said to be the five views In Sanskrit the two adherences can also be called mr or ga Moreover there is the meaning of being stealthy and the meaning of being selective Although the reality is contrary to the principle they are stated to be selective because the purpose stays seeking for religion Because that which is accepted is the wrong path they are called stealthy   and counting on it posi  Attachment to sensual pleasure perplexity repugnance pride and delusion are said to be nonviews Since the objects for their proceeding are different  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya manifold names are established Attachment to sensual pleasure perplexity repugnance pride and delusion are said to be nonviews Being attached to what is pleasant regarding certain objects is called attachment to sensual pleasure  Regarding the truths it sometimes is called perplexity Being angry regarding what is relating to beings and what is not relating to beings is called  repugnance Aimed at someone else who is inferior equal or higher producing an awareness of being higher oneself in respect to such as lineage looks power wealth authority and talent is called pride Being ignorant regarding the truths is called delusion Because these five defilements are not with the nature of wisdom they are nonviews These are the ten contaminants Since the objects for their proceeding are different manifold names are established Because the objects of proceeding of these ten contaminants are different manifold names are established These contaminants are said to be abandoned through the vision of frustration when they obstruct the vision of frustration When they in this way obstruct the vision of the origin the one of cessation or the one of the path   they are said to be abandoned through the vision of the path  Ail are said to be minor frustration Two ways of proceeding are free from three views For the one of the path two views are excluded In the higher realms repugnance does not proceed All are said to be minor frustration Minor frustration is frustration of the realm of sexual passion Because they Contaminants  are contrary to the vision of frustration these ten contaminants are all to be abandoned through the vision of frustration Two ways of proceeding are free from three views Exception made for belief in a self extreme view and adherence to moral precepts and vows the other seven contaminants are to be abandoned through the vision of the origin and through the one of cessation because they are contrary to the vision of the origin and to the one of cessation For the one of the path two views are excluded Exception made for belief in a self and extreme view the other eight contaminants are to be abandoned through the vision of the path because they are contrary to the vision of the path Question Why are belief in a self and extreme view only to be abandoned through the vision of frustration Answer Because they proceed with frustration as substratum and because they proceed with fruit as substratum when one sees this they are abandoned and they are not remote from the subsequent acquisition of a faculty Because these views do not follow a faculty they are abandoned when one primarily sees the truth Question Why is adherence to moral precepts and vows to be abandoned through the vision of frustration and through the vision of the path and not through the one of the origin or through the one of cessation Answer Because of being produced with these as substratum the one outside the path is contrary to these two truths not to the one of the origin and to the one of cessation Because of being with impurity as substratum there is desire in relation to the truth of the origin be Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya cause of what is cleansed as substratum there is desire in relation to the truth of cessation When an inward factor it is to be abandoned through the vision of frustration when an outward factor it is to be abandoned through the vision of the path  Question Why is it that the contaminant perplexity is not to be abandoned through the spiritual path  Answer Because one has no vision regarding an actual entity there is perplexity because one has vision regarding an actual entity there is annihilation produces vision and there is no view to be abandoned through the spiritual path In the higher realms repugnance does not proceed In the realm of form and in the one of formlessness repug nance is excluded The rest are as has been said with the realm of sexual passion In the realm of form nine are to be abandoned through the vision of frustration six are to be abandoned through the vision of the origin and through the one of cessation seven are to be abandoned through the vision of the path and three are to be abandoned through the spiritual path The same applies to the realm of formlessness  Question Why is there no repugnance in the higher two realms Answer Because these are without the nature of shamelessness disregard selfishness envy regret and frustration because one peacefully supports the body because of acquisition of awarenesses of loving kindness because there is no nature of the nine malicious actual entities because of being free from the characteristic marks of Contaminants  what is not conferring benefits because of being free from what is absolutely bad Repugnance is because of two fruits The establishment of the realms of the contaminants has already been spoken of The pervasives shall now be spoken of Since perplexity views and ignorance are universal and abide in frustration and in its cause they are developed by all forms abiding in one stage It should be known  that perplexity views and associated and unique ignorance to be abandoned through the vision of frustration and through the one of the origin   these eleven contaminants are oven in every stage because of their wide objects In relation to the specific stage  five forms are in this way developed by the supporting object What is higher does not develop what is lower because of not being the object because of nonattachment because of full overcoming comprehension What is inferior does not develop what is superior because of being weak because of being no developed thing because the natural fruit cannot be acquired It should be known that what is to be abandoned through the vision of the truth is the cause of all defiled factors This must be this way Because when noble persons produce craving for nonexistence and for existence the fetters of repugnance and the seed of pride are not present and it has to be explained that proceeding is  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya no part of it Craving for nonexistence and for existence are supported by the view of annihilation and are produced subsequently to the view of annihilation because of having to be abandoned through this view of annihilation The fetter repugnance is supported by false view and is produced subsequently to false view because of having to be abandoned through this false view The seed of pride is what is supported by belief in a self and what is produced subsequently to belief in a self because of having to be abandoned through this belief in a self The pervasives of the specific stage have already been spoken of Now those with another stage as object shall be spoken of Another stage as object is exception made for two views as previously It are the nine pervasive contaminants of all stages The same is true for nonidentification Previously eleven pervasives have been spoken of Exception made for belief in a self and extreme view all other nine pervasives from the realm of sexual passion up to the sphere of nothingness are the pervasives of another stage This false view to be abandoned through the vision of frustration of the realm of sexual passion that either specific or general denies the fruit in the realm of form and in the one of formlessness experiences adherence to particular views as the extreme experiences adherence to moral precepts and vows as clean produces perplexity or is not understanding ignorance false view to be abandoned Contaminants  through the vision of the origin of the realm of sexual passion that either specific or general denies the cause of the aggregates in the realm of form and in the one of formlessness experiences adherence to particular views regarding the cause as the extreme is perplexity or is not understanding ignorance The same applies to false view to be abandoned through the vision of frustration and through the one of the origin of the first trance that either specific or general denies frustration and the origin in seven stages In this way it is to be spoken of elaborately up to false view to be abandoned through the vision of frustration and throughthe one of the origin of the sphere of nothingness that either spe cific orgeneral denies frustration and the origin in one stage In this way it is spoken of elaborately The stage of the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification is without pervasives of another stage because there is no higher stage Also the realms are to be spoken of in this way In the realm of formlessness there are no pervasives of another realm because there is no higher realm Question Which meaning does pervasive have Answer The meaning of universally taking all forms of what is impure as supporting object is the meaning of pervasive the meaning of being with the grip of the Bower condition is the meaning of pervasive because of everything that is produced all beings and all things something is called pervasive There are no worldlings who do actually not grasp such forntations as a self regarding impure factors Question Why is it said that belief in a self and extreme  Samyuktabhidharmahydaya view are pervasives of a specific stage and not of another stage Answer Because of seeing present objects these views see present objects When being born in a lower stage there is no vision of a higher stage Although when being born in a higher stage there is vision of a lower stage it has already been said previously that the contaminants of a higher stage do not take a lower stage as supporting object Because attachment repugnance and pride are produced by their specific characteristic marks they do not take another form as supporting object the more taking another stage as supporting object Although the one who is not yet without attachment longs for a higher stage this intention is no greed When false view takes frustration as supporting object it is contrary to the vision of frustration One stage takes nine stages as supporting object The same istrue for the one that takes the one of the origin as supporting object a When false view takes frustration as supporting object it is contrary to the vision of frustration One stage takes nine stages as supporting object False view to be abandoned through the vision of frustration of the realm of sexual passion takes frustration of nine stages as supporting object from the realm of sexual passion up to the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification They are not simultaneously when the realm of sexual passion it is not the realm of form or the one of formlessness The first trance takes eight stages as supporting object the second trance seven stages up to neitheridentificationnornonidentification takes neitheridentificationnornonidentification as supporting object The same is true for the one that takes the one of the origin as supporting object To false view to be abandoned through the vision of the origin the same applies as to what has been said about false view to be abandoned through the vision of frustration Question Why are only the pervasives contaminants how are the other factors Answer  It should be known that when  formations have one and the same fruit as pervasive contaminants they are pervasives This does not apply to such as acquisition Such factors as feeling associated with all pervasive contaminants and such as the simultaneous birth are also pervasives because they are with one and the same fruit because they are combined with them because they proceed subsequently because before and after there is no being notcombined This is called pervasive Because acquisition is not with the nature of such as one fruit it is no pervasive Pervasive contaminants are because of three things causing five forms taking five forms as supporting object and developing five forms Associated factors are causing five forms are taking  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya five forms as supporting objects but are not developing five forms because they are not with the nature of contaminants Simultaneous factors are causing five forms are not taking five forms as supporting object and are not developing five forms That is why four sentences are to be made speaking of pervasive contaminants that are pervasive cause pervasive contaminant but no pervasive cause pervasive contaminants of the future   pervasive cause but no pervasive contaminant associated and simultaneous factors of pervasive contaminants of the past and of the present both pervasive contaminant and pervasive cause pervasive contaminants of the past and of the present neither pervasive cause nor pervasive contaminant  exception made for the above mentioned ones ad  False view perplexity and associated and unique ignorance to be abandoned through the one of cessation and through the one of the path should be known as with a pure supporting object It should be known that false view perplexity associated ignorance and unique ignorance to be abandoned through the vision of cessation and through the vision of the path these six contaminants are in every realm with a pure supporting object False view to be abandoned through the vision of cessation denies cessation Perplexity and not understanding ignorance proceed with cessation as substratum In this way that which is to be abandoned through the vision of the path proceeds with the path as substratum Contaminants  Question Does false view to be abandoned through the vision of cessation deny cessation through vision or through nonvision When through vision it cannot be denied because it is vision when through nonvision it cannot be with a pure supporting object Answer It is denying through vision but to this the same applies as to when false view denies the position of a person Question Is that which is to be abandoned through the vision of cessation just as false view to be abandoned through the vision of frustration of the realm of sexual passion that takes frustration of nine stages as supporting ob ject up to the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification that takes one stage as supporting object Answer It is not so Question How is it Answer  When a view has cessation as object it is only with cessation of the formations of the specific stage as object Because disappearance is no cause When a view has cessation as object it is only with cessation of the formations of the specific stage as object False view to be abandoned through the vision of cessation of the realm of sexual passion takes cessation of the formations of the realm of sexual passion as supporting object not of the first trance The same applies to the first trance up to the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question Why is it no other stage Answer Because disappearance is no cause Because disappearance is unconditioned it is no cause for proceeding because it is no cause for proceeding cessation of the formations of the specific stage is the object of false view That is why it is no other  It is not right that the same applies to good knowledge Because of being contrary to arising when proceeding good knowledge proceeds in the truths and is contrary to arising when proceeding That is why since its proceeding is different it also is different from what is defiled because impure stages would be with annihilation of causes and fruits That false view to be abandoned through the vision of frustration is also with frustration of the specific stage as object is not right because of implicating one another when proceeding because there are the causes for proceeding either birth or basis or establishing or cause Question How does false view to be abandoned through the vision of the path proceed Is it as that which is to be abandoned through the vision of frustration and through the one of the origin or is it as that which is to be abandoned through the vision of cessation Answer It proceeds differently Question Answer  When a view has the path as object this view takes the path as supporting object because of proceeding in mutual dependence It is with six stages and with nine stages Contaminants  Because the path proceeds in mutual dependence false view to be abandoned through the vision of the path of the realm of sexual passion takes the class of knowledge of the law of six stages as supporting object False view to be abandoned through the vision of the path of the eight stages of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness takes the class of subsequent knowledge of nine stages as supporting object knowledge of the law and subsequent knowledge proceed in mutual dependence it is so that as these factors are enriched by craving in the realm of sexual passion and when viewing a self and what belongs to a self are accepted the antidote for these should be that which takes false view to be abandoned through the vision of the path of the reaim of sexual passion as supporting object It is not this defilement that is with another stage as supporting object Also subsequent knowledge is to be spoken of in this way Question Are knowledge of the law in relation to cessation and the one in relation to the path no antidote for factors of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness That is why these knowledges should be the object of false view to be abandoned through the vision of the path of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness If they were not the object it also could not be said that when factors are that which is enriched by craving in the realm of form and in the one of formlessness and when viewing a self and what belongs to a self are accepted the antidote for this should be that which takes false view to be abandoned through the vision of the path of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness as supporting object Answer Because all are incomplete there is no mistake It  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya is not the complete knowledge of the law that is the antidote for these realms although it is knowledge of the law in relation to cessation and the one in relation to the path it is no knowledge of the law in relation to frustration nor the one in relation to the origin It neither is the case that knowledge of the law in relation to cessation and the one in relation to the path completely are the antidote for the realm of form and for the one of formlessness they are only the antidote for knowledge of the law in relation to the spiritual path and not in relation to the path of vision because of primarily not being part of it That is why what you say is not right It is to be compared with the faculty satisfaction and mental formations Depression contentedness and equanimity abide in the stage of the mind Because they cause the six forms of consciousness they establish eighteen mental formations Because the faculty satisfaction of the realm of sexual passion does not abide in the stage of the mind it does not establish a mental formation Question Why are attachment repugnance pride adherence to particular views and adherence to moral precepts and vows not with a pure supporting object Answer  One should not lay charge upon supporting objects of attachment They should not be taken as not conferring benefits They are appeased and the extreme clean These are not with a pure supporting object The wise one sees the fault of attachment If were with a pure supporting object its fault could not Contaminants  be seen when a fault is not seen it also cannot be abandoned When there is attachment regarding nirvana this is interest in a good factor and this is no craving Because of not conferring benefits repugnance is produced and these are not not conferring benefits because of not being appetised pride is produced and these are appeased Adherence to particular views proceeds in the extreme When with a pure supporting object something is a right view and no defilement because of not being overturned The same applies to adherence to moral precepts and vows Question What are all contaminants developed by Answer All modes of the realm of sexual passion develop regarding pervasive contaminants that take the specific stage as supporting object The same is further true for higher stages All modes of the realm of sexual passion develop regarding pervasive contaminants that take the specific stage as supporting object Pervasive contaminants of the realm of sexual passion are developed by the supporting object regarding the five modes of the realm of sexual passion Question How is it for the realm of form and for the one of formlessness Answer The same is further true for higher stages In this way also pervasive contaminants of the specific stage of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness are developed by the supporting object regarding the five modes of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the specific stage ad  It should be known that the other contaminants take the specific mode as supporting object to be developed by the supporting object regarding the specific object All are of the class on which they depend Tt should be known that the other contaminants take the specific mode as supporting object to be developed by the supporting object regarding the specific object The other nonpervasive and pervasive contaminants are developed by the supporting object by a factor of the specific mode because of the object with specific characteristic marks All are of the class on which they depend Both the pervasive and nonpervasive ones whether they are with an impure supporting object or with a pure supporting object each are developed by an associated factor of the specific class  When a contaminant is with a pure supporting object or is a defilement that takes another stage as supporting object it is developed by association in the specific class Because the object is disjunctioned When a contaminant is with a pure supporting object or is a defilement that takes another stage as supporting object it is developed by association in the specific class When a contaminant is with a pure supporting object or takes another stage as supporting object it is developed by association in the specific class it is not developed by the supContaminants  porting object Why Because the object is disjunctioned The object of these contaminants is disjunctioned By means of pure factors every defilement is disjunctioned because factors of a higher stage are disjunctioned from defilement of a lower stage Question By how many kinds are the contaminants one by one developed Answer What develops belief in a self is of the mode to be abandoned through the vision of frustration and of the pervasives with vision of the origin The same is true for the rest of the vision of frustration What develops belief in a self is of the mode to be abandoned through the vision of frustration and of the pervasives with vision of the origin Belief in a self is what is developed by all contaminants to be abandoned through the vision of frustration because it is the specific mode It is of what is developed by the pervasives to be abandoned through the vision of the origin because of the wide object Question How are the other contaminants to be abandoned through the vision of frustration Answer The same is true for the rest of the vision of frustration As has been said with belief in a self it should be known that the same applies to the other contaminants to be  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya abandoned through the vision of frustration  Those of the origin are just as those of frustration Those of cessation and those of the path with an impure supporting object are all developed regarding the specific mode The same is true for what is to be abandoned through the spiritual path Those of the origin are just as those of frustration As has been said with that which is to be abandoned through the vision of frustration the same applies to that which is to be abandoned through the vision of the origin Those of cessation and those of the path with an impure supporting object are all developed regarding the specific mode The same is true for what is to be abandoned through the spiritual path The same applies to those to be abandoned through the vision of cessation through the vision of the path and through the spiritual path The difference is that contaminants to be abandoned through the vision of cessation and through the vision of the path developed by an impure supporting object of the specific mode are all developed by the specific mode and developed by pervasive contaminants they are also developed by contaminantsassociated with the ones with a pure supporting object  Question Contaminants and that which develops contaminants are already known Which of the contaminants is a contaminant Contaminants  Answer The specific class of contaminants of the vision of frustration is developed by the supporting object and by association Ignorance associated with views is developed by the supporting object The same is true for the rest Belief in a self and ignorance associated with belief in a self as two forms of contaminants are developed by the supporting object and by association Other contaminants to be abandoned through the vision of frustration and pervasives to be abandoned through the vision of the origin are developed by the supporting object but not developed by association because they are not of the same class Other contaminants neither are developed by the supporting object nor developed by association What is associated with belief in a self is no developing factor Belief in a self and ignorance associated with it are developed by association and also developed by the supporting object Other contaminants to be abandoned through the vision of frustration and pervasive contaminants to be abandoned through the vision of the origin are developed by the supporting object but not developed by association Other contaminants neither are by association nor by the supporting object To extreme view false view adherence to particular views adherence to moral precepts and vows perplexity attachment repugnance and pride to be abandoned through the vision of frustration the same applies as to belief in a self  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Ignorance to be abandoned through the vision of frustration is developed by the supporting object but not developed by association regarding ignorance to be abandoned through the vision of frustration and regarding pervasives to be abandoned through the vision of the origin Regarding other contaminants to be abandoned through the vision of frustration it is developed both by the supporting object and by association Regarding the rest it neither is developed by the supporting object nor by association To what is to be abandoned through the vision of the origin the same applies as to what is to be abandoned through the vision of frustration The same applies to impure supporting objects to be abandoned through the vision of cessation and through the vision of the path and to what is to be abandoned through the spiritual path The difference is that when something associated with the contaminant can be achieved it exactly is developed by association and developed by the supporting object regarding this contaminant When a view is with cessation as object ignorance arises together with it Pervasive contaminants with impure supporting objects are contrary When a view is with cessation as object ignorance arises together with it False view to be abandoned through the vision of cessation is developed by association by ignorance that is associated with it This ignorance is developed by association by false view Its associated factors are developed by association with both Contaminants  Question How are the other contaminants further Answer Pervasive contaminants with impure supporting objects are contrary Pervasives and contaminants of the mode to be abandoned through the vision of cessation and with impure supporting object are developed by the supporting object The rest neither are developed by association nor developed by the supporting object Because of this meaning it should be known that the same applies to other contaminants with pure supporting object The difference with unique ignorance is that these are without contaminants developed by association  These are developed in both manners and atomic connecting and also continuing They are produced from three things These should be known as such as uninterruptedness Moreover developed in both manners is as breastfeeding a child atomic is atomic formation connecting is as oil in hemp continuing is as following the flood of water with a shadow in space Question How are these contaminants produced Answer They are produced from three things These should be known as such as uninterruptedness Because of three things the contaminant attachment is produced the power cause the power object and the power preparation When the contaminant attachment to sen Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya sual pleasure is not abandoned not knowing it is its power cause that which the fetter sensual pleasure takes as supporting object is its power object unreasoned attention in relation to it is its power preparation This explains causes and conditions of a fully provided defilement These three things do not have to be complete If the three things were needed for their production there would not be the one falling back It should be known that the same applies to all contaminants Question Are the contaminants bad or neutral Answer  In the realm of sexual passion belief in a self extreme view and associated ignorance are neutral In the one of form and in the one of Sormlessness they all are Tn the realm of sexual passion belief in a self extreme view and associated ignorance are neutral In the realm of sexual passion belief in a self extreme view and associated ignorance are neutral Why in later times Also when fully taking the moral precepts he lets the self arise with gods Also when practising the path he lets the self achieve liberation Liberation follows the view of annihilation Furthermore these views are produced because of ignorance regarding a specific thing they are not produced because of suppressing something else That is why the Contaminants  one who is with taking a self sees colours with his eyes but states I see not the eye sees It is not because I see colours that something else is suppressed That is why they are not bad The other defilement of the realm of sexual passion is bad In the one of form and in the one of formlessness they all are Contaminants of the realm of form and of the realm of formlessness are all neutral because of being broken by meditative attainment  because there is no nature of unpleasant feeling That which is bad is with unpleasant feeling as retribution and this one is not in the realm of form and in the one of formlessness In the realm of form and in the one of formlessness there is no retribution of the realm of sexual passion because the fruit of retribution would interrupt the stages Question Which contaminant proceeds in which substratum Answer a  Attachment repugnance and pride are produced by some supporting objects when in the past When future they are spoken of in relation to all Attachment repugnance and pride are produced by some supporting objects when in the past Attachment repugnance and pride of the past cannot be produced regarding all impure factors because they are defilement with specific characteristic marks Attachment cannot be produced regarding objects that are a not seen not heard and not reflected on  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Sometimes there is a person who produces attachment regarding the eye not in relation to other parts of the body The same applies to repugnance and to pride When future they are spoken of in relation to all Attachment repugnance and pride of the future are bound to all impure factors of the three periods of time as supporting object because they are with the three periods of time as supporting object The rest is completely  bound when in two periods of time Views perplexity and ignorance are the rest Because they are produced in relation to general characteristic marks they are whether past or future bound to impure factors of the three periods of time Present contaminants are unfixed That is why they are not spoken of When defilement with specific characteristic marks is present it exactly is bound to the present and to the future Past is when their being produced and already having disappeared is not abandoned Question Is it not so that when contaminants of the past are abandoned they exactly are also abandoned in the future Why then is their being produced in the past and already having disappeared which is not abandoned spoken of Answer It is spoken of because of not being of equal form Sometimes excessive and middle forms are produced first When these are abandoned in the past they exactly are abandoned in the future Regarding this fact one is bound to future minor defilement That is why there is no mistake When defilement with general characteristic marks is present it is bound to all impure factors of the three periods of time This is a general explanation  Contaminants  Defilement cf the group of five forms of consciousness that is past is bound to the ones of the past When present it is bound to the ones of the present When future arisen factors it is bound to the ones of the future when nonarisen factors it is bound to the elements of the three petiods of time With the stage of the mind it is bound to the elements of the three periods of time whether past or present or future Question What is bound Answer Defilement of the group of the consciousness of the eye is bound to matter that is taken as supporting object The associated factors are bound to what they are associated with These associated factors are the sense mind and the factor sensefield The same applies up to defilement of the group of the consciousness of the body bound to the tangible that is taken as supporting object The associated factors are bound to what they are associated with Defilement of the stage of the mind is bound to the twelve sense that are taken as supporting object The associated factors are bound to what they are associated with The associated factors are the sense mind and the factor sensefield  The Abhidharmikas say that the person is not settled that the fetters are settled and that the substance is settled The Darstantikas say that the fetters are settled that the person is not settled and that the substance is not settled because of being with attachment and with attachment disappeared Regarding these it is so that sometimes attachment is produced or repugnance  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya is produced or pride is produced or envy is produced or aversion is produced or compassion is produced or e quanimity  is produced The establishment of the contaminants in the periods of time has already been spoken of The succession shall now be spoken of  Defilement is produced successively the one of the specific stage in the specific stage The one of a higher stage also makes arise in a lower one It should be known that it arises successively Defilement is produced successively the one of the specific stage in the specific stage All contaminants of the specific stage in the specific Every defilement proceeds successively and one by one they make everything arise successively The one of a higher stage also makes arise in a lower one It should be known that it arises successively Deb filement of a higher stage makes defilement of a lower stage arise successively At death with defiled awarenesses there it is produced in the intermediate existence and in the existence at rearising of a lower stage With the stage of neitheridentificationnornonidentification it arises successively in eight stages Up to the brahmaworld it arises successively in the realm of sexual passion Question In relation to this defilement the Worldhonoured One has been speaking of entanglements floods seizures impure influences and bonds What are these Answer Contaminants   There are entanglements floods and seizures impure influences and bonds Because of this meaning entanglements Sloods seizures impure influences and bonds are spoken of Because of being entangled in frustration entanglements are spoken of These are fourfold the entanglement sensual pleasure the entanglement existence the entanglement views and the entanglement ignorance Question Why is it that the five views are said to be the entanglement views and that one ignorance establishes one entanglement Answer Because of the equal burden Question Why is it that exception made for views and ignorance the other fetters of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness establish one entanglement existence Answer Because of the equal stage of right concentration and because of being obscuredneutral Because they flow in beings floods are spoken of Also these are fourfold as has been said with entanglements  Because of seizing existence seizures are spoken of because of extremely grasping Also these are fourfold the seizure of sensual pleasure the seizure of views the seizure of moral precepts and vows and the seizure of the theory that there is a self Question Why is it that ignorance is said to be an entangle Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya ment and a flood and is not said to be a seizure Answer Because it is no zealous formation The meaning of grasping is the meaning of seizure and is a zealous formation This ignorance is no zealous formation it is because of foolishness that a seizure is spoken of Question Why is it that four views are said to be the seizure of views and is one seizure said to be the seizure of moral precepts and vows Answer Because of the equal burden Because this can make actions burning and is contrary to the path Because inward and outward can be achieved when the one outside the path is with such frustration as not eating he makes the conceptual identification of the path the one who is with the path makes the conceptual identification of the path with such as excrement that makes the dress dirty Question Why are the fetters of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness said to be the seizure of the theory that there is a self and not so for the realm of sexual passion Answer Because of being produced in relation to an inward substratum The fetters of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness produce oriented inwardly because they take themselves as supporting object the fetters of the realm of sexual passion produce oriented outwardly from every sense and because the mental outflow flows uninterruptedly impure influences are spoken of These are threefold the impure influence sensual pleasure the impure influence existence and the impure influence ignorance Contaminants  Question Why is it that the flood views and the en tanglement views are spoken of and that the impure influence of views is not spoken of Answer The meaning of running is the meaning of impure influence and this view is zealous and does not follow this running That is why the rest that are not zealous are as the various things that have been said about defilement The meaning of flowing is the meaning of floods  Views follow the flow That is why floods are established The meaning of being bound to frustration is the meaning of bond Question What is the nature of the entanglements floods seizures impure influences and bonds Answer  Their number is twentynine Also twentyeight are spoken of thirtysix and fifteen This is the nature of the entanglements and floods of such as sensual pleasure five forms of attachment five forms of repugnance five forms of pride four forms of perplexity and the ten envelopers The envelopers shall be spoken of later in this chapter The entanglement existence is of twentyeight forms ten forms of attachment ten forms of pride and eight forms of perplexity The entanglement views is of thirtysix forms the five views divided as to realm aspect and mode are thirtysix  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The entanglement mode has fifteen forms The same applies to the floods The next is said to be of thirty forms The third is said to be of six The fourth is with thirtyeight The nature of the seizure of sensual pleasure is of thirtyfour forms five forms of attachment five forms of repugnance five forms of pride five forms of ignorance four forms of perplexity and the ten envelopers The seizure of views is of thirty forms exception made for the seizure of moral precepts and vows The nature of the seizure of moral precepts and vows is of six forms the seizure of moral precepts and vows divided as to realm and mode has six forms The nature of the seizure of the theory that there is a self is of thirtyeight forms ten forms of attachment ten forms of pride ten forms of ignorance and eight forms of perplexity In the realm of form and in the one of formlessness there are two envelopers lethargy and excitedness The envelopers are not differentiated as to realm or mode Because this has already been spoken of previously it is not spoken of here It is said that the nature of the impure influence sensual pleasure should be known as of fortyone forms The impure influence existence is of fiftytwo forms The impure influence ignorance is of fifteen forms Contaminants  The nature of the impure influence sensual pleasure is of fortyone forms five forms of attachment five forms of repugnance five forms of pride four forms of perplexity twelve views and the ten envelopers The nature of the impure influence existence is of fiftytwo forms ten forms of attachment ten forms of pride eight forms of perplexity and twentyfour views The nature of the impure influence ignorance is of fifteen forms These one hundred and eight defilements are said to be entanglements because of the meaning of entanglement because of the meaning of flowing they are said to be floods because of the meaning of seizing they are said to be seizures because of the meaning of impure influence they are said to be impure influences Question How are these kinds of defilement produced Answer  Because of noncognisance there is perplexity because of perplexity there is false view because of this false view all belief in a self arises when proceeding Because of noncognisance there first is no desire for frustration up to no desire for the path This is called ignorance Ts this frustration or no frustration up to Is this the path or not the path When proceeding this ignorance makes perplexity arise Because of perplexity one seeks for certainty When one achieves right effort right certainty arises and then there is frustration the origin cessation and the path With false effort false certainty arises and  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya then there is no frustration origin cessation or path If this is no frustration then it is the self When proceeding this false view makes belief in a self arise From this extreme view is produced adherence to moral precepts and vows and adherence to conceptual identification of moral precepts and vows After being certain regarding these adherence to particular views arises successively When there is this belief in a self and change garding the self is seen annihilation  is subsequently seen When what is similar  is seen to be successive permanence is seen When seeing onesided cleanliness this extreme view makes adherence to moral precepts and vows arise when proceeding When cleanliness it is the extreme this adherence to moral precepts and vows makes adherence to particular views arise when proceeding  The view of the self makes attachment arise The view of someone else produces repugnance Producing the view of a self is called pride Envelopers arise from the proceeding of contaminants From this view of the self defilement arises The view of someone else produces repugnance Producing the view of a self is pride This is production of attachment repugnance and pride from views tion Question What are these Answer Shamelessness and disregard lethargy regret selfishness envy excitedness sleepiness anger and hypocrisy these are the secondary afflictions that are envelopers The ten envelopers are the socalled shamelessness disregard lethargy regret selfishness envy excitedness sleepiness anger and hypocrisy Their characteristic marks have already been spoken of in the chapter Formations M These have contaminants as basis In Sanskrit basis is nisyanda The meaning of nisyanda is the word outcome Envelopers are the outcome of the contami nants just as koumiss flows from a bottle Question Which enveloper is with which contaminant as basis Answer Disregard lethargy and sleepiness these three are with ignorance as basis Excitedness selfishness and shamelessness arise from attachment to sensual pleasure Disregard lethargy and sleepiness these three are with ignorance as basis It should be known that disregard lethargy and sleepiness are with ignorance as basis  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question If these envelopers are with ignorance as basis are they associated with ignorance Answer If they are with ignorance as basis they exactly are associated with ignorance Sometimes that which is associated with ignorance is not with ignorance as basis the other seven envelopers Excitedness selfishness and shamelessness arise from attachment to sensual pleasure The envelopers excitedness selfishness and shamelessness are with attachment to sensual pleasure as basis Question If an enveloper is with attachment to sensual pleasure as basis is it exactly associated with it Answer Four sentences have to be made the enveloper selfishness associated and no basis disregard lethargy and sleepiness both basis and associated excitedness and shamelessness neither basis nor associated exception made for the above mentions ones  The enveloper hypocrisy is with two contaminants as basis Regret is caused by perplexity Anger and envy are with repugnance as basis This is what the Wise One has said The enveloper hypocrisy is with two contaminants as basis Sometimes it is said that the enveloper hypocrisy is with craving as basis because of the power of craving there is hypocrisy Some say that it is with ignorance as basis because of the power of noncognisance there is hypocrisy Regret is caused by perplexity The enveloper regret is Contaminants  with perplexity as basis Anger and envy are with repugnance as basis This is what the Wise one has said The enveloper anger and the enveloper envy are with repugnance as basis Question There are six of these impurities of defilement What is their basis Answer Of the socalled impurities of defilement violence and vengefulness are with repugnance as basis Violence and vengefulness are with repugnance as basis Deceit and arrogance depend on attachment to sensual pleasure This meaning should be known The impurities deceit and arrogance are with attachment to sensual pleasure as basis Craftiness arises with the socalled five false views as basis It should be known that what is said to be the fruit that depends on the adherence to particular views is spite  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Craftiness arises with the socalled five false views as basis The five views are the basis that produces craftiness because of being zealous Tt should be known that what is said to be the fruit that depends on the adherence to particular views is spite The impurity spite is with the adherence to particular views as basis Question Which enveloper is associated with which defilement  Answer  Together with every defilement lethargy and excitedness are spoken of Shamelessness is together with that which is bad The same is further true for disregard Together with every defilement lethargy and excitedness are spoken of These two envelopers are associated with every defilement Because every defiled awareness is not appeased excitedness is to be known When defilement is present and the mind is not patient lethargy is therefore to be known Although excitedness is not associated with excitedness and lethargy is not associated with lethargy because of the specific nature it is not spoken of because of scarceness c It should be known that the contaminants exactly are defilements Because these envelopers are together with every defilement they are with that which is bad and with that which is neutral in the five modes in the group of the six forms of consciousness and in the three realms Shamelessness is together with that which is bad These two envelopers are associated with every bad contaminant With every bad awareness that is present respect is destroyed and blameworthiness is to be feared That is why these envelopers are spoken of in the five modes and in the group of the six forms of consciousness  Regret abides in mental frustration It is to be abandoned through the spiritual path Sleepiness only abides in the one of the mind of the one of sexual passion The rest each are established specifically Regret abides in mental frustration Regret abides in the stage of the mind Because it is zealous because it is produced from being depressed because of being associated with depression and because of being included in unpleasant feeling it abides in the realm of sexual passion Question How is it abandoned Answer It is to be abandoned through the spiritual path Because of arising in active good conduct and misconduct it is to be abandoned through the spiritual path Sleepiness only abides in the one of the mind of the one of sexual passion Sleepiness abides in the stage of the mind of the realm of sexual passion At the moment of sleepiness all defilements proceed together That is why it is associated with every defilement of the realm of sexual passion The rest each are established specifically The other envelopers and secondary afflictions each are established spe Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya cifically The socalled anger hypocrisy selfishness and envy are not associated with another contaminant It should be known that exception made for ignorance also regret is established specifically because proceeding with other defilements is not its nature Question Why are only selfishness and envy established among the nine fetters Answer The socalled selfishness and envy are without companion and are free from a second That is why these two envelopers are established in the nine fetters The two envelopers selfishness and envy are without companion because they are produced from their specific power because they are absolutely bad they are free from a second That is why they are established among the nine fetters Lethargy and excitedness are not without companion because they are together with every defilement because they are bad and neutral they are not free from a second Because sleepiness also is associated with other contaminants it is not without companion because it is good bad and neutral it is not free from a second Although shamelessness and disregard are free from a second they are not without companion Although regret is without companion it is not free from a second because of being good and bad Although anger and hypocrisy both are without companion and free from a second there sometimes is the desire to let them be with the nature of a contaminant Contaminants  There are eight determined envelopers It should be known that when regret and sleepiness are good they are no envelopers because envelopers are absolutely defiled Question Why does attraction establish one fetter and two or three or six contaminants Answer Because the characteristic marks of one bond are achieved one fetter is established because of the stage of right concentration and the stage of being not concentrated two contaminants are spoken of because of the difference in realm three are spoken of because of the difference in basis six are spoken of  Question Why do three false views establish the fetter views and do two views establish the fetter adher Answer Because of the equality of name and because of the equality of substance Belief in a self extreme view and false view are feminine terms and are with the specific nature of eighteen contaminants that is why one fetter is established Fetter adherences is a masculine term Also this one is with the specific nature of eighteen contaminants that is why one fetter is established That is why it is spoken of in this way When bound to factors associated with views by means of the fetter attraction it is neither by the fetter views nor by that which is developed by a contaminant which is no view When knowledge of the origin has arisen and knowledge of cessation has not arisen yet what is to be abandoned through the vision of cessation and through the vision of the path is bound to the associated factors by means of the fetter attraction Adherence to partic Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya ular views and adherence to moral precepts and vows Because the fetter attraction is with an impure supporting object it is not by the fetter views because this pervasive fetter views is abandoned Although the fetter views of the specific mode is not abandoned they do not take it as supporting object because of having a pure supporting object because of the other class It is not so that the contaminant views is not developed because the five views are the contaminant views and three views are the fetter views The specific nature of the defilements has already been spoken of Their being associated with the faculties shall now be spoken of The contaminants that abide in the three realms are all associated with the faculty equanimity According to the stage the faculties and contaminants are associated up to material existence The contaminants that abide in the three realms are all associated with the faculty equanimity All contaminants of the three realms are associated with the faculty equaniity Because of following every defilement be cause of proceeding with contentedness with depression and with both defilements because all defilements are appeased everywhere If it were different there would be no being free from defilement That is why the faculty equanimity is acquired in the five modes in the group of the six forms of consciousness and in the three realms According to the stage the faculties and contaminants Contaminants  are associated up to material existence The faculty contentedness and the faculty satisfaction up to the brahmaworld These contaminants are associated with the faculty contentedness and with the faculty satisfaction The shining gods also have the faculty contentedness the contaminants in this stage are associated with the faculty contentedness The entirely magnificent gods have the faculty satisfaction in this stage the contaminants are associated with the faculty satisfaction The gods having great fruit have the one faculty equanimity these contaminants are only associated with the faculty equanimity Such a as attachment concerns the defilement contentedness repugnance and perplexity concern the defilement depression false view concerns both defilements The faculty equanimity is completely associated with them and proceeds together in one and the same supporting object   In the realm of sexual passion false view and ignorance are with satisfaction and with frustration Repugnance and perplexity are only The rest is absolutely with satisfaction  with frustration In the realm of sexual passion false view and ignorance are with satisfaction and with frustration When false view produces bad action then there is contentedness and with clean action there is depression Ignorance is associated with all faculties Repugnance and perplexity are only with frustration Perplexity in the realm of sexual passion is not with con Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya tentedness because there is no certainty That is why it is associated with unpleasant feeling In the first trance and in the second trance there is no nature of other faculties it is associated with the faculty contentedness Because the faculty contentedness of the realm of sexual passion is coarse beings produce that which they should not produce Just as poor persons often amuse themselves and subsequently produce those things they should not produce Because perplexity in the realm of sexual passion is subtle it is not associated with the faculty contentedness Because repugnance is produced when malice proceeds it is associated with unpleasant feeling The rest is absolutely with satisfaction Because the other defilement of the realm of sexual passion is produced when satisfaction proceeds it is associated with pleasant feeling  The mixed one is associated with two The one to be abandoned through vision is only in the one of the mind Defilement of the realm of sexual passion is said to be associated with all faculties The mixed one is associated with two Defilement to be abandoned through the spiritual path is called mixed It is associated with bodily feeling and with mental feeling When the group of the six forms of consciousness  it is associated with five faculties It is spoken of according to the meaning of that which is produced This faculty frustration and faculty satisfaction of the realm of sexual passion are with the group of five forms of consciousness the faculty contentContaminants  edness and the faculty depression are in the stage of the mind the faculty equanimity is with the group of the six forms of consciousness All bodily feeling is to be abandoned through the spiritual path The one to be abandoned through vision is only in the one of the mind Defilement to be abandoned through the path of vision abides in the stage of the mind Consciousness of the mind is associated with the faculties because it is not produced following a thing Defilement of the realm of sexual passion is said to be associated with all faculties This speaks of defilement of the realm of sexual passion That in higher stages is associated with faculties according to the stage  is also to be spoken of in this way Question With which faculty are the envelopers associated Answer Lethargy excitedness shamelessness and disregard are associated with the five faculties sleepiness is with three faculties exception made for the faculty satis faction and for the faculty frustration anger regret envy vengefulness violence and spite are with the faculty depression and with the faculty equanimity hypocrisy deceit and craftiness are with three faculties exception made for the faculty satisfaction and for the faculty frustration selfishness is with the faculty contentedness and with the faculty equanimity arrogance is vith three faculties exception made for the faculty frustration and for the faculty depression because arrogance is of the stage of the mind and because it proceeds with contentedness in the three realms  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question With how many forms of consciousness are the contaminants associated Answer  It should be known that attachment to sensual pleasure repugnance and delusion are together with six forms of consciousness In the one of sexual passion they are to be abandoned according to the path In the higher stages they follow that which is acquired It should be known that attachment to sensual pleasure repugnance and delusion are together with six forms of consciousness In the one of sexual passion they are to be abandoned through the spiritual path In the realm of sexual passion attachment repugnance and ignorance to be abandoned through the spiritual path are associated with the six forms of consciousness in the higher stages they follow that which is acquired In the realm of form and in the one of formlessness there is no repugnance Attachment and ignorance follow the group of the forms of consciousness in their form of existence and exactly are associated with them In the brahmaworld a group of four forms of consciousness can be acquired That which is insubstantial and pride are with the stage of the mind It should be known that these seven contaminants are with a specific nature a fruit and a person Contaminants  All in the realm of formlessness The contaminants of the realm of formlessness are to be abandoned through the path of vision and to be abandoned through the spiritual path That which is insubstantial and pride are with the stage of the mind Contaminants to be abandoned through the path of vision of the realm of sexual passion and of the one of form and pride abide in the stage of the mind Although the higher three trances are also with the stage of the mind these stages are not spoken of because of the differentiation of the realm Question How are contaminants to be known Answer It should be known that these seven contaminants are with a specific nature a fruit and aperson The contaminants are to be known because of three things a specific nature a fruit and a person A specific nature the contaminant attachment to sensual pleasure is as making great loyalty arise the contaminant repugnance is as bitter seed the contaminant attachment to existence is as the dress of an infant the contaminant pride is as an arrogant person the contaminant ignorance is as a pezson with delusion the contaminant views is as losing the way the contaminant perplexity is as doubting between two roads A fruit when the contaminant attachment to sensual pleasure is practised assiduously or much practised it makes one arise among such birds as mandarin ducks and starlings when the contaminant repugnance is practised assiduously or much practised it makes one arise among poisonous snakes when the contaminant attachment to existence is practised assiduously or much practised it makes  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya one arise in the realm of form or in the one of formlessness when the contaminant pride is practised assiduously or much practised it makes one arise among the lower ones And a person the contaminant attachment to sensual pleasure should be observed as such as Nanda the contaminant repugnance is as such as Angulimala the contaminant attachment to existence is as such as Ajita Aradakalama and Udraka Ramaputra the contaminant pride is as such as Manatthadda the contaminant ignorance is as such as Uruvilvakasyapa the contaminant views is as scs such as Sunaksatra the contaminant perplexity is as such as Mahakasyapa When one knows the contaminants with these three things then one can keep far from them the way one knows a dangerous road A complete defilement is a contaminant an incomplete defilement is an enveloper That is why envelopers do not establish a contaminant The same applies to the impurities of defilement Because of being supplied with these five things something is called a complete defilement The five things are fetters bonds contaminants secondary afflictions and envelopers When these one by one are not supplied something is called an incomplete defilement The establishment of defilement has already been spoken of The annihilation of defilement shall now be spoken of Contaminants   The annihilation of defilement at one moment has been spoken of by the Awakened One In this way also disjunction is not to be achieved at one moment The annihilation of defilement at one moment has been spoken of by the Awakened One This defilement is to be abandoned suddenly and not gradually at the moment the antidote belonging to the same category is produced and when patience regarding the law in relation to frustration is produced ten contaminants to be abandoned through the vision of frustration of the realm of sexual passion are abandoned suddenly With subsequent patience in relation to frustration eighteen contaminants of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness are abandoned suddenly The same applies up to the sudden abandonment of fourteen contaminants with subsequent patience in relation to the path The four excessiveexcessive contaminants are abandoned suddenly with the production of the minorminor noble path of the spiritual path up to the four minorminor contaminants are abandoned suddenly with the production of the excessiveexcessive noble path In this way it is for all stages Question It is with the path of vision that abandoning has to be at one moment Because nine forms of fetters are abandoned with one kind of path and with the ones to be broken by the spiritual path nine forms of fetters are abandoned with nine kinds of path Answer To be abandoned through the spiritual path is that when this form of antidote is produced it exactly is sudden  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya abandonment of this form it is not gradually because of being abandoned already previously In this way also disjunction is not to be achieved at one moment This disjunction is to be achieved at different moments of that which is to be abandoned through vision of the truth of frustration of the realm of sexual passion and of that which is to be abandoned through the vision of frustration through the one of the origin and through the one of cessation of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness it is to be achieved at six moments at the moment of the antidote belonging to the same category at the moment of the four fruits of ramanaship  and at the moment of growing of faculties Of that which is to be abandoned through the vision of the path of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness it is to be achieved at five moments exception made for the antidote belonging to the same category because subsequent knowledge in relation to the path Of the five forms to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the realm of sexual passion it is with five moments exception made for the fruit of srotadpannaship of three forms it is with four moments of the minorminor kind it is with three moments Of the seven stages of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness and of the eight kinds of the stage of neitheridentificationnornonidentification it is with three moments exception made for the first three fruits of sramanaship Of the minorminor kind it is with two moments the fruit of arhatship and growing of faculties Question How is defilement abandoned Contaminants  Answer When awaking in relation to the supporting object It is also said o be with abandoning of the supporting object It is also said to be with genesis of antidote and further with destruction of this supporting object Four things abandon defilement thorough knowledge of the supporting object abandoning of the supporting object genesis of antidote and destruction of the supporting object Thorough knowledge of the supporting object is the supporting object of the specific stage to be abandoned through the vision of frustration and through the vision of the origin and the pure supporting object Abandoning of the supporting object is the impure supporting object to be abandoned through the vision of cessation and through the vision of the path Genesis of antidote concerns what is to be abandoned through the spiritual path Destruction of the supporting object is when with another realm as supporting object Furthermore there are five things that abandon defilement the cause that has disappeared eternally acquisition of annihilation moving in the basis thorough knowledge of the supporting object and genesis of antidote The establishment of the reasons for annihilation of defilement has already been spoken of Full overcoming comprehension shall now be spoken of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  The Noble has been Speaking of four full overcoming comprehensions for disjunction in the realm of sexual passion For being free from the realm of form and Srom the one of formlessness five full overcoming comprehensions should be known There are nine full overcoming comprehension for abandoning defilement of the realm of sexual passion four full overcoming comprehensions are established for abandoning defilement of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness five full overcoming comprehensions are established Although knowledge knows annihilation is the fruit of knowledge and that is why it is said to be full overcoming comprehension just as the fruit of action is also called action  Destruction of defilement through JSrustration and through the origin is generally said to be one full overcoming comprehension What is to be abandoned through cessation and through the path each is one As for the one of sexual passion thre are also three for the higher ones For destruction of the defilement to be abandoned through the vision of frustration and through the vision of the crigin of the realm of sexual passion one full overcoming comprehension is established what is to be abandoned through the vision of cessation is the second what is to be abandoned through the vision of the path is the third As for the realm of sexual passion for that which is to be abandoned through the vision of frustration and through the Contaminants  vision of the origin of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness also one is established what is to be aban doned through the vision of cessation is the second what is to be abandoned through the vision of the path is the third This shall be spoken of elaborately later in this chapter It should be known that Sor what is to be abandoned through the spiritual path the annihilation is realm by realm said to be one Three forms of annihilation are a Sruit of knowledge The rest are said to be a fruit of patience What is to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the realm of sexual passion is one full overcoming comprehension what is to be abandoned in the realm of form is the second what is to be abandoned in the realm of formlessness is the third It should be known that these are a fruit of knowledge Question Why is it that what is to be abandoned through the path of vision of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness is established as one full overcoming comprehension and that what is to be abandoned through the spiritual path is established as two Answer Because what is to be abandoned through the path of vision is with the same antidote and because for what is to be abandoned through the spiritual path it is not the same Question What are the other full overcoming comprehensions a fruit of The rest are said to be a fruit of patience What is to be abandoned through the path of vision is with six full overcoming comprehensions in total and is said to be a fruit of patience because patience is the antidote That what is to be abandoned through the path of vision is all stated to be a fruit of patience but is no full overcoming comprehension is not right because patience belongs to the adjacent of knowledge and because it has one and the same fruit as knowledge That is why what is to be abandoned through the path of vision and through the spiritual path both acquire to be called fruit of knowledge That full overcoming comprehension is a fruit of knowledge has already been said Stages paths knowledge of the law or subsequent knowledge or fruit of the same class shall now be spoken of The first stage is said to be with all The trances are with five and further also with eight The immaterial ones are said to be with one fruit The same is true for the fruit of the adjacent one b The first stage is said to be with all In the pretrance all nine full overcoming comprehensions are supplied as fruit because of being the antidote for the three realms The trances are with five and further also with eight The Abhidharmikas say that the fundamental trances are with five full overcoming comprehensions as fruit annihilation of defilement of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness as has been said previously The venerable Ghosaka says that there are eight excepContaminants  tion made for the full overcoming comprehension of destruction of the five fetters of the lower world because of being a fruit of the pretrance He desires that what is to be abandoned through the vision of the truth of the realm of sexual passion is a fruit of trance The intermediate trance is as has been said with the trances The immaterial ones are said to be with one fruit Three immaterial meditative attainments are said to be with one full overcoming comprehension as fruit exhaustion of all fetters The same is true for the fruit of the adjacent one being without attachment to matter Although what is to be abandoned through the spiritual path of four stages establishes a full overcoming comprehension the destruction of the minorminor form of the fourth trance achieves to be called a full overcoming comprehension That is why the fruit of the adjacent one of the sphere of unlimited space is spoken of Two are a Sruit of the worldly path The noble one is with nine Knowledge of the law is with three Subsequent knowledge is said to be with two These classes are with six or five as Sruit Two are a fruit of the worldly path The destruction of the five fetters of the lower world and being without attachment to matter are a fruit of the worldly path because noble persons abandon the fetters of two realms by means of the worldly path The noble one is with nine All nine full overcoming  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya comprehensions are a fruit of the noble path because the noble path cures every defilement Knowledge of the law is with three Three full overcoming comprehensions are a fruit of knowledge of the law destruction of the five fetters of the lower world being without attachment to matter and exhaustion of all fetters because of abandoning the fetters of the three realms with knowledge of the law of the spiritual path Two full overcoming comprehensions are a fruit of subsequent knowledge being without attachment to matter and exhaustion of all fetters because they are the fruit of the spiritual path of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness These classes are with six or five as fruit The class of knowledge of the law has six full overcoming comprehensions as fruit the three of the ones to be abandoned through the path of vision of the realm of sexual passion and the previously mentioned three fruits of knowledge of the law The class of subsequent knowledge is with five full overcoming comprehensions as fruit the three of the ones to be abandoned through the path of vision of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness and the previously mentioned two fruits of subsequent knowledge Question Who accomplishes how many full overcoming comprehension Answer Sometimes there are noble persons who have not accomplished full overcoming comprehensions yet Sometimes there is accomplishment of one Contaminants  two three four five and six In the period of time of five awarenesses of the path of vision no full overcoming comprehension is accomplished knowledge of the law in relation to the origin and subsequent patience in relation to the origin are with one subsequent knowledge in relation to the origin and patience regarding the law in relation to cessation are with two knowledge of the law in relation to cessation and subsequent patience in relation to cessation are with three subsequent knowledge in relation to cessation and patience regarding the law in relation to the path are with four knowledge of the law in relation to the path and subsequent patience in relation to the path are with five is with six the one who goes to the fruit of sakrdagaminship if the one with double nonattachment arises free from beings is as has been said previously if it concerns the next direction six are accomplished The fruit of sakydagaminship is also with six The one who goes to the fruit of andgaminship if the one who is without attachment to sensual pleasure arises free from beings is as has been said previously If it concerns the next direction six are accomplished Acquisition of the fruit of anagaminship is with one destruction of the fetters of the lower world the one who goes to the fruit of arhatship is with one when not yet without attachment to matter with two when without attachment to matter The fruit of arhatship is with one the full overcoming comprehension of exhaustion of all fetters Question Who abandons how many full overcoming com Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya prehension Answer  One two five or six are abandoned Acquisition is just as abandoning With acquisition of a fruit and when surpassing a realm in these two conditions full overcoming comprehensions are accumulated One two five or six are abandoned Falling back from the fruit of arhatship is abandoning one full overcoming comprehension falling back for the envelopers of the realm of form by the anagamin who is without attachment to matter is abandoning one falling back for the envelopers of the realm of sexual passion by the one who is not without attachment to matter yet is abandoning one falling back for the envelopers of the realm of sexual passion by the one with the fruit of anagaminship who is without attachment to matter is abandoning two acquisition of the fruit of arhatship with the anagamin who has surpassed being without attachment to sensual pleasure it is abandoning five subsequently six are abandoned Question Who acquires how many full overcoming comprehension Answer Acquisition is just as abandoning Sometimes there is acquisition of one full overcoming comprehension at the sixth the eighth the tenth the twelfth and the fourteenth up to the awareness of subsequent knowledge in relation to the path of the path of vision there is one by one acquisition of one The successive fruit of anagaminship  acquires one being without attachment to matter  The fruit of arhatship is with one exhaustion of all fetters  acquisition of two is when falling back for the envelopers of the realm of formlessness by the arhat acquisition of six is falling back for the envelopers of the realm of sexual passion by the arhat or by the anagamin There is no acquisition of five That is why this is not in the scriptural texts Question In which condition are these full overcoming comprehensions accumulated Answer These full overcoming comprehensions are accumulated in two conditions the fruit of anGgdminship and the fruit or arhatship because in these conditions with acquisition of a fruit there exactly is surpassing a realm That is why at the moment of destruction of the fetters of the lower world and of the ones of the higher world there is acquisition of genesis of subsequent knowledge in relation to the path Six forms of annihilation are although with acquisition of a fruit not with surpassing a realm although being without attachment to matter is with surpassing a reali it is not with acquisition of a fruit the other ones neither are with surpassing a realm nor with acquisition of a fruit That is why all these conditions of full overcoming comprehension are not called accumulation The establishment of the specific nature the fruit the accomplishment the abandoning the acquisition and the  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya accumulation have already been spoken of By destruction of two causes by disjunction and when surpassing a realm by acquisition regarding acquisition of what is pure and by the partially summit of existence Because of four reasons or five this annihilation acquires the name full overcoming comprehension The path of vision is with four reasons although what is with what is to be abandoned through the vision of frustration as cause is destroyed it is not so for what is to be abandoned through the vision of the origin Because of this meaning it is not detached from both fetters Although there is acquisition of liberation by acquisition of what is pure it is because there is no partially summit of existence yet In this way one reason is combined and three reasons are not combined Although arising of subsequent knowledge in relation to frustration and patience regarding the law in relation to the origin are with acquisition of liberation by acquisition of what is pure and with the partially summit of existence the other two causes are not supplied That is why in this condition no full overcoming comprehension is established Arising of knowledge of the law in relation Contaminants  to the origin is with destruction of both causes the previous destruction of what is to be abandoned through the vision of frustration as cause and the present destruction of what is to be abandoned through the vision of the origin as cause It should be known that also this is detached from both fetters and with acquisition of liberation by acquisition of what is pure At the moment of arising of subsequent knowledge in relation to frustration there already is the partially summit of existence That is why in this condition a full overcoming comprehension is established Arising of subsequent knowledge in relation to the origin is supplied with all reasons That is why in this condition a full overcoming comprehension is established In this way knowledge of the law in relation to cessation is the third subsequent knowledge in relation to cessation is the fourth knowledge of the law in relation to the path is the fifth and subsequent knowledge in relation to the path is the sixth This is said to concern the path vision What is to be abandoned through the spiritual path is with five reasons the first four and eternal abandonment of the realm these five The nine forms of defilement to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the realm of sexual passion proceed successively The same applies up to the stage of neitheridentificationnornonidentification One form of annihilation of the realm of sexual passion up to eight forms are supplied with two reasons acquisition of liberation by acquisition of what is pure and the partially summit of existence three reasons are not supplied The ninth form of abandoning is supplied with the five reasons  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya One form of annihilation up to eight forms of annihilation of the first trance are only supplied with two reasons as has been said previously The ninth form of annihilation is supplied with four reasons one reason is not supplied surpassing a realm The same applies to the second and to the third trance and to three immaterial ones Up to eight forms of annihilation of the stage of the fourth trance only two reasons are supplied The ninth form of annihilation is supplied with the five reasons That is why in this condition a full overcoming comprehension is established The same applies to neitheridentificationnornonidentification Because of this meaning the worldlings with nonattachment do not establish a full overcoming comprehension because of neither being with acquisition of liberation by acquisition of what is pure nor with the partially summit of existence Full overcoming comprehension has already been spoken of The three forms of object and five forms of genesis of craving shall now be spoken of In being together and not being together with an agreeable object there is a twofold genesis of craving The same is true for the two of disagreeable objects One is equanimity In being together and not being together with an agreeable object there is a twofold genesis of craving Agree able is a name for an object that is to be deContaminants  sired When this object is acquired one is not free from genesis of craving How does one let the self not be free from these things If one has not acquired them yet one acquires the conceptual identification of genesis of craving How are they to be acquired The same is true for the two of disagreeable objects Disagreeable is a name for an object that is not to be desired Also this is with a twofold genesis of craving when together there is the conceptual identification of genesis of craving for being free not together there is the conceptual identification of genesis of craving for no acquisition  One is equanimity Equanimity is a name for an object that neither is to be desired nor not to be desired It is being absolutely with ignorance in relation to the genesis of craving Question Are the contaminants associated with awarenesses or dissociated  That why there is perplexity is that two masters explain it in a different way the vibhajyavadins want them to be dissociated and the yuktavadins want them to be associated In relation to this there is perplexity Answer They are associated  Contaminants defile awarenesses They are obstruction and would not be contrary to the clean ones Since good awarenesses can be acquired it are no dissociated contaminants they are their supporting object and are associated If contaminants were dissociated from awarenesses they should not defile awarenesses as supporting object because would be without supporting object All factors dissociated from awarenesses are without supporting object and are also dissociated because they are no associated factors Awarenesses are what is defiled by contaminants as has been said Because attachment to sensual pleasure defiles awarenesses awarenesses are not liberated Because of this saying it is to be known that contaminants are associated with awarenesses They are obstruction If contaminants were dissociated from awarenesses they would be no obstruction at the moment the path arises because they were not contrary to the awarenesses being successive Because they are obstruction they are not dissociated Not contrary to the clean ones If contaminants were dissociated from awarenesses they would not be contrary to good awarenesses because when simultaneously arising together with good awarenesses no mistake would be made Because of making a mistake they are therefore not dissociated Furthermore Since geod awarenesses can be acquired Because they are contrary to qualities they are called contaminants If contaminants were dissociated from awarenesses good awarenesses would be without the condition of birth because proceed permanently Because good awarenesses arise it should be known they are not dissociated Furthermore because of what has been said about such characteristic marks as being coloured What is the conContaminants  taminant attachment The characteristic marks of being coloured What is the contaminant repugnance A defilement among the accompanying mental factors What is the contaminant pride Production of accompanying mental factors Because when compared in this way contaminants therefore are not dissociated from awarenesses It is not right that when envelopers are contrary to good awarenesses it is not so for contaminants Because of acquisition of the characteristic marks of the contaminant Because of the enveloper attachment to sensual pleas e there is the name enveloper attachment to sensual pleasure Compared in this way no different causes are spoken of they are all attachment to sensual pleasure Stating that while the enveloper is associated the contaminant is dissociated is only a statement Never are any different reasons spoken of When stating that envelopers are the seed for contaminants what is said is not settled Because while the cause is dissociated the fruit would be associated there is a mistake That is why  contaminants are not dissociated Heart of Scholasticism with Miscellaneous Additions volume four se ielneaw gaivacqitosas gneiss ae ty nonoubotl Chapter Five Nobility Composed by the venerable Dharmatrata Translated by the Indian Tripitaka Samghavarman of the Sung and others Defilement has already been spoken of  The first is called the beginner The next one is the one who mastered It should be known that the one having passed the attention is the third kind The threefold application is the beginner the one who mastered and the one having passed the attention The beginner is the one who proceeds in the repulsive It means that the part of attention through resolve of the object has not been acquired yet The one who mastered is the one who proceeds in the condition of accepting mindfulness on the specific characteristic marks It means that the roots cf merit that are connected to penetration have not been acquired yet Higher than this the one having passed the attention should be known because higher than this there is the path of the one vehicle  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Furthermore also contemplation of the repulsive is with a threefold application The one who is with the attention through resolve when removing skin blood and flesh starting from the toes up to the top is called the beginner Making the conceptual identification  not being made arise regarding this skeleton generally encloses the four elements Moreover when one is with the conceptual identification not being made while one observes the skeleton one gradually confronts oneself with these bones and when a great wind blows they are dispersed and are as a heap of snow This is called the one who has mastered having  observed the skeleton and is upright and appeased regarding that which is taken as supporting object and observe it as one kind of matter This is called the one having passed the attention In this way it is up to the concise object It should be known that the roots of merit increase gradually It should be known that the same applies to all roots of merit regarding all other forms of application The application has already been spoken of The rest shall now be spoken of For the one of preparation the nobles who are truly supplied with that which is right and who keep far from defilement such as this because of fea should listen well Such Either mode or preparation or difference Defilement successively spoken of and manifested Defilement Because of heating Although one is free from everything that is impure the fault of defilement still is as poisoned food That is why it is said that they are free Defilement is the fundament of all fear a production of manifold actions and manifold forms of birth Keeps far from them Cessation that is calculated cessation The nobles The group fixed in truth the seven persons and the true worldlings Truly supplied with that which is right Abiding in the true path For the one of preparation one should listen well In relation to the path of preparation one should listen with undivided attention The preparation is the preparation of all good factors formations that lead to liberation because the world suppressed by the three forms of frustration cannot be wakeful one longs for it that concentration is developed  Begin with concentrating the mind bound to the parts of the own body Wishing to bind it to the footing of consciousness In order to destroy the enemy of wisdom Begin The parts of the own body A place of the own body either between the eyebrows or the base of the  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya nose or the toes Bound to Fixed in a supporting object so that it is not dispersed What is fixed Wisdom produced through the power of the own mind that is concentrated Question Answer Wishing to bind it to the footing of consciousness Because the mind moves and does not abide one has to bind it to one supporting object It is because of undivided attention that one knows the highest truth without disturbance Question Why binding it to one supporting object Answer In order to destroy the enemy of wisdom The enemy of wisdom is defilement This has to be abandoned Although one observes someone elses body it is as observing a corpse a scriptural text says this because that is a remote cause and this is said to concern the observation of a near cause the b three gates to transgression follow the observation of the part of the body skeleton following the observation of a corpse only the one gate to transgression which is the repulsive follows The three gates to transgression are contemplation of the repulsive mindfulness on breathing in and breathing out and development of analysis of the elements For attachment to sensual pleasure contemplation of the repulsive is a transgression for initial thought and sustained thought mindfulness on breathing in and breathing out is a transgression for conduct of views development of analysis of the elements is a transgression Contemplation of the repulsive and mindfulness on breathing in and breathing out shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Scriptural Texts Development of analysis of the elemerts shall now be spoken of Because the unreasoned attention of the fool obstructs the eye of wisdom one does not observe the true characteristic of the chain of dependent origination The unlimited factors sown by the defilement of the former action have accumulated to the five aggregates and have produced a collection of conceptual identifications Because of bewilderment one is bound to such false views as counting on such as what has been made by a self among what is made by the chain of dependent origination Sometimes one is close to good company when developing  one acquires to hear the right doctrine and after right conceptualising is produced one can observe the manifold specific natures the manifold actions and the manifold characteristic marks of this body regarding the development of analysis of the elements of this body Because of such six elements as earth this element earth is moistened by the element water  they are not free from one another because the element water is held by the element earth it is not dispersed because the element fire makes mature it is not to be destroyed by water because the element wind moves accumulation is achieved because the element space is empty such as nutriment Moreover when this body is observed from top to toe  Samyuktabhidharmahydaya many kinds of repulsive and dirt are complete and one understands that this matter is as when a fierce wind disperses a heap of sand it is understood that the different parts that before and after are successive are as immaterial factors Observed in this way one acquires the seed of the gate of liberation which is emptiness  When being with aversion regarding this transmigration there is no satisfaction and one acquires the seed of the gate of liberation which is aimlessness When regarding transmigration there already is no satisfaction and one goes in the right direction of nirvana one acquires the seed of the gate of liberation which is signlessness When acquiring the conceptual identification not being made regarding this there already is wakefulness and one observes the destruction of everything that is conditioned This is called fulfilment of the development of analysis of the elements Question As it is already observed in this way how is it further Answer  With this preparation one is certain regarding the true characteristic marks of the body Also feeling and specific awarenesses and factors are to be observed in this way When the devotee already abides in one by one contemplation of the repulsive mindfulness on breathing in and breathing out and development of analysis of the elements body feeling awarenesses and factors each are truly observed  Nobility  True What is not overturned Characteristic marks The characteristic mark matter is the specific characteristic mark of the body the four elements and what they form the characteristic mark subsequent wakefulness is the specific characteristic mark of feeling the characteristic mark consciousness is the specific characteristic mark of awarenesses with the application of mindfulness on factors there are manifold factors that each have their manifold different characteristic marks subsequent knowledge is the characteristic mark of conceystual identification making is the characteristic mark of thinking It is to be compared in this way The general characteristic marks shall be spoken of later Question  they should be said to be one differentiated as to impure and pure they should be said to be two differentiated as to minor middle and excessive they should be said to be three exactly when differentiating these as to impure and pure they should be said to be six differentiated as to impure and pure of such as the one of the body they should be said to be eight differentiated as to the nine classes they should be said to be nine differentiated as to such as the one of the body and inward outward or inward and outward they should be said to be twelve differentiated as to impure and pure of the nine classes they should be said to be eighteen differentiated as to impure and pure of minor middle and excessive of such as the one of the body they should  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya be said to be twentyfour differentiated as to inward outward inward and outward aversion no satisfaction and understanding of such as the one of the body they should be said to be thirtysix differentiated as to impure and pure of the nine classes of such as the one of the body they should be said to be seventytwo Why are four applications of mindfulness spoken of Answer Because the four perverted views the four forms of nutriment the four abodes of consciousness and the aggregates are cured by the four forms of spiritual practice four forms of subsequently developed factors are spoken of Because of curing the overturned conceptual identification of what is unclean as clean the application of mindfulness on the body is spoken of because of curing the overturned conceptual identification of frustration as satisfaction the application of mindfulness on feeling is spoken of because of curing the overturned conceptual identification of what is impermanent as permanent the application of mindfulness on awarenesses js spoken of because of curing the overturned conceptual identification of what is selfless as the self the application of mindfulness on factors is spoken of In this way the other forms are spoken of according to what is proper Question How are these applications of mindfulness fulfilled Answer Because of two reasons they are fulfilled breaking the objects and accumulation of the roots of merit Breaking the objects is breaking the objects by means of   atoms and ksanas according to their meaning acNobility  cumulation of the roots of merit is middle ones when depending on minor roots of merit and excessive ones when depending on middle ones This is called fulfilment Question Why is the application of mindfulness on the body spoken of first and so up to the application of mindfulness on factors Answer Because of being conformable to their production The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of three forms of being conformable being conformable to production being conformable to instruction and being conformable to higher realisation Being conformable to production is that the one who develops the applications of mindfulness the trances and the immaterial ones  first produces the application of mindfulness on the body and produces the application of mindfulness on factors last That is why the Worldhonoured One has been speaking of the application of mindfulness on the body first up to the application of mindfulness on factors It should be known that the same applies to the trances and to the immaterial ones Being conformable to instruction is that with respect to right abandoning  the footings of supernatural power faculties the powers and the members of enlightenment and the ones of the path the four forms of right abandoning because change is spoken of effort lets evil and bad factors that have already arisen be abandoned up to lets good factors that have already arisen abide through effort In this way it is to be spoken of elaborately It is because of what is done that such right abandoning is said to be the four forms of right abandoning not because of nature  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Being conformable to higher realisation is spoken of because the one who develops the noble truths first enters higher realisation of frustration That is why it is spoken of first In this way it is to be spoken of elaborately Question  Why does the devotee produce the application of mindfulness on the body first up to the application of mindfulness on factors Answer Because of being coarse Which one of the five aggregates is coarse The four elements and what is formed by them That is why it is observed first Although feeling is no matter it is spoken of successively because it proceeds in relation to that which is coarse feeling of such as a hand and a foot proceed subsequently Although the aggregates conceptual identification and conditioning factors are coarse and are no consciousness they are combined with nirvana and are the most subtle because of nominal designation of the application of mindfulness on factors That is why awarenesses are observed first and factors are observed later Although everything is a factor this one is fulfilled in relation to the conceptual identification in relation to factors and that is why it is established Of how many forms is the application of mindfulness Nobility  Answer  The application of mindfulness is said to be threefold by means of the specific nature by means of connection and it is also said to be called by means of the supporting object The same is true for such wisdom as the one through learning The application of mindfulness is said to be threefold by means of the specific nature by means of connection and it is also said to be called by means of the supporting object The threefold application of mindfulness is the application of mindfulness by means of the specific nature the application of mindfulness by means of connection and the ap Bp yeation of mindfulness by means of the supporting object The application of mindfulness by means of the specific nature is said to be wisdom that is not overturned As has been said concerning that which follows contemplation of the body mindfulness because of not forgetting the offered supporting object Because the fault of the specific nature is excluded an application of mindfulness is spoken of The application of mindfulness by means of connection is the factor that has one fruit with right wisdom As the Worldhonoured One has said Bhiksu the collection of good factors is the four applications of mindfulness This is right speech Bhiksu all  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya factors are said to be the four applications of mindfulness This is right speech Because of including the totality and because of the concise supporting object only the application of mindfulness by means of connection abandons defilement Although the application of mindfulness by means of the specific nature is with a concise supporting object it does not abandon defilement because of not being completely supplied Although the application of mindfulness by means of the supporting object includes the totality it does not abandon defilement because the object is generally dispersed it is the path of the concise object that abandons defilement Question Are only these applications of mindfulness threefold or does this also apply to something else Answer The same is true for such wisdom as the one through learning Something else is also threefold the one through learning the one through reasoning and the one through personal realisation receiving the scriptural texts Vinaya and Abhidharma from an instructor through reasoning is either being produced from thinking as substratum or free from thinking through personal realisation is absolutely being produced free from names As the three persons who apply themselves to floating one is in the beginning of the application the second is halfway in the application and the third has already applied himself well The one who is in the beginning of the application is close to the bank the one who is halfway in the application sometimes is close and sometimes free from  Nobility  the bank the one who has already applied himself well is free from the bank The first person is to be compared with wisdom through learning the second is to be compared with wisdom through reasoning the third is to be compared with wisdom through personal realisation Wisdom through personal realisation can abandon defilement because of being free from names eternally and because of right concentration It is not right that two forms are nonsensical Why Because they lead to wisdom through personal realisation Wisdom through personal realisation is supplied with the four forms of application of mindfulness the one on the body the one on feeling the one on awarenesses and the one on factors Only this application of mindfulness on factors abandons defilement because it is the only one with a mingled supporting object  and because of substantial objects Because of producing the application of mindfulness on factors also they  are not nonsensical The application of mindfulness on factors is twofold with mingled supporting object and with unmingled supporting object When wisdom takes matter as supporting object it is the application of mindfulness on the body when feeling is taken as supporting object it is the application of mindfulness on feeling when awarenesses are taken as supporting object it is the application of mindfulness on awarenesses when conceptual identification conditioning factors and what is unconditioned are taken as supporting object it is the application of mindfulness on factors with unmingled supporting object The other one shall now be spoken of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  When entering the general observation of factors one achieves the true characteristic marks of factors These four are impermanence emptiness selfless and dissatisfaction When entering the general observation of factors one achieves the true characteristic marks of factors When the devotee enters the application of mindfulness on factors with unmingled supporting object he develops the applications of mindfulness one by one After he has observed the specific characteristic marks and the general characteristic marks of all factors separately he enters the application of mindfulness on factors with mingled supporting object the application of mindfulness on matter and feeling as supporting object on matter and conceptual identification as supporting object on matter and conditioning factors as supporting object on matter and consciousness as supporting object in this way three four and five aggregates as supporting object This application of mindfulness on factors settles every application of mindfulness on the body on feeling on awarenesses and on factors How is the one wakefulness as the general observation measured These four are impermanence emptiness selfless and  dissatisfaction Because of such aspects as impermanence there is a general observation of all impure factors Because these disappear instant after instant they are impermanent because they are free from such as permanence they are empty because they are not selfwilled they are selfless because Nobility  they are oppressed by reality there is frustration From this there is that which is called warmth It arises from wakefulness in relation to factors The sixteen aspects are produced One understands the four noble truths From this there is that which is called warmth It arises from wakefulness in relation to factors In relation to the application of mindfulness on factors with mingled supporting object the devotee successively makes the root of merit called warmth Question With how many aspects is it and what is the object Answer The sixteen aspects are produced Oneunderstands the four noble truths That factor warmth proceeds in the sixteen aspects  of such truths as the one of frustration the four aspects of the truth of frustration up to the four aspects of the truth of the path The meaning of aspect shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Knowledge  When this factor warmth arises taking three truths as supporting object the application of mindfulness on factors is present and the future four are developed If one aspect is present the future four are developed It concerns what is homogeneous and not what is not homogeneous When taking the truth of cessation as supporting object the application of mindfulness on factors is present When one develops it it exactly is its future that is developed It is not when primarily being free from the aggregates that observation is acquired It is development with the path that takes the aggregates as supporting object If  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya one aspect is present the future four are developed When there is increase taking three truths as supporting object it is so that concerning the four applications of mindfulness the applications of mindfulness are one by one present and the future four are developed If one aspect is present the future sixteen are developed When there is increase taking the truth of cessation as supporting object the application of mindfulness on factors is present and the future four are developed If one aspect is present the future sixteen are developed when the roots of merit that are not yet perfectioned are developed the roots of merit with perfectioning of the aspects that are homogeneous are developed The factors that proceed subsequently are with the nature of the five aggregates because warmth makes the fire of noble knowledge arise Because warmth is the seed the factor warmth is spoken of  After this factor has been perfectioned summit and patience arise The acquisition of the highest worldly factor depends on one ksana After this factor has been perfectioned summit and patience arise When right effort and right mindfulness of the devotee have been perfectioned and good action that is conformable achieves to be supplied the factor warmth therefore achieves to be perfectioned The root of merit that arises successively is called summit It takes the four noble truths as supporting object and proceeds in the Nobility  sixteen aspects When this factor summit takes the four noble truths as supporting object the application of mindfulness on factors is present when there is perfectioning taking the truth of cessation as supporting object and the future four are developed If one aspect is present the future sixteen are developed When there is perfectioning taking three truths as supporting object the four applications of mindfulness are one by one present and the future four are developed If one aspect is present the future sixteen are developed Also these roots of merit are with the nature of wisdom the factors that proceed subsequently are with the nature of the five aggregates Because the factor summit abides higher than warmth it is called summit because it is weaker than patience it is called lower Sometimes the Worldhonoured One said it is faith as it was said to be agreement to all young bhiksus Falling back from the summit is called falling back from the summit Also warmth should have falling but it is not spoken of Falling from the summit is because of having much defame There are three conditions that produce great defame and that are as losing something very precious falling back from nonattachment of neitheridentificationnornonidentification from being without the desire of the realm of sexual passion and from the factor summit The nature of not being accomplished is called falling back When there is increase when this devotee accomplishes the root of merit summit regarding this right effort patience that is conformable to the truths arises It takes the four noble truths as supporting object and proceeds in the sixteen aspects If there is increase with primary patience the  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya application of mindfulness on factors is present and the future four are developed If one aspect is present the future sixteen are developed Patience is being patient regarding the wish for these four noble truths It is not right that warmth and summit are also patient because patience is not with falling back because it is contrary to woeful courses and because it is near to the noble path That is why patience that is conformable to the truths is spoken of and no warmth or summit Question Which root of merit does arise with increase of patience Answer The acquisition of the highest worldly factor depends on one ksana When excessive patience as condition as direct antecedent arises that which is achieved by the worldling is the most superior root of merit called highest worldly factor Also this one is with the nature of the five aggregates Because of being impure it is called worldly because of being superior to such as warmth it is said to be higher This also is the highest quality to be developed by the worldling because belonging to one ksana it does not abide and because of being similar to the path of vision because it is successively to warmth summit and patience Some say that since the development of wisdom arises successively to the application of mindfulness that observes factors generally it are roots of merit that are connected to penetration of worldly formations Here nine classes are established minorminor minormiddle and minorexcessive are called factor warmth middleminor and middlemiddle are called factor summit middleexcessive excessiveminor and excessiveNobility  middle are called factor patience excessiveexcessive is called highest worldly factor When such as the impermanence of aggregates are observed the root of merit is called factor warmth when the quality of the three treasures is observed it is called factor summit understanding the noble truths is called factor patience the noble path in succession to the noble path of the observation of frustration is called highest worldly factor After the factor warmth has been acquired there is abandoning when falling back abandoning at death and abandoning when surpassing a realm also when pro ducing proximate action when cutting away the roots of  merit and when arising in woeful courses Because of this merit as supporting object one wants to achieve nirvana The same applies to falling back from the factor summit only exception made for cutting away the roots of merit Patience is without falling back There is abandoning at death and abandoning when surpassing a realm not when doing proximate action not when cutting away the roots of merit and not when falling in woeful courses because of the great power of patience The power of patience is as the king of lions that keeps wild animals at a distance Also uncalculated cessation of all wicked awarenesses is as the abode of a great king and as the smoothness of awarenesses of misconduct of humans and gods Question What is the supporting object of the highest worldly factor and with how many aspects is it Answer  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  Minor frustration has four aspects It is said to include and depend on six stages The same applies to the factor patience According to some the rest depend on seven Minor frustration has four aspects Frustration of the realm of sexual passion is said to be minor It is that which the highest worldly factor takes as supporting object It only proceeds in the aspects impermanence frustration emptiness and without self because of being similar to the path of vision There is a twofold application conduct of craving and conduct of views There are two forms of conduct of craving conduct of selfconceit and increase of sloth Also conduct of views is twofold being attached to a self and to what belongs to a self Selfconceit is the development of the highest worldly factor with the aspect impermanence the increase of sloth is its development with the aspect frustration being attached to the aspect of a self is its development with the aspect without self being attached to what belongs to a self is its development with the aspect emptiness Question In how many stages  is it included Answer It is said to include and depend on six stages The pretrance the intermediate one and the fundamental four trances not the realm of sexual passion because it is without being concentrated not the realm of formlessness because it is without the path of vision Question In how many stages are the other roots of merit connected to penetration included The same applies to the factor patience Patience is included in six stages just as the highest worldly factor According to some the rest depend on seven Warmth and summit are also in six stages The venerable Ghogsaka wanted to have them also in the realm of sexual passion Question The successive production of what is connected to penetration has already been spoken of How is the successive production of the noble path further Answer  In succession to the highest worldly factor patience regarding the law in relation to frustration arises Jn succession to patience knowledge arises Both observe minor Srustration In succession to the highest worldly factor patience regarding the law in relation to frustration arises It is the antidote for the ten contaminants to be abandoned through the vision of frustration of the realm of sexual passion This is the primary pure proximate path Furthermore the highest worldly factor is gradually undone does not aim and is not practised It abandons false actions false courses and false views False actions are the five proximate actions false courses are the woeful courses false view is the five views Moreover with the part highest worldly factor patience regarding the law in relation to frustration constitutes five kinds of fixedness fixedness of stage fixedness of aspect fixedness of supporting object fixedness of ksana and  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya fixedness of condition as direct antecedent Fixedness of stage is that when there is the highest worldly factor in this stage patience regarding the law in relation to frustration exactly is in this stage Fixedness of aspect is that when there is the highest worldly factor in this aspect patience regarding the law in relation to frustration exactly is in this aspect Fixedness of supporting object is because of the definite same supporting object Fixedness of ksana is that when aversion is it this ksana there exactly is arising of patience regarding the law in relation to frustration in this ksana Fixedness of condition as direct antecedent is that in succession to the highest worldly factor patience regarding the law in relation to frustration definitely arises With the part highest patience three kinds of fixedness are made exception made for the one of ksana and for the one of condition as direct antecedent That is why later arising free from beings is achieved because of taking patience in relation to frustration as supporting object This thinking on frustration of the realm of sexual passion and on frustration of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness up to the antidote for the aspects of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness is called lower patience Abandoning the antidote for the aspects of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness when further thinking on the antidote for frustration of the realm of sexual passion up to for the aspects of the realm of sexual passion is middle patience When having understood these truths one by one abandoning to return up to after successively having developed regarding frustration of the realm of sexual pasNobility  sion abandoning it again and so in succession up tothinking on frustration of the realm of sexual passion at one ksana is higher patience Hereafter the highest worldly factor arises In succession to patience knowledge arises In succession to patience regarding the law in relation to frustration knowledge of the law in relation to frustration arises It is with the specific nature of the path of liberation Question With which supporting object are this patience and knowledge Answer Both observe minor frustration Minor frustration is frustration of the realm of sexual passion This one is observed by both  Frustration of the one of form and of the one of formlessness The same is true for the one of the origin the one of cessation and the one of the path This higher realisation of the doctrine is said to be with sixteen awarenesses Frustration of the one of form and of the one of formlessness The same applies to frustration of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness Subsequent patience in relation to frustration is the proximate path subsequent knowledge in relation to frustration is the path of liberation The same is true for the one of the origin the one of cessation and the one of the path In relation to the truth of the origin the one of cessation and the one of the path also two forms of patience are taken to be the proximate path and two knowledges are taken to be the path of lib Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya eration This higher realisation of the doctrine is said to be with sixteen awarenesses This duration of sixteen awarenesses is higher realisation of the doctrine Higher realisation is with the meaning of vision This duration of fifteen awarenesses is the path of vision the very last one awareness is the spiritual path Question Why are patience and knowledge of three truths included in the path of vision and is the very last awareness of the truth of the path included in the spiritual path Answer Because when developing the path with sixteen aspects that which is associated with subsequent knowledge in relation to the path develops the sixteenth aspect and it is not the path of vision that develops the sixteenth aspect Because subsequent knowledge in relation to the path is successive it is included in the path of the fruits That this is not proper is not right just as when the knowledge of destruction the stage of vision the stage of spiritual practice and the stage of having no more learning to do They shall now be spoken of according to their meaning The keen faculties of the doctrinefollower abide in fifteen awarenesses It should be known that also the minor visions of the faithfollower abide in these Nobility  The keen faculties of the doctrinefollower abide in fifteen awarenesses The person with the fifteen awarenesses of the path of vision is said to be the doctrinefollower when with keen faculties Because he behaves according to the doctrine he is said to be the doctrinefollower because he does otherwise not follow some faith It should be known that also the minor visions of the faithfollower abide in these Exactly this person with fifteen awarenesses is said to be the faithfollower when with minor faculties because he acquired release believing in something The faithfollower has few things he understands the doctrinefollower understands many things  It should be known that when the faithfollower and the doctrinefollower are supplied with bonds of defilement they are the ones who go to the first fruit until a fivefold annihilation This person who is the faithfollower and who is the doctrinefollower is called the one who goes to the fruit of srotadpannaship whether supplied with all bonds of defilement  or with a one two three fourand fivefold annihilation Because defilement is with such differentiation as excessiveexcessive nine classes are established At the moment these worldlings have not abandoned one class yet they are called with all bonds When one class is abandoned they are not called with all bonds When five classes are abandoned they are with arising free from beings When the five classes to be abandoned through the vision  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya of frustration of the realm of sexual passion are aban doned knowledge of the law in relation to frustration is achieved as realisation of liberation up to when abandoning the five classes to be abandoned through the vision of the path knowledge of the law in relation to the path is achieved as realisation of liberation When abandoning the five classes to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the realm of sexual passion the fruit of sakydagaminship is achieved as realisation of liberation  Six forms of annihilation up to eight are going to the second fruit Nonattachment up to the eighth stage is the third direction Six forms of annihilation up to eight are going to the second fruit When this faithfollower and doctrinefollower have already abandoned six seven or eight classes these are said to be the ones who go to the fruit of sakrdagaminship Nonattachment up to the eighth stage is the third direction This faithfollower and doctrinefollower both go to the fruit of andgaminship when with nonattachment up to the destruction of the sphere of nothingness  When the sixteenth awareness is reached this is called abiding in the fruit The one with minor vision is the one given to faith The one with keen vision is called viewattainer When the sixteenth awareness is reached this is called abiding in the fruit The sixteenth awareness is said to be associated with subsequent knowledge in relation to the Nobility  path When this is produced all are called abiding in the fruit either the srotadpanna or the Ssakydagamin or the anagamin  The one with minor vision is the one given to faith When the one with minor vision enters the path of vision he is called faithfollower At the moment he abides in the three fruits he is called the one given to faith The one with keen vision is called viewattainer When the one with keen faculties enters the path of vision he is called doctrinefollower At the moment he abides in the three fruits he is called viewattainer The faculty faith of the viewattainer is superior to the one of the one given to faith but because it is mixed with wisdom he is called viewattainer The one who has destroyed every insubstantial defilement  is up to not having progressed yet called srotaapanna  to be abandoned through the path of vision are destroyed it concerns the fruit of srotapannaship Up to not having progressed yet this is called abiding in the fruit of srotadpannaship  When effort abandons the excessiveexcessive form this is said to be the one who goes to the fruit of sakrdagaminship The production of subsequent knowledge in relation to the path when arising free from beings having abandoned exactly this form up to five classes is said to be the srotadpanna it is not the one who goes to sakrdagaminship  because the path that leads to this fruit has not been present for one instant yet  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question Why did the Worldhonoured One speak of the destruction of three fetters in relation to the abandonment of a multitude of defilements Answer Ten contaminants are fundamental the five views perplexity attachment repugnance pride and ignorance Six of these are to be abandoned through the path of vision the five views and perplexity These six contaminants to be abandoned through the path of vision are destroyed eternally Three of these are what proceeds and three are what proceeds subsequently It should be known that when what proceeds has already been spoken of also what proceeds subsequently is already spoken of That is why the Worldhonoured One said that destruction of three fetters is the srotadpanna Moreover this defilement either is of one mode or of two modes or of four modes It should be known that when belief in a self is already spoken of the one of one mode is already spoken of it should be known that when adherence to moral precepts and vows is already spoken of the one of two modes is already spoken of it should be known that when perplexity is already spoken of the one of four modes is already spoken of In this way whether pervasive or not pervasive whether with impure supporting object or with pure supporting object they should all be known The destruction of these fetters is already known up to the arhat Nobility   The one who has not destroyed the kind of the spiritual path yet experiences seve  births in transmigration Jt should be known that what is spoken of is most complete with the srotaapanna It should be known that when this srotadpanna has not destroyed the kind of the spiritual path yet he at the most fulfils seven forms of existence arising seven times in intermediate existence and in existence at rearising among humans and among the gods of the realm of sexual passion This speaks of seven forms of existence in general because seven are not exceeded just as the tree with seven leaves Question Why are seven forms of existence spoken of and not more or less Answer Just as when bitten by the snake of seven steps because of the power of the four elements one reaches seven steps because of the power of poison one does not reach eight In this way there is seven times arising because of the power action and because of the power of enlightenment no eight are reached Exception made for seven times arising in the realm of sexual passion all other forms of birth are acquired by the uncalculated cessation at the moment of abiding in the highest patience because of eventually not being present When arising free from beings among humans the seven are fulfilled among humans when among what is heavenly they are fulfilled returning is what is heavenly Although the noble path is present intermediately there is no parinirvana because of the adherence to the power action  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question When one fulfils seven times arising and Buddha does not rise in the world how does one acquire the fruit of arhatship Answer Some say it is the one living in ones house who acquires the fruit of arhatship and once this fruit is acquired he is no longer the one living in ones house Moreover it is said to be the one with the signs of the one who has left home to become a religious mendicant Because of accomplishment of perfect faith because of hope that is supplied and because of seeing the fault of misconduct the one with the religious merit of the srotaGpanna does therefore not fall in woeful courses Moreover because of being born in the lineage of Bud dha because of the clear cleanliness of the fire of knowledge because of exceeding the objects of views because quietude and insight are supplied and because of that which is mixed by the medicine noble path as a crown prince as a person whose inward fire increases as an agile fish That is why the srotadpanna does not fall in woeful courses Although worldlings do not fall in woeful courses they are not spoken of because of being few and unfixed Because of abiding in the group fixed in truth being fixed is spoken of Because of definite acquisition of nirvana going to be fully awakened is spoken of The seven forms of existence are as has been said previously Abiding concerns intermediate existence arising concerns existence at rearising That is why abiding and rearising are spoken of Not experiencing another arising is therefore called abiding at the limit of frustration Not all srotadpannas definitely have to fulfil the seven forms of existence Nobility   When abandoning three or four kinds when this antidote is accomplished and when still having to arise two or three times this is said to be called one destined to be reborn in the same kind of family Because of three reasons the one destined to be reborn in the same kind of family is established annihilation of defilement accomplishing faculties and rearising Annihilation of defilement is the annihilation of three classes or of four classes of defilement to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the realm of sexual passion It is not so that the annihilation of five classes is called the one destined to be reborn in the same kind of family If five classes can be abandoned one definitely must abandon six classes and accomplish a sakrdagamin because of the power There is no sixth class whose power can obstruct that this fruit is reached Accomplishing faculties is acquisition of all pure faculties that are antidote Rearising is having to rearise in the realm of sexual passion two or three times more When the three reasons are not supplied one by one it is not the one destined to be reborn in the same kind of family There are two forms of the one destined to be reborn in the same kind of family either among gods or among humans The one destined to be reborn in the same kind of family with gods arises two times or three times among the gods of the realm of sexual passion It either is experiencing one heavenly family or two or three Being reborn in the same kind of family with humans is  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya with the human person It either concerns one world or two or three either one family or two or three Question What is the meaning of being destined to be reborn in the same kind of family Answer When going from one family to another family there is parinirvana that is why the one destined to be reborn in the same kind of family is mentioned The most superior one of the srotadpannas is called the one destined to be reborn in the same kind of family When six classes of defilement are abandoned and all to be abandoned through the path of vision this is said to be the sakrdagamin the one who has not progressed yet When the excessive three classes and middle three classes to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the realm of sexual passion and everything to be abandoned through the path of vision are destroyed this is abiding in a fruit not having progressed yet this is called sakydagamin Question Which meaning does sakrdagamin have Answer When there is death here one is born with the gods of the realm of sexual passion and when arising one time among humans there is parinirvana When seven or eight classes are abandoned when accomplishing the faculties that are antidote and when still having to arise one more time this is called singleseeker Nobility  When seven classes or eight classes to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the realm of sexual passion and everything to be abandoned through the path of vision is destroyed when acquiring the pure faculties that are antidote for this and when one has to arise one more time in the realm of sexual passion this is called singleseeker When the three reasons are not supplied one by one this is no singleseeker When gods seek one more time they are with parinirvana when experiencing one heavenly body Question Why is abandoning eight classes called singleseeker and is abandoning five classes not called one destined to be reborn in the same kind of family Answer Even if abandoning six classes would be called the one destined to be reborn in the same kind of family there still would be arising in the realm of sexual passion That is why action and defilement of the realm of sexual passion are no resistance for it With the singleseeker nine classes were desiroyed and one were to arise in the realm of form action and defilement of the realm of sexual passion would therefore be a resistance in an extreme way and that is why it is said that the action of beings of the three residences is an obstruction in an extreme way The three abodes shall be spoken of later The singleseeker is the highest sakrdagamin  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  When nine classes are destroyed there is no return It should be known that there are many forms Sometimes five and seven or eight sometimes it is further said to be multiple When nine classes are destroyed there is no return It should be known that when everything to be abandoned through the path of vision and the nine classes of fetters to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the realm of sexual passion are destroyed this is the anagamin Question f it is with the annihilation of defilement then why did the Worldhonoured One say that the destruction of the five fetters of the lower world concerns the andagamin Answer Because in this way everything one two four fivefold is included in the five of the lower world What is to be contempted has the same meaning as minor a minor realm and minor beings A minor realm is the realm of sexual passion minor beings are worldlings because of being bound to greed and hatred A minor realm is because of being hard to surpass because of being bound to belief in a self to adherence to moral precepts and vows and to perplexity Minor beings is because of being as gatekeepers and guards Sometimes noble persons are first with annihilation of two fetters or of three fetters Because of accumulating abandonment five are spoken of Nobility  The one who does not return in the realm of sexual passion is called andgamin This one is also manifold Sometimes five and seven or eight sometimes it is further said to be multiple This is said to concern the anagamin Five kinds are the one intermediately liberated the one liberated after one rebirth the one liberated with preparation the one liberated without Preparation and the one liberated going upward in the stream Seven is that of the one intermediately liberated there are three kinds as has been said in the scriptural texts The three kinds of the one intermediately liberated the first is as something small that splits a great fire the second is as something very small that splits hot iron the third is as splitting a hot lump of iron Exactly this is said in the scriptural texts four are as has been said previously Eight five kinds are as has been said previously and moreover there is the one liberated in this life the andgamin of the realm of formlessness and the unfixed When faculties are established in relation to the five kinds of the realm of form then there are fifteen minor middle and excessive faculties of the one intermediately liberated the same applies up to the one liberated going upward in the stream When stages are established then there are twenty five in the first trance and so also five up to the fourth trance when lineages are established then there are thirty In this way the same applies up  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya to the one liberated going upward in the stream When residences are established then there are eight y five of the gods of brahmas group and so up to the vskanisiha gods when linea es and faculties are established then there are ninety when stages and lineages are established then there are one hundred twenty  when stages lineages and  faculties are established then there are three hundred sixty when lineages and residences are established then there are four hundred eighty  when lineages residences and faculties are established then there are one thousand four hundred forty It is to be remembered  There are fifteen and twenty thirty and eighty ninety one hundred twenty and three hundred sixty  Four hundred eighty kinds and one thousand four hundred forty In this way what the anagamin includes is spoken of concisely and elaborately  Faculties stages lineages and residences are established elaborately The succession according to the annihilation of defilement shall now be spoken of Furthermore one anagamin is the one intermediately liberated As to faculties three are established as to stages four as to lineages six as to residences sixNobility  teen as to lineages and faculties eighteen as to stages and lineages twentyfour as to stages and nonattachment thirtysix as to stages lineages and faculties seventytwo as to residences and lineages ninetysix as to stages lineages and nonattachment two hundred sixteen as to residences lineages and faculties two hundred eightyeight as to stages lineages faculties and nonattachment six hundred fortyeight as to residences lineages and nonattachment eight hundred sixtyfour As to residences lineages faculties and nonattachment two thousand five hundred ninetytwo are established Know that this is the number of the one intermediately liberated The same applies up to the one going upward in the stream If all this is included one gets twelve thousand nine hundred sixty It is to be remembered  One three four and six sixteen and eighteen Twentyfour are spoken of and further thirtysix are spoken of Seventy have two forms ninety have six forms Two hundred sixteen and two hundred eightyeight  Six hundred fortyeight eight hundred sixtyfour and further two thousand five hundred ninetytwo are spoken of b All anagamins  have already been spoken of The characteristic marks of the five andgamins shall now be spoken of  When keen faculties and minor defilement abide regarding one kind of action this is the one intermediately liberated Six lineages are to be differentiated This person is with keen faculties and minor defilement When doing the action of the intermediate existence there is increase and the action of the existence at rearising is not made there is parinirvana when there is acquisition of the pure path in the intermediate existence of the realm of form having gone down in the realm of sexual passion and when the other fetters are abandoned with this path Because of having surpassed the difficulties of the realm of sexual passion it is no parinirvana in the intermediate existence of the realm of sexual passion When one wants it to be this parinirvana three realms should have to be surpassed when abandoning that which is bad and that which is neutral these two kinds of fetters or when acquiring two or three fruits of sramanaship  and this is impossible with the intermediate existence of the realm of sexual passion When having gone down in the realm of form he is inNobility  cluded in the class of going upward inthe stream Question With how many lineages is this person Answer Six lineages are to be differentiated It should be known that with the one intermediately liberated there are six lineages the one who falls back up to the steadfast one When one says that keen faculties do not correspond to the lineage of the one who falls back this is not right because with this one also nine classes of faculties are established  The one who sustains the careful effort energetically and who develops the path of quick progress is the one liberated after one rebirth This also has two sayings The one who sustains the careful effort energetically and who develops the path of quick progress is the one liberated after one rebirth The person liberated after one rebirth does the action of the intermediate existence and of the existence at rearising and at death there is experiencing the intermediate existence and the existence at rearising of the gods of the realm of form With this primarily arising the path with preparation is produced the careful effort and the path of quick progress When the other fetters are abandoned fast there is Parinirvana when primarily arising and therefore the one liberated after one rebirth is spoken of This also has two sayings Some say that parinirvana when abandoning defilement when primarily arising is not right because there is no abandoning of the part of for mations of the duration of life However it is so that  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya there is no abandoning of the formations of the duration of life up to abiding in the destruction of the duration of life This meaning is superior  The third is with careful effort and is free from the path of quick progress The fourth does not strife energetically The three are all said to be sixfold The third is with careful effort and is free from the path of quick progress If this one is different from the one liberated with preparation it is that the path of quick progress does not proceed The rest is as the name has been spoken of previously When there is parinirvana when differently defilement is abandoned with production of the path with preparation this is the one liberated with preparation Furthermore also parinirvana when abandoning defilement through depending on the samadhi of the conditioned supporting objects is the one liberated with preparation The fourth does not strife energetically The one liberated without preparation neither strives energetically nor is with the proceeding of the path of quick progress The rest is as the name has been spoken of previously When differently defilement is abandoned through the production of the path without preparation and there is parinirvana this is the one liberated without preparation Furthermore also parinirvana when abandoning defilement through depending on the samadhi of the unconditioned supporting objects is the one liberated without preparation The three are all said to be sixfold It should be known Nobility  that the one liberated with Preparation the one without Preparation and the one after one rebirth are all said to be with six lineages Although these three kinds are all with liberation after one rebirth speaking of three is not wrong because their meaning is different  Leaping half leaping and fallen in every place this is called going upward in the stream This is also with six lineages It should be known that there is both Progressing and not progressing Leaping half leaping and fallen in every place this is called going upward in the stream There are two forms of going upward in the stream either first acquiring mixed trance or not acquiring it First acquiring it is being with that which is associated with relishing of the first trance and arising in the brahmaheaven at death when after first having developed three trances in a mixed way having fallen back to and abiding in the first trance Also this is threefold opment is fulfilled leaping to the fourth trance as one deSires and with death there arising with the akanisthagods Half leaping is from having gone down in the brahma heaven either arising in one or in two or in three residences and later being born with the akanisthagods Fallen in every place is arising in all residences one by one up to the akanisthagods  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya First not acquiring the mixed one is not arising with the gods of the clean residences but arising in the realm of formlessness The rest is as has been said previously Question With how many lineages is this meaning Answer This is also with six lineages Also going upward in the stream is with six lineages from the one who falls back up to the steadfast one This is no primarily abiding in the faculties of the lineage of the steadfast one the lineage of the one who falls back who having fallen back regarding mixed development of trance later becomes to be the viewattainer It should be known that there is both progressing and not progressing It should be known that with going upward in the stream there is both progressing and not progressing Four sentences should be made Having to progress and not not progressing abiding in the realm of sexual passion and in the brahmaheaven Not progressing and not having to progress abiding with the akanisthagods Both progressing and not progressing abiding with the other gods Nither progressing nor not progressing this does not exist When going to the realm of formlessness there is no mixed development That is why arising in the realm of formlessness is spoken of  Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking about the seven courses of the true man How did He establish the seven courses of the true man Nobility  Answer Birth faculties and defilement this is saying there are three forms The same is further true for those of nonarising The two of going upward in the stream are one One anagamin is established sevenfold because of four reasons the socalled establishing of faculties establishing of defilenient establishing of arising and of nonarising and establishing of progress Of those of arising the first is with keen faculties and minor defilement the second with middle faculties and middle defilement and the third with minor faculties and excessive defilement Those of nonarising are also with three as the three of arising Going upward in the stream is said to be progressing Because worldlings return when proceeding they are not going upward in the stream Going upward in the stream of the realm of formlessness has the superiority of five things the superiority of realm the superiority of stage the superiority of meditative attainment decrease of aggregates and annihilation of defilement Although there is the superiority of five things there is no acquisition of mixed  development and therefore the courses of the true man are not established  Such nine defilements abide in the higher eight stages It is by means of a double path that they are to be abandoned This is what the Worldhonoured One has said  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Such nine defilements abide in the higher eight stages Just as defilement to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the realm of sexual passion has nine classes from minorminor up to excessiveexcessive the same applies to the higher eight stages four trances and four immaterial ones When the path of vision is produced first nine kinds of defilement are abandoned by means of one kind of path Question When also defilement of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness is ninefold why then is the person with nonattachment not established there Answer Because a second birth is not being part of one residence Since in the realm of sexual passion there is such a god such a direction and such a lineage noble persons are with a second birth there is no second birth of noble persons in the realm of form and in the one of formlessness If there were a second birth there would not be the one liberated after one rebirth up to when going upward in the stream Tt is by means of a double path that they are to be abandoned This is what the Worldhonoured One has said It should be known that the defilement of these three realms is to be abandoned through the proximate path and through the one of liberation The proximate path can abandon the acquisition of defilement the path of liberation acquires the realisation of liberation The proximate path abandons the defilement the path of liberation does not loose what is made Therefore being abandoned through a double path is spoken of When one states that the path of liberation abandons defilement would this be when it is produced or when it is not Nobility  produced yet If it is when it is produced there should be defilement at the moment the knowledge of destruction primarily arises and this would then not be accomplished if it is when it is not produced yet it is so that a future path cannot abandons defilement Question Which path abandons defilement Answer The path with impurity and the one with absence of impurity can both make free from eight stages The one who abides in it is said to be the eyewitness the acquisition of meditative attainment of cessation The path with impurity and the one with absence of impurity can both make free from eight stages The one with impurity is the worldly path the one with absence of impurity is the noble path Exception made for the summit of existence it is so that at the moment the other stages are with nonattachment the impure and the pure path should be known For nonattachment in the summit of existence there only is the pure one because the impure one is not being part of it Because the worldly path climbs to higher stages it free from the defilement of lower stages just as a centipede The sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification is without higher stage to which can be climbed and without possibility to free from these fetters Because of being bound to the specific stage one cannot free from the fetters of the specific stage just as a person who has been bound cannot free himself  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya This conventional proximate path is with three as pects either coarse or frustration or coarse obstruction Because of being present it is saidto be coarse because of settling the three forms of frustration frustration is spoken of because of being easy to observe coarse obstruction is spoken of Also the path of liberation is with three as pects peace excellence and escape The proximate  path with the aspects one by one is with a minor supporting object the path of liberation is with an excessive supporting object Noble conduct shall be spoken of later The one who abides in it is said to be the eyewitness acquisition of meditative attainment of cessation Abiding in what is to be abandoned through the path of vision and through the spiritual path of eight stages and in what is to be abandoned through the path of vision of one stage i  is abiding in it The one who acquires meditative attainment of cessation is said to be called eyewitness That is why the seeker produces meditative attainment of cessation when one by one being with nonattachment up to regarding the summit of existence This is the acquisition of meditative attainment of cessation when being bound with all bonds or acquiring it when eight classes haye been destroyed Because of surpassing meditative attainment the Worldhonoured One stated that when all neitheridentificationnornonidentification are surpassed the religious merit of abiding in the extinguishing of conceptual identification and knowledge Meditative attainment of cessation shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Concentration Nobility   In succession to the diamondlike concentration one definitely makes the knowledge of destruction arise In succession to the diamondlike concentration one definitely makes the knowledge of destruction arise The ninth proximate  path when being with nonattachment in the stage of neitheridentificationnornonidentification iscalled diamondlike samadhi Because there is nothing that is not destroyed it is called diamond This meaning shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Investigations In succession to the diamondlike concentration the knowledge of destruction definitely arises This primarily is with two knowledges either subsequent knowledge in relation to frustration or subsequent knowledge in relation to the origin In the mind in which it has arisen birth of a self is destroyed is that it takes the four aggregates of the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification as supporting object because of the root of existence The one who should be honoured is free from impure influences The one who has destroyed everything that is impure when the knowledge of destruction arises is called the one who should be honoured because he should be brought reverence by everyone and because of harming every defilement Moreover because he does not sow the seed of consciousness regarding the field of existence when successively right view is present it is belonging to one ksana when knowledge of nonorigination is present it is successively The knowledge of destruction of the one with occasional liberation of mind is sometimes belonging to one ksana when successively right view is present it is belonging to one ksana when further knowledge of destruction is present it is successively Question Of how many kinds is the arhat Answer The arhat is sixfold With the faithfollower five arise These acquire two knowledges It should be known that they are the ones conditionally liberated The arhat is sixfold The one who falls back the one who wants the one who guards the one who abides unshakeably the one who will penetrate and the steadfast one The one who at first in the stage of still having learning to do does not exert himself often or does not exert himself suddenly is called the one who falls back The same applies to the one who wants It concerns the competence of thinking The one who guards is the one who exerts himself often and who does not exert himself suddenly He does not fall Nobility  back because of following the guarding The one who abides unshakeably is the one who exerts himself suddenly and who does not exert himself often He does not fall back and does not proceed The one who will penetrate is the one who exerts himself often and who exerts himself suddenly He is with minor faculties and can acquire steadfastness The steadfast one is the one who exerts himself often and suddenly and who has keen faculties Some say that the one who falls back has to fall back up to that the one who will penetrate has to progress This speaking of six kinds concems the arhat of the realm of sexual passion In the realm of from and in the one of formlessness there are two kinds the one who abides unshakeably and the steadfast one Some say that the one who falls back does not have to fall back when falling back it is only in this lineage This is saying that the three realms all have the six kinds of arhat With the faithfollower five arise Among these six kinds of arhat the first five kinds are of the lineage of faith These accomplish two knowledges the knowledge of destruction and the right view of the adept Because a these sometimes fall back the knowledge of nonorigination is not spoken of Because there is no further rearising the Worldhonoured One said in all scriptural texts Not experiencing a later existence is to be known as true Tt should be known that they are the ones conditionally liberated It should be known that these are the ones conditionally liberated Therefore they are said to be the ones conditionally liberated  The steadfast one with keen faculties is the one unconditionally liberated He acquires three knowledges His specific liberation is accomplished The steadfast one with keen faculties is the one unconditionally liberated If the steadfast one is absolutely with keen faculties he can develop good action at any moment according to desire and he does not wait for any provision This is the one unconditionally liberated He acquires three knowledges He accomplishes three knowledges the knowledge of destruction the knowledge of nonorigination and the right view of the adept It is the one who does not fall back His specific liberation is accomplished It should be known that a liberation that is said to be similar to himself is accomplished The one with occasional liberation of mind waits for the moment therefore an occasional liberation of mind is accomplished The steadfast one is not moved by defilement because he is steadfast Therefore he is said to be the steadfast one This is the meaning of not falling back Question Why is the one with occasional liberation of mind called with craving and is this not so for the steadfast one Answer Because extremely protects himself as when one is with one aim because of being not selfwilled because of fear of falling back just as when borrowing something Nobility  from someone because the roots of merit that are mutually bound are no part The one who is steadfast liberated has roots of merit that are mutually bound because he has another form of samadhi That is why craving is not spoken of Emptiness of emptiness aimlessness of aimlessness signlessness of signlessness They are said to be mutually bound because one abandons concentration through concentration It should be known that the one liberated through wisdom does net acquire meditative attainment of cessation It should be known that when meditative attainment of cessation is acquired it is the twicedelivered one Tt should be known that the one liberated through wisdom does not acquire meditative attainment of cessation The one of these six kinds of arhat who does not acquire meditative attainment of cessation is said to be the one liberated through wisdom Because he is disjunctioned from the obstruction defilement through the power of wisdom he is called liberated through wisdom Tt should be known that when meditative attainment of cessation is acquired it is the twicedelivered one The one of these six kinds of arhat who acquires meditative attainmert of cessation is said to be the twicedelivered one With this mind of being free from the obstruction defilement through the power of wisdom liberation is acquired the one who is free from the obstruction liberation through the power of meditative attainment of cessation and who acquires liberation is therefore called the twicedelivered one  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Four sentences are further to be made concerning the one who falls back and all twicedelivered ones The one who falls back not the twicedelivered one the one who falls back who does not acquire meditative attainment of cessation The twicedelivered one not the one falling back the five kinds of arhat who acquire meditative attainment of cessation the one who falls back who acquires meditative attainment of cessation Neither the one who falls back nor the twicedelivered one the five kinds of arhat who do not acquire meditative attainment of cessation The same applies up to the one who is steadfast liberated  The faculties are said to be ninefold and also nine kinds of person are spoken of the seven kinds of Sravaka the pratyekabuddha and the tathagata These are said to be the ninefold faculties from minorminor up to excessiveexcessive Also the arhat is ninefold the first five kinds and two steadfast liberated ones either acquiring to be unshakeable depending on being conditionally liberated or acquiring to be unshakeable through origin These seven kinds of Sravaka the pratyekabuddha and the tathagata are said to be the nine kinds of person That faculties establish persons has already been said The accomplishment of faculties by a person shall now be Nobility  spoken of  The most minor Saculties among the minor ones concern the first kind of person Up to increasing to the excessiveexcessive ones the ninth person should be known The one who falls back accomplishes minorminor faculties The one who wants is with minormiddle ones The one who guards is with minorexcessive ones The one who abides unshakeably is with middleminor ones The steadfast one depending on the lineage of the one conditionally liberated is with middleexcessive ones The acquisition of the fruit of the adept When one is of the lineage of the seeker is either exactly of this lineage or is progressing to not falling back again The six kinds of arhat sometimes acquire arhatship by means of being of such a lineage as of the stage of still having learning to do Exactly the arhat of this lineage does sometimes acquire not to fall back by means of growing of faculties This lineage is because of developing faculties The one who falls back has three things that shall be spo Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya ken of later  The steadfast one only has one thing exactly this parinirvana when abiding The other arhats have two things  The fundamental lineages have already been spoken of The perfectioning of faculties of the arhat shall now be spoken of Three four five six or seven increase successively such as those of the one who falls back are said to be the thing of five arhats The one who falls back has three things abiding in the faculties of the one falling back from the religious merit of still having learning to do when falling back or this parinirvana when abiding or progressing when with perfectioning of faculties The one who wants has four things abiding in the faculties of still having learning to do when falling back exactly abiding in the faculties of the one who falls back when falling back if it were different one should have to progress and not fall back because it has been said previously that this lineage is not with falling back there is abiding in the faculties of the one who falls back exactly this parinirvana when abiding progressing when with perfectioning of faculties The one who guards has five things abiding in the faculty of still having learning to do when falling back from the one who guards abiding in the faculties of the one who falls back abiding in the faculties of the one who wants exactly this parinirvana when abiding progressing when with perfectioning of faculties Nobility  The one who abides unshakeably is sixfold the one who will penetrate is with seven they are to be spoken of according to their meaning The establishing of the characteristic marks of the true man has already been spoken of The establishing of religious merit shall now be spoken of The religious merit of the faithfollower or the religious merit of the doctrinefollower and the path of vision of the truths are all with one and the same characteristic mark The religious merit of the faithfollower the religious merit of the doctrinefollower and the path of vision of the truths these three forms of religious merit are all with one and the same characteristic mark The difference is that the faithfollower is with minor faculties and the doctrinefollower is with keen faculties Sensual factors among these are called the faculty I shall come to understand the not yet understood Buddha said that other religious merit of the seeker is the faculty of understanding Sensual factors among these are called the faculty I shall come to understand the not yet understood Faculties that are included in this path of vision of the truths are a number of nine factors the faculty mind the faculty satisfaction thefaculty contentedness the faculty equanimity and such five faculties as faith This is called the faculty I shall come to understand the not yet under Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya stood All these faculties are accomplished by the faithfollower and by the doctrinefollower The name means that since that which is not understood yet shall be understood it therefore is said to be the faculty I shall come to understand the not yet understood Question When patience regarding the law in relation to frustration arises the five aggregates of the realm of sexual passion are observed and later when knowledge of the law in relation to frustration arises there is not this regarding the five aggregates Is this having to un derstand the not yet understood When stating that what is not understood yet shall be understood this is not right Answer Patience is no knowledge Because it is not with the nature of knowledge it is not wrong Because patience is vision it is not with the nature of knowledge Because knowledge knows it is not wrong Buddha said that other religious merit of the seeker is the faculty of understanding Exception made for the religious merit of the seeker in the path of vision other religious merit of the seeker is a number of faculties of nine factors said to be the faculty of understanding This faculty is what is accomplished by the one given to faith by the viewattainer and by the eyewitness Although when subsequent knowledge in relation to the path arises subsequent patience in relation to the path has observed and that which is not understood yet shall be understood it is not spoken of because it is already small just as a drop of the ocean as one piece of dust of Su meru as the place of a mosquito in space Nobility   It should be known that the religious merit of the adept is said to be the faculty of the one who has fully understood With the acquisition of a fruit the former path is abandoned That is what the One with Unhindered Knowledge has said Tt should be known that the religious merit of the adept is said to be the faculty of the one who has fully understood It should be known that the religious merit of the adept exactly is a number of faculties of nine factors said to be the faculty of the one who has fully understood This faculty is accomplished by the one liberated through wisdom and by the twicedelivered one Of this path of vision it is with six stages the four trances the preand the intermediate one It is not the root of merit effort of a higher stage because of not being part of it and not being with a wide object The religious merit of the seeker of the spiritual path is with nine stages these six stages and three immaterial ones This is what the One with Unhindered Knowledge has said It should be known that at the moment of the acquisition of a fruit the former pure path is abana doned When acquiring the fruit of srotadpannaship the path of vision is abandoned when acquiring the fruit of sakrdagaminship the path of vision is also abandoned when one first was the one with double nonattachment when it is successively the fruit of srotadpannaship and the path that goes to srotadpannaship are abandoned  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya When acquiring the fruit of andgaminship the path of vision is also abandoned when one first was the one without attachment to sensual pleasure when it is successively the fruit of sakrdagaminship and the path that goes to the sakrdagamin are abandoned When acquiring the fruit of arhatship the fruit of anagaminship and the path that goes to anagdaminship are abandoned Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of such seven persons as the faithfollower How are they established Answer  Preparation and faculties meditative attainment liberation and both it should be known that there are seven nobles Of actual entities it is said there are six Preparation and faculties meditative attainment liberation and both it should be known that there are seven nobles Because of five reasons seven persons are spoken of In name they are seven but there are no seven actual entities The five reasons are preparation faculties meditative attainment liberation and both meditative attainment and liberation Preparation is the faithfollower and the doctrinefollower The faithfollower is said to be the faithfollower because of manifold faith First he sows action and acts with faith in something else Having acquired the path later he isspoken of by his original name The doctrinefollower first reflects himself and forms actions Having acquired the path later he is spoken of by his original name With minor faculties he is said to be the one given to faith with keen faculties he is said to be the viewattainer Meditative attainment is the eyewitness Liberation is the one liberated through wisdom Both meditative attainment and liberation is the twicedelivered one Of actual entities it is said there are six There are six of these noble persons In the path of vision there are two the faithfollower and the doctrinefollower In the spiritual path there are two the one given to faith and the viewattainer In the path of the adept there are two the one conditionally liberated and the one unconditionally liberated The person who is the faithfollower should be said to be one of the seven persons Becauseof faculties three should be spoken of minor middle and excessive because of lineage five should be spoken of the one who falls back up to the one who will penetrate because of paths fifteen should be spoken of abiding in patience regarding the law in relation to frustration up to in subsequent patience in relation to the path nonattachment should be said to be seventythree nonattachment in the realm of sexual passion is ten with all bonds up to destruction of the nine classes the first trance is with nine up to the sphere of nothingness Furthermore there is increase by means of establishing faculties lineages paths and bases Also this should be spoken of elaborately In this way there are one hundred fortyseven thousand eight hundred twentyfive persons who are faithfollowers  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya This is what is included One three five fifteen and seventythree Faculties lineages paths and being without defilement should be known Threefold and fivefold Jifteenand ninefold In this way the multitude of kinds is said to only concern the faithfollower It should be known that the other noble persons should also be spoken of in this way according to their meaning Question How are such eight persons as the one who goes to srotaapannaship spoken of in the scriptural texts Answer  Because there are five actual entities it is said that there is the name of eight persons Before and after is each one actual entity three are intermediate With these four courses and four fruits the names of eight persons are spoken of the actual entities are five of the one who goes to srotadpannaship and the arhat the names are one and also the actual entities are one of the srotadpanna and the one who goes to sakrdagdminship the names are two and the actual entities are one the same applies to the sakrdagamin and the one who goes to anagaminship to the anagamin and the one who goes Nobility  to the fruit of arhatship These four persons accomplish the noble path of one stage Exactly this is also said to be the one destined to be reborn in the same kind of family and the singleseeker Going to the fruit of andgaminship either is with one stage or up to six stages the fruit of andgaminship either is with three stages or up to six stages the one who goes to the fruit of arhatship either is with three stages or up to nine stages the arhat accomplishes nine stages About these fruits of sramanaship that are with a path that is mingled and with a stage that is mingled four sentences are to be made the fruit of sakrdagaminship The stage is mingled but not the path is mingled the fruit of arhatship Both the path is mingled and the stage is mingled the fruit of anagaminship The path is unmingled and the stage is unmingled the fruit of srotadpannaship Mingling what is impure and what is pure is called a mingled path One is disjunctioned from that which is already destroyed Acquisition depends on one fruit It is to be explained that what is undefiled is destroyed by the ninth One is disjunctioned from that which is already destroyed Acquisition depends on one fruit All paths  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya of liberation among the paths of escape acquire disjunction as fruit At the moment of acquisition of a fruit the acquisition of one kind of disjunction is acquired when that which is to be abandoned through the class of knowledge of the law is destroyed When that which is to be abandoned through the class of subsequent knowledge is destroyed acquisition of two kinds of disjunction is acquired It is said because the path is not mingled At the moment of one acquisition of a fruit five reasons are spoken of acquisition of the not yet acquired path abandoning the already acquired path sudden acquisition of eight knowledges development of the sixteen aspects simultaneously acquisition of the fruit of disjunction of the unity Question Annihilation of what is defiled has already been spoken of previously How is what is not defiled abandoned Answer It is to be explained that what is undefiled is destroyed by the ninth The annihilation of the nine classes of the dependence of defilement has been spoken of already previously What is undefiled is abandoned suddenly when abiding in the ninth proximate one it is not gradually What is undefiled are the five aggregates of the worldly clean and of that which is nonobscuredneutral Also defiled matter is to be abandoned through the ninth proximate one because of being small it is not spoken of  Question Why is defilement to be abandoned in nine classes and is what is undefiled to be abandoned by the ninth proximate one Nobility  Answer Because defilement is contrary to the noble path c and the noble path is contrary to defilement what is undefiled is not contrary That is why this is so When such paths are produced they abandon defilement according to what should be abandoned When the minorminor path is produced excessiveexcessive defilement is abandoned up to minorminor defilement is abandoned when the excessiveexcessive path is produced To this the same applies as to a small light that extinguishes great darkness and as to a great light that extinguishes subtles darkness Through that which is defiled the annihilation of something of this specific nature is not accomplished What is undefiled abandons the mistake of defilement as if it were poison  The one with a name similar to unattached can acquire steadfastness Of the ones of the lineage of the ones given io faith the one who will penetrate also makes the path increase The one with a name similar to unattached can acquire steadfastness Not every arhat can acquire steadfastness only those who are similar to the one that has the name of the quality acquire it the one who will penetrate Of these five kinds it are those with perfectioning of faculties who acquire it reaching to be the one who wants from being the one who falls back In this way the series is fully to be known as that they further on acquire steadfastness When there are the nine proximate  and the nine paths of liberation it is as acquisition of the fruit of arhatship The nine proximate paths and eight paths of liberation   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya are included in conditional liberation The ninth path of liberation is included in unconditional liberation These are all that which is included in the path of the fruits When the path of preparation is pure they are in cluded in the path of the fruits when impure they are not included in it Of the ones of the lineage of the ones given to faith the one who will penetrate also makes the path increase When the one given to faith is of the lineage of the one who will penetrate he and only he can acquire to be the viewattainer That is why the five kinds of the stage of still having learning to do are also with perfectioning of faculties Increase of the path is to make faculties burning Perfectioning of faculties is increase among humans in no other course Increase is in the noble path not in the worldly path The seeker depends on trances the adept depends on trances and on immaterial ones the srotadpanna and the sakrdagamin depend on the future one and are with perfectioning of faculties this exactly is the acquisition of one stage when abandoning one stage The andgdmin is the one who arises free from beings when first depending on the first trance and of the adjacent ones and successively when not having acquired the second trance yet is with abandoning three stages as fruit and with acquisition of those of three stages as fruit when with perfectioning of faculties When the second trance is acquired and not the third trance and later there is perfectioning of faculties depending on the first trance it is abandoning three stages and of the path that is superior to the fruit In this way it is up to abandoning three stages and abandoning the path that is superior to the fruit of nine stages as fruit and acquiring three stages as fruit when acquiring the pure sphere of nothingness That when a great path is abandoned a small path is acquired it should be the one who falls back is not right Because of the acquisition of the superior path of this person Question s annihilation of the path also annihilation of abandoning Answer With annihilation of the worldly path it does not concern abandoning At the moment of becoming the viewattainer when defilement of the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification is abandoned kind by kind the spiritual path of neitheridentificationnornoni dentification is annihilated and abandoning and the antidote are annihilated but the acquisition of defilement is not accomplished just as at the moment when worldlings arise in a higher stage Moreover if there first is arising free from beings depending on the first trance and later there is perfectioning of faculties depending on the second trance this is acquisition of four stages as fruit when abandoning three stages and the path that is superior to the fruit of four stages as fruit In this way all stages should be spoken of elaborately If when abiding in the fruit there is perfectioning of faculties the one of preparation the proximate one and the path of liberation are included in the fruit If when abiding in the path that is superior to the fruit there is perfectioning of faculties the one of preparation and the proximate  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya path are included in the path that is superior to the fruit and the path of liberation is included in the fruit one path of preparation one proximate path and also one path of liberation In this way also the path of vision is with six lineages and is without perfectioning of faculties because of the quick path In this way also the roots of merit connected to penetration are with six lineages The devotee successively is with perfectioning of faculties Only the highest worldly factor is without perfectioning of faculties because of being instantaneous The fulfilment of faculties has already been spoken of The fulfilment and unfulfilment of the seeker shall now be spoken of  Sometimes there is fulfilment of the fruit by the seeker sometimes of faculties sometimes of meditative attainment Sometimes all three are further fulfilled For adepts the same is true for two The seeker has fulfilment of three things either fulfilment of the fruit or fulfilment of faculties or fulfilment of meditative attainment When the andgamin given to faith does not acquire meditative attainment of cessation it is only fulfilment of the fruit no fulfilment of faculties because of minor faculties it is no fulfilment of meditative attainment because of not acquiring meditative attainment of cessation The srotadpanna who is the viewattainer and the Nobility  sakrdagamin are only with fulfilment of facultis not with fulfilment of the fruit and not with fulfilment of meditative attainment Acquisition of meditative attainment of cessation by the anagamin aa given to faith is with fulfilment of the fruit and with fulfilment of meditative attainment not with fulfilment of faculties Not acquiring meditative attainment of cessation by the anagamin  Who is the viewattainer is with fulfilment of the fruit and with fulfilment of faculties not with fulfilment of meditative attainment Acquisition of meditative attainment of cessation by the viewattainer is with fulfilment of the three things For adepts the same is true for two All adepts are with fulfilment of the fruit because there is no aature of a second fruit The one liberated through wisdom with minor faculties is with fulfilment of the fruit and not with fulfilment of faculties The one with keen faculties is with fulfilment of the fruit and with fulfilment of faculties Both are not with fulfilment of meditative attainment The twicedelivered one with minor faculties is with fulfilment of the fruit and with fulfilment of meditative attainment not with fulfilment of faculties With keen faculties he is with fulfilment of the three things Question Fulfilment of the three kinds is observing the truths well How are the truths observed Suddenly or gradually Answer When establishing quality and vice the noble truths are gradually seen Through the power of the proximate path  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya there is the acquisition of conditioned and of unconditioned fruits When establishing quality and vice the noble truths are gradually seen Because of seeing vice the truth of frustration and the one of the origin are established regarding these noble truths Because of seeing quality the truth of cessation and the one of the path are established That is why at the moment one sees vice quality is not seen Neither is vice seen at the moment quality is seen because they are inherently different Neither is not truly seeing the truths called higher realisation of the truths Neither is there one knowledge that generally observes the noble truth because the truths are with multiple natures That is why the truths are seen gradually Some say the aspect without self it is a sudden higher realisation This is explained in this way the aspect without self takes all factors as supporting object and must be with a sudden higher realisation This is not right Because the perverted views are multiple because the specific nature the associated and the simultaneous factors are not the object because the truths have different characteristic marks Since regarding these truths such as selfless is in relation to multiple natures what is overturned is not in relation to one and when the selfless is produced a multiple uncertainties of the specific nature are to be abandoned Higher realisation shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Investigations Question Higher realisation of the truth acquires the fruits of Sramanaship Are these conditioned or unconditioned Nobility  fruits Answer Through the power of the proximate path there is the acquisition of conditioned and of unconditioned fruits Calculated cessation of defilement and the path of liberation are both acquired by the power of the proximate path That is why both are said to be with the fruits of Ssramanaship The abandonment of defilement is the fruit of disjunction and the fruit of human effort The path of liberation is the fruit of human effort and the natural fruit  Question Of how many forms is higher realisation Answer The three forms of higher realisation are higher realisation of the supporting object of the duty and of vision It should be known that there are three forms or two or further also one The threefold higher realisation is higher realisation of the supporting object higher realisation of the duty and higher realisation of vision This wisdom is the threefold higher realisation Higher realisation of the supporting object is because of being with supporting object Higher realisation of the duty is because of being able to settle the duty Higher realisation of vision is because of the nature of vision Factors associated with wisdom are with two forms of higher realisation   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Simultaneous factors are only with one higher realisation of the duty Regarding the truth of frustration patience of frustration and knowledge of frustration are with the three forms of higher realisation regarding the truth of cessation and the truth of the path they are with higher realisation of the duty It should be known that the same applies to patience of the origin and knowledge of the origin regarding the truth of the origin Regarding the truth of cessation patience of cessation and knowledge of cessation are with the three forms of higher realisation regarding the truth of frustration the one of the origin and the one of the path they are with higher realisation of the duty Regarding the truth of the path patience of the path and knowledge of the path are with the three forms of higher realisation regarding the truth of frustration the one of the origin and the one of cessation they are with higher realisation of the duty The spiritual path has to be known according to its meaning Because of these reasons higher realisation of vision of the truth should in this way be known as a gradual higher realisation Heart of Scholasticism with Miscellaneous Additions volume five Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Heart of Scholasticism with Miscellaneous Additions Volume Six Chapter Six Knowledge Composed by the venerable Dharmatrata Translated by the Indian Tripitaka Samghavarman of the Sung and others Establishment of the true man has already been spoken of Knowledge shall now be spoken of  If one can understand the nature of knowledge one is with clear observance of everything that exists and with nirvana where that which exists does not exist These characteristic marks are now spoken of When there is this actual entity Knowledge The meaning of certainty Understand Differentiating Observing Everything that exists In an extreme way limited to the three forms of existence the truth of frustration and the one of the origin Existing The nature of existence That which exists does not exist The end of what ex ists Abandonment of every defilement This is Nirvana said to be the truth of cessation The specific nature and the characteristic nature Are now spoken of Manifesting the specific nature Question What is knowledge Answer  Three knowledges have been spoken of by the Buddha who has the utmost and highest wakefulness knowledge of the law and subsequent knowledge and also conventional knowledge These three knowledges include all knowledges Knowledge of the law When knowledge is the pure knowledge j in the realm of sexual passion as object Because of primarily experiencing the essential marks knowledge of the law is spoken of Subsequent knowledge When knowledge is the pure knowledge that has frustration its origin cessation and the path in the realm of form and in the one of formlessness as object When knowledge of the law proceeds in these aspects  what proceeds subsequently  in exactly these aspects is subsequent knowledge Because of being of the kind of knowing subsequently it is said to be subsequent knowledge Conventional knowledge When  knowledge is the impure knowledge that has all factors as object What is conventional is that which mostly  is experienced as worldly business such as being masculine feminine long and short That is why it is said to be convenKnowledge  tional knowledge   Frustration its origin cessation and the path Two knowledges arise from the truths These names make four knowledges rise The Muni has been speaking of them according to the truth This knowledge of the law and subsequent knowledge proceed according to the truth The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of them according to the sound of the truth with the truth of frustration as object knowledge of frustration is spoken of with the truth of the origin the one of cessation and the one of the path as object knowledge of the path is spoken of When knowledge observes the awarenesses of another it is to be spoken of from three The knowledge of destruction and the one of nonorigination are two Their objects abide in four categories When knowledge observes the awarenesses of another it is to be spoken of from three Three knowledges observe the awarenesses of another with the class of knowledge of the law as object knowledge of the law is spoken of with the class of subsequent knowledge as object subsequent knowledge is spoken of with impure awarenesses and accompanying mental factors as object conventional knowledge is spoken of The knowledge of destruction and the one of nonorigi Samyuktabhidharmahydaya nation are two Knowledge of destruction and knowledge of nonorigination are these two knowledges knowledge of the law and subsequent knowledge Certain proceeding of the accomplishment of what was done is knowledge of destruction certain proceeding of what shall not be made again is knowledge of nonorigination Question Which truth is their object Answer Their objects abide in four categories They take the four noble truths as supporting object Question When the Worldhonoured One has been speaking about three knowledges why are ten spoken of Answer Antidote and preparation specific nature aspect and both aspect and supporting object the work done and expansion of the cause that is why ten knowledges are spoken of Because of seven reasons ten knowledges are spoken of antidote preparation specific nature aspect both aspect and supporting object the work done and expansion of the cause This antidote is that knowledge of the law and subse quent knowledge are pure knowledges the antidote for the realm of sexual passion is said to be knowledge of the law the antidote for the realm of form and for the one of formlessness is said to be subsequent knowledge Although knowledge of the law is the antidote for the realm of form and for the one of formlessness it is not for everything and also not for a complete mode That is why it is Knowledge  not spoken of Preparation Knowledge of the awareness of another also knows accompanying mental factors but these are because of wanting to know awarenesses as preparation Specific nature Conventional knowledge mostly grasping worldly business as has been said previously Aspect Knowledge of frustration and knowledge of the origin The aspects of these two knowledges are not to be mingled but their supporting object is mingled because of being with one supporting object These two knowledges are with one and the same supporting object That is why the proceeding of the aspect impermanence regarding this supporting object is knowledge of frustration and also knowledge of impermanence could be spoken of It is because frustration in an extreme way makes aversion increase that this knowledge is called knowledge of frustration Furthermore because of what is unique The aspect frustration is absolutely with an impure supporting object When the aspect impermanence is impure it is with three truths as supporting object when pure it is with an impure supporting object When the aspects emptiness and without self are impure they take all factors as supporting object when pure they are with an impure supporting object That is why four sentences should be made about knowledge of frustration and the aspect frustration Sometimes knowledge of frustration is not the aspect frustration knowledge of frustration that proceeds in other aspects Sometimes the aspect frustration is no knowledge of frus    Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya tration factors associated with knowledge of frustration Sometimes both knowledge of frustration and the aspect frustration knowledge of frustration that proceeds in the aspect frustration Sometimes neither knowledge of frustration nor the aspect frustration associated factors of knewledge of frustration proceeding in other aspects To that which has been proceeding and to that which will proceed the same applies as to that which proceeds To the one of impermanence emptiness and without self the same applies as to the aspect frustration Just as knowledge of frustration is with twelve the same applies up to knowledge of the path Both aspect and supporting object This  s knowledge of cessation and knowledge of the path because the supporting objects of these knowledges are not to be mingled and also their aspects are not to be mingled Knowledge of destruction because that what must be done is already done Expansion of the cause Knowledge of nonorigination because of depending on all pure knowledges and because of abiding in the group of the steadfast one The reasons why ten knowledges are established have already been spoken of Such differences as being good shall now be spoken of  Nine knowledges are only said to be good One knowledge is divided into three One is vision two are nonvision the rest have two forms Nine knowledges are only said to be good Exception Knowledge  made for the conventional knowledge the other nine knowledges are said to be good because of the desired fruit One knowledge is divided into three The conventional knowledge either is good or bad or neutral One is vision The knowledge of the awareness of another is vision because of the nature of differentiating Two are nonvision The knowledge of destruction and the knowledge of nonorigination are nonvision because they are not with the nature of differentiating The rest have two forms The other seven knowledges either are vision or nonvision When not included in the knowledge of destruction or the knowledge of nonorigination knowledge of the law subsequent knowledge knowledge of frustration the one of the origin the one of cessation and the one of the path are vision When included in them they are nonvision Conventional knowledge either is vision or nonvision The five views  and conventional right view are vi sion because of being zealous Perplexity craving repugnance pride and wisdom associated with ignorance are nonvision Because of being covered by two contaminants Although wisdom associated with ignorance is without second contaminant one can fully cover it there is no defilement Nonobscuredneutral wisdom is nonvision because it is not zealous Wisdom associated with five kinds of consciousness is nonvision because it is not with the nature of deliberation   Still having learning to do and having  more learning to do are six  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Two knowledges are said to be having no more learning to do Neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do is one It should be known that one is threefold Still having learning to do and having no more learning to do are six Knowledge of the law subsequent knowledge and knowledge of frustration the one of the origin the one of cessation and the one of the path either are still having learning to do or having no more learning to do When they are acquired by the seeker they are still having learning to do when they are acquired by the adept they are having no more learning to do Two knowledges are said to be having no more learning to do It are the knowledge of destruction and the knowledge of nonorigination that are of the adept because he abides in being free from defilement Neither still having leaming to do nor having no more learning to do is one The conventional knowledge is neither stili having learning to do nor having no more learning to do because of being impure It should be known that one is threefold The knowledge of the awareness of another either is still having learning to do or having no more learning to do or neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do When only with awarenesses and accompanying mental factors of the seeker as object it is still having learning to do when with awarenesses and accompanying mental factors of the adept as object it is having no more learning to do when only with impure awarenesses and accompanying mental factors as object it is neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do Knowledge   The nature of eight knowledges is uninterruptedness Two knowledges are said to be twofold One is both impure and pure The nature of eight knowledges is uninterruptedness Exception made for the knowledge of the awareness of another and for the conventional knowledge the other eight knowledges are with uninterruptedness because of being with pureness Two knowledges are said to be twofold When the knowledge of the awareness of another is impure it is to be abandoned through the spiritual path when pure it is with uninterruptedness When the conventional knowledge is with patience as antidote it is to be abandoned through vision when with knowledge as antidote it is to be abandoned through spiritual practice One is both impure and pure The knowledge of the awareness of another either is impure or pure With impure awarenesses and accompanying mental factors as object it is impure with pure awarenesses and accompanying mental factors as object it is pure One is said to be impure The conventional knowledge is absolutely impure because it is the state of defilement It should be known that the uninterruptedness of eight knowledges is said to be pure Four knowledges are with a conditioned supporting object One has a permanent supporting object Five knowledges are with two objects This is what the Wise One has said  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Four knowledges are with a conditioned supporting object The knowledge of the awareness of another knowledge of frustration the one of the origin and the one of the  path are with a conditioned supporting object because the aggregates are the object One has a permanent  supporting object Knowledge of cessation is with an unconditioned supporting object because nirvana is the object Five knowledges are with two objects When knowledge of the law subsequent knowledge knowledge of destruction and knowledge of nonorigination have three truths as object they are with a conditioned supporting object when they have the truth of cessation as object they are with an unconditioned supporting object Also the conventional knowledge is with a conditioned supporting object when with three truths as object and with an unconditioned supporting object when with calculated cessation and space as supporting object Knowledge of the law should be known as produced from six stages Subsequent knowledge is with nine stages The knowledge of the awareness of another abides in trances Knowledge of the law should be known as produced from six stages Knowledge of the law is to be acquired in six stages and is acquisition of the specific nature the four trances the preand the intermediate one no immaterial ones because the immaterial ones do not take the realm of sexual passion as supporting object Subsequent knowledge is to be acquired in nine stages the pre the inKnowledge  termediate one the four trances and three immaterial ones The knowledge of the awareness of another abides in trances In the fundamental trances there is the knowledge of the awareness of another because of being the fruit of concentration in four or five members It should be known that the conventional knowledge abides in eleven stages The other knowledges are class by class as has been said previously It should be known that the conventional knowledge abides in eleven stages The conventional knowledge abides in eleven stages the realm of sexual passion the pre the intermediate one the four trances and the four immaterial ones The other knowledges are class by class as has been said previously When knowledge of frustration the one of the origin the one of cessation and the one of the path knowledge of destruction and knowledge of nonorigination are of the class of knowledge of the law they abide in six stages as knowledge of the law when of the class of subsequent knowledge they abide in nine stages as subsequent knowledge  When the applications of mindfulness are spoken of one knowledge should be known as the last one Three are said to be one knowledge It has been said by the Wise One that the other ones are with four  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya When the applications of mindfulness are spoken of one knowledge should be known as the last one Knowledge of cessation is with application of mindfulness on factors because of being with an unconditioned supporting object Three are said to be one knowledge The knowledge of the awareness of another because of taking awarenesses and accompanying mental factors as supporting gpleet This one is with three applications of mindfulness exception made for the application of mindfulness on the body It has been said by the Wise One that the other ones are with four The other eight knowledges are with the four applications of mindfulness because of taking the five aggregates as supporting object  One knowledge is with the realm of sexual passion as basis There is one with two realms as basis Two knowledges are with the three realms as basis The other six either are with one or with three One knowledge is with the realm of sexual passion as basis Knowledge of the law is only with the realm of sex ual passion as basis because knowledge of the law arises subsequently to that which is formed by the four elements of the realm of sexual passion There is one with two realms as basis The knowledge of the awareness of another is with the realm of sexual passion and with the one of form as basis because of depending on matter Two knowledges are with the three realms as basis Subsequent knowledge and conventional knowledge are Knowledge  with the three realms as basis The other six either are with one or with three When such six knowledges as knowledge of frustration are of the class of knowledge of the law they are with the realm of sexual passion as basis when of the class of subsequent knowledge they are with the three realms as basis basis is another name for group  In name there are the sixteen aspects The actual entities are sometimes said to be sixteen Free from the sixteen aspects there is no pure one after removal of ignorance In name there are the sixteen aspects Impermanence frustration emptiness and nonself cause origin source and condition cessation peace excellence and escape path correct method practice and definite release Impermanence because of being grasped by multiple conditicns frustration because of being suppressed emptiness because of the antidote for the view of what belongs to a self nonself because of the antidote for the view of a self Cause because of the characteristic of seed  origin because of arouser source because of successiveness condition because of mutual maturity because of appeasing three fires excellence be definite release because of being beyond the limit Furthermore impermanence because of having no   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya limit frustration because of heavy burden emptiness because of having no inward personality nonself because of being not selfwilled Cause because of future effort origin because of producing effort source because of expansion condition because of being basis Cessation because of not being successive and being free from successiveness peace because of being free from the three characteristic marks of what is conditioned excellence because of being good and because of permanence escape because of highest peace Path because of the antidote against the false medium correct method because of the antidote against what is incorrect practice because of climbing to the fortress of nirvana  How many aspects do the actual entities have Answer The actual entities are sometimes said to be sixteen These are called the sixteen aspects Some say that there are seven actual entities concerning the aspects of frustration there are four natnes and also four actual entities because they are the antidote for what is overturned Concerning the aspects of the origin there are four names and one actual entity The same applies to cessation and to the path In this way speaking of sixteen names and also of sixteen actual entities is right Question Is there still pure wisdom free from the sixteen aspects Answer Free from the sixteen aspects there is no pure one after removal of ignorance Free from the sixteen aspects there is no pure wisdom Just as a scriptural Knowledge  text says My births have ended this also concerns the births of such aspects as frustration that have ended It is as stating I fell a tree Who fells The axe fells The same applies to this Question How many aspects does each of these knowledges have Answer Two knowledges are with the sixteen aspects knowledge of the law and subsequent knowledge Either with these aspectsor not the conventional knowledge is spoken of Two knowledges are with the sixteen aspects knowledge of the law and subsequent knowledge All knowledges of the law and subsequent knowledges proceed in the sixteen aspects as they have been spoken of Either with these aspects or not the conventional knowledge is spoken of The conventional knowledge proceeds in the sixteen aspects and is also not in the sixteen aspects With the sixteen aspects such roots of merit as warmth that are with the sixteen aspects The same applies to other unfixed wisdom through learning and through reasoning What is not so is as being with a disease as the proceeding of cancer This is called not Question When the conventional knowledge is with the sixteen aspects why then is it not said to be called knowledge of frustration up to knowledge of the path Answer Because of the mingled object Pure aspects are with an unmingled object because they take a separate  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya truth as supporting object impure aspects are with a mingled object The impure aspect impermanence is with three truths as supporting object the aspects emptiness and without self are with all factors as supporting object G Four knowledges have four aspects that are said to be certain aspects When a knowledge knows the awareness of another it either is with such aspects or not Four knowledges have four aspects that are said to be certain aspects Knowledge of frustration has four aspects The same applies up to knowledge of the path When a knowledge knows the awareness of another it either is with such aspects or not Pure knowledge of the awareness of another is with the four aspects of the path This is not so for impure knowledge because of the object with specific characteristic marks  The knowledge of destruction and the knowledge of nonorigination are free from the aspects emptiness and without self and are said to have fourteen aspects Because of being near to what is conventional The knowledge of destruction and the knowledge of nonorigination are free from the aspects emptiness and without self and are said to have fourteen aspects The knowledge of destruction and the knowledge of nonorigination are with fourteen aspects exception made for the aspects emptiness and without self Knowledge  Question Why are they not with the aspects emptiness and without self Answer Because of being near to what is conventional The knowledge of destruction and the knowledge of nonorigination are the highest truth and are near to what is conventional The aspects emptiness and without self are the highest truth and are near to the extreme Question By whom can these aspects be practised Are they also practised by another What is their nature Answer  It is wisdom that can proceed in the aspects It is also where something else proceeds in The rest that are with basis are twofold Without basis is where something else proceeds in It is wisdom that can proceed in the aspects It is also where something else proceeds in The specific nature of wisdom is proceeding Regarding jfeyam it can proceed in such aspects as impermanence and this is also practised by such aspects as the one of impermanence The rest that are with basis are twofold Exception made for wisdom also the other associated factors can proceed because of being with supporting object because they are that which is taken as supporting cbject by something else They are not with the aspects because they are not with the nature of wisdom Without basis is where something else proceeds in When these dissociated factors matter the unconditioned ones and the formations dissociated from aware Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya nesses are that where something else proceeds in they are not with the aspects because they are not with the nature of wisdom they are not what can proceed because of being without supporting object The establishment of aspects has already been spoken of The establishment of acquisition shall now be spoken of The primary pure awareness sometimes accomplishes one The second one sometimes accomplishes three Four moments each add one sometimes accomplishes one The primary awareness associated with patience regarding the law in relation to frustration accomplishes one when not with nonattachment yet the conventional knowledge with nonattachment it accomplishes the knowledge of the awareness of another The second one sometimes accomplishes three The second awareness associated with knowledge of the law in relation to frustration accomplishes three knowledges when not yet with nonattachment knowledge of frustration knowledge of the law and conventional knowledge with nonattachment it accomplishes the knowledge of the awareness of another Four moments each add one At the higher four moments there each time is increase Subsequent knowledge in relation to frustration is with four knowledges when not yet with nonattachment With patience no knowledge is acquired because of not being with the nature of knowledge Subsequent knowledge in relation to the origin the one in relation to cessation and the one in relation to the path do not accumulate knowledge because subsequent knowledge in relation to frustration acquires the name The accomplishment of knowledge has already been spoken of Spiritual practice shall now be spoken of  The Spiritual practice which is obtaining regarding knowledges abides in the noble path of vision It is exactly developing them as future The same applies to patience The spiritual practice which is obtaining regarding knowledges abides in the noble path of vision It is exactly developing them as future Knowledge of the path of vision developed presently exactly is developed as future knowledge of the law in relation to frustration developed presently is knowledge of the law in relation to frustration developed as future It is no patience and no other knowledge The same applies up to knowledge of the law in relation to the path The same applies to patience Patience regarding the law in relation to frustration developed presently exactly is developed as future It is no knowledge and no other  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya patience The same applies to all forms of patience Question Why does the path of vision only develop that which is homogeneous and does the spiritual path develop that which is homogeneous and that which is not homogeneous  Answer Because this first acquires the lineage Because the path of vision primarily sees the truths it is only with development of what is homogeneous Moreover because the path does not complicate because of being zealous and because the path is not conscious  In three of its awarenesses there is the spiritual practice which is obtaining regarding conventional knowledge It should be known that the very last awareness either develops seven or six In three of its awarenesses there is the spiritual practice which is obtaining regarding conventional knowledge Three awarenesses of the path of vision develop conventional knowledge at the limit of higher realisation subsequent knowledge in relation to frustration the one in relation to the origin and the one in relation to cessation When there is arising free from beings depending on the pretrance one develops the path of vision in one stage and conventional knowledge in two stages in the pretrance and in the realm of sexual passion When there is arising free from beings when depending on the first trance the path of vision in two stages and conven tional knowledge in three stages is developed Up to with the fourth trance the path of vision in six stages and conventional knowledge in seven stages is developed Knowledge  Question Why is it that at the limit of subsequent knowledge in relation to the path no conventional knowledge is developed Answer Because limit is not being part of it and something is called limit of higher realisation because of development at the limit of higher realisation of a truth With the ability to develop all paths and the Buddhalimit there is no knowing of all frustration its origin and cessation Furthermore the conventional knowledge regarding these truths can be developed because of higher realisation because of being the adjacent of the path of vision The conventional knowledge of the limit of higher realisation is the adjacent of the path of vision Subsequent knowledge in relation to the path is of the spiritual path That is why it is not developed in the realm of formlessness because there is no path of vision  Question Why is knowledge of the law not developed Answer Because higher realisation cf the truths is not accomplished If it were accomplished it would have been spoken of among the forms of higher realisation When of the realm of sexual passion something is with the nature of four aggregates because of being not concenitrated when of the realm of form something is with the nature of the five aggregates because of being concentrated If there is being concentrated there is the aggregate matter because there is matter accompanying concentration That is why there are the five aggregates Because there is increase of knowledge the development of conventional knowledge is spoken of At the limit of higher realisation of frustration there are four things The one of the realm of sexual passion takes frustration of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the realm of sexual passion as supporting object the one of the realm of form takes frustration of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness as supporting object The same applies to the limit of higher realisation of the origin and to the one of cessation This concerns nonarisen factors because of depending on the faithfollower and on the doctrinefollower This faithfollower and doctrinefollower accomplish it when not present  Jt should be known that the very last awareness either develops seven or six When subsequent knowledge in relation to the path is acquired with nonattachment there is future development of seven knowledges exception made for the conventional knowledge for the knowledge of destruction and for the knowledge of nonorigination When not yet without attachment six knowledges are developed exception made for the knowledge of the awareness of another When developing the antidote for the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification the conventional knowledge is not developed in relation to the path because it is not its antidote  It should be known that seven are developed in the seventeen pure awarenesses of the higher spiritual path With the growing of faculties there sometimes are six It should be known that seven are developed in the seventeen pure awarenesses of the higher spiritual path When not free from the six forms of desire yet there is development of seven knowledges when entering the nine proximate paths and eight paths of liberation from the fruit of srotadpannaship onward Because this path is included Knowledge  in the pretrance there is no knowledge of the awareness of another Because the knowledge of destruction and the knowledge of nonorigination are having no more learning to do they are not developed The other seven knowledges are definitely developed When the conventional knowledge is with nonattachment the one conventional knowledge is developed presently and seven are developed as future when pure the four knowledges of the law are one by one developed presently and seven as future With the growing of faculties there sometimes are six With the proximate path of the one given to faith who seeks to become the viewattainer six knowledges are developed no knowledge of the awareness of another because of being contrary to the proximate path no conventional knowledge because of being similar to the path of vision no knowledge of destruction or knowledge of nonorigination because these are having no more learning to do When not yet without attachment these six are also developed with the path of liberation when with nonattachment seven knowledges are developed That is why it is said to be sometimes With the nine proximate aths of the one who will penetrate who becomes the steadfast one  seven knowledges are developed no knowledge of the awareness of another because of being contrary to the proximate path no conventional knowledge because of being no antidote for the summit of existence no knowledge of nonorigination because that one is not acquired yet With eight paths of liberation eight knowledges are developed because there also is acquisition of knowledge of the awareness of another With the ninth path of liberation the ten knowledges are developed That is why it is said to be sometimes   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  At the moment oft the acquisition of the fruit of nonreturning when being free from the higher seven Stages with the mixed development and the ones of liberation or with higher faculties eight are developed Because with the acquisition of the fruit of anagaminship the fundamental trances definitely are acquired eight knowledges are developed  exception made for the knowledge of destruction and for the knowledge of nonorigination At the moment of being with nonattachment in the four trances and in three immaterial ones these seven stages eight knowledges are developed with the nine paths of liberation At the moment of nonattachment of the worldly path the conventional knowledge is developed presently and eight are developed as future When the pure path is with nonattachment such six knowledges as the one of frustration are one by one developed presently and eight as future The six knowledges are subsequent knowledge in relation to frustration and subsequent knowledge in relation to the origin the one in relation to cessation and the one in relation to the path and knowledge of the law in relation to cessation and the one in relation to the path With the one path of liberation of the mixed development of trance the seeker develops eight knowledges the adept develops the ten knowledges With the one path of liberation of the footing of supernatural power of knowledge of the mental makeup of others and of the higher faculty of the former existences also eight knowledges are developed because of being included in the fundamental trances c With the path of liberation of the divine eye and of Knowledge  the divine ear they are not developed because of being neutral The moment of acquiring the above three higher faculties and the later moment of enjoyment of them are all the path of liberation The paths of liberation are all  the other two because they see what is subtle and what is remote Because the one of the eye and the one of the ear are without this they are neutral  It should be known that with all these proximate paths and with extinguishing in the summit of existence exactly these eight liberations seven are developed With the proximate paths of being with nonattachment in seven stages with the two proximate paths of mixed development of trance and with the five proximate paths of the higher faculties of the seeker seven stages with nonattachment and with mixed development form a proximate path by means of one conventional knowledge and one pure knowledge have one proximate path five are spoken of  seven knowledges are developed exception made for the knowledge of the awareness of another because it is contrary to the proximate path With the eight paths of liberation of being with nonattachment in the summit of existence seven knowledges are developed exception made for the conventional knowledge because it is nc antidote  With the proximate paths of being with nonattachment in the summit of existence  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya six are developed It should be known that when climbing up those of lower stages are developed With the proximate paths of being with nonattachment in the summit of existence six are developed With the nine proximate paths of being with nonattachment in the summit of existence six knowledges are developed exception made for knowledge of the awareness of another and for the conventional knowledge With all paths of preparation impure or pure eight knowledges are developed It should be known that when climbing up those of lower stages are developed With nonattachment in this stage exactly pure knowledge of this stage and of the lower stage is developed In the first trance with nonattachment the qualities of the first trance and of the pretrance are developed In this way up to development of pure qualities of all stages when being with nonattachment in the summit of existence The above antidote is called climbing up In the primary awareness of the adept there is development regarding all stages It is development of what is similar to having no more learning to do Sometimes subsequent knowledge in relation to frustration or the one in relation to the origin Tn the primary awareness of the adept there is development regarding all stages With the primary awareness associated with the knowledge of destruction of the adept qualities of nine stages are developed Knowledge  Question Which form of qualities of the adept are developed Answer It is developmentof what is similar to having no more learning to do With the one who falls back minorminor qualities of nine stages are developed up to the development of excessiveexcessive qualities with the stage of the tathagata  Question Which knowledge is the primary awareness of the adept Answer My births have ended This is because in the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification the condition for birth of four aggregates is ended as very last The development of pure qualities has already been spoken of Impure ones shall now be spoken of Together with the awareness of knowledge of destruction there is development of goodimpure qualities Jt is from nine stages to one stage With the succession of development there is reduction At the moment of the acquisition of the fruit of ahatship sometimes goodimpure qualities of nine stages are developed up to sometimes of one stage Question Why nine stages up to one stage   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Answer Gl y  When arising in the realm of sexual passion impure ones of nine stages are developed When arising in the summit of existence they are developed in one stage With the acquisition of the fruit of arhatship when having arisen in the realm of sexual passion there is acquisition of the roots of merit of nine stages developed by the knowledge of destruction When arising in the first trance those of eight stages are developed exception made for the ones of the realm of sexual passion The same applies up to the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification it exactly is with development of the roots of merit of this stage Question Why are the roots of merit of the three realms developed regarding this residence Answer Because disjunction of all bonds has been appeased eternally when the three forms of bonds are disjunctioned one is as it were a hero who has suppressed defilement Just as when a king mounts the throne is liberated and inaugurated all contribute rare and precious things Although the qualities of a lower stage were acquired first the radiance of kr wledge does not shine because of the defilement of a higher stage With the acquisition of the fruit of arhatship all qualities are developed cumulatively and one is shining The meaning of spiritual practice shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Investigations  Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of Knowledge  vision knowledge and wisdom Are they one or are they different Answer G yr Patience is no knowledge The one of destruction and the one of nonorigination are nonvision It should be known that all other noble wisdom is with a threefold nature Patience is no knowledge Eight kinds of higher realisation are patience and no knowledge because it are no certainties because of acquisition of a bond through perplexity in relation to the antidote of the specific class Because the meaning of certainty is the meaning of knowledge Furthermore patience is seeking for hope knowledge is appeasing hope Furthermore patience is vision and is not with the nature of knowledge The one of destruction and the one of nonorigination are nonvision The knowledge of destruction and the knowledge of nonorigination are nonvision because of appeasing seeking because of evenness because of turning ones back to transmigration Tt should be known that all other noble wisdom is with a threefold nature Exception made for patience and for the knowledge of destruction and the knowledge of nonorigination the other kinds of wisdom are vision because they can seek they are knowledge because of certainty Question Which are these Answer and right  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya view of the adept Gisy When goodimpure knowledge abides in the one of the mind it is vision Vision of defilement is knowledge These and the rest are said to be wisdom Goodimpure knowledge of the stage of the mind is vision because it can seek Some say that not all goodimpure knowledge associated with consciousness of the mind is with the nature of vision what is produced from that which is of the group of the forms of consciousness that do not deliberate is therefore nonvision  The awareness of death is nonvision because of being weak Producing awarenesses are nonvision because of being oriented outwardly In this way what is right is namely what has been said first of all explanations the one that makes sense is called right explanation Vision of defilement is knowledge Withthe specific nature of vision are such as belief in a self Because of arising from deliberation they are said to be vision They are also said to be knowledge because of certainty These and the rest are said to be wisdom It should be known that those said to be either knowledge or vision and the ones not spoken of yet the neutral ones associated with consciousness of the mind and exception made for the five views the other defiled ones of the stage of the mind Knowledge  and all that are associated with five forms of consciousness are all wisdom When the ones that have not been spoken of yet are spoken of neutral wisdom is nonvision because of not being zealous Although crafty wisdom is zealous it is nonvision because of being obstructed by seeking for birth The defiled one has been spoken of already previously Wisdom associated with five forms of consciousness is nonvision because it does not differentiate because it is not zealous and because of being onesided Question How many knowledges do the knowledges one by one take as supporting object Answer Knowledge of the law and subsequent knowledge understand nine knowledges Knowledge of the cause and knowledge of the fruit are with two knowledges as object Knowledge of the law and subsequent knowledge understand nine knowledges Knowledge of the law takes nine knowledges as supporting object exception made for subsequent knowledge Also subsequent knowledge takes nine knowledges as supporting object exception made for knowledge of the law Question Why do they not take one another as supporting object when proceeding Answer Because of higher and lower objects Knowledge of the law takes what is lower as supporting object subse quent knowledge takes what is higher as supporting  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya object that is why they do not take one another as supporting object when proceeding Just as two persons who abide together one person observes that which is lower one person observes that which is higher Because earth and sky are observed in a different way they do not see one anothers face When stating that not taking oneself as supporting object is as not seeing ones own face this is not right because of successive observation Knowledge of the cause and knowledge of the fruit are with two knowledges as object because of being included in the truth of frustration and in the one of the origin Knowledge of the path is with nine knowledges as supporting object knowledge of liberation is without supporting object The rest are with all as object This is what the One with Certain Knowledge has said Knowledge of the path is with nine knowledges as supporting object Knowledge of the path is with nine knowledges as supporting object exception made for the conventional knowledge the other nine knowledges are the supporting object because of being included in the truth of the path Knowledge of liberation is without supporting object Knowledge of cessation does not take a knowledge as supporting object because of taking that which is unconditioned as supporting object The rest are with all as object This is what the One with Knowledge  Certain Knowledge has said The other four knowledges are the knowledge of the awareness of another the conventional knowledge the knowledge of destruction and the knowledge of nonorigination They take the ten knowledges as supporting object Question As has been said previously that the antidote for the realm of sexual passion is knowledge of the law although it is the antidote for the realm of form and for the one of formlessness it is not for everything and not for something complete What makes knowledge of the law to the antidote for the realm of form and for the one of formlessness Answer When this knowledge of the law proceeds in cessation and in the path it is the antidote for the three realms It is not the realm of sexual passion by subsequent knowledge When this knowledge of the law proceeds in cessation and in the path it is the antidote for the three realms In relation to the spiritual path there are knowledge of the law in relation to cessation and knowledge of the law in relation to the path These are the antidote for what is to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the three realms These see the faults regarding the realm of sexual passion in an extreme way reflect on cessation of formations of the realm of sexual passion and on the antidote and achieve to be free from desire of the three realms   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question Why is it no knowledge of the law in relation to frustration or the one in relation to the origin Answer Because what is lower is weak and what is higher is superior It is no weak observation that can disjunction from desire of a higher residence Cessation and the path are both superior that is why the observation of this extinguishes the desire of the three realms Furthermore it is not right that when with the realm of sexual passion as supporting object and being free from the realm of form and from the one of formlessness there is a different aversion a different unhappiness and a different liberation Question Is there somehow subsequent knowledge that disjunctions from the realm of sexual passion Answer It is not the realm of sexual passion by subsequent knowledge There is no subsequent knowledge that is the antidote for the realm of sexual passion because the specific duty is not accomplished yet To knowledge of the law the same applies as to a king who after having subjected the enemies in his own sphere subjects the others later There is no subsequent knowledge that first extinguishes the realm of form and the one of formlessness and later extinguishes the realm of sexual passion Moreover knowledge of the law is an extremely keen knowledge When it extinguishes that which is bad how much the more is this so for that which is neutral Question With the nature of how many knowledges are the higher faculties Answer Knowledge   The Sooting of supernatural power and the divine eye and ear are said to be with the one conventional knowledge Sometimes six knowledges with the one of the former existences Five are said to be with the knowledge of the mental makeup of others The footing of supernatural power and the divine eye and ear are said to be with the one conventional knowledge The footing of supernatural power the divine eye and the divine ear are with the one conventional knowledge Pure knowledge does not proceed through them The footing of supernatural power concerns manifold manifestations The higher faculty of the divine ear is wisdom associated with consciousness of the divine ear The higher faculty of birth and death is wisdom associated with consciousness of the divine eye The footing of supernatural power shall be spoken of in another chapter The divine ear doing effort when reflecting on great sounds and when this effort increases gradually the clean divine ear formed by the four elements of the realm of form is acquired Whether sounds are remote or near they are all heard The divine eye doing effort when reflecting on the clear characteristic marks and when this effort increases gradually the clean divine eye formed by the four elements of the realm of form is acquired regarding the roundness of the eye When abiding in one direction the ten directions are observed Everything is seen but not simultaneously  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Sometimes six knowledges with the one of the former existences The venerable Ghosaka has been speaking of six knowledges no knowledge of the awareness of another because this takes the present because this takes what is unconditioned as supporting object no knowledge of destruction or knowledge of nonorigination because these are not with the nature of vision The Abhidharmikas say that it is the one conventional knowledge because it takes such as name and surname of beings as supporting object The effort either is regarding oneself or regarding someone else The sravaka and the pratyekabuddha are produced from a former body and up to their accomplishment it is according to what they desired It is only the tathagata who is selfdependent according to what he wishes Whether earlier or later according to what is heard or seen everything is reflected upon Five are said to be with the knowledge of the mental makeup of others Five knowledges know the awarenesses of another knowledge of the law knows the awarenesses and accompanying mental factors of the class of knowledge of the law of others because that which is homogeneous is the object The same applies to subsequent knowledge Knowledge of the path knows the pure awarenesses and accompanying mental factors of others The conventional knowledge knows the conventional awarenesses and accompanying mental factors of others The knowledge of the awareness of another is the fifth a body with such charKnowledge  acteristic marks has a mind with such characteristic marks By means of this effort the roots of merit increase gradually up to knowing the awarenesses and accompanying mental factors of others This is called accomplishment At the moment of reaching accomplishment when produced regarding the effort of matter and regarding the own mind matter and the own mind are not taken as supporting object and free from aspect and supporting object there is knowing the awareness of another Degree of the faculties minor ones do not know middle or excessive faculties up to minor ones of the stage of the fourth trance only know the pure ones among the weak ones of a lower stage The impure ones know the impure ones and do not know the pure ones Degree of the stage the first trance does not know the second trance the seeker does not know the adept That is why the awarenesses and accompanying mental factors of Buddha are not the object of every knowledge of the awareness of another Every knowledge of the awareness of another is with the actual entity as object with the specific characteristic marks as object with awarenesses and accompanying mental factors as object with the present as object and with awareness of another as object Exception has to be made for the path of vision it is to be achieved through the spiritual path It is dissociated from emptiness and from signlessness The knowledge of destruction and the knowledge of nonorigination are not included in it Question Do the higher faculties arise as spoken of or differently  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Answer Sometimes it is said they arise as spoken of Just as because the Worldhonoured One has been speaking of the footing of supernatural power first it therefore arises first Up to the knowledge of birth and death that arises last because it has been spoken of last The venerable Ghosaka said that the higher faculties produced with the realm of sexual passion as residence arise as has been spoken of When in the realm of form it is different from this the devotee hears speaking about the gods of the realm of form and does not see them Because of longing to see them the divine eye is produced Seeing them he cannot go to them therefore the footing of supernatural power is produced Going to them he does not hear their explanations therefore the divine ear is produced Although hearing them he does not know where their mind abides in therefore the knowledge of the mental makeup of others is produced js produced Spoken of in this way the higher faculties are without successive meditative attainment also without transgressing meditative attainment also without following meditative attainment and also without running counter to meditative attainment It should be known that since the higher faculties are included in the path of liberation it is not in the proximate path Question With the nature of how many knowledges are the powers knowledge and confidences one by one Answer Knowledge   The power knowledge of the possible and impossible and the first confidence are with the ten knowledges of Buddha The rest are to be differentiated in them With the nature of which knowledge are the other powers knowledge and forms of confidence Answer  The rest are to be differentiated in them Differentiating the power knowledge of the possible and impossible there are the other powers knowledge differentiating the first confidence there are the other confidences The Worldhonoured One observed the hope of pupils and that is why many forms were established Question Why did the Worldhonoured One speak about the own qualities Answer For the development of the samadhi of recollection on Buddha with the ones who seek for the path of Buddha furthermore because difference is present regarding right liberation for finding satisfaction with the explanation of perspicuity For the ones who are with perplexity and do not know whose power it is when being without stopping without obstruction and without lack up to when a drunken elephant is subjected the own power is manifested Furthermore the real qualities are spoken of for the pupils Because He does not exceed the right measure because of being free from the qualities of A Samyuktabhidharmahydaya small people  Clean action has a desired fruit the fruit of foul action is disliked this is said to be this possible When different it is said to be impossible The power knowledge of the possible and impossible should be known in this way Clean action has a desired fruit the fruit of foul action is disliked Cause and fruit are determined The unhindered knowledge of this is knowing that this is the certain cause clean ac tion has a desired fruit and foul action is with a disliked fruit just as with the outward seed as cause the fruit is similar as to species When different it is said to be impossible What is contrary to this is called impossible The power knowledge of the possible and impossible should be known in this way The meaning of experiencing the arouser is the meaning of the possible What is contrary to this is called the meaning of the impossible Power knowledge is spoken of because of not subjecting oneself and not submitting oneself because of no superiority and no movement These ten knowledges are its specific nature It abides in eleven stages It is said with certainty to be the tathagata It is with Jambudvipa as basis As has been said previously it is with the specific nature of the ten Knowledge  knowledges because of the general object It takes all factors as supporting object It is with the sixteen aspects or free from aspects It is associated with the four applications of mindfulness with three meditative attainments and with three faculties It abides in eleven stages The realm of sexual passion the four trances the preand the intermediate one and the four immaterial ones It is said with certainty to be the tathagata It is said to be established through the power of the tathdgata not the one of the sravaka or of the pratyekabuddha because the tathagata excludes two forms of noncognisance the defiled one and the undefiled one That is why the knowledge of Buddha is not submitted to what is no knowledge This is having no more learning to do and neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do no still having learning to do The sravaka and the pratyekabuddha only exclude the defiled one and do not exclude the undefiled one The tathdgata excludes two forms of perplexity This body is only present in Jambudvipa because in the other directions there is no Buddha rising in the world Since humans in Jambudvipa are with keen faculties it is easy to make them awake That is why Buddha only rose in the world in Jambudvipa  The second power knowledge is with eight knowledges This thing proceeds regarding action having to be felt and defilement The rest is as has been said before  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The second power knowledge is with eight knowledges The power knowledge of retribution of action is with eight knowledges exception made for knowledge of cessation and for knowledge of the path because of the pure supporting object It is with aspects or free from aspects It is associated with emptiness and with aimlessness Question What does it take as supporting object Answer This thing is the fruit of action bodily action verbal action and thinking is action As far as having to be felt is concerned there are four forms of having to be felt there is pleasant feeling in the past and pleasant feeling in the future it is to be compared in this way Defilement is the cause of action When proceeding in these it is produced with these as supporting object The rest is as has been said before The rest is as has been said with the power knowledge of the possible and impossible   Tn trances liberations meditative attainments and samadhis the third power knowledge proceeds It is with nine knowledges The rest is as before The trances are the four trances the liberations are the eight liberations the meditative attainments are meditative attainment without conceptual identification meditative atKnowledge  tainment of cessation and the four immaterial ones the samadhis are emptiness signlessness and aimlessness The third power knowledge proceeds regarding these trances liberations meditative attainments and samddhis and is produced with these as supporting object Question With which nature is this power knowledge Answer With the nature of nine knowledges exception made for knowledge of cessation the four aspects of cessation and the samadhi of signlessness because of the unconditioned supporting object The rest is as before The rest is said to be as with the power knowledge of retribution of action Regarding excessive and minor faculties the fourth power knowledge proceeds The fifth is said to be the power knowledge of resolve The sixth takes dispositions as supporting object Regarding excessive and minor faculties Excessive is superior minor is weak faculties are the main thing The fourth power knowledge The power knowledge of higher and lower faculties Proceeding Taking as supporting object as supporting object Because of being produced from the effort of taking faculties as supporting object the power knowledge of higher and lower faculties is spoken of as the knowledge of the mental makeup of others Resolve is lust Also this is twofold superior and weak Superior is good lust weak is bad lust Furthermore lust for the path and for the fruits of the path is superior lust for transmigration is weak Also  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya this takes three truths as supporting object Because of being produced from the lust as effort it is said to be the power of lust The sixth takes dispositions as supporting object Dispositions are its specific nature There are two forms as has been said previously Regarding manifold courses the seventh power knowledge proceeds It should be known that for the four that have been spoken of already the rest is all as has been said previously Regarding manifold courses the seventh power knowledge proceeds Course is the path Also this is manifold from the direction of hell up to nirvana as supporting object it is called the power knowledge of the courses Jt should be known that for the four that have been spoken of already the rest is all as has been said previously The power knowledge of higher and lower faculties the one of resolve the one of dispositions and the one of the courses have already been spoken of The other reasons should be known as said with the one of trances liberations meditative attainments and samadhis Sometimes it is said that the power knowledge of the courses is with the nature of the ten knowledges   Knowing that former existences have formations is said to be the eighth power knowledge It is trance It has defilement The rest is as has been said before Knowledge S is oO Knowing that former existences have formations is said to be the eighth power knowledge The power knowledge of the former existences is completely knowing what is experienced in former existences what has proceeded and what was felt What has proceeded is intermediate existence what was felt is existence at former time because existence at former time has what is felt a Either ksatriya or brahmana compared in this way all are to be known This power knowledge of the former existences is said to be with one knowledge what has ever been acquired and what is to be acquired now excessive middle and minor are said to be three when the stages are established four are spoken of minor middle and excessive ever acquired and to be acquired now are said to be six stages ever acquired and to be acquired now are said to be eight minorminor up to excessiveexcessive are said to be nine differentiated as to stages and as to minor middle and excessive twelve are spoken of such as minorminor ever acquired and to be acquired now are said to be eighteen stages and minor middle and excessive ever acquired and to be acquired now are said to be twentyfour differentiated as to stages and as to such as minorminor   thirtysix are spoken of stages and such as minorminor ever acquired and to be acquired now are said to be seventytwo The fundamental trances no adjacent ones and no immaterial ones because these are without the samadhi where the higher faculties depend upon The samadhi that is included in the four members and in the five members is that on which the higher faculties de Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya pend It are only trances not the other ones When the higher faculty of former existences is acquired depending on a certain trance it exactly is knowing this trance and the lower stages When a higher faculty is acquired depending on the first trance it is knowing the first trance and the intermediate one because of being one and the same stage Tt has defilement This has been spoken of already previously It concerns the conventional knowledge That is why it is without pure things It is with the application of mindfulness on factors The rest is as has been said before As has been said with the power knowledge of the courses  The ninth power knowledge should be known as remote from its supporting object It is death and rearising It proceeds regarding that which is relating to beings The ninth power knowledge should be known as remote from its supporting object The power knowledge of birth and death is exception made for its supporting object as has been said concerning the knowledge of the former existences When a sravaka does not exceed himself he sees one chiliocosm when he exceeds himself he sees a dvichiliocosm When the pratyekabuddha does not exceed himself he sees a dvichiliocosm when he exceeds himself he sees a trichiliocosm one hundred million times one hundred times one thousand times a trichiliocosm Knowledge  Question What is its supporting object Answer It is death and rearising It proceeds regarding that which is relating to beings It takes the sensefield matter as supporting object as has been said Know that the true knowledge of having to be felt that follows action is said to concern its dependence Knowledge of birth and death is the inward factor The tenth power knowledge is with the ten knowledges or with six It is with all stages It is wonder power understanding and higher faculty The rest is all as has ben said before The tenth power knowledge is with the ten knowledges or with six Speaking of what the person who has destroyed impure influences acquires the knowledge of destruction of impure influence is said to be with the nature of the ten knowledges When it is the knowledge of destruction of impure influence because of taking the destruction of impure influence as supporting object this is said to be with six knowledges exception made for the knowledge of the awareness of another for knowledge of frustration the one of the origin and the one of the path It is with all stages The knowledge of destruction of impure influence abides in eleven stages because of being included in rearising Tt is wonder power understanding and higher faculty This knowledge of destruction of impure influence is said to be called wonder miraculous admonition because of letting joy be unshakeable power is spoken of because of being free from ignorance eternally understanding is spoken of because of the lineage of higher  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya faculties higher faculty is spoken of The power knowledge of former existences and the power knowledge of birth and death are said to be higher faculty understanding and power no wonder This is neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do How then do the scriptural texts say that three kinds of understanding are absolutely having ao more learning to do Answer Because they are acquired in the group of the adept because they implicate highest understanding Question Why do only three higher faculties of the six higher faculties establish understanding  Answer Because three kinds are the antidote for ignorance This first kind of understanding extinguishes ignorance concerning what is past  the second extinguishes ignorance concerningwhat is later the third extinguishes ignorance concerning the noble truths because they implicate the three gates to liberation the footing of supernatural power and the knowledge of the mental makeup of others two that are understanding are no wonder the knowledge of former existences and the knowledge of birth and death the higher faculty of destruction of impure influence has all the higher faculty of the divine earhas none The rest is all as has been said before The reasons of the rest that has not been spoken of yet are as has been said before The powers knowledge have already been spoken of The confidences shall now be spoken of Knowledge   The first is as the first power knowledge The second is as the tenth The other two are as the second and the seventh These are called confidences The first is as the first power knowledge When stating I am the Fully Awakened One this is the first confidence This exactly is the power knowledge of the possible and impossible The second is as the tenth When stating I have already destroyed impure influence this exactly is the power knowledge of destruction of impure influence The other two are as the second and the seventh These are called confidences When stating I have been speaking about the factors that obstruct the path to all disciples then that one is without fear that someone states that they do not obstruct the path This exactly is the power knowledge of retribution of action I have been speaking about the path to all disciples it is definite release to the noble there is no fear that someone states that it is no definite release It should be known that this exactly is the power knowledge of the courses Question Why did the Worldhonoured One explain by means of these scriptural texts Answer For curing the slander of Sunaksatra and of Bhatadvaja He explained these scriptural texts The Sramana Gautama is without doctrine that surpasses man to cure this He has been speaking about the first two confidences  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Furthermore the first two confidences are speaking about what is safe for oneself the last two confidences are speaking about bringing safety to someone else The meaning of not submitting is the meaning of confidence because of being free from fear Question What is the difference between the powers knowledge and the confidences Answer Some say that there is no difference Moreover it is said that knowledge is the powers knowledge and that the shining of knowledge that glows generally is the confidences Uninterruptedness of knowledge is the powers knowledge uninterruptedness of discrimination is the confidences such as this Furthermore the powers knowledge are one by one included in the four confidences the confidences are one by one included in the ten powers knowledge These fourteen factors and also three unique applications of mindfulness and great compassion are the eighteen unique factors of Buddha Unique because they are not general for all sravakas and pratyekabuddhas The unique applications of mindfulness and great compassion are with the nature of wisdom  Question In which stage with which aspects and present in which residence is being without fighting What is its supporting object Which persons produce it What is its specific nature Being without fighting only abides in the fourth trance because of the general object because it is the most superior one of all bases It is with impurity Because of being free from noble conduct It is without fighting Because of being contrary to defilement It is with three directions as basis It is only present in three directions because it is said to be produced through power It takes not yet arisen defilement of the one of sexual passion as supporting object It takes future defilement of the realm of sexual passion as supporting object defilement with the specific characteristic marks attachment hatred delusion and pride not the general characteristic marks The general characteristic marks are the general object That is why the four applications of mindfulness are acquired It is associated with the faculty equanimity tt depends on the steadfast one Because it is acquired when depending on a body free from defilement and because of the power samadhi it is what can be produced by the steadfast one a It is wisdom It is with the specific nature of wisdom because this arhat does not proceed in the five reasons one can let him not produce defilement right de    Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya portment and right speech differentiating what should be accepted and what should not be accepted understanding the state and understanding the person Right deportment sitting with the body upright in one direction when there is a person coming exactly observing his mind understanding this mind as to which deportment does not let fetters be produced When this deportment does not let them be produced it exactly is temporarily abiding in such deportment Right speech when there is a person coming exactly understanding his mind If when speaking these fetters are produced then there is no speech When they are produced when not together with speech then it is speech Differentiating what should be accepted and what should not be accepted when others give precious things exactly understanding these If when this giving would be accepted these fetters would be produced it is although needed not accepting them If they would be produced when not accepted it is although unneeded accepting them Understanding the state if when abiding in this state these fetters are produced it is abandoning precious things although they are overwhelming Understanding the person first understanding the person and then entering him When with house or road there is production of fetters there is not entering then How are bad conditions made regarding this Because of being included in something else this indecision is made Because of the moment of my defiled body of the past they have made me experience the disliked fruit because of defilement that I have produced How much more is this so for being with nonattachment now I have to do this ef  Knowledge  fort that in no way lets them produce defilement regard ing me Such as Buddha and the sravakas who develop the paramitas achieve the mauneya of being without fighting and no manifold entering because of letting beings achieve transgression depending on defilement there sometimes is no entering samadhi of being without fighting The socalled knowledge resulting from resolve is remote from its object It is acquired there as last It is with the nature of being selfdependent in relation to six knowledges The socalled knowledge resulting from resolve is remote from its object Also the knowledge resulting from resolve abides in the fourth trance It is with what is impure as basis It is acquired by the steadfast one of three directions It is with the nature of wisdom It takes all factors as supporting object because of the general object basis of the one of formlessness this basis is meaningful for the outcome because the realm of sexual passion and the one of form are the breath of the realm of formlessness they are called basis This is explaining the knowledge resulting from resolve as knowing the realm of formlessness depending on the natural fruit it is as a farm er the four applications of mindfulness are spoken of Because  it is to be known as knowledge resulting from resolve it is said to be knowledge resulting from resolve Wanting to know is its meaning Tt is acquired there as last At the moment this knowl Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya edge is produced the first trance is present in succession to good awarenesses of the realm of sexua passion In this way successively up to the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification in this way in reverse order up to good awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion further in succession up to the fourth trance that is present next regarding the fourth trance from minor to middle and from middle to excessive b After this excessive fourth trance the knowledge resulting from resolve is produced It is with the nature of being selfdependent in relation to six knowledges This knowledge is with the specific nature of six kinds three discriminations exception made for the discrimination of language moreover the knowledge of being without fighting the knowledge of the last limit and the knowledge resulting from resolve These knowledges are produced because of three reasons because of including something else because of including the dispensation of the doctrine and because of bringing peace to the ones who are not with peace yet since one is awakened for the world  The discrimination of the meaning is impure or pure It abides in all stages The explanations of Buddha are its preparation The rest is as has been said before The discrimination of the meaning is impure or pure This discrimination is with the nature of the ten knowledges because it concerns the highest truth of all factors Some say that it is with the nature of six knowledges exKnowledge  ception made for the knowledge of the awareness of another for knowledge of frustration the one of the origin and the one of the path because the truth of cessation is the extreme highest truth That is why the aspects the applications of mindfulness and samadhis are said to be its supporting object Tt abides in all stages This discrimination abides in eleven stages because of acquisition regarding specific natures The explanations of Buddha are its preparation Discrimination of the meaning takes the explanations of Buddha as preparation When there are no explanations of Buddha first then there is nothing that can produce it because one would not know the meaning The rest is as has been said before The rest that has not been spoken of yet is as has been said with the knowledge resulting from resolve  The socalled discrimination of perspicuity is with the path and with explanations as object The explanation of understanding in relation to the cause is its preparation Sometimes three When this discrimination is not prepared by means of the explanation of understanding in relation to  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the cause then there is nothing that can produce it because there is no knowing of what is perspicuous and of what is not perspicuous That is why the Abhidharma is said to be its preparation because there is nobody as the Abhidharmikas for explaining understanding in relation to the cause because their knowledge is complete Sometimes three This discrimination is with the nature of three knowledges discrimination the knowledge resulting from resolve and the last knowledge say that when the highest truth of all factors is known this also is the discrimination of the meaning The rest is as before The rest that has not been spoken of yet is as has been said with the discrimination of the meaning The discrimination of factors takes nominal designation as supporting object It abides in five stages It is with numbers as preparation The rest is as has been said with being without fighting The discrimination of factors takes nominal designation as supporting object The discrimination of factors takes limitation in name as supporting object It abides in five stages The realm of sexual passion and the four trances no higher stage because the realm of formlessness does not take name and lower stages as supporting object because they are not being part of it It is with numbers as preparation The discrimination of factors is with what is relating to number as preparation The rest is as has been said with being without fighting The rest that has not been spoken of yet is as has been said before with being without fighting Knowledge   With the explanation of understanding in relation to sound as preparation is the discrimination of language It is with teaching as object It is in two stages The rest is as before The discrimination of language takes the explanation of understanding in relation to sound as preparation When the understanding in relation to sound is not practised first then it cannot be produced because it would be free from seed It is in two stages The realm of sexual passion and the first trance no higher stage because of being free from initial thought and from sustained thought The rest is as has been said before is as has been said with the discrimination of factors Question Do the discriminations arise as has been spoken of or differently Answer Some say that they arise as has been spoken of regarding factors skilfulness in names is produced first Knowing names their meaning is not known yet therefore the discrimination of the meaning is produced successively Although the meaning is known language is not known yet therefore the discrimination of language is produced successively When language is already known one cannot explain swiftly  therefore the discrimination of perspicuity is produced successively  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Moreover it is said that the discrimination of the maning is produced first Knowing the meaning names are not known  therefore the discrimination of factors is produced successively Knowing names language is not known  therefore the discrimination of language is produced successively Knowing language one cannot explain swiftly  therefore the discrimination of perspicuity is produced successively The discrimination of perspicuity is as has been said previously Moreover it is said that names proceed according to what has been said that is why the discrimination of factors is produced Meaning depends on names for proceeding that is why the discrimination of the meaning is produced successively These three discriminations implicate Question How are these discriminations acquired One by one Answer It is not so When one is acquired then all four to this the same applies as to the four traditional practices of a monk that are achieved simultaneously Heart of Scholasticism with Miscellaneous Additions volume six Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Heart of Scholasticism with Miscellaneous Additions Volume Seven Chapter Seven Concentration Composed by the venerable Dharmatrata Translated by the Indian Tripitaka Samghavarman of the Sung and others  Knowledge depends on concentrations to proceed unshakeably That is why concentration should be reflected on and vision in relation to the highest truth should be zealously sought for of certainty is called knowledge What is successive to the righteousness of good awarenesses is cailed concentration The meaning of establishing is called basis There are two kinds of basis appearing simultaneously and the condition as direct antecedent It is said that these two are called basis Because of being established depending on concentration it is said to be a basis There are eight kinds of fixed knowledge four knowledges of the law and four subsequent knowledges  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Unshakeably Because something does not move it is said to be unshakeable Proceeding The meaning of taking a supporting object Just as a lantern depends on clean oil and a taper and when free from a windy place the shining is very clear in this way knowledge depends on concentration and free from the wind of disturbance it is unshakeable when proceeding That is why Speaking of the reason Concentration That on which knowledge depends This shall be spoken of later The meaning of knowledge and vision Zealously seeking the four noble truths This is said to be the vision of the highest truth Because true knowledge is not produced free from concentration Question How many forms of samadhi are there Answer The Certain One has been speaking of four trances and immaterial meditative attainments These are one by one said to be with relishing clean and pure The Certain one has been speaking of four trances and immaterial meditative attainments That eight kinds of samadhi include all samadhis has been said concisely by the One with Certain Knowledge the knowledge of the Worldhonoured One differentiates samadhis and meditative attainments All sravakas and pratyekabudConcentration  dhas do not know their names As has been said elaborately in the sutras These are one by one said to be with relishing clean and pure The samadhis are one by one said to be threefold with relishing clean and pure The goodimpure one is clean The pure one is free from burning The one with relishing is associated with craving In the highest one there is no pure one The goodimpure one is clean It should be known that the goodimpure one is clean Question The goodimpure one is with impurity how then is it said to be clean Answer Because it is contrary to defilement because it is not mingled with defilement because it implicates the pure one The pure one is free from burning Free from the burning of defilement something should be known as pure Although this one is the highest integrity since it is free from defilement eternally the establishment of its name should be known because of differentiating The one with relishing is associated with craving It should be known that if it concerns the form of concentration associated with craving it is the one associated with relishing Question Why is it that the one associated with craving is said to be a trance and not so for other defilement Answer Because of being similar Absolutely with  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya grasping a mixed supporting object is samadhi Other defilement is without being grasped as supporting object as craving is Furthermore since craving has been spoken of already it should be known that other defilement has already been spoken of because it is the footing of defilement In the highest one there is no pure one Because of this general saying one could state that the samadhis are one by one threefold It should be known however that the sum mit of existence only has two kinds and is without the pure one because of not being intense The two limits of existence are the realm of sexual passion and the summit of existence The noble path is free from the two limits and is called the middle mode of progress The same applies to being free from the roots of two forms of existence When what is associated with relishing is taken the form of meditative attainment is called meditative attainment with relishing when no relishing is taken the form of meditative attainment is called clean meditative attainment when pure and when such aspects as impermanence of the five aggregates are reflected upon pure meditative attainment should be known Question How many kinds of clean one are there Answer  The clean one has four members Concentration  What is connected to falling back is conformable to defilement what is conducive to maintenance is conformable to the specific stage what is connected to progress is conformable to a higher stage what is connected to penetration is conformable to the noble path Furthermore what is connected to falling back is falling back when abiding what is conducive to maintenance is neither progressing nor falling back when abiding what is connected to progress is being able to progress when abiding what is connected to penetration is successively being able to arise free from beings Furthermore what is connected to falling back i is that by which defilement is accumulated and mingled  in succession to the trances defilement is present and in succession to defilement the trances are present what is conducive to maintenance is what can be with aversion in relation to such aspects as being coarse of lower stages and can experience such aspects as peace of the specific stage what is connected to progress is what can be with aversion in relation to the mistakes of the specific stage and can experience the merit of higher stages what is connected to penetration is warmth summit patience and the highest worldly factor To the immaterial ones the same applies as to the trances sony exception made for such qualities as warmth Question With which nature are the trances Answer  The one with five members has initial thought and sustained thought There further are also three feelings  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya many forms and four awarenesses The one with five members is the one that is settled by five members The meaning of part is the meaning of member just as a chart has a multitude of parts The meaning of provision is the meaning of member just as a king has generals and nobility The members either are different or conformable When they are different they are as the six members of the Veda of the four Vedic scriptures the first is the Rgveda the second is the Atharvaveda the third is the Yajurveda the fourth is the Samaveda Veda is knowledge It is settled from six members the first is articulation the second is metre the third is ceremony the fourth is etymological interpretation the fifth is grammatical analysis the sixth is astronomy and as the five superior members of the bhiksu the first of the five superior members from which the bhiksu is settled is faith the second is no craftiness the third is no disease the fourth is energy and the fifth is knowledge When they are conformable they are as the sixteen members spread over the noble eightfold path These members are initial thought sustaized thought joy satisfaction and undivided attention At the moment of meditative attainment conceptual identification with the characteristic of coarse awarenesses called initial thought is made first That which proceeds subsequently to that which is with the characteristic of coarse awarenesses is called sustained thought When the mind is glad at the moment of meditative attainment this is called joy Satisfaction because body and mind are free from what is evil is called satisfaction This is satisfaction of tranquillity and no experiencing of Concentration  satisfaction Awarenesses and accompanying mental factors that are not dispersed regarding a supporting object is called undivided attention Being with initial thought and with sustained thought concerns the first trance that is with initial thought and with sustained thought Question The five members have already been spoken of Why is being with initial thought and with sustained thought spoken of separately Answer The members are good Because also what is defiled is with initial thought and sustained thought it is spoken of separately There further are also three feelings This one has three feelings in the group of three forms of consciousness there is the faculty satisfaction in the stage of the mind there is the faculty contentedness in the group of four forms of consciousness there is the faculty equanimity Many forms In the brahmaheaven there are manifold groups there is a superior and there is a weak because of arising from the power of initial thought and of sustained thought This one has four awarenesses consciousness of the eye consciousness of the ear consciousness of the body and consciousness of the mind This is said to be the first trance These factors are said to be the first trance Because of conquering every defilment and because of observing all objects ina right way trance is spoken of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  The second has four members many forms and is with two feelings The third is said to be with five members This trance is also with two feelings The second has four members Personal tranquillity joy satisfaction and undivided attention this one is not with many forms because initial thought and sustained thought are not being part of it there are many good awarenesses In the fundamental ones there is the faculty contentedness After contentedness is appeased the faculty equanimity of the adjacent one is present After equanimity is appeased the faculty contentedness is entered again And is with two feelings The faculty contentedness and the faculty equanimity These factors are said to be the second trance The third is said to be with five members Mindfulness tranquillisation satisfaction equanimity regarding conditioning factors this aspect equanimity regarding conditioning factors is as such aspects as the aspect permanence this is equanimity regarding conditioning factors not the faculty equanimity and undivided attention Mindfulness is no forgetting regarding a supporting object but remembering Tranquillisation is differentiating reflection at the moment of acting or of equanimity Satisfaction is what is successively experienced regarding a supporting object Equanimity regarding conditioning factors is that because satisfaction grasps satisfaction there is no experiencing of another exercise Undivided attention is not being dispersed regarding a supporting object This trance is also with two feelings Also this one is with two feelings the faculty satisfaction and the faculty Concentration  equanimity These factors are said to be the third trance Free from breathing in and breathing out the fourth has four members The members are spoken of regarding the good one According to the actual entities as they have been spoken of elaborately Free from breathing in and breathing out the fourth has four members The fourth trance is without breathing in and breathing out because with this meditative attainment the pores of the body are closed and the four elements are extremely dense The four members are neitherpleasantnorunpleasant equanimity regarding conditioning factors purity of mindfulness and undivided attention Neitherpleasantnorunpleasant is because of already being free from frustration or from satisfaction Concerning purity of mindfulness mindfulness is because of guarding the roots of merit and purity is because of being free from the eight secondary afflictions The eight secondary afflictions are four faculties initial thought sustained thought and breathing in and out because of being free from inward or outward distraction The meaning of distraction shall be spoken of in detail in the chapter Investigations Undivided attention is the mind that is not dispersed regarding a supporting object Question Why is it that with the first trance and with the second trance no tranquillisation is established  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Answer Because joy and initial thought and sustained thought are with distraction this kind of member is not established That is why also mindfulness is not established and also equanimity regarding conditioning factors is not established because appeasing satisfaction and equanimity regarding conditioning factors are contrary  Question Why is it that with the third trance neitherpleasantnorunpleasant is not established Answer Because of being conformable to the class of ignorance Understanding is contrary to ignorance Because of this meaning no tranquillisation is established with the fourth trance Question Do the three kinds of meditative attainment such as the one associated with relishing all accomplish members Answer The members are only spoken of regarding the good one It should be known that the good trance is associated with the members not the defiled one Question What does the defiled one not have Answer The first trance is without joy and satisfaction arisen from nonattachment because of being associated with defilement the second trance is without personal tranquillity because of being distracted by defilement the third trance is without mindfulness and tranquillisation because defilement and satisfaction are confused the fourth trance is without purity of mindfulness and equanimity regarding conditioning factors because of being contrary to defilement Furthermore the first trance and the second trance are Concentration  without appeasing satisfaction because of being absolutely good the third trance and the fourth trance are also without equanimity regarding conditioning factors According to the actual entities as they have been spoken of elaborately The trances have been spoken of previously according to the actual entities When further other trances are spoken of there is no increase with actual entities not had yet Just as both in relation to the first trance and to the second trance joy and satisfaction are spoken of It should be known that these two members are no four This is true for all stages Question How many of these members of trance are there Answer  The members of trances are eighteen in name Of actual entities there are eleven The immaterial ones do not have members There are eighteen names of members of trances The first trance has five members The same is true for the third trance The second trance is with four members The members have been spoken of already previously Of actual entities there are eleven With the five members of the first trance there are five names and also five actual entities the second adds personal tranquillity the third adds equanimity regarding conditioning factors mindfulness satisfaction and tranquillisation the fourth adds neitherpleasantnorun Samyuktabhidharmahydaya pleasant About the members of the first trance that are not the members of the second trance four sentences are to be made members of the first trance that are not the ones of the second trance initial thought and sustained thought of the second and not of the first exception made for the above mentioned ones In this way it is to be spoken of up to the proceeding of the fourth trance The immaterial ones do not have members The same is true for the adjacent trances With the four immaterial ones and with the adjacent trances no members are established because of the aspect frustration The trances that include members are with the aspect satisfaction That is why it is said that these stages are the mode of progress of frustration If members were established here all stages would have to be called mode of progress of sat isfaction With initial thought and also with sustained thought the pretrance is spoken of The intermediate trance is with sustained thought This is what the Wise One has said With initial thought and also with sustained thought the pretrance is spoken of When the basis has not been reached yet one is with initial thought and with sustained thought The one not reached yet is the adjacent one of the first trance The intermediate trance is with sustained thought This is what the Wise One has said The intermediate Concentration  trance is with sustained thought and without initial thought because the devotee proceeds in being appeased Question Why is for the first trance and for the second trance a basis established in between and is this not so for the higher stages Answer Because these can acquire rising and falling The first trance is with initial thought and with sustained thought the second trance is without both The intermediate one is with sustained thought and without initial thought That is why a separate basis is established Higher stages are without this rising and falling Sree from the one associated with relishing The intermediate trance is threefold Both are also said to be with one feeling The pretrance sometimes is twofold free from the one associated with relishing Some say that the pretrance is with a twofold nature clean and pure it is not associated with relishing The intermediate trance has a threefold nature associated with relishing clean and pure There also is being associated with relishing as with the other stages the faculty equanimity Because the pretrance has fear it is without pleasant feeling because it is near to the realm of sexual passion Because the devotee has fear pleasant feeling is not produced because the duty is not accomplished yet The devotee goes to being with nonattachment and because it is not acquired yet pleasant feeling is not produced because of subsequent arising of sorrow and because there is the rest of the bonds of the realm of sexual passion Just as when a person has been bound there is liberation and there is a rest perplexity and fear still arise and pleasant feeling is not produced The same applies to this because peace is weak To the intermediate trance the same applies as to the pretrance it is to be spoken of according to its meaning The stages have already been spoken of The qualities that are produced shall now be spoken of  Samadhis and higher faculties unlimited ones and spheres of totality spheres of mastery and knowledges and liberations are produced in them These samadhis are the three samadhis of emptiness of aimlessness and of signlessness Because such good awarenesses are even samadhi is Concentration  spoken of The one of emptiness is twofold impure and pure When impure it is with all factors as supporting object when pure it is with what is impure as supporting object This further is ninefold emptiness of the inward emptiness of the outward emptiness of both the inward and the outward emptiness of the conditioned emptiness of the unconditioned emptiness of both the conditioned and the unconditioned emptiness of what is insubstantial emptiness of the highest truth and emptiness of emptiness Emptiness of the inward is emptiness of the inward senses It is making the indecision that they are selfless The same applies to emptiness of the outward emptiness of both the inward and the outward emptiness of the conditioned emptiness of the unconditioned and emptiness of both the conditioned and the unconditioned Emptiness of what is insubstantial is the nonexistence of all things Emptiness of the highest truth is that at the moment the eye is produced there is nothing from which it arises and at the moment it disappears there is nothing where it goes to In this way it is spoken of by comparison Emptiness of emptiness is with the impure being empty making the indecision of emptiness being empty regarding the pure that is empty Also the one of aimlessness is twofold impure and pure Both are with two kinds of supporting object They are to be spoken of according to their meaning This further is fivefold three forms of such as the inward and aimlessness of the conditioned and aimlessness of aimlessness Aimlessness of the conditioned is making the indecision that such aspects as impermanence are aimless by means of the impure and the pure regarding conditioned factors The rest is as has been said with   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the one of emptiness The one of signlessness the one of signlessness is twofold impure and pure This further is fourfold making the indecision that cessation peace excellence and escape are signless by means of the impure and the pure regarding calculated cessation of the inward senses The same applies to signlessness of the outward of both the inward and the outward and to signlessness of signlessness The samadhis shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter sutra  The doubled samdadhis shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Miscellany Higher faculties The six higher faculties have already been spoken of in the chapter Knowledge  Question If when developing higher faculties one realises the path realising is the meaning of becoming manifest when not losing what is made then what is made becomes manifest are these Answer When liberation is neutral these are then produced emitting concentration is called producing When liberation is neutral then samadhi is emitted when good it exactly is samadhi when good they are not produced  Two unlimited ones are with absence of hatred The last one is said to be with absence of greed The third is said to be with the faculty contentedness They are with the realm of sexual passion as support Concentration  Two unlimited ones are with absence of hatred Loving kindness and compassion are with the nature of the root of merit absence of hatred because of being the antidote for hatred Justified hatred is cured by loving kindness unjustified hatred is cured by compassion Furthermore hatred produced for abandoning life of beings is cured by loving kindness hatred produced for certain punishment of beings is cured by compassion That is why those who seek for merit can produce these unlimited ones not those who seek for what is vicious It is seeing actual clean action in relation to the seeking for merit even for those who are with cutting away the roots of merit Those who seek for what is vicious see actual foul action in relation to the seeking for what is vicious even for the one who is arhar The last one is said to be with absence of greed is with the nature of the root of merit absence of greed It is not right that absence of greed is no antidote for craving for sensual pleasure and for hatred Because it does not interrupt absence of hatred Question Equanimity is an antidote for attachment to sensual pleasure Also the contemplation of the repulsive is an antidote for attachment to sensual pleasure Which greed is cured by equanimity and which greed is cured by the contemplation of the repulsive Answer Attachment to colour is cured by the contem  plation of the repulsive attachment to carnal enjoyment is cured by equanimity The third is said to be with the faculty contentedness The unlimited one sympathy is with the nature of the faculty contentedness the increase of satisfaction is taken to be the characteristic mark of loving kindness when dissatisfaction is excluded it is the characteristic mark of compassion subsequent sympathy is the characteristic mark of contentedness lenience is the characteristic mark of equanimity They are with the realm of sexual passion as support  They are only present in the realm of sexual passion Because the increase of satisfaction proceeds When seeing frustration of beings in the realm of sexual passion there is the wish to let them acquire increase of satisfaction because of excluding frustration The realm of form and the one of formlessness are without frustration Furthermore because of being the antidote for hatred The unlimited one loving kindness is the antidote for the fault of hatred Just as has been said that when loving kindness is practised assiduously and much practised hatred is excluded compassion excludes violence sympathy excludes unhappiness equanimity excludes craving for sensual pleasure and for hatred The realm of form and the one of formlessness are without these faults Moreover it are three directions in the realm of sexual passion exception made for Uttarakuru Question Which indecision are the meditative attainments of the unlimited ones Answer y Satisfaction frustration and sympathy in relation to beings Concentration  and having no other conceptual identification than beings proceed according to what is proper The unlimited ones are with beings as supporting object Such indecision regarding beings as wishing to let them achieve satisfaction is entering the meditative attainment of loving kindness Such indecision regarding beings with frustration as wishing to let them be free from frus tration when sighing Oh frustration is entering the meditative attainment of compassion Such indecision as making these beings glad is entering meditative attainment of sympathy Such indecision as having no other conceptual identification than beings when considering  is entering meditative attainment of equanimi Question The power of loving kindness cannot let beings with frustration achieve satisfaction why is this not overturned Answer Because of being good because of being produced from hope on satisfaction because of being associated with right conceptualising because of being contrary to hatred They are with beings as supporting object They take beings of the realm of sexual passion as supporting object as has been said When indecision fully goes in one direction and one abides in its accomplishment this is speaking about the receptacle the ones in the receptacle Because of this meaning it should be known that because the unlimited ones take impure beings as supporting object they generally take all beings as supporting object the four forms of birth Free from these there are  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya no other beings They are acquired by nonattachment and acquired by effort Acquired by nonattachment is acquisition at the moment of nonattachment Later the ones of effort are present Question Which effort Answer Loving kindness is produced from kinsmen at the moment of wishing to produce an awareness of loving kindness three classes are established regarding all beings kinsmen enemies and in between Kinsmen are further divided in the classes minor middle and excessive First there is producing true hope regarding the class of excessive kinsmen father mother and other respected ones Because vicious hope has long been felt in relation to them increase of awarenesses was not reached Further what is included in awarenesses is increase of conceptual identification In this way there is abiding in the acquisition of evenness in relation to excessive kinsmen up to in relation to excessive enemies This is called accomplishment of meditative attainment of awarenesses of loving kindness The same is true for compassion and for sympathy equa nimity is produced from the middle class The name means that because unlimited beings are taken as supporting object they are said to be the unlimited ones  Of spheres of mastery it is said that there are eight The first three with liberation from matter and eight spheres of  totality  are with the nature of the root of merit absence of greed Concentration  It should be known that these roots of merit are with the nature of absence of greed because they are the antidote for greed because they are attention through resolve in relation to everything that is impure Question These are not with the nature of the root of merit absence of greed Because observation has been spoken of and conceptual identification has been spoken of as the scriptural texts say that inward there is conceptual identification of matter and outward observation of matter In this way it is said elaborately that ob servation is wisdom That is why the spheres of mas tery are with the nature of wisdom In the Abhidharma the fact of liberation is called mastering knowledge and mastering vision Vision exactly is wisdom The liberations are also said to be the observation of matter Matter is the first liberation That is why the first three liberations are with the nature of wisdom In this way the one general conceptual identification of earth is spoken of in relation to the spheres of totality That is why the spheres of totality are with the nature of conceptual identification and is speaking about the nature of absence of greed not right Answer All roots of merit are with the nature of absence of greed because wisdom is increased by conceptual identification This is said to be vision and conceptual identification just as mindfulness on the former existences and as mastering conceptual identification of matter That is why there is no mistake Just as knowledge of mindfulness follows that which is already extinguished because mindfulness increases When stating that one is mindful on the unlimited things with which one has ever been in contact one also is with this knowledge of it Just as  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya mastering conceptual identification of matter is with the nature of wisdom Because conceptual identification increases mastering conceptual identification of matter is spoken of Furthermore it is said because they are near to one another That is why speaking of conceptual identification is without mistake Absence of greed wisdom and conceptual identification are not without one another they are with one basis one aspect one supporting object one fruit and one natural fruit natural in natural fruit is also with the meaning of outcome are of three kinds the first arises from the pervasive cause the second arises from the homogeneous cause and the third arises from the resting power of the cause of retribution Taking life achieves a short duration of life That is why they are said to be one It should be known that is spoken of How is the nature of absence of greed to be known Because of being the antidote for greed It should be known that these roots of merit are the antidote for greed When they were with the nature of understanding they would have to be said to be the antidote for delusion Although wisdom is the antidote for every defilement it is because delusion is the nearest not greed When the spheres of totality were with the specific nature of conceptual identification they would be no antidote for defilement because of not being certain Therefore it should be known that these roots of merit are with the nature of absence of greed When their dependence is spoken of They are with the nature of the five aggregates Concentration  These are said to be with three directions as basis Their object is matter of the realm of sexual passion When their dependence is spoken of they are with the nature of the five aggregates It should be known that these roots of merit and their dependence are with the nature of the five aggregates These are said to be with three directions as basis These roots of merit are produced in the group of three directions exception made for Uttarakuru It is nowhere else Because these roots of merit are the antidote for attachment to sensual pleasure and in the realm of form and in the one of formlessness there is no attachment to sensual pleasure Although Uttarakuru is with attachment to sensual pleasure these roots of merit cannot be produced because the power wisdom is weak Although the gods of the realm of sexual passion have attachment to sensual pleasure these roots of merit can also not be produced because there is attachment to satisfaction Their object is matter of the realm of sexual passion These roots of merit take matter of the realm of sexual passion as supporting object The first two liberations and the first four spheres of mastery make such aspects as blue d and proceed in the sensefield matter because they proceed in unclean formations The rest proceed in clean formations That is why they are acquired in the application of mindfulness on the body Question Why does the devotee experience clean characteristic marks regarding the supporting object Answer Because of trying what is unclean not settled because when awarenesses of sloth arise with the one who observes the repulsive there is the wish to let it be included moreover when wishing to observe from competence this reflection can be made That by means of the contemplation of the repulsive no defilement is produced is not that wonderful Not being produced when observing that which is clean is that wonderful moreover because one realises the endurance of the roots of merit The last one among the liberations is a formation dissociated from awarenesses It is said to be with two realms as basis It is produced from the realm of sexual passion first The last one among the liberations is a formation dissociated from awarenesses The liberation that is cessation of conceptual identification and feeling is with the nature of a formation dissociated from awarenesses Question When all awarenesses and accompanying mental factors are extinguished then why are cessation of conceptual identification and feeling spoken of Answer Because of these two powers one lets the devotee in an extreme way make fatigue arise regarding two realms because of the power of feeling there is fatigue regarding trances because of the power of conceptual identification there is fatigue regarding the immaterial ones The meaning of feeling and of conceptual identification is as has been said with the aggregates  It is said to be with two realms as basis Present in the group of the realm of sexual passion and of the realm of form it is not in the one of formlessness Because Concentration  it is no awareness The realm of sexual passion and the one of form have matter That is why it is so that when these awarenesses and accompanying mental factors are extinguished the faculty life depends on matter for proceeding and in the one of formlessness there is no matter when at the moment of this meditative attainment awarenesses and accompanying mental factors are extinguished the faculty life should be abandoned Since what has to die is no meditative attainment this case is not right It is produced from the realm of sexua passion first Meditative attainment of cessation is produced from the realm of sexual passion first Concerning this it is so that when one arises in the realm of form having fallen back but further abandons this desire it is present Question Why is it that in the realm of form and in the one of formlessness the production of trances and of immaterial ones is acquired first and not of meditative attainment of cessation Answer Trance is produced because of three things the power cause the power action and the power preparation of the characteristic The power cause is what has ever been produced nearby regarding this trance The power action is supporting the action to be felt after having been made  The power preparation of the characteristic is as the moment a kalpa reaches its end the realm of formlessness are produced with two things the power cause and the power action Explanations are of the realm of sexual passion the explanations of Buddha and of the sravakas who develop the paramitas That is why it can only be produced as first in the group of the realm of sexual passion Once one enters meditative attainment in the realm of sex ual passion it is no longer than seven days because of the group of solid food When longer one falls faint when leaving meditative attainment Once one has entered meditative attainment in the realm of form it runs steadily during kalpas  The rest are with the nature of four aggregates They are said to be with the three realms as basis Or with the immaterial ones as object and with pure supporting object The rest are with the nature of four aggregates The other qualities are four liberations and two spheres of totality  They are with the nature of four aggregates exception made for the aggregate matter because they are immaterial They are said to be with the three realms as basis These qualities are present in the three realms The liberation of the sphere of unlimited space and the sphere of totality of the sphere of unlimited space  are first produced from the realm of sexual passion and from the one of form because of abandoning matter and because of developing emptiness first produced from the sensefield matter Or with the immaterial ones as object and with pure supporting object The sphere of totality of the sphere of unlimited space is with the four aggregates of the stage of Concentration  the sphere of unlimited space as supporting object The sphere of totality of the sphere of unlimited consciousness is with the four aggregates of the stage of the sphere of unlimited consciousness as supporting object The liberation of the sphere of unlimited space takes the four immaterial ones and their cause their cessation and all of the class of subsequent knowledge as supporting object The liberation of the sphere of unlimited consciousness takes three immaterial ones as supporting object The rest is as has been said above The liberation of the sphere of nothingness takes two immaterial ones as supporting object The rest is as has been said above The liberation of the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification exactly takes this stage its cause and its cessation and all of the class of subsequent knowledge as supporting object The specific nature of the roots of merit has already been spoken of The accomplishment of qualities shall now be spoken of  It should be known that sometimes the accomplishment of four unlimited ones is spoken of or further the accomplishment of three Less is not right When being without the desire of the realm of sexual passion having arisen in the realm of sexual passion and when arising in the first trance or in the second trance four unlimited ones are accomplished When arising in the third trance or in the fourth trance three unlimited ones are accomplished exception made for sympathy because the nature of the faculty contentedness abides in the first two  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya trances and not in higher stages Less than this does not exist  Sometimes one up to eight are accomplished regarding the liberations Sometimes four and further also eight are accomplished regarding the spheres of mastery  Sometimes one up to eight are accomplished regarding the liberations Sometimes there is accomplishment of one liberation and sometimes there is accomplishment up to eight Accomplishment of one when having arisen with the entirely magnificent gods  being with destruction of craving regarding these and not having destroyed craving of the ones having great fruit when having arisen with theones having great fruit not having destroyed craving regarding these yet when having arisen in the realm of sexual passion and when having arisen in the first trance or in the second trance being with destruction of craving regarding these and not having destroyed craving of the entirely magnificent ones yet when having arisen in the third trance or in the fourth trance being without attachment to matter and not having destroyed craving of the sphere of unlimited space yet  when having arisen in the sphere of unlimited space having destroyed caving of the sphere of unlimited space and not having destroyed craving of the sphere of unlimited consciousness yet  when having arisen in the sphere of unlimited conscious ness not having destroyed exactly this craving Concentration  yet when having arisen in the realm of sexual passion and in the first trance or in the second trance having destroyed craving of the entirely magnificent ones and not having destroyed craving of the ones having great fruit yet when having arisen with the entirely magnificent ones or with the ones having great fruit having destroyed craving of the sphere of unlimited space and not having destroyed craving of the higher ones yet when having arisen in the sphere of unlimited space or in the sphere of unlimited consciousness because if what is pure arises higher the lower is not lost it is so that when arising in the sphere of unlimited consciousness the liberation of the sphere of unlimited space is accomplished This applies to all having destroyed craving of the sphere of unlimited consciousness and not having destroyed craving of the higher ones yet when having arisen in the sphere of nothingness not having destroyed exactly this craving yet Accomplishment of four when having arisen in the realm of sexual passion and in the first trance or in the second trance being without attachment to matter and not having destroyed craving of the realm of unlimited space yet when having arisen in the third trance or in the fourth trance having destroyed craving in the sphere of unlimited consciousness and not having destroyed craving of the higher ones yet  when having arisen in the sphere of unlimited space in the sphere of unlimited consciousness or in the sphere of nothingness having destroyed craving of the sphere of nothingness when having arisen in the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification not having acquired the samadhi of cessation yet when having arisen in the realm  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya of sexual passion and in the first trance or in the second trance having destroyed craving of the sphere of unlimited space and not having destroyed craving cf the sphere of unlimited consciousness yet when having arisen with the entirely magnificent ones or with the ones having great fruit having destroyed craving of the sphere of nothingness and not having acquired the samadhi of cessation yet when having arisen in the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification having acquired the samadhi of cessation Accomplishment of six when having arisen in the realm of sexual passion and in the first trance or in the second trance having destroyed craving of the sphere of unlimited consciousness and not having destroyed craving of the higher ones yet when having arisen with the entirely magnificent ones or with the ones having great fruit having acquired the samadhi of cessation Accomplishment of seven Accomplishment of eight when having arisen in the realm of sexual passion and in the first trance or in the second trance having acquired the samadhi of cessation In this way it is spoken of in general With liberation of the impure when being with nonattachment in lower stages and not having arisen in a higher stage yet all are accomplished When pure also accomplished having arisen in a higher stage Sometimes four and further also eight are accomplished regarding the spheres of mastery There either is accomConcentration  plishment of four spheres of mastery or of eight Accomplishment of four when having arisen in the realm of sexual passion and in the first trance or in the second trance being with the destruction of craving regarding these and not having destroyed craving of the entirely magnificent ones yet when having arisen with the entirely magnificent ones having destroyed craving regarding these and when having arisen with the ones having great fruit Accomplishment of eight when having arisen in the realm of sexual passion and in the first trance or in the second trance having destroyed craving in relation to the entirely magnificent ones It should be known that with the application  of the spheres of totality sometimes one further also two eight nine or ten are accomplished Sometimes there is accomplishment of one sphere of totality sometimes of two sometimes of eight sometimes of nine and sometimes of ten Accomplishment of one is when arising in the sphere of unlimited space not having destroyed exactly this craving yet and when arising in the sphere of unlimited consciousness Accomplishment of two is when having arisen in the sphere of unlimited space having destroyed craving regarding this one Accomplishment of eight is when having arisen in the realm of sexual passion or in the one of form having destroyed craving in relation to the entirely magnificent ones and not having destroyed craving of the ones having great  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya fruit yet Accomplishment of nine is when having arisen in the realm of sexual passion or in the one of form having destroyed craving regarding the ones having great fruit and not having destroyed craving of the sphere of unlimited space yet Accomplishment of ten is when having arisen in the realm of sexual passion or in the one of form having destroyed craving in relation to the sphere of unlimited space The accomplishment has already been spoken of The qualities shall now be spoken of according to the stages Five higher faculties abide in the four trances It are the fundamental ones no other stages The knowledges are as has been said previously Three unlimited ones are sometimes with six Five higher faculties abide in the four trances It are the fundamental ones no other stages In the four fundamental trances five higher faculties are accomplished it are no other stages exception made for the higher faculty of the destruction of impure influence Why Because of being included in the samadhi with members The knowledges are as has been said previously As has been said previously in the chapter Knowledge They are acquired according to the stage Three unlimited ones are sometimes with six Exception made for sympathy the other unlimited ones abide in six stages the pre the intermediate one and the fundamental four trances Some do not wish them to be in the pretrance Concentration   Moreover it is said that in the first trance and in the second trance no compassion and no sympathy are produced because the faculties are contrary The faculty contentedness is the proceeding of sympathy when feeling a specific nature compassion is the proceeding of sorrow That is why this one is not associated That it is as patience and knowledge of frustration and of the origin is not right When stating that since patience and knowledge of frustration and of the origin are with aversion in an extreme way they are associated with the faculty contentedness and that the proceeding of compassion should also be so this saying is wrong because these are indecision of the highest truth Production of compassion by joy is attention through resolve That is why there is a mistake although compassion is no indecision of the highest truth it can implicate the indecision of the highest truth Because of excluding frustration through sympathy compassion together with contentedness Question What is the difference between compassion and great compassion Answer Compassion is with the nature of absence of hatred great compassion is with the nature of understanding Furthermore compassion is common with the Sravakas and pratyekabuddhas great compassion is unique Furthermore compassion can be compassionate and can not save great compassion can both be compassionate  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya and save Furthermore compassion takes frustration of frustration in relation to beings as supporting object great compassion takes the three forms of frustration Compassion takes bodily frustration as supporting object great compassion takes bodily and mental frustration as supporting object Question Why is it called great compassion Answer Because it saves beings with great frustration it is called great compassion because of acquisition of Buddhahood it is called great compassion because of including the great collection of beings it is called great compassion because great persons enter that which is great ad extremely difficult it is called great compassion  These first four spheres of mastery the unlimited one sympathy and also the first two liberations abide in the first two trances The first four spheres of mastery such as sympathy and the first two liberations only abide in the first trance and in the second trance Although the third and the fourth trance have roots of merit similar to the first two liberations these are not established That is why they also have roots of merit similar to the first four spheres of mastery As a siitra says that loving kindness reaches its extreme with the entirely magnificent ones that compassion reaches its extreme in the sphere of unlimited space Concentration  that sympathy reaches its extreme in the sphere of unlimited consciousness and that equanimity reaches its extreme in the sphere of nothingness Some say that this scriptural text speaks of the noble path by means of the names of the unlimited ones because pupils enter the noble path by means of the names of the unlimited ones Furthermore these members of enlightenment as antidote are spoken of by means of the names of unlimited ones the member of enlightenment as antidote for the third trance is spoken of by means of the name loving kindness The same applies up to the member of enlightenment as antidote for the sphere of nothingness that is spoken of by means of the name equanimity Furthermore they are spoken of by means of a similar name loving kindness proceeds in satisfaction pleasant feeling is up to the third trance compassion proceeds in frustration the sphere of unlimited space proceeds in deriding matter sympathy proceeds in joy the sphere of unlimited consciousness finds joy with abiding in consciousness equanimity proceeds in equanimity the sphere of nothingness is said to be equanimity   The four other spheres of mastery there are one liberation and also eight spheres of totality abide in the highest trance The last four spheres of mastery the clean liberation and the first eight spheres of totality abide in the fourth trance not in the other ones Also in the lower stages there is a root of merit similar to the clean liberation but clean liberation is not established because of being that which is  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya abandoned through unpleasantness That is why there y also are the roots of merit similar to the last four spheres of mastery With meditative attainment on earth and the sphere of totality earth it is said that this meditative attainment on earth abides in the realm of sexual passion and in the four trances and that the sphere of totality earth only abides in the fourth trance Because of being free from resistance of the eight things There are two kinds of desire for matter of the realm of sexual passion  because of its antidote In the first trance two liberations and four spheres of mastery are established because in desire for matter of the first trance there also are two kinds In the second trance two liberations are established because the second trance is without two kinds of desire for matter In the third trance no liberations are established because of contentedness with supreme satisfaction it cannot be that such kinds of roots of merit and spheres of totality are produced By means of these liberations one enters the spheres of mastery by means of the spheres of mastery one enters the spheres of totality by means of the first liberation one enters the first two spheres of mastery by means of the second liberation one enters the third and the fourth sphere of mastery by means of the clean liberation one enters the last four spheres of mastery by means of the last four spheres of mastery one further enters the spheres of total ity The rest is exactly called liberation The same is true for two spheres of totality Disappearance is the very last The other pure ones are with nine stages Concentration  The rest is exactly called liberation Exception made for the nine proximate paths and for the awareness of death of the sphere of unlimited space the rest that is good is all said to be the liberation of the sphere of unlimited space The proximate paths go to the fourth trance and the awareness of death goes to birth That is why no liberation is established It should be known that the same applies to the other immaterial ones The same is true for two spheres of totality The sphere of totality of the sphere of unlimited space and the one of the sphere of unlimited consciousness are also exactly spoken of by their names Question Why is it that higher than the sphere of unlimited consciousness no spheres of totality are established Answer The devotee first enters observation of the liberations it cannot be the ones of mastery  Later he enters the spheres of mastery it cannot be the observation of the infinite emancipation of mind Later he enters the spheres of totality and is with the observation of the infinite emancipation of mind blue To yellow red and white the same applies as to this one When reflecting on what this colour depends on observing that it depends on the element earth he later enters the observation of the infinite emancipation of mind earth That the same is also true for the other elements is further reflecting on these as such It is being conscious Exactly when first entering the sphere of totality of the sphere of unlimited space and being conscious with which basis it is observing it as with consciousness of the mind as basis exactly is entering the infinite sphere of totality of the sphere of unlimited consciousness This basis has nothing else that depends on it That is why no spheres  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya of totality are established higher Disappearance is the very last The meditative attainment of cessation is included in the summit of existence Because of being conformable to extinguished awarenesses Because of successiveness in gradually becoming subtle extinguishing is easy Question The meditative attainment of cessation does not have to be included in the summit of existence As has been said Surpassing all spheres neitheridentificationnornonidentification abides in the accomplishment of cessation of conceptual identification and feeling Answer It is included in the summit of existence The Worldhonoured One said this because surpasses meditative attainment and attachment to sensual pleasure He said this because of surpassing abiding in meditative attainment of the seeker He said this because of surpassing attachment to sensual pleasure of the adept Furthermore surpassing all spheres neitheridentificationnornonidentification is said to concern that which is to be abandoned through the path of vision cessation of conceptual identification and feeling is said to concern that which is to be abandoned through the spiritual path In this way what has already been practised and what has not been practised yet the general and the unique acquired by nonattachment and acquired by effort should all be known  of the realms Two liberations are said to be of the eyewitness The meditative attainment of cessation are impure because of being conConcentration  formable to the extinguished awarenesses This meditative attainment is acquired by effort and is not acquired by nonattachment When it is produced again having fallen back it concerns acquisition of what is not acquired yet and not of what has already been acquired The other pure ones are with nine stages The other pure qualities three samadhis and the higher faculty of the destruction of impure influence abide in nine stages the four trances three immaterial ones and the pretrance and intermediate one The impure samddhis abide in eleven stages these nine and the realm of sexual passion and also the summit of existence  Three liberations should be known as impure and pure The concentrations knowledges and higher faculties have already been spoken of The rest are all impure Three liberations should be known as impure and pure The liberation of the sphere of unlimited space the one of the sphere of unlimited consciousness and the one of the sphere of nothingness should be known as impure and pure The concentrations knowledges and higher faculties have already been spoken of The concentrations have already been spoken of previously The knowledges and the higher faculties are as has been said in the chapter Knowledge The rest are all impure The other three higher faculties because they are similar to craftsmanship and because they experience the specific characteristic marks of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya matter and of sound the unlimited ones because they take beings as supporting object the spheres of totality spheres of mastery and the first three liberations because of acquiring attention through resolve the meditative attainment of the summit of existence because of not being zealous the cessation of conceptual identification and feeling  because of being contrary to awarenesses are all impure Question What is the difference between a liberation a sphere of mastery and a sphere of totality Answer Their nature is liberation It can excel the sphere which is taken as supporting object Without intervals they extend to the totality The name is spoken of according to that which is surpassed Because of going in no direction a liberation is spoken of because of excelling a certain sphere a sphere of mastery is spoken of because of excelling a sphere the WorldHonoured One has been speaking of the spheres of mastery Although not all devotees can excel these spheres that defilement is not produced in relation to a supporting object is also called a sphere of mastery Because of the infinite emancipation of mind spheres of totality are spoken of Furthermore minor roots of merit are said to be a liberation middle ones are said to be a sphere of mastery and excessive ones are said to be a sphere of totality Furthermore causes are said to be a liberation fruits are Concentration  said to be a sphere of totality and causes and fruits are said to be a sphere of mastery The specific nature accomplishment stages and being impure and pure of qualities has already been spoken of The three kinds of accomplishment of the trances and of the immaterial ones shall now be spoken of  It should be known that when not yet without attachment the one associated with relishing is accomplished When being free from what is lower and not having reached what is higher yet clean concentration is accomplished It should be known that when not yet without attachment the one associated with rlishing is accomplished When not yet without attachment in a certain stage the one associated with relishing of that stage is accomplished When being free from what is lower and not having reached what is higher yet clean concentration is accomplished When one is without the desire of the realm of sexual passion but not in the brahmaheaven yet one accomplishes the clean first trance and the other qualities of the stage of the first trance Worldlings accomplish the one that is associated with relishing and the clean one Noble persons accomplish the three kinds It should be known that when abiding in a higher one the pure one of the lower one is accomplished  Samyuktabhidharmahydaya It are qualities arisen by application It should be known that they are not by nonattachment It should be known that when abiding in a higher one the pure one of the lower one is accomplished When noble persons arise higher than the brahmaheaven they accomplish the pure first trance and other qualities such as pure samadhis and higher faculties Impure qualities are bound to the sphere of arising pure ones are not bound to it That is why free from the sphere of arising impure qualities are abandoned no pure ones It are qualities arisen by application It should be known that they are not by nonattachment That qualities are accomplished when free the from desire of a lower stage has already been said it should be known that what is acquired is not present What is present is not with nonattachment they are what is acquired by effort Because the knowledge of the divine eye and of the divine ear are with this neutral nature they do not belong to the clean one to the pure one and to the one associated with relishing That is why they are not acquired at the moment of acquiring these three kinds of trance They are present after the effort has been made Two of the six higher faculties are neutral because they are included in the path of liberation the other four are good Question Which of these qualities acquired by effort abandon defilement and which do not abandon defilement Answer   The fundamental clean first trance is also one and the same bond Concentration  It cannot abandon defilement The same is true for the unlimited ones The fundamental clean first trance is also one and the same bond It cannot abandon defilement Because the fundamental clean first trance is bound to the one bond of defilement of the specific stage it cannot abandon defilement to this the same applies as to a person who is bound cannot free himself Because the relishing of the specific stage is relished it cannot be rejected to this the same applies as to a person who cannot abandon even his weak friend When the antidote for defilement is the fundamental trance annihilation is acquired When no annihilation is acquired this is no antidote That is why the pure trance is the antidote for defilement What is impure is to be abandoned through effort In this way it is up to the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification The same is true for the unlimited ones The unlimited ones do not abandon defilement because they take beings as supporting object the essential marks abandon defilement furthermore because they are included in the path of liberation and it is that which is included in the proximate path that abandons defilement furthermore because they take the present as supporting object and it is what takes the three periods of time as supporting object that abandons defilement because they are an instantaneous antidote The sitras of the Worldhonoured One say just as the one who has debts extends the deadline  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  It should be known that five liberations the eight spheres of mastery and also the ten spheres of totality cannot abandon defilement Factors of the sphere of totality of the sphere of unlimited space and of the sphere of unlimited consciousness and of the liberation of neitheridentificationnornonidentification are included in the fundamental ones and do not abandon defilement as has been said previously Because the liberation of cessation of conceptual identification and feeling is contrary to awarenesses it does not abandon defilement The liberations spheres of mastery and spheres of totality of matter do also not abandon defilement because of the object with specific characteristic marks It is the path of general characteristic marks that abandons defilement not the one of specific characteristic marks Furthermore because of attention through resolve it is indecision of the highest truth that abandons defilement no emancipation of mind Furthermore because of attention through resolve it is what is no attention through resolve that abandons defilement Furthermore because of the duty as object indecision of what is not to be done abandons defilement Furthermore because of being included in the path of liberation what is included in the proximate path abandons defilement The twentythree kinds of meditative attainment are eight associated with relishing eight clean ones and seven pure ones Concentration  Question For how many kinds are these samddhis one by one the cause Answer The socalled pure concentrations are one by one the cause for seven kinds One is caused by what is associated with relishing The same is true for the clean one The socalled pure concentrations are one by one the cause for seven kinds The pure first trance is the associated the simultaneous and the homogeneous cause garding the pure first trance regarding three pure trances and three immaterial ones  it is the homogeneous cause In this way up to the sphere of nothingness This then is a general saying the faithfollower the doctrinefollower the one given to faith the viewattainer the one conditionally liberated and the one unconditionally libexated The path of the faithfollower is the cause for six kinds the path of the doctrinefollower is the cause for three kinds the path of the one given to faith is the cause for four kinds the path of the viewattainer is the cause for two kinds the path of the one conditionally liberated is also the cause for two kinds the one unconditionally liberated exactly is the cause for the one unconditionally liberated One is caused by what is associated with relishing The first trance associated with relishing is only the cause for the first trance associated with relishing because the cause of the first trance is dissimilar It is no cause for another stage because causes and fruits would be interrupt   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya ed What is associated with relishing is fivefold what is to be abandoned through the vision of frustration up to what is to be abandoned through the spiritual path What is to be abandoned through the vision of frustration is the cause for what is to be abandoned through the vision of frustration The same applies to all The same is true for the clean one The clean first trance is the cause for the clean first trance not for the one associated with relishing and not for the pure one because of being dissimilar It is not the cause for the clean one of another stage because of being bound to the specific stage The clean first trance is fourfold what is connected to falling back what is conducive to maintenance what is connected to progress and what is connected to penetration What is connected to falling back is the cause for the four kinds what is conducive to maintenance for three what is connected to progress for two and what is connected to penetration is only for what is connected to penetration It should be known that the same applies also to other stages Question How many kinds do one by one arise in succession Answer The pure trance and the immaterial ones are reverse and following and transgressive and successive In succession six seven eight nine and ten kinds arise In succession to the pure first trance six kinds arise the Concentration  clean one and the pure one of the specific stage The same applies to the second and to the third trance In succession to the pure sphere of nothingness seven arise two of the specific stage one of the higher stage and four of the lower stages In succession to the pure second trance eight arise two of the specific Stage two of the lower stage and four of the higher stages In succession to the pure sphere of unlimited consciousness nine arise two of the specific stage three of the higher stages and four of the lower stages In succession to the other pure ones ten arise In succession to the trance that is included in the class of subsequent knowledge the immaterial ones are present The class of knowledge of the law is with lower stages as basis and with lower stages as supporting object That is why the immaterial ones are not present successively  Six eleven are reached what arises in succession to the clean one Successively two Six eleven are reached what arises in succession to the clean one In succession to the clean sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification six kinds arise the one associated with relishing and the clean one of the specific stage and four of the lower stages because of being with nonattachment In succession to the clean first trance s seven arise three of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the specific stage and four of the higher stages the clean one and the pure one In succession to the clean sphere of nothingness eight arise three of the specific stage one of the higher stage and four of the lower stages In succession to the clean second trance nine arise in succession to the clean sphere of unlimited consciousness ten arise the rest are with eleven These are said to be acquired by effort and acquired by nonattachment not acquired by genesis That is why the one associated with relishing acquired by genesis of lower and higher stages is not spoken of In succession to the moment of clean death the one associated with relishing of all stages arises Question In succession to which clean first trance does the noble path arise Answer what is connected to penetration If it were different the four kinds would not be established Successively two to ten arise the one associated with relishing No three In succession to the first trance associated with relishing two kinds arise the one associated with relishing and the clean one of the specific stage no pure one because of being contrary to defilement It are not the ones of a higher stage because of not yet being without attachment No three is that there is no arising of three When three are spoken of this is not right In succession to the one associated with relishing of the second trance four arise two of the specific stage exception made for the pure one and two of the lower stage the one associated with relishing and the clean one acquired Concentration  by genesis Because of fear for craving of the second trance one protects oneself by depending on the clean first trance As the sitras say It is better to depend on meditative attainment of indecision that is together with agitation  of the first trance than to depend on weak indecision of the second trance The third trance makes five arise two of the specific stage two of the second trance and one of the first trance The fourth trance associated with relishing makes six arise the sphere of unlimited space seven the sphere of unlimited consciousness eight  the sphere of nothingness nine The sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification ten two of the specific stage two of the sphere of nothingness and six associated with relishing of the lower stages because of defilement of rearising Question How many kinds do they one by one take as supporting object Answer The clean and the pure trance take all stages as supporting object Impure factors of the specific stage are taken as supporting object by the one associated with relishing The clean and the pure trance take all stages as supporting object The clean and the pure trance take all kinds of all stages as supporting object because of the wide object The class of pure subsequent knowledge takes eight stages as supporting object the class of knowledge  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya of the law takes one stage as supporting object the application of the roots of merit takes the four noble truths as supporting object Impure factors of the specific stage are taken as supporting object by the one associated with relishing The first trance associated with relishing only takes what is associated with relishing and what is clean of the specific stage as supporting object This meaning has already been spoken of elaborately in the chapter Contaminants It does not take that which is pure or another stage as supporting object  The immaterial ones do not take impure kinds of a lower stage as supporting object the fundamental good forms of existence The defiled ones are as the trance with relishing The immaterial ones do not take impure kinds of a lower stage as supporting object the fundamental good forms of existence The clean one and the pure one of the fundamental immaterial ones do not take impure factors of a lower stage as supporting object because of being free from the characteristic mark matter Because they take the specific stage and the higher stage as supporting object it is said that it is not the lower one Because the class of subsequent knowledge takes the pure ones of the lower one as supporting object not being with impure kinds is spoken of Because the proximate path included in effort takes the lower stage as supporting object therefore it is said to be fundamental the worldly path that abandons the fetters It is with a minor supporting object is with an excessive supporting object The ones associated with relConcentration  ishing take the specific stage as supporting object therefore good forms of existence are spoken of The defiled ones are as the trance with relishing To the immaterial ones the same applies as to the trance associated with relishing that takes what is associated with reiishing of the specific stage as supporting object Such other qualities as the unlimited ones of the realm of form take the realm of sexual passion as supporting object This has been said by the Most Superior One That such qualities as four unlimited ones take the realm of sexual passion as supporting object has been said already previously because exception made for the higher faculties such qualities as the unlimited ones were spoken of These five higher faculties take the realm of sexual passion and the one of form as supporting object the first trance takes the first trance and the realm of sexual passion as supporting object no higher stages the same applies to the rest They are to be spoken of according to their meaning The clean trances are threefold The one mixed with defilement is what is connected to falling back In the impure one there is the breath of defilement and that is why it is called mixed with defilement The one mixed with the path is what is mixed with the path The other one is not mixed Question Which trances can be mixed  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Answer   When trances can be mixed this is depending on the fourth trance Because of destruction of craving in three stages Of the clean residences it are only Depending on the fourth trance the first trance is mixed Why Because of being free from the resistance of eight things because it is the most superior one of all bases There are five kinds of mixing minor middle excessive excessivemiddle and excessiveexcessive These make the five kinds of clean residences arise Also lower stages have five kinds of mixing because of being with the destruction of craving of the third trance In lower stages no clean residences arise In that on which it de pends either mixing is produced or not producing and not producing is emitting concentration or not emitting concentration Its preparation is supplying meditative attainment by means of the irrigation of the pure fourth trance Later there is impurity and successively further purity Regarding this irrigation there is gradual contraction Up to the second ksana that is impure that is present in succession to the second ksana that is pure With the purity of one ksana there is one ksana that is impure and further one ksana that is pure This is called establishing mixed trance There are fifteen awarenesses five impure awarenesses and ten pure awarenesses Concentration  Question Why is trance mixed Answer There either is affection for meditative attainment or fear for defilement or further also satisfaction with rearising These are spoken of each according to its meaning Mixing trance has three reasons Affection for meditative attainment is that the devotee is with affection for meditative attainment because of pleasant abiding in the present Fear for defilement is because of fear for falling back Satisfaction with rearising is because of satisfaction when arising in the clean residences affection for meditative attainment no fear for defilement because of final exemption from the life of transmigration and no satisfaction in arising and turning ones back to every birth The mixed trance is with the nature of the five aggregates It is impure and pure It takes the four noble truths as supporting object spreading the pure over that which is impure is just as the meaning of spreading flowers over a caitya is called mixing In this way it should be spoken of elaborately Mixing pure awarenesses in impure awarenesses is as spreading flowers over a caitya Question The threefold meditative attainment has already  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya been spoken of How are these to be acquired Answer When being with nonattachment and rearising the clean trance is acquired The defiled one when falling back and by genesis The pure one only when being with nonattachemnt When being with nonattachment and rearising the clean trance is acquired The clean first trance is acquired at two moments when being without the desire of the realm of sexual passion and when arising in the brahmaheaven having gone down in a higher stage Question Is it also acquired at the moment of falling back When falling back from being with nonattachment in the first trance the root of merit connected to falling back of the first trance is acquired Why is this not spoken of Answer Among these all clean ones that are acquired when they were not acquired first are spoken of Although the root of merit connected to falling back of the moment of falling back was not acquired first and is acquired  the other three kinds were accomplished The former is losing one and acquiring three now three are lost and one is acquired It is not so that previously there was nothing That is why there is no acquisition of everything that was not acquired That is why it is not spoken of Is it somehow so that when in the clean first trance acquired by nonattachment nonattachment is abandoned this is also so for falling back and for rearising Answer Indeed It is the first trance of what is connected to falling back It is acquired at the moment of nonattachment Concentration  in the realm of sexual passion and abandoned at the moment of nonattachment in the brahmaheaven At the moment of nonattachment in the brahmaheaven there is acquisition of such things as that which is connected to progress That is why what is connected to falling back is abandoned It is acquired at the moment of falling back from nonattachment in the brahmaheaven and it is abandoned at the moment of falling back from nonattachment in the realm of sexual passion It is acquired at the moment of arising in the brahmaheaven having gone down in a higher stage and it is abandoned at the moment of arising in the realm of sexual passion having gone down in the brahmaheaven The same applies up to the sphere of nothingness It is acquired when being with nonattachment in neitheridentificationnornonidentification and not acquired by genesis because there is no higher stage The defiled one when falling back and by genesis The first trance associated with relishing is acquired at the moment of falling back falling back to the realm of sexual passion and to the fetters of the brahmaheaven from being with nonattachment in the first trance Acquired by genesis is arising in the realm of sexual passion and the brahmaheaven having gone down in a higher stage In this way up to the sphere of nothingness The one of neitheridentificationnornonidentification is only to be acquired when falling back The pure one only when being with nonattachment The pure first trance is acquired by nonattachment noble persons who are free from the desire of the realm of sexual passion This is spoken of according to the person It is also acquired when arising free from beings depending on the  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya first trance The same applies up to all stages Question Which of these qualities abandon defilement Answer  The pure ones exclude defilement And the adjacent ones of the meditative attainments All adjacent ones of the concentrations are associated with the faculty equanimity The pure ones exclude defilement The pure fundamental first trance is the antidote for the defilement of eight stages up to the sphere of nothingness that is the antidote for the defilement of two stages And the adjacent ones of the meditative attainments The adjacent ones of the meditative attainments are called paths of preparation Up to not being without the desire of the lower stage yet there is no acquisition of the fundamental meditative attainments The rest are no antidote All adjacent ones of the concentrations are associated with the faculty equanimity All paths of preparation are associated with the faculty equanimity Because they are not acquired yet no joy Question As has been said the higher stages are without consciousness of the body How can be seen heard or felt at the moment the eye wishesto see the ear to hear and the body to touch in the higher stages Answer Consciousness of the brahmaworld is present Question Why is it that the higher stages do not have these Concentration  forms of consciousness Answer This has been explained already previously because initial thought and sustained thought are not being part of the higher stages there is not this group of three forms of consciousness When there is wishing to see wishing to hear and wishing to touch in a higher stage there is seeing hearing and feeling when consciousness of the first trance is present This does not concern the realm of sexual Passion because of not being the fruit of spiritual practice  Question At which moment are they accomplished Answer According to the consciousness that is present the ones of a higher stage are accomplished When abandoned they are not accomplished Because the power of awarenesses is weak the consciousness that is present either consciousness of the eye or consciousness of the ear or consciousness of the body they are accomplished at these very moments Because awarenesses are weak because of being nonobscuredneutral they are therefore accomplished instantaneously When they are already produced they do not proceed subsequently Question The moments of the acquisition of good and defiled meditative attainment and of the accomplishment of the forms of consciousness are already known How is magic awareness acquired and how many awarenesses are acquired simultaneously  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Answer  When rearising and when being with nonattachment this magic awareness is acquired Two three and four and also five are acquired simultaneously There are two reasons for the acquisition of magic awareness rearising and nonattachment Sometimes two three four and five are acquired suddenly Rearising is the acquisition of two awarenesses as fruit of the first trance at the very moment of arising in the brahmaheaven when having gone down in a higher stage the first of the realm of sexual passion and the second of the first trance When arising in the second trance there is the acquisition of three awarenesses the first of the realm of sexual passion the second of the first trance and the third exactly of the specific stage When arising in the third trance there is the acquisition of four awarenesses three of the lower stages and one of the specific stage When arising in the fourth trance there is the acquisition of five awarenesses four of the lower stages and one of the specific stage These are said to be acquired by rearising Nonattachment is the acquisition of two awarenesses when being without the desire of the realm of sexual passion as has been said previously nonattachment in the first trance is with the acquisition of three awarenesses nonattachment in the second trance is with the acquisition of four awarenesses nonattachment in the third trance is with the acquisition of five awarenesses Concentration  That is why it is said that sometimes magic awareness acquired at one ksana is not abandoned Concerning the very last proximateS path of the moment of nonattachment in the realm of sexual passion four sentences are to be made Acquisition but no abandoning magic awareness that is the fruit of the first trance in the stage of the first trance At the moment of being without the desire of the realm of sexual passion there is acquisition of magic awareness of the first trance as fruit Because this awareness is bound by the fetters of the first trance it is not abandoned Abandoned but not acquired magic awareness that is the fruit of the second of the third and of the fourth trance in the realm of sexual passion Because magic awareness of these three stages are factors of the realm of sexual passion they are bound to the defilement of the realm of sexual passion Because when free from the desire of the realm of sexual passion these bonds were abandoned and in the first trance one was not without attachment yet they are not acquired Both acquired and abandoned magic awareness that is the fruit of the first trance in the realm of sexual passion Neither acquired nor abandoned other magic awareness Up to being with nonattachment in the third trance it is to be spoken of according to its meaning Of these fourteen magic awarenesses four are in the realm of sexual passion and ten are in the realm of form These magic awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion change the magic of the realm of sexual passion the magic awarenesses of the realm of form change the magic of the realm of form because of being homogeneous This magic is eightfold when arising in the realm of sexual  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya passion changing the magic of the realm of sexual passion concerns the own person and another person The same applies up to the one of the realm of form that is with arising in the realm of form Magic of the realm of sexual passion concerns four sensefields magic of the realm of form concerns two sensefields Why Because of not changing the faculties With undivided attention magic is single or manifold but it is one stage Abiding in the footing of supernatural power can make abide Although in nirvana  magic proceeds subsequently produced fire when already in nirvana and burnt his body The complete body of the venerable Mahakasyapa abides during a long time Converting by the Worldhonoured One and converting by instruction are not being part of it because the duty of Buddha was accomplished With parinirvana  there is no abiding in magic Question Is magic that is wisdom through personal realisation also wisdom through rearising Answer It is also wisdom through rearising Because when arising having fallen back one acquires magic awareness This primarily was acquisition of wisdom by means of nonattachment Magic awareness of the god Mara is wisdom through rearising Just as when Mara changes he takes the Buddhabody just as the god Mara goes to Buddha in a female transformation when the one who transforms actually wishes to nourish his own body this nutriment exactly is digested in the person of the one who transforms  when he actually does not wish to nourish his own body then Concentration  this nutriment only is accumulated in the person who does the transformation Question How many forms of magic awareness are accomplished Answer  Sometimes there are two three four Sive seven and nine Three are added or also five Magic awareness is settled in this way When arising in the realm of sexual passion being without attachment to sensual pleasure and not having destroyed the craving of the brahmaheaven yet and when arising in the brahmaheaven not having destroyed this craving yet this accomplishes two  When arising in the second trance not having destroyed this craving yet this accomplishes three  When arising in the third trance not having destroyed this craving yet this accomplishes four  When arising in the fourth trance this accomplishes five  When arising in the realm of sexual passion and in the brahmaheaven having destroyed the craving of the brahmaheaven and not having destroyed the craving of the second trance yet this also accomplishes five  When arising in the second trance having destroyed the craving of the second trance and not having destroyed the craving of the third trance yet this accomplishes seven  In this way it is to be spoken of elaborately Nine should be spoken of and an addition of three or five When arising in the third trance and arising in the second trance having destroyed the craving of the fourth trance three are  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya added when arising in the first trance five are added Question What is the difference between magic of the realm of sexual passion as fruit of the first trance and magic of the stage of the first trance as fruit of the first trance Answer The realm of form is superior because of superiority of realm Moreover with the second trance as fruit of the realm of sexual passion and the first trance as fruit of the realm of form the realm of sexual passion is with trembling superiority Because of the possibility to reach the second trance it is stated to be trembling superiority The realm of form is with superiority of realm All magic is said to be like this Magic awareness acquired by nonattachment and magic awareness acquired by effort each have fourteen forms At the moment of arising in a lower one from a higher stage there first is acquisition of the fourteen forms through nonattachment Heart of Scholasticism with Miscellaneous Additions volume seven Chapter Eight Siitra Composed by the venerable Dharmatrata Translated by the Indian Tripitaka Samghavarman of the Sung and others Concentration has already been spoken of Sitras shall now be spoken of   will say a little about the subtle meaning of the sutras spoken of by the Omniscient It is good that the devotee listens well Because He knows everything He is said to be Omniscient Omni The twelve sense Everything is known regarding their specific characteristic marks and general characteristic marks Spoken of What has been manifested by the Omniscient Himself The subtle meaning The very profound nature and the extreme subtle meaning This extreme subtle meaning is what has been spoken of in the sitras therefore the subtle meaning of the sitras is mentioned This exposition  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Say a little Because what has been said by the Muni is unlimited and infinite saying a little is mentioned Sutra has five meanings in all The first is bringing forth because of proclaiming all meanings the fourth is noting down like a string because of stringing the factors Such five meanings are the meaning of sitra Although these meanings not abide in the explanations they are proclaimed by means of these explanations and therefore the meaning of the teaching is mentioned Depending on  these explanations names proceed and depending on names the meanings are manifested Listen well It is good to unite ones mind to be certain and to listen well Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking about giving moral precepts and spiritual practice Of how many forms are these one by one Answer G Giving  and adherence to clean moral precepts each are fourfold The development of trance has two  When their names are spoken of it are merits Fear is the threefold fear Because He wishes that effort makes surpass the three kinds of fear the Worldhonoured One has been speaking of these three kinds of merit in a concise way Sitra  For the one who fears the fear for poverty He lets the effort surpass  that is why giving is spoken of for the one who fears the fear for woeful courses  He lets the effort surpass  that is why moral precepts are spoken of for the one who fears the fear for transmigration He lets the effort surpass  that is why spiritual practice  is spoken of uestion What is the nature of iving  Answer Thinking associated with absence of greed one and the same fruit  produced together and that which arises through the base of enjoyment this is the nature of giving Thinking associated with the root of merit absence of greed that which arises through the given thing as condition and bodily and verbal action  that proceed subse quently these five aggregates are the specific nature of giving because such things as matter smell or taste being possessed of is spoken of When stating that such as thinking are no giving this is not right Because when the name of giving is spoken of regarding a certain thing this is proclaiming the mind of the munificent man  by the Worldhonoured One Because one lets the essence be by means of thinking the name of giving regarding a certain thing is spoken of This exactly is that which arises through the given thing as condition  Question Four forms of giving have been spoken of previously What are these forms of giving  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Answer The socalled experiencing oneself JSurther also what is experienced by someone else or is experienced by both or is experienced by neither there is giving because of experiencing both oneself and by someone else because of being grateful is giving that is neither experienced by bneself nor experienced by someone else The arhat brings reverencing to Buddha because of gratefulness and not because of himself or because of someone else This experiencing oneself Reverencing the caitya by those not yet with nonattachment and by worldlings with nonattachment this is called giving for ones own safety Reverencing the caitya by noble persons who are not yet without attachment is giving one experiences oneself because this form of giving experiences the realm of sexual passion as ret ribution and because those who are not yet with nonattachment arise in the realm of sexual passion Although worldlings who are with nonattachment arise in Sutra  the reaim of form and in the one of formlessness they later when falling back experience the one that is to be felt later and the unfixed retribution in the realm of sexual passion This is called experiencing oneself and not experienced by someone else Because the caitya is no beings With the one with nonattachment who is no worldling giving to beings exception made for the one to be felt in this life is said to be experienced by someone else When the arhat or the anagamin exception made for giving to be felt in this life are with other giving to beings this is said to be experienced by someone else no experiencing oneself because rearising is not being part of an arhat Although the andgamin is with rearising he does not experience the fruit of giving when abiding in the realm of form and in the one of formlessness Because cause and fruit are interrupted realms are established It shouid be known that giving to beings by the one who is not yet without the desire of the realm of sexual passion and by worldlings who are already with nonattachment is experienced by both It should be known that giving to beings by noble persons who are not yet with nonattachment and by worldlings  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya who are already with nonattachment is giving that is experienced by both Bringing reverencing to the caitya by those with nonattachment who are no worldlings exception made for the one to be felt in this life is the form to be experienced by neither Exception made for giving to be felt in this life reverencing the caitya by either the arhat or the andgamin neither is experienced by oneself nor experienced by someone else because the arhat is without rearising Although the anagamin is with rearising he is not being part of the realm of sexual passion and therefore it is no experiencing oneself Because the caitya is no beings it is not experienced by someone else This is being mindful on the actual favour and because of being grateful still reverencing the caitya although Buddha is in parinirvana Furthermore  Sometimes there is reverencing the caitya that is experienced by someone else the unlimited group of those who see or hear this subsequently all make being goodminded arise Sometimes there is reverencing the caitya that is also experienced by someone else reverencing the caitya by means of a banner a curtain of flowers burning incense or spreading flowers lets this be the cause for subsequent joy when getting disjunctioned when born with gods for those among the unlimited beings who see this That is why the Worldhonoured One said in the satras Sitra  Establishing a caitya in places where it was not established yet can make the brahmamerit arise Because of being experienced by unlimited beings the brahmamerit is mentioned Question What is stated concerning the limitation of the brahmamerit Answer Some say that exception made for the bodhisattva who is near to the Buddhastage the action that can make such dominant fruits as great enjoyments and great power arise of all other beings is the measure of the brahmamerit Some further say that the action that can make the insentient universe arise when all beings and the insentient universe arise at the moment the world is settled is called the measure of the brahmamerit Moreover concerning this giving  Such seven forms of giving as the one out of hope are not excessive The eighth decorates the awarenesses and is called the most excelling giving The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of eight forms of giving giving out of hope giving out of fear giving because of reciprocity giving because of later reciprocity I giving because of familiar regularity giving in order to reborn with the gods giving because of seeking for fame and giving because of decorating the awarenesses subjecting the awarenesses following spiritual practice and reaching the ultimate truth Giving out of hope is giving to those who come to seek  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya because of wishing a great fruit when selecting the field of merit Among the forms of giving giving to those who come to seek has been spoken of in the old Abhidharma ag giving out of hope Giving out of fear is giving which is generosity out of loss seeing that there is such a loss making the conceptual identification that it is better to be generous and not to loose Giving because of reciprocity is the advantage ever received from someone else how is it not to be recompensed Giving because of later reciprocity is that when giving to someone else one hopes that this one will recompense it after some time Giving because of familiar regularity is giving for the honour of the antecedents no giving because of believing oneself Giving in order to be born with the gods is giving because of seeking to be born with the gods Giving because of seeking for fame is giving because of fame Because these seven forms of giving are what the Wise One contempts they are not excessive Giving not because of seeking satisfaction in transmigration is called giving in order to decorate the awarenesses Because this is giving which is a preparation for the path it is the extreme one of the forms of giving of worldly things Giving has already been spoken of The fruit of giving shall now be spoken of Such five kinds as life beauty power Satisfaction and perspicuity an It is the generous munificent man who experiences one hundred times one thousand retributions of giving Giving is as has been said above The five kinds are as the five merits of giving spoken of in the siitras by the Worldhonoured One After a meal there is life it is not when not eating That is why there is life by means of giving The same applies up to perspicuity A similar cause makes a similar fruit arise acquisition of longevity as retribution up to perspicuity To this the same applies as to when sowing outward seed there is harvesting of fruits according to the species Life concerns humans and gods no woeful courses Because of the cause of support life through giving is spoken of as has been said When being free from taking life is practised or much practised longevity is acquired This is spoken of because of the cause of birth it is to be compared with a twofold mother the mother giving birth and the foster mother The one who is free from taking life is as the mother giving birth the one giving nutriment is as the foster mother The five kinds of retribution when giving to animals acquire a merit of one hundred times as big a combined acquisition In this way it is spoken of elaborately Although the one in the path of vision does not eat he can experience the fruit of giving Giving and its fruit have already been spoken of The ex Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya act form of giving and the exact fruit shall now be spoken of  Loving kindness being without fighting the samadhi of cessation the path of vision and having no more learning to do Produced from these meditative attainments im the one doing giving acquires exactly this as fruit  When produced from the awarenesses of loving kindness the samadhi of being without fighting the samadhi of cessation the path of vision and the fruit of arhatship the one who does giving acquires exactly this as fruit Since there is mixing of loving kindness in the body there is this loving kindness  because of the characteristic mark of increasing toleration regarding unlimited beings The one who has produced giving from this acquires exactly this fruit The samadhi of being without fighting does not let defilement of unlimited beings be produced because of mix  farreaching merit in the body The one who has produced giving from this acquires exactly this fruit The samadhi of cessation is because of mixing wide merit in the body because of being similar to nirvana The one who has produced giving from this acquires exactly this fruit When the fetters to be abandoned through the path of vision have been ended eternally it is because the noble path is mixed in the body The one who has produced giving from this acquires exactly this fruit When the fetters to be abandoned through the spiritual path have been ended eternally the mind achieves to be selfwilled and abiding in the fruit of arhatSutra  ship The one who has produced giving from this acquires exactly this fruit The exact fruit has already been spoken of A great fruit shall now be spoken of  With father mother or a sick person a proclaimer and the bodhisattva who is near to the Buddhastage the one who does giving acquires a great fruit Giving to these five kinds of persons acquires a great fruit Giving because of the favour of raising a born person by father and mother acquires a great fruit Giving because a sick has nothing to depend on and the increase of awarenesses of compassion because of this acquires a great fruit Giving to the one who proclaims the doctrine acquires a great fruit because of the increase of the doctrinal body and because of manifesting what is good and what is bad to humans Giving because the one who is close to the Buddhastage accumulates merit and because he widely grasps beings acquires a great fruit Question Is it the superiority of thinking that makes giving clean or is it the superiority of the field of merit When it is the superiority of thinking then why did the Worldhonoured One praise the field of merit When it is the superiority of the field of merit then why is it that when giving to one field of merit no even fruit is acquired Answer Because of the superiority of thinking giving is  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya clean because of the power cause of the field of merit That is why it primarily are thinking and its dependence that are said to be called with the merit of giving When being free from seeking for bodily wealth by means of serene awarenesses wisdom proceeds subsequently In this way one experiences a great fruit when giving If it were different it would be giving to a superior field of merit when seeking for glory that would be with a great fruit This is no giving of a great person pWWhen according to the power of the field evil and merit would arise then when such as the power of the field are not settled proximate action would have to be acquired and it is not acquired That is why it should be known that it is the power of thinking It is because the meritorious field of merit can produce superior thinking that the Worldhonoured One praised the field of merit  Question Giving because of raising a born person is already known How is giving because of raising the doctrinal body further Answer  When the doctrine of the scriptural texts is explained well when being remote from perverted views and when not slandering the Muni this is said to be the gift of the doctrine Truly reflecting on Sitra Vinaya and Abhidharma not being attached to reputation and widely grasping beings is called the gift of the doctrine It should be known that although without adherence to conceptual identification one is said te be overSatra Sil turned when one denies the Tathagata and true causes and conditions and then one has strange conceptual identifications These are the reason for disturbed awarenesses Although what is said is not overturned awarenesses may be attached and it is as that merchant That is why the stanza Not knowing what the Muni has said is as a knife fire and poison When this is reflected on well it is as eating nectar Furthermore there are three forms of perverted views the perverted view of the doctrine the perverted view of the person and the perverted view of the time The perverted view of the doctrine is when saying that practising clean conceptual identification abandons attachment to sensual pleasure the perverted view of the person is speaking about loving kindness with the ones having attachment to sensual pleasure the perverted view of the time is speaking about the noble truths when the human faculties are not mature for this yet It is to be compared in this way What is contrary to this is said to be the nonoverturned explanation of the doctrine The gift of the doctrine has already been spoken of The gift of fearlessness shall now be spoken of Speaking about the consolation of fear with the ones who are free from ordination is called the gift of fearlessness It can destroy the fear for poverty  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya When seeing the fear of beings in this period of time in a later period of time and in both because they are free from the act of entering into the order of monks saying the words of awarenesses of loving kindness and of consolation Beings have no fear I will let you reach fearlessness regarding what you have done is called the gift of fearlessness This fear is as poverty The real antidote for this is called the gift of fearlessness The gift of fearlessness has already been spoken of Great giving shall now be spoken of When generally accepting the restraint of moral precept  regarding mankind the stream of merits increases This is great giving The Worldhonoured One said that five moral precepts are great giving because of grasping infinite beings and because of producing infinite satisfaction Giving of worldly things cannot include all beings it is only possible for the ones who are ordained After the five moral precepts are taken the twelvefold restraint that was not acquired before is acquired regarding all beings lasting for life and instant after instant the three roots of merit one by one produce that which is bodily and verbal manifesting and unmanifesting This moral precept flows successively and is uninterrupted Question The fourfold giving is already known How is the fourfold moral precept spoken of previously Answer Sitra   The one of the realm of sexual passion the one of trance and pure restraint Restraint of abandoning comes from two These are said to be the kinds of restraint The fourfold restraint is restraint of the code restraint of trance pure restraint and restraint of abandoning Restraint of the code is the moral precept accepted by the seven groups of the Buddhist order Restraint of trance is the moral precept that arises subsequently to what is impure Pure restraint is the moral precept of the seeker and of the adept Restraint of abandoning is the restraint that free from the desire of the realm of sexual passion arises subsequently to the nine proximate paths When impure it is moral precept of trance when pure it is pure moral precept These restraint have already been spoken of in the chapter Actions  The fourfold moral precept has already been spoken of Other four shall now be spoken of  There is moral precept that is accepted out of hope and moral precept  that is adhered to because of fear the one conformable to the members of bodbi and the perfectly clean morality  There are four kinds of moral precept the socalled moral precept of hope moral precept of fear moral precept of being conformable to the members of enlightenment and the perfectly clean morality  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The moral precept of hope is fully taking the moral precepts because of seeking to be born with the gods and in other residences The moral precept of fear is fully taking the moral precepts because of fear for own punishment fear for punishment of others fear for faults fear for woeful courses fear for death or fear for defame The moral precept of being conformable to the members of enlightenment is fully taking the moral precepts because of decorating awarenesses because of the development of completeness or because of seeking for the supreme truth The perfectly clean morality is pure moral precept What is the perfectly clean morality Answer  The fundamental ones and the adjacent ones that are clean not being broken by initial thought including right mindfulness and being conformable to parinirvana There are five reasons because of which moral precept is clean the socalled fundamental ones that are clean the adjacent ones  that are clean not being broken by initial thought  including right mindfulness and going to liberation in a right way That the fundamental ones are clean is that one is free from the fundamental paths of action That the adjacent ones are clean is that one is free from the preparation of such as taking life Sutra  Not being broken by initial thought is that one is free from the defilement of the three forms of initial thought Including right mindfulness is including the recollection on Buddha on the doctrine and on the samgha That is why one is also free from neutral awarenesses Going to liberation in a right way is fully taking the moral precepts for liberation not because of personal richness or other deeds That is why this is also said to be conformable to the members of enlightenment By means of these five reasons moral precept is clean The Worldhonoured One said that this is with acquisition of a great fruit because of being free from every defilement Question That the moral precept on which every right practice depends is as a jar of heavenly merit is already known How are the two kinds of spiritual practice Answer In the trances the immaterial ones and the unlimited ones there is spiritual practice which is obtaining and spiritual practice which is development The meaning of two kinds of spiritual practice the repulsive and mindfulness on breathing in and breathing out is likewise ones dress devel Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya oping as mixing o hemp developing as mixing metal Present  is spiritual practice which is development future is spiritual practice which is obtaining because what is present is enjoyed because what is future is to be produced Present is doing what one shoud do future is having to do it because what is present has arisen and what is future is to be achieved Present is the part which is present future is the part of accomplishment The trances immaterial ones and unlimited ones have already been spoken of elaborately in the chapter Concentration  The contemplation of the repulsive is with the nature of absence of greed because it is the antidote for greed Moreover it is further said to be fourfold because it is the antidote for four kinds of attachment the development of the contemplation of a corpse because of abandoning the attachment of what is relating to deportment the development of the contemplation of the discoloured corpse because of abandoning the attachment to colour the development of the contemplation of a skeleton from which skin and flesh have been removed because of abandoning the attachment to contact the development of the contemplation of bones because of abandoning the attachment to places There further are four kinds of this contemplation of the repulsive what is connected to falling back what is conducive to maintenance what is connected to progress and what is connected to penetration What is connected to falling back is falling back when abiding what is conducive to maintenance is not progressing and not falling back when abiding what is connected to progress is having to progress when abiding what is connected to penetration is the noble path that follows when abiding Sutra  The realms are the realm of sexual passion and the one of form the stages are ten stages the realm of sexual passion the intermediate trance the fundamental four trances and the four adjacent ones the basis is the realm of sexual passion the aspects is being without aspects the supporting object is taking the realm of sexual passion as supporting object the application of mindfulness is application of mindfulness on the body the knowledge is conventional knowledge It is associated with three faculties It falls in the three periods of time the past  takes the past as supporting object the present takes the present as supporting object and the future takes the future as supporting ob ject when with arisen factors and takes the three periods of time as supporting object when with nonarisen factors When good it takes what is neutral as supporting object Being neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do it takes neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do as supporting object To be abandoned through the spiritual path takes what is to be abandoned through the spiritual path  as supporting object It should be mentioned that it takes meaning as supporting object Question Is it acquired by effort or Answer It is both acquired by effort and acquired by nonattachment When the first trance is acquired being without the desire of the realm of sexual passion up to when the fourth trance is acquired being without the desire of the  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya third trance the effort is present later Question How is the contemplation of the repulsive prepared Answer The development of the contemplation of the repulsive is that when reaching a burial chamber these characteristic marks are taken extremely well after these have been taken one returns and reaches a place to sit washes the feet and sits in peace makes ones body and mind smooth is free from all obstructions takes this outward supporting object and compares ones own body with it one abides in the footbone the shinbone the heelbone the thighbone the kneecap the pubic bone the spinal cord the ribs the handbone the armbone the shoulderbone the neckbone the jawbone the toothbone the teethbone and the scull When one finds satisfaction with a concise contemplation one first surpasses from the application of mindfulness on the body When one finds satisfaction in a wide contemplation one observes the scull from the place between the eyebrows up to the footbone and from here one is with one place to sit one room one hall one samgharama one village one region or one country With the one who only produces it from conceptual identification there are not these residences With the one who can reach a general great reach with the shining of the eyes   he can observe that all these residences are full of skeletons When further contracting one successively rea turns to the place between the eyebrows and contracts the mind between the eyebrows This is called the accomplishment of the contemplation of the repulsive  Sutra  With the contemplation of the repulsive sometimes the supporting objects are scarce but the selfdependence is not scarce Four sentences are to be made The supporting objects are scarce but the selfdependence is not scarce going into the contemplation of the repulsive manifold regarding the own person The selfdependence is scarce but the supporting objects are not scarce understanding the unpleasantness of all four sees and continents simultaneously and not being able to go into the contemplation of the repulsive manifold Both the supporting objects are scarce and the selfdependence is scarce understanding the unpleasantness of the own person simultaneously and not being able to go into the contemplation of the repulsive manifold Neither the supporting objects are scarce nor the selfdependence is scarce being with the unpleasantness of all four sees and continents and also being able to go into the contemplation of the repulsive manifold Furthermore with the contemplation of the repulsive there are the supporting objects that are unlimited but not the selfdependence that is unlimited Four sentences are to be made The supporting objects are unlimited but not the selfdependence is unlimited unpleasantness of all four sees and continents and not being able to go into the contemplation of the repulsive manifold The selfdependence is unlimited but not the supporting objects are unlimited going into the contemplation of the repulsive manifold regarding the own person Both the supporting objects are unlimited and also the selfdependence is unlimited the unpleasantness of all four sees and continents and also being able to go into the contemplation of the repulsive manifold  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Neither the supporting objects are unlimited nor the selfdependence is unlimited not being able to go into the contemplation of the repulsive manifold regarding the own person The contemplation of the repulsive has already been spoken of Mindfulness on breathing in and breathing out shall now be Pe of  Ana is adhering to what comes apa a is adhering to what goes It is also called asvasa and prasvasa Mindfulness is being mindful It is carefully binding ones mindfulness regarding anapana so that the mind is not in vain Because of the development of this mindfulness spiritual practice is spoken of Mindfulness on breathing i in and breathing out is with the nature of wisdom Because mindfulness increases in relation to this class mindfulness on breathing in and breathing out is spoken of just as the applications of mindfulness just as being mindful on the former existences What is produced first is what is produced concerning the place of the navel in the womb the breath of life produced by action It either is oriented downward or it is oriented upward The one that is oriented downward makes the pores of the lower part of the body the one that is oriented upward makes the pores of the upper part of the body After the pores have been settled breathing out is first Up to at death  breathing out is the very last The same is true for meditative attainment when breathing out is first there is entering concentration when breathing in is first there is leaving concentration There are six reasons that acquire six kinds of mindfulness on breathing in and breathing out the socalled counting following fixing observing modifying and purifying Counting The devotee is skilled in concentrated reflection and counts breathing in and breathing out There is not one breathing in and breathing out he does not perceive When the mind is disturbed there is sometimes counted less there is sometimes counted more and sometimes there is counted in disorder Counting less is seeing two as one counting more is seeing one as two counting in disorder is making the conceptual identification that breathing out is breathing in and making the conceptual identification that breathing in is breathing out When the mind is not disturbed this is called counting right Five times breathing out and five times breathing in When at the moment the devotee counts the mind is disturbed among these ten one has to return and start counting again from one When the number ten is accomplished whether he is disturbed or not he should start counting from one again because of fear the mind gets dispersed ten may not be surpassed because of fear not to concentrate the mind it is not less than ten Because one has never had a higher number Following Is there something that proceeds with the go of breathing in and breathing out Is it long or short when following Does it concern the whole body Does it abide in one place Is breathing in from remote or from nearby What is the limitation of proceeding and of returning Fixing According to that with which the mind is glad letting concentrated awarenesses abide in one place of the body and understanding it Is this breathing in and breathing out advantageous or disadvantageous regarding the body Is it cold or hot Things like this   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Observing When practised assiduously or practised extremely being present according to wish just as the attention for the specific name Modifying With the one who depends on initial thought on sensual pleasure it is little zealous with the one who depends on initial thought on renunciation it is zealous Purifying Purifying all obstructions When the devotee makes one conceptual identification regarding breathing in and breathing out it is observing the body as a cane of bamboo and observing breathing in and breathing out as precious stones one wears When breathing in and breathing out is unshakeable this does not produce consciousness of the body regarding the body This is called accomplishment of mindfulness on breathing in and breathing out Some say that also consciousness of the body is produced but that it does not harm the body Moreover regarding breathing in and breathing out the devotee is harmed by means of atoms This is called observation of the body Experiencing breathing in and breathing out is called feeling It exactly is the obser vation of this feeling This is called observation of feeling Being conscious of breathing in and breathing out is called consciousness It exactly is the observation of this consciousness This is called observation of consciousness It exactly is the observation of this conceptual identification This is called observation of conceptual identification Atoms break matter After matter has been extinguished completely it is present by means of the production of joy conceptual identification and consciousness and subseSutra  quently one exactly lets these three be considered as the seed of preparation of three applications of mindfulness  It is not when breathing in is not extinguished yet that breathing out arises it is not when breathing out is not extinguished yet that breathing in arises This is called surpassing the aspect impermanence depending on anapana Because breathing in is suppressed breathing out is extinguished This is called surpassing the aspect frustration This is called acquisition of the preparation that is the seed of the gate of liberation which is aimlessness Birth duration and disappearance of breathing in and breathing out are not selfwilled This is called observation of surpassing the aspect without self depending on breathing inand breathing out Breathing in and breathing out is free from such things as permanence That is why the aspect emptiness js surpassed depending on this This is called acquisition of the preparation that is the seed of the gate of liberation which is emptiness Making a mind of aversion and going to nirvana arise regarding breathing in and breathing out is called acquisition of preparation that is the seed of the gate of liberation which is signlessness Depending on these minor three samadhis there are middle ones depending on middle ones there are excessive ones In this way there successively is the factor warmth up to the knowledge of destruction and the knowledge of nonorigination Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of therealms How are these Answer  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  Twenty are said to be of the realm of sexual passion The realm of form is sometimes with sixteen The realm of formlessness has four They are spoken of in succession of the places Twenty are said to be of the realm of sexual passion The eight great hells animal birth ghosts the four conti nents and the six gods of the realm of sexual passion these twenty are said to be of the realm of sexual passion Because of desire these beings receive a body provisions and a companion That is why they are said to be of the realm of sexual passion The realm of form is sometimes with sixteen The gods of brahmas group the brahmapurohitagods the ones of limited radiance the ones of unlimited radiance the shining ones the ones of limited magnificence the ones of unlimited magnificence the entirely magnificent ones the unclouded ones the ones having increase of merit the ones having great fruit the not troubled ones the ones without ardour the clearly visible ones the clearvisioned ones and the highest gods in form these sixteen residences are said to be of the realm of form Some wish that there are seventeen just as the previous sixteen and the great brahmas These beings receive a material body no provisions and no companion That is why they are said to be of the realm of form The realm of formlessness has four The sphere of unlimited space the sphere of unlimited consciousness the sphere of nothingness and the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification Beings in these residences do not receive a material body because of being without desire for matter Question How are the three realms established Is it because of abandoning craving or is it because of the place When because of abandoning craving there should be nine abandonment of craving of the realm of sexual passion is the realm of sexual passion the same applies to the first trance up to the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification When established because of the place there should be forty as has been said previously Answer Generally it is said to be because of abandoning craving abandoning craving of the realm of sexual passion is the realm of sexual passion The same applies to abandoning craving of the realm of form that is the realm of form and to abandoning craving of the realm of formlessness that is the realm of formlessness Because the realm of sexual passion is not concentrated it is developed by one because the realm of form and the one of formlessness are concentrated they are not developed by one Question How are the realms established Answer They are spoken of in succession of the places Some say that in succession to the lower there is the higher the lowest is the Avicihell next there is the Hell of all burning  and in this way in succession up to the highest gods in form Higher than the highest gods in form there further is the Avicihell and successively up to the highest gods in form When one is free from one kind of desire of the realm of sexual passion then one is free from all kinds of desire of the realm of sexual passion When one acquires the footing of supernatural power of the first trance one can reach  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the whole realm of sexual passion and the whole brahmaworld Furthermore there is the wish to let the realms be established side by side Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of the seven abodes of consciousness How are these Answer The good courses that abide in the realm of sexual passion three stages of the realm of form as well as three of the one of formlessness these are said to be the abodes of consciousness The good courses of the realm of sexual passion gods and humans the first three stages of the realm of form and the first three stages of the realm of formiessness these seven stages are said to be the abodes of consciousness Beings that have a configuration accomplish a material body Manifold bodies is having manifold configurations manifold conceptual identifications are the conceptual identifications frustration satisfaction and neitherpleasantnorunpleasant This is said to be the first abode of consciousness Furthermore manifold bodies is as has been said previously one conceptual identification is the conceptual identification of what is defiled It is making this reflection when primarily arising with the gods of brahmas group We arise from the gods of the great brahmas The gods of the great brahmas make this reflection I can make these arise Because of honourable and dishonourable places and because of the group of consciousness Sttra  of initial thought and sustained thought the gods of brahmas group have manifold bodies This is said to be the second abode of consciousness One body is evenness of colour of signs of the body and of the measure of the configuration Manifold conceptual identifications are the conceptual identifications satisfaction and neitherpleasantnorunpleasant In the fundamental one there is contentedness With fatigue the faculty equanimity of the adjacent one is present With fatigue of equanimity contentedness is present again This is said to be the third abode of consciousness  With one body and one conceptual identification one body is as has been said previously one conceptual identification is satisfaction This is said to be the fourth abode of consciousness Beings of the one of formlessness do not accomplish a material body because of being free from desire for matter They surpass every conceptual identification of matter is said because of proceeding free from matter because the conceptual identification of matter is associated with consciousness of the eye When free from the desire of the first trance one surpasses proceeding in craving for sensual pleasure When free from the desire of the fourth trance one surpasses proceeding in material formations Because of this meaning the cessation of conceptual identification of what is resisting is spoken of because of being associated with the group of five forms of consciousness Not being mindful on manifold conceptual identifications concerns these manifold conceptual identifications That the stage of the fourth trance is generally dispersed is because of taking manifold sense  as supporting object defiled it takes ten  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya sense as supporting object undefiled it takes the twelve sense as supporting object Because of being free from the disturbance of desire not being mindful is spoken of The unlimited ones are because of the aspect of being unlimited When developed there is the indecision of going into emptiness  Because there is meditative attainment on emptiness going into the sphere of unlimited consciousness is spoken of The accomplishment of going into the sphere of unlimited space is the acquisition of the accomplishment of four aggregates of this stage This is said to be the fifth abode of consciousness If when developing there is the indecision of going into the consciousness of the sphere of unlimited consciousness this is said to be the sixth abode of consciousness When the aspect of being unlimited is not being part of it it is therefore said to be the sphere of nothingness This is said to be the seventh abode of consciousness Question Why are seven abodes of consciousness established Answer When consciousness abides in satisfaction in them they are therefore said to be abodes of consciousness With woeful courses there is suppression by frustration and that is why consciousness does not abide in satisfaction Because the gods of the clean residences go to nirvana consciousness does not abide in satisfaction because the ones who do not conceptually identify are without intention  because the rest of the fourth trance either seek for the one of formlessness or seek for clean residences  or seek for absence of conceptual identification  consciousness does therefore not abide in satisfaction Sutra  Because the summit of existence is not intense consciousness does not abide in satisfaction Furthermore when there are factors that break consciousness therefore no abode of consciousness is established because with woeful courses the faculty frustration is breaking because with the fourth trance the samadhi without conceptual identification is breaking and because with the summit of existence the samadhi of cessation is breaking no abode of consciousness is established Question What are the nine abodes of beings Answer  With the summit of existence and the ones who do not conceptually identify these are said to be abodes of beings Four impure aggregates are said to be four abodes of consciousness With the summit of existence and the ones who do not conceptually identify these are said to be abodes of beings The seven abodes of consciousness previously spoken of the gods who do not conceptually identify and the summit of existence are said to be the nine abodes of beings Question Why are woeful courses not said to be an abode of beings Answer Because abiding in satisfaction is not being part of them because of manifold frustration there is no abiding in satisfaction The gods of the clean residences go to nirvana fast therefore there is no abiding in satisfaction  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the rest of the fourth trance are as has been said previously Question What are four abodes of consciousness Answer Four impure aggregates are said to be four abodes of consciousness Exception made for the aggregate consciousness the other four impure aggregates are said to be abodes of consciousness Some say that that the aggregates of what is relating to beings are said to be an abode of consciousness is not right Because of the meaning of basis aspect supporting object associatedness and condition is called abode Basis is that on which consciousness depends supporting object is being able to be supporting object not that which is taken as supporting object What is condition in Sanskrit It is avasthayam The meaning of streaming and abiding rearising is successively arising in the womb Although in the past and in the future they are not that which is relating to beings they also have these five meanings That is why they achieve to be an abode of consciousness That pure factors also are said to be an abode of consciousness is not right Because they destroy defiled consciousness they do not establish an abode of consciousness The aggregate consciousness is no abode of consciousness because the two are not being part of one another because before and after they are not together because the specific nature is not looked upon Consciousness of what is homogeneous abides in the aggregates of what is homogeneous the realm of sexual passion abides in the realm of sexual passion Compared in this way it does not concern another realm another stage or another body Question Why are the aggregates of what is homogeneous Siitra  said to be an abode of consciousness and not of what is not homogeneous Answer Because the aggregates of what is homogeneous are grasped by consciousness Question Why is it that the aggregate awarenesses not of what is homogeneous and the aggregate nonawareness are called abode of consciousness The moment that awarenesses of another realm abide is called aggregate awarenesses not of what is homogeneous the moment that what is no accompanying mental factor Also these accomplish the characteristic marks of abodes of consciousness When consciousness of what is homogeneous arise these then proceed subsequently and are with the meaning of an abode of consciousness It is because of hindrance of intermediate reasons that consciousness did not arise it is not not being part of an abode of consciousness Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of the chain of dependent origination Which characteristic marks does this have Answer  According to the sequence of defilements actions and actual entities there is birth It should be known that this has members The members of the chain of dependent origination in three parts are defilements actions and actual entities  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Defilements actions and actual entities are called the members of the chain of dependent origination regarding arising in successive production It should be known that these are the members of the chain of dependent origination The establishment of all these parts is rearising of beings Two are past and future Being intermediate is spoken of regarding eight The establishment of all these parts is rearising of beings Regarding this chain of dependent origination in three parts twelve members are spoken of Question How are these when not being able to differentiate frustration satisfaction and neitherpleasantnorunpleasant yet is said to be contact Differentiating the limitation of frustration and of satisfaction and not being able to differentiate the limitation of defilement yet is said to be feeling The arising of feeling of the fool with pleasant feeling Sutra  regarding what is to be desired or is not to be desired either free or combined is said to be craving Widely producing defilement in the present is said to be grasp ing Arising again in a later existence is said to be existence Two are action and seven are actual entities Seven are called members of the former existence Five are said to be the later state Three members of existence are defilement Two are action and seven are actual entities then Ignorance craving and grasping as three members of existence are defilement Conditioning factors and existence as two members are action The other members are said to be actual entities Seven are called members of former existence Five are said to be the later state It should be known that the seven members from ignorance to feeling are called the former chain of dependent origination The other five members are said to be the later chain of dependent origination Of the first members five are said to be a fruit The other two are a cause Of the later members three are said to be a cause The other two are a fruit  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya From consciousness up to feeling of the former chain of dependent origination are a fruit ignorance and conditioning factors are a cause The first three members of the later chain of dependent origination are said to be a cause the later two members are said to be a fruit Question Do some of the former and later members acquire to proceed in harmony Answer There is such an acquisition How is this Former delusion is later craving and grasping The same is true for the combination of conditioning factors and existence The psychophysical complex senses contact and feeling are equally said to be with decay and dying The consciousness of primary experiencing a body is future birth Question That there are former and later members that include one another when proceeding is already known How are they produced Answer  Defilement produces defilement and action This action makes an actual entity arise when proceeding Also an actual entity makes actual entities arise and further also make defilement arise Because of defilement defilement arises because of cravSitra  ing grasping arises Because of defilement action arises because of grasping existence arises Because of action an actual entity arises because of existence birth arises because of birth decay and dying arise Actual entities further make defilement arise the psychophysical complex six senses contact and feeling previously spoken of exactly are as decay and dying of the later members That is why it is said that because of feeling craving arises It is also said that because of decay and dying there is ignorance This is called the endless wheel of existence Question There are four kinds of chain of dependent origination What are these four Answer   Proceeding by connection instantaneous extended and the previously mentioned segmented these are said to be the chain of dependent origination Proceeding by connection is the meaning of being endless Because causes and fruits are connected when proceeding the wheel of the chain of dependent origination is spoken of just as the beginning of the full moon is not to be known That is why the sitras say The origin of craving for existence is not to be known That It should be said that it does not exist it should not be said that it is not to be known where existence comes from it  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya would be impossible to know what exists is not right Because there is no cause of teaching there is no teaching but if exists and one is asked stating that is not to be known being asked why not to be known then the answer is It is not to be known in any way The chain of dependent origination is such dependent successiveness as the beginning of the wheel of the full moon that is not to be known The beginning of the wheel of the full moon is not to be known that is why it is said that it is not to be known Because all members of existence are present in the period of a ksana being instantaneous is spoken of just as the Vijfanakayasastra says regarding the thing of decoration Because of noncognisance greed is produced Noncognisance is ignorance Greed is conditioning factors Knowing regarding actual entities is consciousness Because of extended proceeding the extended chain of dependent origination is spoken of it is the meaning of abiding for a long time when actually proceeding It are not only the twelve members that are said to be the chain of dependent origination Either that which makes arise or Sitra  that which arises all conditioned factors are said to be the chain of dependent origination The venerable Punyayasa said that sometimes that which is produced from dependent origination is not that which is already produced from dependent origination the five aggregates of death of the past and of the present arhat that which is produced from dependent origination is that which is already produced from dependent origination exception made for the five aggregates of death of the past and of the present arhat all other past and present factors that which is not produced from dependent origination is not that which is already produced from dependent origination unconditioned factors Because of that which is to be acquired in what is segmented segmented is spoken of The state of defilement of the moment of the past existence is said to be ignorance The rest is as has been said previously Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of birth and courses Of the courses it should be stated that they are that which is acquired Does birth include the courses or do the courses include birth Answer  Birth includes all courses it are not the courses that include birth In birth intermediate existence increases It should be known that it is not included in the courses Birth includes the courses it are not the courses that include birth Answer In birth intermediate existence increases Intermediate existence is included in birth and is not included in the courses Because of arriving a course is spoken of Intermediate existence is going and no arriving that is why it does not concern the courses eggborn born from the womb moistureborn and magically born The realm of sexual passion is supplied with the four kinds of birth the realm of form and the one of formlessness are completely with being magically born hell is with being magically born animal birth is with the four kinds ghosts are with being magically born and also have being born from the womb humans are with the four kinds gods are with being magically born Being magically born is the most wide one because it is two complete courses and one part of three courses This is also the most superior form Question If it is the most superior form then why is the Worldhonoured One not magically born Answer Because the moments are not together with the moment of being magically born there is no Buddha who rises in the world with the moment Buddha rises in the world there is no person who is magically born Furthermore because of all superiority when the Worldhonoured One would be with all superiority the lineage in which He is born should have to be the most superior one of all beings because of explaining the doctrine and accepting faith and because of abandoning the pride of the lineage  The courses are the five courses hell animal birth ghosts humans and gods Because of having no satisfacSatra  tion the hell is spoken of because the body moves horizontally animal birth is spoken of because of seeking from another ghosts are spoken of because of the mind that is appeased humans are spoken of because of brilliance gods are spoken of There is the wish to let the asuras be the same course as the gods That is why it is said You are in first instance that god Question When this is right then why are the truths not seen Answer Because of being covered by craftiness Some say that these are ghosts with great power because they are not spoken of with the course gods Question If it is so then why is Sakra tise of both Answer Because of attachment to matter Also bhiitas kumbhandas and raksasas are included in the course ghosts Kimnaras pisacas heluvakas Saras and vakras are included in the course animal birth close to the prac Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of the six elements What are these Answer The socalled four elements the impure forms of consciousness and also what is characterised as present in matter These elements are said to be the fundament of birth The socalled four elements the impure forms of consciousness and also what is characterised as present in mat Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya ter The four elements the group of five forms of con sciousness and impure consciousness of the mind and also what is present in matter That which is felt by the eye is calculated as in the element space These are said to be the six elements Question The eighteen elements have already been spoken of Why are the six elements spoken of separately These elements are said to be the fundament of birth These elements are said to establish that which is calculated as a person because of being the fundament of birth That is why the pure factors are not established among the six elements The four elements are as has been said in the chapter Elements Questicn Which characteristic marks do the truths have Answer   Formations that are with the nature of a fruit and that are impure are said to be frustration The nature cause concerns the origin The truth of cessation is the destruction of multiple frustration Formations that are with the nature of a fruit and that are impure are said to be frustration All impure formations are with cause and because of the nature of bonds are said to be frustration The nature cause concerns the origin These impure formations with the nature of a cause are said to be the truth of the origin That is why frustration and the origin are one thing but because of cause and fruit two truths are esSutra  tablished The truth of cessation is the destruction of mae frustration Final appeasement of all impure factors said to be the truth of cessation  Formations that are pure are said to be the truth of the path Formations that are pure are said to be the truth of the path All pure formations are said to be the truth of the path because there is contrariness Question Why is something said to be called a truth Answer This is because of two reasons There are two reasons to speak of a truth the specific nature that is not false and vision Although the specific nature of space and of uncalculated cessation is not false they are not said to be a truth because of being neutral and because of being pure When factors concern frustration the cause of frustration free from frustration or the antidote for frustration a truth is therefore established because of being pure they are no frustration and no cause of frustration because of being neutral they are not free from frustration because of being unconditioned they are no antidote for frustration That is why the four noble truths are spoken of Disease the cause of disease being without disease and medicine are also explained in this way Question What is the meaning of noble truth Answer The nobles produce real wakefulness regarding  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya all these truths and because of manifesting them to others they are said to be noble truths This characteristic mark suppressing is said to be frustration the characteristic mark birth is said to be the origin the characteristic mark peace jis said to be cessation the characteristic mark escape issaid to be the path Question There ought to be a cause first and a fruit later Why did the Worldhonoured One first speak of the fruit Answer Although it is in this way the fruit is spoken of first because of being conformable to higher realisation Because frustration is coarse it is with higher realisation first it is to be compared in this way Although cessation is subtle it is not the path and in nominal designation this truth is spoken of first seeking for cessation is coarse and is not the path Furthermore it is because of the meaning of being to surpass easily that they are established as to succession in being coarse Coarse concerns frustration of the realm of sexual passion this is with higher realisation first Later it is in reiation to frustration of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness Although frustration of the realm of form is coarse and is not of the realm of formlessness they are with one form of higher realisation because of being concentrated and because of being not concentrated Question How is higher realisation of the noble truths Is it of specific characteristic marks or of general characteristic marks Answer Because of the truth it is of specific characteristic marks because of aggregates it is of general characteristic marks Sitra  Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of the four fruits of ramanaship How many actual entities does this concern Answer  There are six actual entities of noble fruits The most superior one abides in nine stages The third abides in six stages There are six actual entities of noble fruits Six actual entities are said to concern the fruits of sramanaship the pure five aggregates and calculated cessation When the noble path is said to be with the fruits of sramanaship these fruits  The fruits of sramanaship shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Inves tigations  Question In which stages are these fruits included Answer The most superior one abides in nine stages The fruit of arhatship is included in nine stages the pretrance the intermediate one the fundamental four trances and three immaterial ones The third abides in six stages The fruit of anagaminship is included in six stages exception made for the immaterial ones Two fruits Question Which characteristic marks does the path have Answer  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Practising the doctrine by the faithfollower is free from defilement and is characterised by slowliness Practising the doctrine by the doctrinefollower is free from defilement and is characterised by quickliness Practising the doctrine by the faithfollower is free from defilement and is characterised by slowliness Because the pure factors practised by the faithfollower are included in the class of minor faculties it should be known as slow When experienced by the faithfollower it should be known it is also experienced by the one given to faith and by the one conditionally liberated because of equal minor faculties Practising the doctrine by the doctrinefollower is free from defilement and is characterised by quickliness Because the pure factors practised by the doctrinefollower are included in the class of keen faculties it should therefore be known it is the quick path When experienced by the doctrinefollower it should be known it is also experienced by the viewattainer andby the one unconditionally liberated because of equal keen faculties It should be known that in the stages of the fundamental trances it is the mode of progress of satisfaction It should be known that because of being limited and hard to acquire it is said to be the one of frustration Tt should be known that in the stages of the fundamental trances it is the mode of progress of satisfaction The characteristics of minor faculties and the characteristics of keen faculties of the stages of the fundamental four Sutra  trances are said to be the mode of progress of satisfac tion Because of quietude and insight that are even the path of this stage is proceeding in satisfaction It should be known that because of being limited and hard to acquire it is said to be the one of frustration What depends on the other stages is said to be the mode of progress of frustration In immaterial meditative attainments the path of insight is limited Because of this effort is hard to be acquired and it is said to be the one of frustration It is not the noble path that is with the nature of unpleasant feeling Although the path of the destruction of frustration also is with unlimited forms of differentiations it is said to be of four kinds because of being established by these stages and faculties when these stages of fundamental trances are with keen faculties they are said to be the mode of progress of satisfaction and the quick path when with minor faculties they are said to be the mode of progress of satisfaction and the nonquick path When the paths of the other stages are with keen faculties they are said to be the mode of progress of frustration and the quick path when with minor faculties they are said to be the mode of progress of frustration and the nonquick path Because of right progress the path is spoken of because of going to liberation in a right way the path is spoken of Question What are the kinds of perfect faith Answer  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Faith that is clean and with absence of impurity in relation to Buddha and in relation to the religious merit of the Sravaka in relation to liberation and also in relation to other causes and in relation to noble moral precept It is certainty Faith that is clean and with absence of impurity in relation to Buddha and in relation to the religious merit of the sravaka in relation to liberation and also in relation to other causes When pure faith regarding the religious merit of the adept acquired by Buddha is produced this is called perfect faith regarding Buddha  When pure faith regarding the proceeding i in the religious merit of still having learning to do and of having no more learning to do by the samgha is produced this is called perfect faith regarding the samgha  When pure faith regarding nirvana  is produced and when exception made for the factors previously spoken of pure faith regarding the other truths of frustration and of the origin  and regarding the pure qualities of the bodhisattva and the pure qualities of the pratyekabuddha is produced this is called perfect faith in the doctrine with unmingled supporting object Because of the treasure of the doctrine with different supporting objects a fixed unmingled supporting object When pure faith regarding the religious merit of Buddha the religious merit of the pratyekabuddha and the religious merit of the sravaka is produced this is called perfect faith in the doctrine with mingled supporting object Because of the three treasures with mingled supporting objects Ma mingled supporting object is spoken of  And in relation to noble moral precept Pure moral Sutra  precept the four elements that are clean Faith is that awarenesses are clean moral precept is that the four ele ments are clean Question Why is it that what is pure is said to be perfect faith Answer It is certainty Pure faith that arises together with the knowledge of the absolute truth and moral precept are certainty Impure faith is what is mingled with lack of confidence impure moral precept is what is mingled with bad moral precepts Since the pure one passes through birth it is not mingled because of certainty What is pure establishes perfect faith This meaning shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Investigations  Question Which characteristic marks does the develop  ment of concentration have Answer It is said that when the first trance is good this is called pleasant abiding in the present  The acquisition of the knowledge of birth and death is said to be called knowledge and vision  t is said that when the first trance is good this is called pleasant abiding in the present The clean and the pure  first trance is pleasant abiding in the present This is called pleasant abiding in the present  acquired by the development of concentration Know that the same ap plies to the fourth trance The first trance is also said to be pleasant abiding in the future but it is not in any case it is either when falling back or when arising  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya in a higher stage or with Parinirvana Because pleasant abiding in the future is unfixed the Worldhonoured One has been speaking of pleasant abiding in the present The acquisition of the knowledge of birth and death is said to be called knowledge and vision The higher faculty that is the knowledge of birth and death js called knowledge and vision acquired through development of concentration It is completely to be known as has been said with the powers knowledge  It should be known that analytical wisdom is a quality arisen by application The diamondlike Sourth trance is called the destruction of impure influence Tt should be known that analytical wisdom is a quality arisen by application Qualities arisen by application are what is gocd of the three realms through learning through Teasoning and through personal realisation from desire for good factors and what is pure It is said that this is all called analytical wisdom acquired through the development of concentration The diamondlike fourth trance is called the destructionof impure influence The diamondlike concentration is said to be associated with the last awareness of the seeker It depends on the fourth trance and is called the destruction of impure influence acquired through the development of concentration This has been spoken of already by the Worldhonoured One Himself Destruction of craving of the sphere of nothingness by all bodhisattvas in the fourth trance is when arising free from beings depending on the fourth trance up to the destruction of impure influence Sutra  Question What is the specific nature of the footing of supernatural power Answer  Buddha said that good and conditioned factors produced by application are a footing of supernatural power They are also said to be right abandoning Buddha said that good and conditioned factors produced by application are a footing of supernatural power Because the qualities arisen by application previously spoken of are all the opportunity for supernatural power they are said to be a footing of supernatural power Because in the selfdependence of specific awarenesses manifold qualities are produced they are said to be a footing of supernatural power Because they are the footing Basis and member are both with one and the same meaning Question Answer t is samadhi This further is fourfold as to difference in supremacy When the supremacy of desiretodo produces samadhi it is called concentration of desiretodo The same applies to the samadhi produced from thesupremacy of energy of awarenesses or of deliberation With this there first is the supremacy of desiretodo because of desiretodo After desiretodo has arisen there is the supremacy of energy because of seeking for accomplishment After energy has been developed there is the supremacy of awarenesses because of following seeking Because of having gone to the accomplishment of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya a footing of supernatural power in a right way regarding desiretodo energy and awarenesses there is supremacy of deliberation When there is no deliberation then the rest is lost Question What is a supernatural power and what is a footing Although there is arising of such factors as feeling these are said to be a footing because concentration arises when these are grasped This meaning shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Miscellany They are also said to be right abandoning Exactly these qualities are said to be right abandoning Because c the fire of right knowledge burns grasses that are defilement right burning is spoken of Because these also abandon defilement right abandoning is spoken of Furthermore because abandoning defilement is most superior right superiority is spoken of This concerns abandoning and supporting evil and merit Because of the competence of either protecting or increase right abandoning is spoken of This is further fourfold because of difference in actual entities a taper oil warmth and breaking darkness When in this way energy is present at one ksana four actual entities are made Such as bad factors that have already arisen are as has been said elaborately in the stitras Appeasing defilement sows the faculties of the path for the annihilation of the acquisition of past and future defilement The annihilation of the acquisition of defilement is said Sutra  to be abandoning the past one and the future one that is not produced Although they abandon everything that is impure they are only said to be the annihilation of bad factors because bad factors are extremely vicious and are contrary to the noble path Because they make one fruit arise they are said to be evil because they make two fruits arise they are said to be bad Because good factors that have already arisen abide successively duration is spoken of Because of increase from minor to middle and to excessive doubled development and increase are spoken of Although the arhat is without bad factors and antidote that is abandoning four kinds of right abandoning are also spoken of because he is with the antidote that is detraction scolding and blaming is the antidote that is detraction with the antidote that is support and with the antidote that is removal The same applies to the realm of form and to the one of formlessness  These are said to be the Sour applications of mindfulness The same is true for the four traditional practices of a monk As they arise by this supremacy they are all spoken of according to this name These are said to be the four applications of mindfulness The qualities spoken of previously are also said to be applications of mindfulness the one on the body the one on feeling the one on awareness and the one on factors Because of being conformable to the observation of the specific characteristic marks and of the general character Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya istic marks of the inward of the outward and of both they are said to be applications of mindfulness as has been said in the chapter Nobility The same is true for the four traditional practices of a monk The qualities spoken of previously are also said to be the four traditional practices of a monk Because what is noble is the seed for them they are said to be traditional practices of a monk because what is noble arises from them they are said to be traditional practices of a monk Question What is the nature of the traditional practices of a monk Answer The nature of the root of merit absence of greed Their dependence js with the nature of the five aggregates Because of being the antidote for four kinds of craving and grasping four causes are spoken of craving arisen because of dress as cause giving alms as cause lodging as cause and craving arisen in relation to existence and nonexistence craving for nonexistence is craving for annihilation Exception made for the higher three this other form of craving is generally called craving for existence According to the successive antidotes the four traditional practices of a monk are established Because dress and giving alms are included in a medicine and because it moreover does not concern everything and not always no medicine is established separately Contentment is pro duced regarding present objects minuteness of desire is Sutra  produced regarding future objects When in the present one coin is not grasped it is hard not to be a sovereign of the world in the future The traditional practices of a monk regarding the one who has left home to become a religious mendicant have a twofold superiority hope and enjoyment For the one living in ones house there is only hope That is why the restraint of the code is a traditional practice of a monk because of being unmanifesting it is not manifesting Although the realm of form and the one of formlessness are without dress and nutriment they have a traditional practice of a monk pure restraint Question Why are all these qualities said to be a footing of supernatural power up to a traditional practice of a monk supremacy they are all spoken of according to this nameBecause these qualities arise from the Supremacy of concentration they are said to be a footing of Supernatural power when they arise from the Supremacy of energy they are said to be right abandoning when they arise from the supremacy of mindfulness they are said to be an application of mindfulness when they arise from the supremacy of contentment they are said to be a traditional practice of a monk Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of the thirtyseven classes of enlightenment How many natures do these have Answer  Clean Saith energy mindfulness wisdom joy tranquillity  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya equanimity thinking moral precept and samadhi associated with the class of enlightenment As has been said There are ten actual entities All other parts of the classes of enlightenment belong to them How is this Faith is the faculty faith and the power faith Energy is right abandoning the faculty energy the power energy the member of enlightenment energy and right effort Mindfulness is the faculty mindfulness the power mindfulness the member of enlightenment mindfulness and right mindfulness Wisdom is the applications of mindfulness the faculty wisdom the power wisdom the member of enlightenment investigation into factors and right view Joy is the member of enlightenment joy Tranquillity is the member of enlightenment tranquillity Equanimity is the member of enlightenment equanimity Thinking is right conceptualising Moral precept is right speech right action and right livelihood Samadhi is the footing of supernatural power the faculty concentration the power concentration the member of enlightenment concentration and right concentration The Vibhasa wants moral precept to be of two forms because of bodily and verbal action that are not to be mingled eleven actual entities are spoken of Question Why are these factors established in manifold forms Sutra  Answer Establishment effort and selfdependence Minor ones are as keen ones The path of vision and also the spiritual path That is why thirtyseven are spoken of Establishment Because establishment is established by the zight supporting object the applications of mindfulness are spoken of Effort Because of right effort right abandoning is spoken of Because of selfdependent qualities the footing of supernatural power is spoken of  Minor ones Such five characteristic marks as faith being minor is said about faculties As keen ones When these faculties are dominant a power is spoken of That is why the meaning of supremacy is said to concern the faculties Because of being hard to subject a power is spoken of  Question What are these faculties and how is their succession Answer Faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom The succession of these faculties is that faith in gauses and fruits can be the root of all good factors that is why faith is spoken of first After there is faith there is abandoning what is bad and what is good is developed therefore energy is developed After energy is developed awarenesses abide in mindfulness regarding an object After awarenesses abide there is no disturbance regarding a supporting object After there is no disturbance there is the competence to understand  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Furthermore after there is understanding regarding a factor the mind is concentrated After the mind is concentrated there is subsequent abiding in right mindfulness After there is abiding in right mindfulness there is right competence After there is right competence there is faith in the fruit of action Question How are the five faculties established Answer They are established because of the stage the stage of the beginner is with the development of faith  because of implicating all superior factors The stage of vision is with the development of energy because the path of vision is with quick progress The thin stage is said to be with the development of mindfulness because abiding in mindfulness makes greed hatred and delusion thin The stage of nonattachment js said to be with the development of concentration because concentration develops the fundamental trances The stage of having no more learning to do is said to be with wisdom because when developing wisdom there is being free from ignorance eternally The powers are also to be spoken of in this way The path of vision In the path of vision the members of the path are developed because the path of vision is with quick progress it is right view up to right concentration Because of this manifesting of specific characteristic marks and of general characteristic marks regarding factors the right view is spoken of because of reflection upon the right meaning right conceptualising is spoken of because the four forms of verbal misconduct that are not included in false livelihood are abandoned through calcuSitra  lated cessation right speech is spoken of because the three forms of bodily misconduct that are not included in false livelihood are abandoned through calculated cessation right action is spoken of because false livelihood is aban doned through calculated cessation right livelihood is spoken of because of the competence of right effort right effort is spoken of because of not forgetting supporting objects when with right mindfulness right mindfulness is spoken of because of mindfulness with undivided attention when grasping what is right right concentration is spoken of Their succession is as is said in the siitras Right view this right view is the path and is also a member of the path the rest are members of the path and are no path Just as concentration is trance and is also a member of trance and the rest are members of trance and no trance The same as what has been explained applies to the eight forms of fixed things The spiritual path The spiritual path is the members c of enlightenment Abandoning the nine classes of defilement to be abandoned through the spiritual path is suddenlys because of extreme awaking Because of the meaning of awaking a member of enlightenment is spoken of Investigation into factors of enlightenment is enlightenment and is also a member of enlightenment the rest Question Why do joy tranquillity and equanimity establish a member of enlightenment and no member of the path do right conceptualising right speech right action and right livelihood establish a member of the path and no  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya member of enlightenment and is faith neither Answer Because they are conformable to enlightenment Up to knowing the supporting object joy arises permanently up to the arising of joy enlightenment arises permanently when all actual entities are appeased and with equanimity enlightenment arises permanently Because there is no being conformable to progress they are no members of the path Progress is with the meaning of the path Joy is no going because of being a happy state Because tranquillity and equanimity are absolutely contrary to going they are not said to be a member of the path Because moral precept is the hub of the wheel of the path it establishes a member of the wheel of the path because it is not associated it is no member of enlightenment because right conceptualising whips up right view there is being conformable to progress because it is no enlightenment it establishes a member of the path and no member of enlightenment Faith first practises surpassing enlightenment and the path are having already surpassed These are said to be thirtyseven These ten factors each are differentiated because the actual entities are differentiated the Worldhonoured One has been speaking of thirtyseven stage of the beginner is said to be with the applications of mindfulness because regarding such as the body there is development by differentiation The factor warmth is said to be right effort because the heat of the fire of noble knowledge arises The factor summit js said to be the footings of supernatural power because when acquiring the factor summit these qualities are selfdependent Sutra  The factor patience is said to be the faculties because these are supreme regarding progress The highest worldly factor is said to be the powers because when abiding i in it the powers cannot be subjected The path of vision is said to be the members of the path because of quick progress The spiritual path is said to be the members of enlightenment because of enlightenment Because of gradual increase of the number four up to eight there should first be the members of enlightenment and next the members of the path The second trance is with thirtysix The pretrance is further also thus The third fourth and the intermediate one are all with thirtyfive The second trance is with thirtysix Exception made for right conceptualising  because this stage has no thinking The pretrance is further also thus The pretrance is also with thirtysix The third fourth and the intermediate one are all with thirtyfive The third and the fourth trance and the intermediate trance are with thirtyfive exception made for joy and for right conceptualising The first trance is said to be with all The immaterial ones are with thirtytwo  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The highest one is with twentytwo The realm of sexual passion is further also thus The first trance is said to be with all The first trance is with all thirtyseven classes The immaterial ones are with thirtytwo Three immaterial ones are with thirtytwo exception made for joy right conceptualising right speech right action and right livelihood a The highest one is with twentytwo The sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification is without members of the path and members of enlightenment Although the members of the path are impure it should be known that they are pure since they are spoken of after the members of enlightenment That is why the sitras say Because the thirtyseven classes of enlightenment are absolutely pure As has been said in the sitras Practising the contemplation of the repulsive is together with the member of enlightenment mindfulness This is because by means of the contemplation of the repulsive the mind is controlled but later the member of enlightenment is present The realm of sexual passion is further also thus The realm of sexual passion is also with twentytwo Question In which stages do the four kinds of nutriment abide and which nature do they have Answer  Among the kinds of nutriment solid food of the realm of sexual passion is said to be with three sensefields The food of consciousness the one Sutra  of representative cognition and the one of contact these nutriment are said to be impure Among the kinds of nutriment solid food of the realm of sexual passion is said to be with three sensefields In the realm of sexual passion solid food is with three sensefields smell taste and the tangible There are thirteen actual entities then the eleven forms of contact smell and taste According to what is proper it either is because of grasses or because of wood or because of roots or because of fruits or because of the five grains or because of juices or because of smell or because of warmth it is to be compared in this way The food of consciousness the one of representative cognition and the one of contact these nutriment are said to be impure Because consciousness representative cognition and contact that are impure grasp the successiveness of birth and summon existence they are therefore said to be nutriment Although such as pure contact belong to the faculties and to the four elements they do not summon existence Because they abandon existence they therefore are no rutriment Question Why is matter no nutriment Answer Because matter is coarse it is no nutriment because matter is broken something is called nutriment Matter cannot extremely keep up the faculties and the four elements The meaning of keeping up is the meaning of nutriment This meaning shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Investigations   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question How many aspects do the three samddhis one by one have for their proceeding Answer The one of aimlessness has ten aspects With two aspects is the concentration of emptiness Four aspects are spoken of in relation to the one of signlessness The one of aimlessness has ten aspects The samadhi of aimlessness proceeds in ten aspects the socalled aspect impermanence the aspect frustration the four aspects of the origin and the four aspects of the path With two aspects is the concentration of emptiness The samadhi of emptiness proceeds in the aspect emptiness and in the aspect without self Four aspects are spoken of in relation to the one of signlessness These are said to be noble aspects The samadhi of signlessness proceeds in the four aspects of the truth of cessation This has already been spoken of elaborately in the chapter Concentration   Question How are the four perverted views By which nature are they abandoned Answer  It should be known that these Sour perverted views are to be abandoned through the vision of frustration They are with the accumulated specific nature of three views The one who sees the highest truth differentiates them  It should be known that these four perverted views are to be abandoned through the vision of frustration Because all four perverted views do not search for a root for a long time and because they are produced with frustration as substratum  they are to be abandoned through the vision of frustration The vibhajyavadins wish to have twelve perverted views the socalled perverted view conceptual identification the perverted view views and the perverted view awareness in relation to that which is called perverted view of impermanence as permanence The same applies to the other ones Eight kinds of these are to be abandoned through the path of vision the six of permanence and of selfless these two each are with the one which is awareness the one which is conceptual identification and the one which is views therefore six the perverted view views of seeing frustration as with satisfaction and the perverted view views of seeing what is unclean as clean Four are to be abandoned through the path of vision and through the spiritual path the perverted view conceptual identification and the perverted view awareness of frustration and of what is unclean The view of satisfaction and of cleanliness are absolutely to be abandoned through vision of the truth The one which is conceptual identification and the one which is awareness of satisfaction and of cleanliness are to be abandoned through the path of vision and through the spiritual path By means of vision of the truths the one which is conceptual identification and the one which is awareness are not destroyed when they are abandoned through vision Spoken of in this way this meaning is not right Because the perverted views are with the nature of views  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya because the one which is conceptual identification and the one which is awareness are disturbed by views that the perverted view conceptual identification and the one which is awareness are spoken of Because although also such as feeling are disturbed by view they are not that which is bound to the world they therefore are not spoken of When asked what the srotadpanna is defiled by it is because defilement is not abandoned Just as the srotadpanna who is the one living in ones house and who abandons the perverted view of the self still establishes the fetter of masculinity and of femininity To this the same applies as to the conceptual identification of a nonfactor that produces the fetter of masculinity and of femininity also the above mentioned conceptual identification and awareness that are no perverted view are like this They are with the accumulated specific nature of three views The one who sees the highest truth differentiates them These four perverted views are with the specific nature of three views but one part is spoken of  They are established by the one who sees the highest truth Question Answer Because of supremacy Question Why do the other views not establish a perverted view Answer Because of three things a perverted view is spoken of socalled certainty being superimposed and being absolutely delusioned  Although this false view and the view of annihilation included in extreme view are certainty and absolutely delusioned it is not superimposed because of arising from a broken actual entity Although the adherence to moral precepts and vows certainty and superimposed it is not absolutely delusioned because of being produced regarding a limited reality as substratum The Abhidharma says that belief in a self and the adherence to particular views are completely overturned It is that which is overturned that is practised endlessly When defilement is already abandoned the srotaapanna and the sakrdagamin are still attached to objects  is Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of manifold views In which views are these included Answer They are included in the five views Question How is this this view is false view when a view denies the highest truth it does not exist not existing is denying such as giving and moral precept Such as the nonexistence of frustration are said to be a false view What is untrue that is superimposed concerns two views and knowledge The self and what belongs to a self that are superimposed regarding the aggregates is the belief in a self Satisfaction and cleanliness that are superimposed is the adherence to particular views When what is untrue is superimposed regarding other substrata such as having a personal principle this is in this way all a false knowledge and no view  It is said that seeing what is no cause as a cause is adherence to moral precepts and vows Accepting the extreme view depends on annihilation and on eternality seeing what is no cause as a cause is adherence to moral precepts and vows Seeing a cause regarding what is without cause is adherence to moral precepts and vows Just as the one who because of a selfdependent god seeks to arise with the gods by means of abandoning such as nutriment or to acquire the nature of liberation when being able to explain the nature and the personal principle Apart from these five views there are no other views That is why it is said that all views are included in the five views Question How are these views abandoned Answer  Denying and being superimposed seeing a cause and the two extremes Regarding these actual entities proceed Sometimes they are to be abandoned when seeing them Denying It should be known that when the false views that have been spoken of are with denial of frustration they are to be abandoned through the vision of frustration be cause they are produced with frustration as substratum The same applies to such as vision of the origin to particular views and adherence to moral precepts and vows to be abandoned through the vision of cessation and through the one of the path that arise with these other substrata are to be abandoned through vision of these other substrata Because of this meaning also defilement of the realm of sexual passion that takes what is higher as supporting obis to be spoken of in this way  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya What is untrue that is superimposed is said to concern two views Because belief in a self is produced with frustration as substratum it is to be abandoned through the vision of frustration When adherence to particular views is superimposed regarding an untrue fruit it is to be abandoned through the vision of frustration When produced in relation to the cause it is to be abandoned through the vision of the origin What is produced regarding what is to be abandoned through the vision of cessation is to be abandoned through the vision of cessation It is not to be abandoned through spiritual practice because of certainty Adherence to moral precepts and vows is seeing a cause when there is no cause When produced regarding impurity as substratum it is to be abandoned through the vision of frustration When produced with what is to be abandoned through the vision of the path as substratum it is to be abandoned through the vision of the path Since the view of annihilation and the one of eternality are produced with vision of frustration as substratum they are to be abandoned through the vision of frustration Question What are the twentytwo faculties by the Worldhonoured One Answer spoken of  Such four faculties as the eye There are three forms of the faculty body The faculties mind and life Sutra  Such four faculties as the eye As has been said in the chapter Elements There are three forms of the faculty body The faculty body is said to be threefold the faculty body the male faculty and the female faculty The faculty mind The faculty mind has been spoken of already previously because the element mind exactly is the faculty mind Duration of life is said to be the faculty life These faculties are the basis for transmigration Because these faculties are the basis for transmigration they are established as a faculty Question What is the meaning of faculty Answer  Supremacy is the meaning of faculty Five faculties are said to be fourfold It should be known that the other four faculties each have two kinds of supremacy This meaning of supremacy is the meaning of faculty the meaning of being handsome is the meaning of faculty the meaning of excelling is the meaning of faculty the meaning of supremity is the meaning of faculty the meaning of mastery is the meaning of taculty Although all conditioned factors each are supreme they either are weak or superior  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question How many kinds of meaning of supremacy are there Answer In such as the eye there is a fourfold supremacy in such five faculties as the eye there is a fourfold dominant condition socalled letting the body be handsome protecting oneself being basis making consciousness arise and the unique principle This faculty eye lets the body be handsome when the fac is not perfect a person does not see joy manifold bad things increase and there is no supremacy Protecting oneself when the eye sees safety and danger it lets danger go and goes to safety to let the body abide for a long time Being basis making consciousness arise based on the eye consciousness of the eye and associated factors arise The unique principle only the eye sees matter The faculty ear Jets the body be handsome and protects oneself as has been said previously Being basis making consciousness arise based on the ear consciousness of the ear and associated factors arise only the ear hears sound The other faculties let the body be handsome as has been said previously Protecting oneself these three faculties are all with solid food and let the body abide for a long time Being basis making consciousness arise these three faculties each make consciousness that is homogeneous arise each proceeds in its own object It should be known that the other four faculties each have two kinds of supremacy Because the male faculty and the female faculty have two things as dominant condition there is supremacy the difference between beings and the difference in their characteristic marks Originally Sutra  there was one being after two faculties had arisen there was difference in beings and difference in the characteristic marks of beings Furthermore because of defilement and being clean being possessed of these two faculties nonrestraint can be made up to the five proximate actions and cutting away the roots of merit can be done Being clean is accepting moral restraint acquisition of a fruit being with nonattachment and sowing the seed of the three vehicles When being without distinctive marks and being with two distinctive marks such good or bad cannot be produced The faculty life is the species that is successive and is adhered to The faculty mind is what is successively in the future existence and subsequently proceeds in selfdependence The successiveness of existence is as has been said The existence with smell has two awarenesses that are present when proceeding either craving or hatred the selfdependence is as has been said Awarenesses lead the world In this way it is spoken of elaborately   Feeling sometimes concerns the state of defilement Such as faith depend on that which is clean When nine faculties are pure these three depend on a path Feeling sometimes concerns the state of defilement Frustration satisfaction depression contentedness and equanimity are feelings They are conformable to the state of defilement as dominant condition Feelings are mixed by defilement because feelings grasp satisfac Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya tion they are defiled by grasping satisfaction Furthermore feelings are the dominant condition for the state of defilement and for the one which is clean The state of defilement is as has been said Pleasant feeling is with the contaminant attachment unpleasant feeling is with the contaminant repugnance the faculty equanimity is with the contaminant delusion The state of being clean is as has been said Satisfaction is the cause for concentration of the own mind frustration and the origin are the basis of faith The six forms of escape are the aspect equanimity and such as faith Such as faith depend on that which is clean Because of being conformable to that which is clean such five faculties as faith are developed by the state of being clean When nine faculties are pure these  three depend on a path Such five faculties as faith and the faculties contentedness satisfaction equanimity and mind these nine faculties are either pure or impure When pure they establish three faculties because of depending on a path when included in the path of the faithfollower and in the one of the doctrinefollower it is the faculty I shall come to understand the not yet understood when included in the path of the one given to faith and in the one of the viewattainer it is the faculty of understanding when included in the path of the adept it is the faculty of one who has fully understood The faculties have already been spoken of Other reasons shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter In vestigations To which realm are these faculties bound Answer  The realm of sexual passion is with four Eight are good There are seven faculties of material kind There are ten that are accompanying mental factors then The realm of sexual passion is with four The male faculty the female faculty the faculty frustration and the faculty depression are bound to the realm of sexual passion The other material faculties and the faculty mind are as has been said in the chapter Elements  To such as faith and the faculty equanimity the same applies as to the faculty mind When the faculty satisfaction and the faculty contentedness are impure they are bound to the realm of sexual passion and to the one of form when pure they are unbound The faculty life shall be spoken of in the chapter Miscellany  Because the three pure faculties are with uninterrupted ness they are unbound Question How many are good Answer Eight are good Such five faculties as faith and the three pure faculties are good because of the desired fruit The faculty life and feelings should be spoken of as fruits of retribution The rest is as has been said in the chapter Elements  There are seven faculties of material kind Such seven faculties as eye are material Is the rest is immaterial How many are with the nature of awarenesses how many are with the nature of accompanying mental factors how many are no awareness and how many  are no accompanying mental factor Answer There are ten that are accompanying mental factors Such five faculties as faith and the five faculties of feeling are accompanying mental factors because of being associated with awarenesses One is an awareness The faculty mind is with the specific nature of an awareness because it acquires the characteristic marks of an awareness Such eight faculties as life neither are awarenesses nor accompanying mental factors because of being without supporting object Three faculties are twofold Of the three pure faculties there are two forms awarenesses and accompanying mental factors because of the accumulation of manifold natures Question How many are with retribution and how many are without retribution Answer Of all these faculties one and ten are with retribution Among twelve there are retributions The faculty life is only a retribution Of all these faculties one and ten are with retribution The faculty depression is absolutely with retribution because of being good bad and impure because it arises from defilement When bad or goodimpure the faculty mind is with retribution pure or neutral it is without retribution The same applies to three feelings  When good or bad the faculty frustration is with retribution when neutral it is without retribution When impure such five faculties as faith are with retribution when pure they are without retribution The other eight faculties such as life are without retribution because of their neutral nature The three pure ones are without retribution  Question How many are retribution and how many are no retribution Among twelve there are retributions as has been said in the chapter Elements  The faculty mind and four feelings either are retribution or no retribution When a good or a bad fruit they are this retribution The faculty life is only a retribution The faculty life absolutely is a retribution Some wish this one to be a fruit of meditative attainment Question How many faculties are acquired as retribution at the moment of primary arising Answer  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  Two or six seven and eight are acquired at the moment of primary arising it should be known that this is retribution in the realm of sexual passion The one of form is with six the one of formlessness with one Two or six seven and eight are acquired at the moment of primary arising it should be known that this is retribution in the realm of sexual passion These faculties arise gradually when being born from the womb being eggborn or being moistureborn At the ksana of this primary arising two faculties are acquired At this ksana the faculty mind is defiled and not undefiled because of experiencing arising successively to mind The same applies to the faculty equanimity The other faculties are also acquired but are not spoken of because they are no retribution  Being magically born without distinctive marks is with six five material faculties and the faculty life with one distinctive mark is with seven with two distinctive marks is with eight This is absolutely said to concern the realm of sexual passion The one of form is with six the one of formlessness with one In the realm of form six faculties are acquired because this one is absolutely with being magically born That there is no masculinity or femininity has been said already previously  The realm of formlessness is only with one Sutra  Question How many faculties are finally abandoned at the moment of death Answer One abandons four eight nine or further abandons ten There is a gradual end and a sudden going down When abandoning with good ones each increases with five One abandons four eight nine or further abandons ten There is a gradual end and a sudden going down With a gradual death with neutral awarenesses four faculties are abandoned the faculties body mind life and equanimity When the one without distinctive marks and with neutral awarenesses has a sudden death eight faculties are aban doned such five faculties as eye and the faculties mind life and equanimity With neutral awarenesses and with one distinctive mark there are nine with two distinctive marks there are ten With bad awarenesses it is also thus Question How many faculties are abandoned with good awarenesses  Answer When abandoning with good ones each increases with five With death with good awarenesses each increases with such five faculties as faith This is said to concern rearising in the realm of sexual passion when having gone down in the realm of sexual passion For being born in a higher realm when having gone down in the realm of sexual passion exception has to be made for being without distinctive marks and for being with two distinctive marks because both are not being part  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya of nonattachment With death in the realm of form and in the one of formlessness it is also spoken of in this way according to the faculties that were acquired There is no gradual death This is said to concern abandoning of faculties that are present no abandoning of accomplished ones With nonobscuredneutral ones abandoning of those that were acquired is spoken of with good ones abandoning of formations in exactly this birth is spoken of regarding this death when arising in other residences it then concerns abandoning those that were acquired Question How many are to be abandoned through vision how many are to be abandoned through spiritual practice and how many are with uninterruptedness Answer Four are to be abandoned through two or not to be abandoned Six faculties are twofold The three pure ones are with uninterruptedness either to be abandoned through vision or to be abandoned through spiritual practice or with uninterruptedness To be abandoned through the path of the faithfollower and through the one of the doctrinefollower they are said to be abandoned through vision to be abandoned through the path of the one given to faith and through the Sitra  one of the viewattainer they are said to be abandoned through spiritual practice pure they are said to be with uninterruptedness Six faculties are twofold The faculty depression is to be abandoned through vision and to be abandoned through spiritual practice Such five faculties as faith are to be abandoned through spiritual practice or are with uninterruptedness They are not to be abandoned through vision because of being undefiled The three pure ones are with uninterruptedness Because they are absolutely pure The other ones are to be abandoned through the spiritual path The other nine faculties are to be abandoned through the spiritual path Because of being nonobscuredneutral such eight faculties as life are not to be abandoned through vision because they fall in birth they are not not to be abandoned Because the faculty frustration is associated with the group of five forms of consciousness it is not to be abandoned through vision because of arising from defilement it is not with uninterruptedness Question How many faculties are accomplished when accomplishing faculties Answer  Sometimes there is accomplishment of three four five seven eight eleven or thirteen This is said to be the certain accomplishment  When the faculty mind is accomplished three faculties are definitely accomplished mind life and equanimity The rest either is accomplished or not accomplished  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The faculties eye ear nose and tongue are definitely accomplished when arising in the realm of form When arising in the realm of sexual passion they are accomplished when they are not lost having been acquired They are not accomplished when arising in the realm of formlessness when the womb gets thicker gradually and the faculties are not fulfilled yet when arising in the realm of sexual passion or when they are lost when having been acquired The faculty body is definitely accomplished when arising in the realm of sexual passion and in the one of form When arising in the realm of formlessness it is not accomplished The faculty satisfaction is definitely accomplished when arising with the entirely magnificent gods when arising lower and when noble persons higher When worldlings arise higher it is not accomplished The faculty contentedness is definitely accomplished b when arising with the shining gods The rest is as has been said with the faculty satisfaction The faculty frustration is definitely accomplished when arising in the realm of sexual passion The faculty depression is definitely accomplished when not yet with nonattachment it is not accomplished when with nonattachment When the roots of merit are not cut away such five faculties as faith are definitely accomplished when cut away then they are not accomplished The three pure faculties are definitely accomplished by the noble person according to the stage the stage of vision the stage of spiritual practice and the stage of having no more learning to do with worldlings they are not Sutra  accomplished To the faculty life and to the faculty equanimity the same applies as to the faculty mind When the faculty body is accomplished four faculties are definitely accomplished body mind life and equanimity When the faculty satisfaction is accomplished also four faculties are accomplished life mind satisfaction and equanimity When the faculty eye is accomplished five faculties are definitely accomplished the faculties body mind life equanimity and eye The same applies to the faculties ear nose and tongue When the faculty contentedness is accomplished also five faculties are accomplished contentedness satisfaction mind life and equanimity When the faculty frustration is accomplished seven faculties definitely are accomplished body mind life and four feelings exception made for the faculty depression When the male faculty is accomplished eight faculties are definitely accomplished the seven previous ones and one distinctive mark The same applies to the female faculty When the faculty depression is accomplished also eight faculties are accomplished body mind life and the five feelings When the faculty faith is accomplished also eight faculties are accomplished such five faculties as faith and mind life and equanimity The same applies to the faculties energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom When the faculty of understanding is accomplished eleven faculties are definitely accomplished mind life con Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya tentedness satisfaction equanimity such five faculties as faith and the faculty of understanding The same applies to the faculty of the one who has fully understood When the faculty I shall come to understand the not yet understood is accomplished thirteen faculties definitely are accomplished body mind life frustration satisfaction contentedness equanimity such five faculties as faith and the faculty I shall come to understand the not yet understood Question How many faculties are acquired with the fruits of sramanaship Answer  The First fruit is acquired with nine faculties Or they are experienced by two ramanas The fourth fruit is accomplished by means of eleven faculties The first fruit is acquired with nine faculties With nine faculties the fruit of srotaapannaship is acquired the faculty mind the faculty equanimity such five faculties as faith the faculty I shall come to understand the not yet understood and the faculty of understanding The faculty I shall come to understand the not yet understood is the proximate path the faculty of understanding is the path of liberation Or they are experienced by two sramanas When the one with double nonattachment acquires the fruit of sakrdagaminship he is with nine faculties as has been said previously When the one who is without attachSutra  ment to sensual pleasure acquires the fruit of andgdaminship he also is with nine faculties eight faculties are as has been said previously Three feelings are spoken of according to their function When the fruit of sakrdagaminship is successively acquired with the worldly path it is with seven mind equanimity and such five faculties as faith with a pure path it is with eight the previous seven and the faculty of understanding The same applies to the successive acquisition of the fruit of anagaminship The fourth fruit is accomplished by means of eleven faculties With eleven faculties the fruit of arhatship is acquired the faculty mind and three feelings such five faculties as faith the faculty of understanding and the one of the one who has fully understood The faculty of understanding is the proximate  path and the faculty of the one who has fully understood is the path of liberation Questicn Are they determined by the state or determined by the function When determined by the state also the fruit of anagaminship also be with three feelings when determined by the function there are not these three functions Moreover there are no two feelings that proceed simultaneously How much more for three Answer This is because of the group of being determined by the function and because of not being instantaneous When the fruit of arhatship was acquired by means of the faculty satisfaction it is to be acquired again from the faculty contentedness after one has fallen back in relation to this After one further has fallen back it is to be acquired again from the faculty equanimity When the fruit of and Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya gaminship is acquired by means of this feeling and one has fallen back from it it is to be acquired only from this feeling again Question In the sitras the Worldhonoured One has been speaking of the group of six forms of consciousness Of which objects are these forms of consciousness conscious  Answer  When that which is meaningful for the faculties is grasped it is the object of five kinds of awarenesses Grasping all factors is said to concern consciousness of the mind is grasped it is the object of five kinds of awarenesses Such five objects as matter are that which is grasped by five kinds of consciousness Consciousness of the eye grasps matter up to consciousness of the body grasps the tangible because of feeling specific characteristic marks and because of present objects Grasping all factors is said to concern consciousness of the mind Consciousness of the mind takes all factors as supporting object because of the general characteristic marks as object because of indecision because of repeated mindfulness This meaning is as has been said elaborately in the chapter Elements  The objects of consciousness have already been spoken of The object of knowledge shall now be spoken of Satra   The aggregates of the realm of sexual passion of the one of form and of the one of formlessness as well as the pure are the eight with basis and without basis and two unconditioned ones There are ten factors those associated with and those dissociated from the realm of sexual passion the same applies to the realm of form and to the one of formlessness those associated with and those dissociated from the pure among what is conditioned and two forms of unconditioned ones good and neutral Question These ten factors are what is known by knowledge With how many factors are the forms of knowledge one by one as object Answer Five factors should be known as the object of knowledge of the law Subsequent knowledge is with seven as supporting object The one of the awareness of another is with three as object Five factors should be known as the object of knowledge of the law Those associated with and those dissociated from the realm of sexual passion those associated with and those dissociated from the pure and the unconditioned good Subsequent knowledge is with seven as supporting object Those associated with and those dissociated from the realm of form of the one of formlessness and the pure and the unconditioned good The one of the awareness of another   is with three as  Samyuktabhidharmahydaya object Those associated with the realm of sexual passion with the one of form and with the pure because aware nesses and accompanying mental factors are its object  The impure one should be known as with ten Knowledge of the cause and the one of the fruit have six The one of liberation is with one The one of the path is with two The impure one should be known as with ten The conventional knowledge proceeds in all ten factors because of its wide object Knowledge of the cause and the one of the fruit have six Knowledge of frustration and the one of the origin know six factors those associated with and those dissociated from the three realms because of impure objects because of knowledge of the law and of subsequent knowledge Knowledge of cessation takes one factor as supporting object the unconditioned good because of having calculated cessation as object The one of the path is with two Knowledge of the path takes two factors as supporting object those associated with and those dissociated from the conditioned pure because of having still having learning to do and having no more learning to do as object The other two are with nine as object The knowledge of destruction and the knowledge of nonorigination take nine factors as supporting object exception made for the neutral unconditioned because of being with the four noble Sutra  truths as object Question What is developed by all contaminants Answer  Defilement of a specific stage is certain to develop within the specific stage The specific mode of pervasives is subsequently developed by another mode Defilement of a specific stage is certain to develop within the specific stage Defilement of the realm of sex ual passion exactly develops factors of the realm of sexual passion The same applies up to the summit of existence because of superiority and because of the antidote what is minor does not develop what is higher Because of the bodily conduct of nonattachment it is so that what is excessive does not develop what is lower The specific mode of pervasives is subsequently developed by another mode Factors of a specific mode are developed by contaminants of the specific mode Pervasives are also by another mode because of being with the five modes as object  When a factor definitely is of the three realms it is developed by contaminants of the threerealms It is to be known for birth in two realms One realm is further also thus When a factor definitely is of the three realms it is developed by contaminants of the three realms Factors of five modes included in the three realms are developed by all contaminants of the three realms In this way all  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya factors are spoken of according to what is proper Factors included in two realms are according to what is proper developed by defilement of the two realms Since initial thought and sustained thought are of the five modes of the realm of sexual passion and of the one of form they are that which is developed by all contaminants of the realm of sexual passion and of the one of form Since the faculty mind is of the five modes of the three realms it is developed by all contaminants of the three realms In this way all factors according to what is proper One realm is further also thus When a factor definitely is of one realm it is developed by contaminants of this one realm Since the faculty depression is of the five modes of the realm of sexual passion it is developed by all contaminants of the realm of sexual passion In this way all factors according to what is proper  The nature of these scriptural texts explained by the Muni is already differentiated It should be known that consciousness knowledge and contaminants are three categories  I have already completely differentiated these sutras explained by Buddha One should understand them by means of three categories the socalled category consciousness category knowledge and category contaminants Just as giving is of the realm of sexual passion is to be abandoned through the spiritual path and is with the nature of the five aggregates It is knowing seven knowledges exception made for subsequent knowledge for knowledge of cessation and for knowledge of the path Because of the Sutra  realm of sexual passion subsequent knowledge is excluded because of being impure knowledge of cessation and knowledge of the path are excluded It is conscious of three kinds of consciousness consciousness of the eye consciousness of the ear and consciousness of the mind because of being included in four sense It is developed by the pervasives of the realm of sexual passion and by the contaminants to be abandoned through the spiritual path Moral precept is knowing eight knowledges exception made for the knowledge of the awareness of another and the knowledge of cessation It is conscious of three forms of consciousness consciousness of the eye consciousness of the ear and consciousness of the mind It is developed by the pervasives of the realm of sexual passion and of the one of form and by the contaminants to be abandoned through the spiritual path Spiritual practice is with the nature of heedfulness t is knowing nine knowledges exception made for knowledge of cessation It is conscious of consciousness of the mind It is developed by pervasives of the three realms and by the contaminants to be abandoned through the spiritual path All sutras speak of it in this way according to what is proper When its meaning is spoken of in general wanting to know what is included is to be observed as the establishment of elements wanting to know the category of knowledges is to be observed as the establishment of the truths wanting to know the category of consciousness is to be observed as the establishment of sense wanting to know the category of contaminants is to be observed as the establishment of modes   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Spoken of in this way it is easy to know Heart of Scholasticism with Miscellaneous Additions vol ume eight Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Heart of Scholasticism with Miscellaneous Additions Volume Nine Chapter Nine Miscellany Composed by the venerable Dharmatrata Translated by ie Indian Tripitaka Samghavarman of the Sung and others The factors have already been differentiated they are one by one definitely successive That factors are successive when proceeding and are of manifold classes has already been said The multiple miscellaneous meanings of the above what has been said to be certainly successive has already been spoken of in one section exactly this meaning and the multiple miscellaneous meanings of the above shall be spoken of in this chapter shall now be spoken of concisely With supporting object and also associated with aspect and also with basis c awarenesses and accompanying mental factors are said to be with one and the same meaning differentiated for awarenesses and for accompanying mental factors B Because of having this supporting object they are said to be with supporting object Because of proceeding regarding an object  and because the actual entities time basis aspect and supporting object  proceed together they are said to be associated That being with aspect is wisdom has already been said in the chapter Knowledge Because aspects are made regarding the supporting object they are said to be with aspect Because of proceeding depending on something else being with basis is spoken of Arising from conditions and also cause with cause and also conditioned ground for discussion and period of time as well as being with fruit should be known These are the names differentiated for conditioned factors Because all arise from a combination of conditions arising from conditions is spoken of Because they make other factors arise cause is spoken of Because of depending on the power cause being with cause is spoken of Because of being made from causes and conditions being conditioned is spoken of Because they make discussion arise they are called ground for discussion  Because of being included in the periods of time of past future and present period of time is spoken of Because of this having a fruit being with fruit is spoMiscellany  ken of With blameworthiness and also obscured defiled inferior and black Good conditioned ones are said to be studied and are further also said to be called to be practised With blameworthiness and also obscured defiled inferior and black These are the names differentiated for bad ones and for obscuredneutral ones Because of being together with blameworthiness they are said to be with blameworthiness This is the meaning of what is to be despised Because of being covered by defilement and by secondary affliction they are said to be obscured This is the meaning of being covered with impure influence Because they are polluted by impurity of defilement they are said to be defiled Because of being extremely inferior they are said to be inferior Black is twofold defiled black and black disagreeable to the mind These are said to be defiled black they are not said to be black disagreeable to the mind because black disagreeable to the mind also has the black of a bad retribution Good conditioned ones are said to be studied and are further are said to be called to be practised These are the names differentiated for good conditioned factors Because of being that in which good factors are included and the desired fruit they are said to be good  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Because of the increase of qualities they are said to be studied and to be practised This is said to be spiritual practice which is obtaining and spiritual practice which is development What is approaching is with the meaning of to be studied the meaning of seed is the meaning of to be practised present is called to be studied and future is called to be practised That is why they are said to be good conditioned Since the spiritual practice which is antidote and the spiritual practice which is expulsion are with all impure factors they are also said to be practised Question What are the formations dissociated from awarenesses Answer  The absence of conceptual identification two meditative attainments also the likeness of beings the groups of sentences vyafijanas and names the faculty life and the acquisition of factors When rearising with the ones who do not conceptually identify awarenesses and accompanying mental factors are extinguished Some say that this is the fruit of meditative attainment without conceptual identification Some say that this is explained to be the fruit of the adjacent one of the fourth trance Some say that up to being with intention is the fruit of being with intention and that being without intention is the fruit of being without intention Miscellany  Question Are the former awarenesses manifold or are the later awarenesses manifold Answer Some say that the later awarenesses are more than the former awarenesses With minuteness of desire one quickly enters the absence of conceptual identification Spoken of in this way it is unfixed either the former are manifold or the later are manifold When entering meditative attainment without conceptual identification with this deportment this exactly is entering abiding in the absence of conceptual identification with this deportment When denying nirvana as definitive release after this has been produced there is when it concerns action to be felt later arising in the realm of sexual passion because when the retribution of this action has ended no other action is to be produced Two meditative attainments Meditative attainment  without conceptual identification and meditative attainment of cessation Meditative attainment without conceptual identification is when being with the destruction of craving with the entirely magnificent ones not having destroyed the craving of higher ones yet When first inaking the conceptual identification of escape there is reflection on the cessation of awarenesses and of accompanying mental factors It is only produced from the realm of sexual passion because these faculties are keen Worldlings do produce it no noble persons because there are no noble persons who make the conceptual identification of escape regarding existence It is to be acquired by effort not by nonattachment s  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question What is the difference between meditative attainment without conceptual identification and absence of conceptual identification Answer Meditative attainment without conceptual identification is the cause the absence of conceptual identification is the fruit this is good that is neutral this is with retribution that is the retribution this is with aspect that is without aspect Meditative attainment of cessation is the reflection on the cessation of awarenesses and of accompanying mental factors after first having appeased conceptual identifications when being without the desire of the sphere of nothingness Question How is this meditative attainment Answer When awarenesses and accompanying mental factors are extinguished formations dissociated from awarea ness among them which are successive subsequently keep streaming abiding in the four elements and in the faculties This is said to be meditative attainment of cessation The rest is as has been said in the chapter Concentration Companionship is that the body the faculties the limbs the activity and the beverage and nutriment of beings the socalled companionship of realm companionship of course companionship of birth companionship of place companionship of the own person and companionship of nature The companionship of realm is that beings of the realm of sexual passion are of the species of beings of the realm of sexual passion the same applies to the realm of form and to  Miscellany  the one of formlessness The companionship of course is that being born in one course is of the species of this one course The companionship of birth is that experiencing one kind of birth is of the species of this one kind of birth The companionship of place is that arising in Avicihell is of the species of Avicihell the same applies up to the summit of existence The companionship of the own person is that when equally arising in one realm in one course and in one kind of birth one kind of birth is one of the four kinds of birth there are manifold specific bodies just as the multitude of birds It is to be compared in this way The companionship of nature is that when the natural nature is equal the nature is of this species When the sixfold companionship is similar this is called companionship Sentences vyafjanas is the eventual manifestation ing Vyanjana is syllable In Sanskrit there is the sound of vyafjana among the sounds It is a standard for writing It is no written of a present configuration Names Name factors By means of names meanings are manifested just as something is called masculine or feminine  Life Duration of life to achieve that the aggregates the elements and the sense What is the difference between the formations of life and the formations of the duration of life  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Answer Some say that there is no difference Some say that the fruit of former action is called the duration of life and that the development of a fruit is called life Question Why did the Worldhonoured One abandon one fifth of his duration of life Answer Because of accomplishing the duty of Buddha well because the other duties are to be accomplished by the Sravakas Furthermore because of abiding in the four traditional practices of a monk Because when existence and every provision have ended there is nothing left Acquisition Acquisition of factors That acquisition and accomplishment are with one and the same meaning shall be spoken of elaborately later  Ordinariness and the four characteristic marks of factors are immaterial and dissociated They are said to be conditioned formations Not acquiring the religious merit of the noble The four characteristic marks These factors are not with the nature of matter because the four elements and derivative form are not being part of them saesocated Because of being without supporting object Miscellany  They are said to be conditioned formations Because of being formed by something else and because of forming something else Question How many of these formations are good how many are bad and how many are neutral Answer  Two are good Five kinds are threefold It should be known that seven are neutral Two abide in the one of form One abides in the stages of the immaterial ones Two are good Meditative attainment without conceptual identification and meditative attainment of cessation are good because of spiritual practice as nature Five kinds are threefold Acquisition birth duration decay and impermanence are good in relation to that which is good bad in relation to that which is bad and neutral in relation to that which is neutral because such as birth are one fruit with the factors because acquisition is not not homogeneous It should be known that seven are neutral Absence of conceptual identification companionship sentences vyarijanas names the faculty life and ordinariness Question How many of these factors are bound to the realm of sexual passion how many are bound to the realm of form and how many are bound to the realm of formlessness Answer Two abide in the one of form The gods who do not conceptually identify and meditative attainment without conceptual identification are bound to the realm of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya form because the gods who do not conceptually identify are the fourth trance as fruit because meditative attainment without conceptual identification is included in the fourth trance One abides in the stages of the immaterial ones Meditative attainment of cessation is bound to the realm of formlessness because it is included in the summit of existence   Two realms are said to have three The rest abide in the three realms Five are both impure and pure The rest are all impure Two realms are said to have three The groups of sentences vyafijanas and names abide in the realm of sexual passion and in the one of form not in the realm of formlessness because speech is not being part of it The rest abide in the three realms Companionship acquisition the faculty life ordinariness and the characteristic marks that are to be acquired abide in the three realms because of being general Question How many are impure and how many are pure Answer Five are both impure and pure When the four characteristic marks of the conditioned abide in pure factors they are pure in impure factors they are impure because of being one fruit with factors Acquisition Acquisition of that which is conditioned is also in this way Acquisition of calculated cessation either is impure or pure because of being common with worldlings Acquisition of uncalculated cessation is Miscellany  impure because of being neutral Exactly because of this meaning being bound and not being bound are spoken of The rest are all impure The gods who do not conceptually identify meditative attainment without conceptual identification meditative attainment of cessation likeness of beings the faculty life sentences vyafjanas names and ordinariness are absolutely impure because of being included in existence Question What is without the religious merit of the noble is called ordinariness How is it abandoned and how is it annihilated Answer  It should be known that in the primary pure awareness there is abandoning and no acquisition Worldlings stream through the realms The moment of nonattachment is with disappearance It should be known that in the primary pure awareness there is abandoning and no acquisition Noble persons abandon ordinariness at the moment the primary pure awareness arises The primary pure awareness is associated with patience regarding the law in relation to frustration At the moment this arises ordinariness is abandoned When stating that it is abandoned after this has been produced then this moment of abiding in patience regarding the law in relation to frustration were not with a noble person because of not abandoned ordinariness  That is why the moment of arising is spoken of That is why Buddha said that at the moment  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya two factors arise its duty is accomplished the inward thing is the dependence of patience regarding the law in relation to frustration the outward thing is all dignity Worldlings stream through the realms When at the mo ment worldlings stream through the realms there is nh in this stage it exactly is abandoned in this stage When arising in another stage it exactly is acquired in the other stage because of being nonobscuredneutral This is no accomplishment of abandoning because of not acquiring the religious merit of the noble The moment of nonattachment is with disappearance When without the desire of this stage and either being a worldling or a noble person at this very moment the ordinariness of this stage is abandoned because of being nonobscuredneutral Question Which characteristic marks do the three unconditioned ones have Answer  When abandoning defilement one is free from fetters this is called calculated cessation Being without the characteristic marks of obstruction is said to be space this is called calculated cessation By means of wisdom one abandons the acquisition of such defilements as belief in a self and its dependence When there is the acquisition of being free from fetters regarding these this being free from fetters is called calculated cessation Medicine and the kinds of disease match one another as Miscellany  to number Some say that because there is only one cessation and the actual entities are without something that is homogeneous there have to be a multitude of acquisitions When the acquisition of cessation is acquired in relation to this that which is realised exactly is this nirvana That is why nirvana is unique Regarding this actual entity fetter the Vibhasa speaks about being free from exactly this actual entity fetter If it were different when abandoning the kind of fettersS to be abandoned through the vision of frustration also other defilement would have to be abandoned because one thing would be realised If it were so later antidotes would be without function but because is not accomplished yet the things therefore each are different Because there is no homogeneous cause not having something that is homogeneous is spoken of Although patience regarding the law in relation to frustration and its dependence are without homogeneous cause it is the homogeneous cause in relation to something else Because a certain class is not being part of something it is said to be a wrong class Because defilement is extinguished nirvana is spoken of Because of speaking about what is infinite it is stated to be a wrong explanation Because of being superior to all factors it is said to be most superior Because of the fruit of knowledge it is said to be knowledge Because of steadfastness it is said to be nonorigination Because of abiding at the limit of the path of liberation it is said to be the limit Being without the characteristic marks of obstruction is said to be space That which is not obstructed because manifold matter is with such as coming and going space is spoken of The Darstantikas say that space neither is material nor immaterial The statement space is spoken of because of being conformable to the world Some say that there is no absence of space because of including existence If there were no space there would also be no including of existence Because of including existence therefore there is the actual entity space Factors that depend on conditions are with basis and object When these are not supplied they do not arise This cessation is no understanding All conditioned factors arise because of depending on the powers condition and object because of being weak When these are not being part of them they do not arise just as consciousness of the eye arises because of de pending on the combination of the eye matter radiance space and mindfulness When these are not one by one supplied it does not arise At the moment other forms of consciousness are present in the period of time of instant after instant and the one eye is closed it could arise in the other eye but because the multitude of conditions are not supplied consciousness of the eye does not achieve to arise When consciousness of the eye has to depend on these eyes to arise then it does not arise because after such as the basis have been extinguished it eventually does not arise Since there is cessaMiscellany  tion even though there primarily was no effort this is said to be uncalculated cessation To the group of all forms of consciousness the same applies as to consciousness of the eye When moreover what is pure achieves to progress in the path of the faithfollower the path of the doctrinefollower is uncalculated cessation The same applies to all paths all have to be known according to their meanings Question When so then why is the acquisition of a superior path not included in the fruit of the path Answer It is because of other things because of abandoning defilement and because vigorous effort is no uncalculated cessation That is why it is not included in the fruit of the path Question All conditioned factors are said to be a cause Who is cause for whom Answer A previous one develops a similar one and increase Some are produced together with their basis It is said that only two causes and one condition are absolutely already arisen A previous one develops a similar one and increase A previous factor is the cause for a later similar factor and the cause for increase it is no cause for what is minor At the moment of developing a factor there either is maintenance or increase there is no decrease Some are produced together with their basis The associated cause and the simultaneous cause  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Tt is said that only two causes and one condition are ab solutely already arisen The homogeneous cause is said to be already arisen it is not not arisen yet A previous one is the cause for a later one and with what has not arisen yet there is no former or later That is why the pervasive cause is also in this way The condition as direct antecedent is also said to be already arisen The meaning of the condition as cause has already been spoken of in the chapter Formations  Question Should it be stated that the retribution is relating to beings or is not relating to beings Answer The retribution is relating to beings It is conditioned It is the fruit of disjunction The retribution is relating to beings The retribution is said to be relating to beings because it is unique It is not to be seen with the eyes of someone else nor is it to be accomplished The same applies to the meaning of other retribution It should be known that such provisions as dress and nutriment are the fruit of human effort and the dominant fruit They are not relating to beings because of being general Question How is the fruit Answer Miscellany   It is conditioned It is the fruit of disjunction All conditioned factors are said to be a fruit They arise having a cause That is why they reach calculated cessation It is also said to be the fruit of the path The meaning of fruit has already been spoken of in the chapter Actions Questions How do awarenesses and accompanying mental factors proceed in supporting objects Answer Question In which supporting object do they proceed Answer They are proceeding in what is with other characteristic marks Awarenesses and accompanying mental factors take other factors as supporting object not the specific nature Why Because there is no proceeding in oneself since there are no two certainties They also do not take what is associated as supporting object because of being with one aspect and one supporting object This meaning shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Investigations Question Are awarenesses and accompanying mental factors with place or without place Answer  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  The complete cause is without place At the moment of arising the mind is disjunctioned Defilement abides in awarenesses of the path The complete cause is without place Awarenesses and accompanying mental factors arise through their complete cause caused by two eyes one form of consciousness arises The same applies to consciousness of the ear and to the one of the nose If it had a place to abide it should have to proceed in one eye If it were so one eye should see matter and there would be no seeing with both This meaning has already been spoken of in the chapter Elements When stating that two forms of consciousness arise together this is not right Because the second condition as direct antecedent is not being part of it It is not right that one form of consciousness sees matter when abiding in two eyes because of being incorporeal When one form of consciousness would abide in two eyes what is compesed of parts should arise When abiding in the left eye it is not in the right eye because of difference in places This is no explanation Because what is immaterial is incorporeal When further one form of consciousness would abide in c two eyes it also would have to arise from the faculty body between these two eyes If it were so consciousness of the eye exactly would be consciousness of the bodyt When it does not arise in between it should be broken and two parts and not one part should be made because it has been said already previously that there are no two forms of consciousness that arise together Miscellany   is the mind dis Question Answer At the moment of arising the mind is disjunctioned The moment the path arises is the moment of abandoning defilement that is why the mind is disjunctioned at the moment the path arises to this the same applies as to a breach in a dike the nearest water comes out first Moreover it is said that all future disjunction of the mind is not only at the moment of arising but because of primary disjunction it is said to be at the moment of arising Question Is there abandoning of defilement at the moment the path arises or not Answer Defilement abides in awarenesses of the path Up to the moment of cessation it is abandoned At the moment the path is abandoned defilement is abandoned because the duty is accomplished The moment of arising is future How can the duty of a future path be accomplished That is why it is said that it is at the moment of abandoning the proximate path that defilement is abandoned Question Of how many modes is craving for exis  Craving for existence has five modes The one for nonexistence is only with one characteristic mark Disappearance of craving actual entities and other defilement is three elements Craving for existence is attachment regarding existence It has five  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya modes what is to be abandoned through the vision of frustration through the one of the origin through the one of cessation through the one of the path and through the spiritual path because of the five modes of proceeding of attachment to existence The one for nonexistence is only with one characteristic mark Craving for nonexistence is the attachment of satisfaction arisen regarding the annihilation of the specific retribution after the vision of annihilation It is to be abandoned through the spiritual path An attachment to view is to be abandoned through the path of vision This attachment is produced following the impermanence of retribution The retribution is to be abandoned through the spiritual path because of being nonobscuredneutral The same applies to the impermanence of the retribution Because it is one and the same fruit with the retribution it is not to be abandoned through the path of vision because it is no pervasive This craving for nonexistence is not abandoned and not practised by the srotadpanna and by the sakrdagamin because it is supported by the view of annihilation just as regret being supported by perplexity  also is not practised by the srotadpanna and by the sakrdagamin Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of three elements the element abandoning the element fading away and the element cessation How are these Answer Disappearance of craving actual entities and other defilement is three elements This destruction of craving is the element fading away the destruction of actual entities is the element cessation the destruction of Miscellany  other defilement is the element abandoning of the Worldhonoured One say The destruction of all formations is called the element abandoning Question The twelve factors are good ones bad ones obscuredneutral ones and nonobscuredneutral ones in the realm of sexual passion in the realm of form there are three exception made for bad ones the same applies to the three of the realm of formlessness and still having learning to do and having no more learning to do How many of these twelve factors are to be acquired with a defiled awareness how many are to be acquired with a good awareness and how many are to be acquired with a neutral awareness Answer It should be known that when nine kinds of factors are acquired it concerns a defiled awareness A good awareness acquires six kinds A neutral one exactly is with neutral ones It should be known that when nine kinds of factors are acquired it concerns a defiled awareness At the moment of returning from a realm or a stage there is the acquisition of the seven awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion and of the one of form at the moment of arising in the realm of form when having gone down in the higher realm one acquires neutral awarenesses and magic ones of the realm of sexual passion and the three awarenesses of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the realm of form the good ones of the realm of sexual passion are acquired at the moment of increase of the roots of merit and at the moment of falling back the defiled ones of the three realms and the awareness of the seeker  The rest are not acquired good ones and nonobscuredneutral ones of the realm of formlessness and the one of the adept Although good ones of the realm of formlessness are scarce there is acquisition of falling back what is connected to falling back but here all that were not accomplished and are acquired are spoken of This is a generalised saying It is not one person who in relation to one awareness acquires nine factors With a good awareness there is the acquisition of six awarenesses nonobscuredneutral ones of the realm of sexual passion good ones and nonobscuredneutral ones of the realm of form good ones of the realm of formlessness the one of the seeker and the one of the adept Also this is a generalised saying It is no simultaneous acquisition A neutral one exactly is with neutral ones because of being weak Question How many of the ten factors belonging to the class of enlightenment are with the nature of faculties and how many are not with the nature of faculties Answer In what belongs to the class of enlightenment there are six factors that should be known as with the nature of a faculty Miscellany  When factors are associated they are said to be with another nature In what is belonging to the class of enlightenment there are six factors that should be known as with the nature of a faculty It should be known that such five faculties as faith and the member of enlightenment joy The rest is not with the nature of a faculty Question Are the associated ones with this specific nature or with the nature of something else Answer When factors are associated they are said to be with another nature Factors are associated with another nature not with the specific nature because there is not one nature that is both produced at two ksanas because of not being combined before and after because the specific nature does not make itself This meaning has already been spoken of elaborately in the chapter Formations  Question What is one disjunctioned from Answer  One acquires to be disjunctioned from the supporting object is what has been said by the Great Wise Recluse There also is still being bound having abandoned In the path of vision and in the spiritual path It should be known that there is acquisition of being disjunctioned vegarding a supporting object Being free from what is associated with it is impossible because of belonging to one ksana because awarenesses arise together with defilement Beings are ignorant regarding a supporting object Exactly when no ignorance arises in relation to this  one is disjunctioned from defilement Question Is abandonment exactly being disjunctioned Answer Being disjunctioned exactly is abandonment There also is still being bound having abandoned There is no being disjunctioned when a little abandoned when knowledge of frustration arises but knowledge of the origin has not arisen yet defilement to be abandoned through the vision of frustration is abandoned but one is bound to the pervasive contaminants to be abandoned through the vision of the origin because these supporting objects have not been abandoned yet When abandoning one class of the spiritual path one is still bound to the other eight classes up to when eight classes are abandoned one is still bound to the ninth class because of one contaminant When these eight classes were abandoned first there is being disjunctioned later when exactly the ninth class is abandoned this exactly is being disjunctioned The same applies to all other ones Question How can vision of the truth achieve perfect faith Answer Miscellany   One achieves perfect faith in two when understanding three truths in four when depending on vision of the right path In two periods of time there is spiritual practice One achieves perfect faith in two when understanding three truths in four when depending on vision of the right path When frustration the origin and cessation are realised in a higher way perfect faith in the doctrine and noble moral precept are acquired Higher realisation of the path is with acquisition of four forms of perfect faith This meaning shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Investigations  Questions In which periods of time is there spiritual practice Answer In two periods of time there is spiritual practice Present is the spiritual practice which is development because of being present future is the spiritual practice which is obtaining because of not being present because of the successive acquisition The past is without spiritual practice because the present as cause is not being part of it Question Which factors follow awarenesses and proceed together Answer  All accompanying mental factors are said to proceed together with awarenesses Also the characteristic marks of these awarenesses the characteristic marks of the others and what is made  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya All accompanying mental factors are said to proceed together with awarenesses All accompanying mental factors proceed together with awarenesses because they have one and the same fruit as the awarenesses Also the characteristic marks of these awarenesses Such characteristic marks as birth of these awarenesses also proceed together with awarenesses because they also have one and the same fruit as the awarenesses The characteristic marks of the others The characteristic marks of these accompanying mental factors also proceed together with awarenesses Made is called moral precept that is unmanifesting because of depending on awarenesses It also proceeds together with awarenesses because it also has one and the same fruit as the awarenesses Question Which factors are to be abandoned Answer  The factors that are to be abandoned are impure ones To be known is also what is with absence of impurity Extinguished ones and future ones are said to be remote The factors that are to be abandoned are impure ones Because of having evil to this the same applies as to dress that has impurity has to be washed This does not go for what is with absence of impurity Question How are the factors that are to be known Answer To be known is also what is with absence of impurity Either impure factors or pure ones all are said to Miscellany  be that which is to be known according to the thing In order to exclude noncognisance Question Which factors are remote Answer Extinguished ones and future ones are said to be remote Past and future factors are said to be remote because they are remote from present consciousness This is said to be the remoteness in time The meaning of the four kinds of remoteness has already been spoken of in the chapter Formations The rest are said to be near Present ones are said to be near because they are together with the group of the forms of consciousness Unconditioned ones are said to be near because they are not bound to a place as they are c acquired according to each direction because cessation is depending on the path because uncalculated cessation is free from that which is sought for The meaning of period of time has already been spoken of elaborately in the chapter Elements Question How are the fixed factors Answer  The Wise One has said that the socalled proximate actions and the pure paths are called fixed The abodes of view are the impure ones The Wise One has said that the socalled proximate actions and the pure paths are called fixed The proximate actions are said to be falsely fixed because they are sure to be with the hell as course Pure formations are said to be rightly fixed because of surely being with the fruit of disjunction as course The rest are unfixed  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question Under the bodhithree the Worldhonoured One has established three groups regarding all beings Are these established because of beings as limitation or because of the doctrine as limitation When because of the beings as limitation how then is it to be spoken of The limit of beings cannot be acquired as beings are infinite When because of the doctrine as limitation also the Sravaka should establish the doctrine How then is the Tathagata said to be unique Answer Some say that it is because of beings as limitation As it is to general characteristic marks it is not to specific characteristic marks the four kinds of birth are spoken of Question If it is so then also the sravaka should establish  What then is the difference between the Tathagata and the Sravaka Answer There is a difference the Tathagata establishes from His specific power the sravaka from c what he has learned from Buddha This is the difference Moreover it is said that the Tathagata establishes the doctrine because of beings as limitation and that the Sravaka and the pratyekabuddha establish because of the doctrine as limitation After the Worldhonoured One had established the three groups of beings He still brought satisfaction for beings new Because of great compassion understood beings at three moments of day and night with the Buddhaeye Question What are the abodes of view Answer The abodes of view are the impure ones All imMiscellany  pure factors are the abodes of view they are together with defiled views With a defiled view of a factor they are developed by the supporting object and developed by association This is said to be an abode of view Moreover it is said that the impure factors achieve to be called an abode of view because of the power of being taken as supporting object by a view of the specific realm They are not developed by the supporting object in another one because of not being part of them In this way what is right is what has been said first Question When beings accomplish faculties how many faculties do they accomplish Answer  It is said that having nineteen faculties is the accomplishment of the highest number It has been said by The One Who Knows the Faculties that there at least is the accomplishment of eight It is said that having nineteen faculties is the accomplishment of the highest number Noble persons accomplish nineteen faculties at the most when not yet with nonattachment they are supplied with all faculties When abiding in the path of vision the faculty of under Standing the one of one who has fully understood and being with one distinctive mark are excluded When abiding in the spiritual path the faculty I shall come to understand the not yet understood the one of the one who has fully understood and being with one distinctive mark are excluded With the worldling of whom the roots of merit have not been cut away and who is supplied with the faculties and  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya with two distinctive marks excluded Tt has been said by The One Who Knows the Faculties that there at least is the accomplishment of eight At least there is the accomplishment of eight faculties when the rest when the faculty body dies gradually there is a part as rest of the roots of merit of the faculty body are cut away there is arising in Avicihell with a gradual death suppressed by a big mountain there only are the faculty body the faculty life the faculty mind and the five faculties of feeling With the worldling who arises in the realm of formlessness it are mind life equanimity and such five faculties as faith  the three pure faculties are Question How many kinds of contact are there Answer The one of expression is the form of contact associated with the group of consciousness of the mind Because all factors are taken as supporting object the one of expression is spoken of Moreover it is said to be the one of expression because of taking many names as Miscellany  supporting object Although also the fifth kind of contact takes many names as supporting object this one acquires the name first that is why there is no mistake The kind of contact associated with the group of five forms of consciousness is said to be the one of what is resisting because of depending on resisting faculties What is pure is said to be the contact of understanding because of being associated with understanding What is defiled is said to be the contact of ignorance because of arising from ignorance What is undefiled impure is said to be the contact of neitherunderstandingnorignorance because of being associated with none of these These five kinds of contact are said to be of sixteen kinds because of the difference in what they are conformable to and what they are not conformable to associatedness and basis Established as to what they are conformable to and what they are not conformable to are the kinds of con tact associated with craving and with hatred because of the difference in associatedness the contact of frustration the one of satisfaction and the one of neitherfrustrationnorsatisfaction are spoken of because of the difference in basis the contact of the eye the one of the ear the one of the nose the one of the tongue the one of the body and the one of the mind are spoken of Question Is the acquisition of a fruit by means of the proximate path or by means of the path of liberation Answer The socalled acquisition of a fruit is the duty of a double path There is acquisition of a fruit with both of a double path the proximate path and the path of liberation The proximate path abandons the acquisition of defilement the path of liberation acquires the realisation of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya liberation Moreover it is said that the proximate path acquires the fruit and that the path of liberation protects  because of not letting loose what is done it is spoken of in this way Question The Worldhonoured One said that after aversion there is nonattachment What are aversion and nonattachment Answer Knowledge and patience abiding in frustration and in cause are said to be aversion Four are said to be nonattachment because they can make free from attachment because of taking despicable things as supporting object Since the truth of frustration and the one of the origin are that on which misconduct and defilement depend they are said to be the thing of aversion Four are said to be nonattachment because they can make free from attachment When patience and knowledge proceed in the four noble truths they are all said to be nonattachment because of breaking attachment Although they are free from every defilement attachment is the footing of every defilement and that is why they are said to benonattachment Hatred unhappiness impeding and corrupting ferentiations within aversion Nonattachment cessation disjunction and destruc  are difMiscellany  tion are differentiations within nonattachment Question In which awarenesses does the arhat abide for parinirvana Answer  The arhat abides in the ones arisen by retribution and in awarenesses relating to deportment  Because of being subsequent to the awarenesses that are extinguished there is approaching parinirvana The arhat abides in the ones arisen by retribution and in awarenesses relating to deportment for parinirvana Because of being subsequent to the awarenesses that are extinguished Good awarenesses abide solidly and are not conformable to awarenesses that are extinguished Neutral awarenesses are weak Because of being weak they are conformable to awarenesses that are extinguished Furthermore because of the limited fault because good awarenesses make pass through birth because of the categories of the natural fruit and of the fruit of retribution The neutral ones only have the category of the natural fruit and not the category of the fruit of retribution Furthermore because of turning ones back to the courses when approaching a course it definitely have to be good awarenesses that are present through energy There is no letting me arise in woeful courses That iswhy he abides in awarenesses with the nature of permanence because he turns his back to all courses Sometimes good awarenesses in this bodily part are emp Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya ty just as when cutting away the roots of merit Bad awarenesses are also empty Furthermore because there is a gradual disjunction from transmigration Being with nonattachment in the realm of sexual passion is being free from bad awarenesses being with nonattachment in the summit of existence is being free from defiled awarenesses Neutral aware nesses that are present is being free from good awarenesses awarenesses of death that are present is being free from neutral awarenesses The venerable said this Dharmatrata sees the former Dharmatrata as venerable Good awarenesses are energetic and successive there is nothing that proceeds subsequently to the moment of death Some say that there is the wish to let the lower stages have the neitherpleasantnorunpleasant retribution This is said to concern the awarenesses arisen by retribution and the ones relating to deportment of the realm of sexual passion up to of the fourth trance for parinirvana The realm of formlessness only is with the ones arisen by retribution and not with the ones relating to deportment because matter is not being part of it There is the wish to let the lower stages be without the neitherpleasantnorunpleasant retribution This is speaking of the realm of sexual passion up to the third trance that are only with abiding in awarenesses relating to deportment for parinirvana The rest is as has been said above Question How many forms of existence are there Answer Miscellany   The existence at rearising and the existence at death the existence at former time and further also the intermediate one It should be known that two are instantaneous One is defiled of three there are two The existence at rearising and the existence at death the existence at former time and further also the intermediate one The existence at rearising is the five aggregates of the state of birth because of being together with birth it is called existence at rearising It is with the meaning of arising together with successive awarenesses The existence at death is the five aggregates of dying because of being together with dying it is called existence at death It is with the meaning of being produced together with awarenesses that have gone down The existence at former time is exception made for the five aggregates of the state of birth and of the state of dying the existence in between Because of abiding for a long time sown by former action it therefore is called existence at former time The intermediate existence is the existence from after dying up to not having acquired another existence at rearising yet approaching the experiencing of the existence at rearising in between It is not included in the courses with the five aggregates Because of being produced in between the two it is called intermediate existence Question How many of these forms of existence are instantaneous and how many abide for a long time Answer Tt should be known that two are instantaneous  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The existence at death and existence at rearising each are with a duration of a ksana because they do not abide for a long time Because of this meaning it should be known that the existence at former time and the intermediate existence are abiding for a long time Question How many are defiled and how many are undefiled Answer One is defiled of three there are two The existence at rearising is absolutely defiled because of defiled awarenesses birth is successive and is not undefiled These worldlings of the realm of sexual passion are with thirtysix contaminants one by one these contaminants let birth be successive The same applies to noble persons who one by one are with the four contaminants to be abandoned through the spiritual path Worldlings of the realm of form are with thirtyone contaminants one by one these contaminants let birth be successive Noble persons are with three contaminants The same applies to the realm of formlessness It are contaminants that let birth be successive no secondary afflictions The other forms of existence are both defiled and undefiled Question At how many moments is the devotee extremely hindered by action Answer When being free from the desire of the realm of sexual passion when surpassing the summit of existence Miscellany  and when producing the factor patience he is extremely hindered by action At these three moments action in an extreme way constitutes obstruction for the devotee At the moment noble persons are free from the desire of the realm of sexual passion this action of the realm of sexual passion is an obstruction in an extreme way Its meaning is stating When with nonattachment in which resi dence would I experience retribution Because noble persons are free from the desire of the realm of sexual passion they do not experience birth in the realm of sexual passion and achieve eternal peace Because of not falling back as fruit with death At the moment of grasping the fruit of arhatship action to be felt later in an extreme way constitutes obstruction Its meaning is stating In which residence would I experience retribution At the moment of producing patience when abiding in the factor summit action in an extreme way constitutes obstruction in relation to experiencing woeful courses as retribution because of producing the factor patience is eternally free from woeful courses The rest is as has been said previously  Question How many kinds of actual entities are there Answer It should be known that there are five kinds the actual entities specific nature and cause fetter possession and all supporting objects  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The five kinds of actual entities are the socalled actual entity specific nature the actual entity cause the actual entity fetter the actual entity possession and the actual entity supporting object The actual entity specific nature is when the own nature of a factor is spoken of by means of the name actual entity As has been said When an actual entity is acquired it is the accomplishment of this actual entity The actual entity cause is as has been said How is there the factor actual entity The answer is There is a cause The actual entity fetter is as has been said When bound to this actual entity by means of the fetter attraction is this exactly being bound to this actual entity by means of repugnance These five kinds of factors are spoken of by means of the name actual entity The five kinds of factors are five formations The actual entity possession experiencing as in taking possession of is as has been said The actual entity field and the actual entity house it is to be compared in this way The actual entity supporting object is as has been said a All factors are known by knowledge according to the actual entity When a factor takes another factor as supporting object it is spoken of by means of the name actual entity  There further are five other kinds of actual entities  Speaking of aggregates exactly as actual entities The same is true for the actual entities element and sense  And period of time and ksana Miscellany  These are said to be five kinds of actual entities When speaking of aggregates exactly taking these aggregates as actual entities no other kind In this way up to when speaking of a ksana exactly taking a ksana as an actual entity no other kind In this way it is spoken of concisely The different names for the same reality all have to be known Question How are the five kinds of fruit as they have been spoken of in the chapter Actions Are there only these fruits or are there further still other  Answer There is the wish to have four more fruits  The yuktavadins speak about the one of support and the one of preparation and also speak about the combined one and the one of spiritual practice These are spoken of as the four fruits The fruit of support is as water abiding in a windcircle the watercircle is the fruit of support of the windcircle All are in this way The fruit of preparation is from the contemplation of the repulsive as preparation up to the production of the knowledge of destruction and of the knowledge of nonoriginatior This knowledge of destruction and knowledge of nonorigination are the fruit of preparation of the contemplation of the repulsive In this way all preparation this is approaching as preparation because a cause seeks for a fruit should be known The combined fruit is that when an eye matter radiance and mindfulness are combined consciousness of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  a the eye arises When such factors are combined a factor arises This factor is the combined fruit The fruit of spiritual practice is when being in the path of the realm of form changing the magic of the realm of sexual passion and making speech of the realm of sexual passion This magic and speech are the fruit of the spiritual path of the realm of form All are in this way Question Of how many kinds is the footing of supernatural power one says rddhi or one says footing of supernatural power or one says footing of supernatural power or one says selfdependence or one says accomplishment All emit the meaning but none of them acquires to be completely the original name Answer  The moving of the body and of resolve and thought as selfdependent higher faculty The one of thought is only of the Tathagata It should be known that two are general Three forms of selfdependence the selfdependence of the moving of the body the selfdependence of the one of resolve and the selfdependence of thought The selfdependence of the moving of the body when raising the body passing through space as a flying bird The selfdependence of the one of resolve with resolve one makes that which is remote near in the duration of time of stretching and folding the arms one reaches the end of matter The selfdependence of thought just as the duration of time consciousness of the eye to reach matter Miscellany  It is exactly reached when following the mind This selfdependence of thought is only of Buddha because that what the Omniscient knows reaches the other bank It should be known that two are general The selfdependence of the moving of the body and the selfdependence of the one of resolve are general for the Tathagata the pratyekabuddha and the Sravaka because they are the fruit of trance Question Do all andgamins enter the realm of form and the one of formlessness or not Do all those given to faith achieve to be the viewattainer or not Do all who fall back definitely have to fall back or not Answer  entering the realm of form and the one of formlessness or further also the growing of faculties with nobles falling back and when arising in the intermediate one one is sure to be without Noble persons who are with rearising when returning are as has been said previously there surely are no other reasons Rearising when returning one is sure not to reach the higher two realms There neither is perfectioning of faculties nor falling back  Those who are rearising when returning when having acquired a fruit in the realm of sexual passion arising in the realm of sexual passion when returning are with aversion regarding abiding in the womb and see the fault of existence and do not enter the realm of form and the one of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya formlessness This is because of the length of the duration of life Because of developing the noble path for a long time one carmot be with perfectioning of faculties To this the same applies as to the possibility to drop a lower friend Because of being with arising in the intermediate one there is no falling back when developing the noble path Question At which moment does Buddha rise in the world At which moment does the sovereign of the world rise in the world At which moment does the pratyekabuddha rise in the world Answer With decrease of a kalpa Buddha rises in the world At the moment of increase it is the sovereign of the world At two moments it is the pratyekabuddha At the moment of decrease of a kalpa  Buddha rises in the world because the instructor of liberation follows Buddha is the instructor of liberation because at moments of increase beings go to the view of transmigration and proceed in satisfaction When Buddha would rise in the world at that very moment He would be coming in vain because beings cannot abandon transmigration and adhere to satisfaction in an extreme way At the moment of decrease beings turn their backs to the view of transmigration and defilement and misconduct are extremely dominant That is why they can Miscellany  abandon transmigration That is why Buddha rises in the world at the moment of having come to beings of one hundred years not when less If it were when less beings at that very moment would no longer long for the doctrine they would have false greed and all would practice the false doctrine Because defilement is energetic it is no opportunity for the right doctrine The sovereign of the world mostly rises in the world at the moment of increase and can establish beings with the ten good ones That is why he does not rise at moments of decrease Because these beings go to misconduct it therefore is easy to convert them at the moment of increase because the moment is fruitful At the moment of primary decrease the sovereign of the world also rises in the world because it still is fruitful The pratyekabuddha rises in the world at the two moments because he does the own duty Question Is acquisition with acquisition of acquisition When this acquisition has a further acquisition this acquisition should further also have another acquisition How then is it not nonfinal When there is no acquisition of acquisition how then is acquisition accomplished Answer When factors arise two forms of acquisition are produced simultaneously It should be known that since two forms of acquisition arise together there is acquisition of acquisition When a factor arises exactly with this factor two forms of acquisition arise together acquisition and acquisition of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya acquisition Because of the power of this acquisition the factor and acquisition of acquisition are accomplished because of the power of acquisition of acquisition acquisition isaccomplished because of acquisition and acquisition of acquisition that both proceed in one awareness they make each other acquire that is why it is not nonfinal This aggregate matter and aggregate conditioning factors are with acquisition of one acquisition the same applies to the other aggregates The first acquisition can acquire one aggregate and a secondary acquisition The conditioned and the unconditioned are with acquisition of one acquisition The first acquisition can acquire the unconditioned and a secondary acquisition When past moral precept and bad moral precept of the realm of sexual passion are to be acquired in the three periods of time when present they are acquired as present and as future when future they are exactly acquired as future The acquisition of the three periods of time in the three periods of time of the four good and defiled aggregates of the realm of sexual passion of the five good aggregates and four defiled aggregates of the realm of form of the four good and defiled aggregates of the realm of formlessness of the five pure aggregates and of the four aggregates that arise simultaneously with magic awareness is to be acquired according to species The four aggregates relating to deportment are mostly acquired because of abandoning the periods of time and abandoning ksana With the one who practises them well they are to be acquired in the three periods of time The same applies to craftsmanship Neutral matter and the four aggregates arisen by retribution are to be acquired because of abandoning the Miscellany  periods of time and abandoning ksana future is future and present is present Past is past Question How many forms of acquisition does patience regarding the law in relation to frustration have Up to how many forms of acquisition does subsequent patience in relation to the path have Answer When there are Jifteen of the forms of acquisition this is acquisition of patience regarding the law in relation to frustration It should be known that the other paths of increase of vision are one by one with decrease When there are fifteen of the forms of acquisition this is acquisition of patience regarding the law in relation to frustration Patience regarding the law in relation to frustration has a fifteenfold acquisition because of the fifteen awarenesses of the path of vision With all awarenesses this acquisition arises one form of acquisition arises together with this patience fourteen arise later It should be known that the other paths of increase of vision are one by one with decrease The path of vision is called increase of vision because wisdom is dominant What is achieved when gradually surpassing the awarenesses one by one of the rest of the path of vision is proceeding of decrease Knowledge of the law in relation to frustration is with a fourteenfold acquisition one arises together and thirteen arise later It is without what has arisen previously because it has never been acquired yet Because the forms of acquisition that arise together with knowledge of the law  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya in relation to frustration start to be produced now and because there is not that which has arisen previously there are fourteen because the rest are without that which has arisen previously there is a gradual decrease Subsequent patience in relation to frustration  is with a thirteenfold acquisition one arises together and twelve arise later Subsequent knowledge in relation to frustration is with a twelvefold acquisition one arises together and eleven arise later Up to subsequent patience in relation to the path that is with one form of acquisition that arises together it is without that which arises later because the path of vision is accomplished because of being without patience for that which has arisen previously it has never been acquired yet Since there is not that which is produced later and not that which has arisen previously there is only one Question In which stage is the acquisition of being disjunctioned included Answer  The antidote that is abandoning and the one that is detraction in this stage exactly include the acquisition of being disjunctioned It is the class of knowledge of the law and the one of subsequent knowledge The antidote that is abandoning and the one that is detraction in this stage exactly include the acquisition of being disjunctioned Some say that with the antidote that is abandoning in this stage the acquisition of being disjunctioned because of Miscellany  depending on the antidote that is abandoning Spoken of in this way the acquisition of being disjunctioned of what is to be abandoned through the path of vision and through the spiritual path of the realm of sexual passion is included in the pretrance For the stage of the first trance it is included in the pretrance in the first trance and in the intermediate one For the second trance it is included in four stages exactly the previous three stages and the second trance For the third trance it is included in five stages exactly the previous four stages and the third trance For what is to be abandoned through the path of vision and through the spiritual path of the fourth trance and for what is to be abandoned through the path of vision of the one of formlessness it is included in six stages exactly the previous five stages and the fourth trance For what is to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the sphere of unlimited space it is included in seven stages exactly the previous six stages and the sphere of unlimited space For what is to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the sphere of unlimited consciousness it is included in eight stages exactly the previous seven stages and the sphere of unlimited consciousness the pretrance the intermediate one the fundamental four trances and three immaterial ones Moreover some say that it is when this stage includes the antidote that is abandoning and the antidote that is detraction This saying is that the acquisition of being disjunc Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya tioned of what is to be abandoned through the path of vision and through the spiritual path of the realm of sexual passion and of the one of form and of what is to be abandoned through the path of vision of the realm of formlessness is included in six stages What is to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the realm of formlessness is as has been said previously It is the class of knowledge of the law and the one of subsequent knowledge Moreover some say that when a stage is with the class of knowledge of the law the acquisition of being disjunctioned from what is to be abandoned through the path of vision and through the spiritual path of the realm of sexual passion exactly is included in these stages When a stage is with the class of subsequent knowledge the acquisition of being disjunctioned from what is to be abandoned through the path of vision and through the spiritual path of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness exactly is included in these stages This is said to be the acquisition of being disjunctioned from the realm of sexual passion included in six stages and the acquisition of being disjunctioned from the realm of form and from the one of formlessness included in nine stages Question Is the acquisition that is produced together with the path the acquisition that is the cause of the path that is produced together or not only exception made for the efficient cause all other causes are asked for Answer  The acquisition that is produced together with the path is since it is produced together no cause Also the path is not its cause Miscellany  What is produced later is either with or without The acquisition that is produced together with the path is no cause for the path because of not being one and the same fruit When there is not one fruit there is no meaning of a general cause Also the path is not its cause Also the path that is produced together with the acquisition is no cause for the acquisition also because it is not one and the same fruit Question How are the forms of acquisition that are produced later Answer What is produced later is either with or without The path that has been produced previously is either with cause or without cause regarding the acquisition that is produced later For the acquisition of the later similar dominant path and for the acquisition of the similar excessive being disjunctioned it is the cause it is not the cause for the acquisition of the minor path and for the acquisition of being disjunctioned of the minor path because this one is with a natural cause it is no cause for what is middle and for what is excessive With patience regarding the law in relation to frustration one form of acquisition arises together This form of acquisition is no cause for patience and patience is also no cause for this form of acquisition With knowledge of the law in relation to frustration three  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya forms of acquisition arise together the acquisition of two paths and the acquisition of one form of being disjunctioned Knowledge of the law in relation to frustration is no cause for these forms of acquisition and also these forms of acquisition are no cause for knowledge of the law in relation to frustration This patience regarding the law in relation to frustration is the cause for the three forms of acquisition With subsequent patience in relation to frustration four forms of acquisition arise together the acquisition of three paths and the acquisition of one form of being disjunctioned Subsequent patience in relation to frustration is no cause for these forms of acquisition these forms of acquisition are also no cause for patience Knowledge of the law in relation to frustration is the cause for three forms of acquisition it is no cause for the acquisition of patience regarding the law in relation to frustration because patience is weak The acquisition of subsequent patience and of subsequent knowledge and of being disjunctioned With subsequent knowledge in relation to frustration six forms of acquisition arise together the acquisition of four paths and the acquisition of two forms of being disjunctioned Subsequent knowledge in relation to frustration is no cause for these forms of acquisition these forms of acquisition are also no cause for knowledge Subsequent patience in relation to frustration is the cause for three forms of acquisition it is no cause for three forms of acquisition it is acquisition in the class of knowledge of the law Up to with subsequent patience in relation to the path twentytwo forms of acquisition arise together the acquisition of fifteen paths and the acquisition of seven forms of Miscellany  being disjunctioned Subsequent patience in relation to the path is no cause for these forms of acquisition and these forms of acquisition are also no cause for patience Knowledge of the law in relation to the path is the cause for three forms of acquisition knowledge of the law itself is the natural cause regarding the future acquisition the acquisition of being disjunctioned and the acquisition of subsequent patience Since the lower forms of acquisition are weak they are no cause it is no cause for the rest Question With which aspect which specific nature and which supporting object is emptiness of eraptiness and in which stages is it included Answer  With the aspect emptiness with impurity and duration this is said to be emptiness of emptiness It is said to be with having no more learning to do as object It abides in eleven stages After having arisen emptiness of emptiness is produced later The aspect emptiness is when observing the five appropriating aggregates as empty to this the same applies as to a person who at the moment of burning a corpse grasps a stick to turn it and then burns the stick With impurity The meaning of being impure because of routing the noble path Emptiness of emptiness routs the noble path It is not by means of the noble  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya path that the noble path is routed because by means of a conduct that is with aversion for what is pure one does not take what is pure as supporting object Duration the specific nature of samadhi Emptiness of emptiness The meaning of emptiness in relation to the aspect emptiness Having no more learning to do as object The meaning of being with having no more learning to do as supporting object the aspect emptiness of having no more learning to do is its supporting object Moreover taking the five aggregates that arise together with the aspect emptiness as supporting object is spoken of Eleven stages Because of being impure because of the general object Emptiness of emptiness is with eleven stages the realm of sexual passion up to the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification Question How is aimlessness of aimlessness Answer Proceeding in the aspect impermanence this is aimlessness of aimlessness Together they abide with the steadfast one this is aimlessness of aimlessness Aimlessness associated with the aspect impermanence observes the impermanence of the five appropriating aggregates and regarding the later produced aimlessness of aimlessness the imperma nence of aimlessness is considered Miscellany  With the aspects of frustration it be overturned because the noble path is not with the nature of frustration It neither are such aspects as the cause because of being contrary to the noble path Because aimlessness of aimlessness is contrary to the noble path it does not concern such aspects as the cause If it were to concern such aspects as the cause it would have to follow the noble path but it routs the noble path because it contradicts the noble path It neither concerns such aspects as the path because such aspects as the path find satisfaction with the path The previously mentioned emptiness of emptiness and aimlessness of aimlessness these two are samddhis that can be present with the steadfast arhar because of having power because of being free from defilement Although the viewattainer has keen faculties and acquires selfdependent samadhi it is because he is not free from defilement yet Although the one conditionally liberated is free from defilement he does not acquire selfdependent samadhi because of minor faculties The one unconditionally liberated acquires selfdependent samadhi because of keen faculties and because of being free from the desire of the three realms That is why they only can be present with him Tt concerns the realm of sexual passion It is only present in the realm of sexual passion because of mostly being produced from the power of explanations It is exception made for Uttarakuru the other three directions The rest is as before The other things are as has been said with emptiness of emptiness  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  Signlessness of signlessness proceeds in peace It proceeds in neutral cessation The rest is as has been said before Signlessness of signlessness proceeds in peace Signlessness observes peace regarding calculated cessation and regarding the later produced proceeding of signlessness of signlessness the meaning is stating Your uncalculated cessation is also peace Question What is its supporting object Answer It proceeds in neutral cessation Uncalculated cessation is its supporting object This is neutral Neither does it produce uncalculated cessation Not being produced is as has been said previously Because of this meaning it is not said to concern the aspect cessation because there is a twofold cessation uncalculated cessation and cessation through impermanence When stating that it proceeds in the aspect cessation it is not known which kind of cessation  Because of not being established by the three characteristic marks it is in peace The rest is as has been said before The rest is as has been said with emptiness of emptiness Moreover these forms of samadhi acquire to be present with keen faculties at the moment the knowledge of destruction arises and there is later effort Buddha is with absence of effort the pratyekabuddha is with little effort the Sravaka either is with middle or excessive  Emptiness of emptiness and aimlessness of aimlessness Miscellany  are present after the knowledge of frustration of knowledge of the law and of subsequent knowledge Signlessness of signlessness is present after the knowledge of cessation of knowledge of the law and of subsequent knowledge With samdadhis of the realm of sexual passion they are produced after the noble path included in the pretrance With the stage of neitheridentificationnornonidentification they are produced after the noble path of the sphere of nothingness For the rest they are successively to the specific stage Question Which meditative attainment is the transgressing samadhi Answer The transgressing samadhi reaches the third after going up and down The same is true for the nonmindful indecision regarding the transgression of the supporting object The transgressing samadhi reaches the third after going up and down At the moment of meditative attainment of the transgressing samddhi in succession to the impure first trance the impure second trance is present in this way successively up to the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification Hereafter succes sively returning the first trance is reached Regarding all these stages the pure first trance is produced after having been developed well and successively up to the sphere of nothingness Next when successively returning the first trance is reached When these stages again are developed well the meditative attainment of the  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya impure first trance is produced next From the producing of the first trance there is transgression and entering the impure third trance after the third trance has been produced there is entering the sphere of unlimited space after the sphere of unlimited space is produced there is entering the sphere of nothingness The reverse transgression is also in this way After these stages have been developed well the pure transgressing meditative attainment is produced later Later there is successive entering the meditative attainment of the pure third trance when the impure first trance can be produced In succession to the pure third trance there is the impure sphere of unlimited space In succession to the impure sphere of unlimited space there is the pure sphere of nothingness The reverse transgression is also in this way This is said to be the accomplishment of the transgressing meditative attainment Because they are remote from one another the fourth meditative attainment is not transgressed Only the one unconditionally liberated of three directions can produce it Because of being free from defilement because of the power of selfdependent samadhi as has been said previously The second trance with the first trance as supporting object successively is with taking the lower realm of sexual passion and the first trance as supporting object and taking the higher third and fourth trance as supporting object In this way it is to be known for all stages That the immaterial ones do not take lower ones as supporting object has been said already previously Although in succession to knowledge of the law in relation to frustration subsequent patience in relation to frustration arises up to taking the summit of existence as supporting object it is because this is not with an interrupted object because they are not interrupted when experiencing one another there is no transgressing although being remote Although the awarenesses that take the specific stage as supporting object are produced in succession to the clean liberation and sometimes the higher stage is taken as supporting object these are however defiled Question Should it be stated that the Buddhaword is  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya good or neutral Answer The Buddhaword is good and neutral As the first awareness proceeds the same is further also true for the accomplishment it is neutral or clean The Buddhaword is good and neutral When speaking is doing effort in relation to the fact of subjecting it is good as has been said All formations are impermanent all factors are selfless and nirvana is being extinguished eternally it is to be compared in this way When speaking is in relation to the absence of this effort it is neutral as asked Ananda Why is it that in the park there are high sounds and big sounds it is to be compared in this way As the first awareness proceeds the same is further also b true for the accomplishment it is neutral or clean When the Worldhonoured One has been manifesting with good awarenesses it exactly is accomplished with good awarenesses Manifesting with neutral awarenesses either is accomplished with neutral awarenesses or accomplished with good awarenesses there is no manifesting with good awarenesses that is accomplished with neutral awarenesses because at the moment of explanation increase proceeds no decrease Question How is it with the sravaka Answer With the sravaka it is unfixed when accomplishing and when proceeding Miscellany  That at the moment of the explanation there is no falling back is only with that honoured Buddha Manifesting with good awarenesses by the Sravaka either is accomplished with good awarenesses or accomplished with neutral awarenesses Manifesting with neutral awarenesses either is accomplished with good awarenesses or accomplished with neutral awarenesses Question Why is it that with the Worldhonoured One it is manifested with good awarenesses and accomplished with good awarenesses and that with the sravaka it is manifested with good awarenesses and accomplished with neutral awarenesses Answer That at the moment of the explanation there is no falling back is only with that honoured Buddha Only at the moment of the explanation by the honoured Buddha there is no falling back At the moment of the explanation by such sravakas as Sariputra there still is falling back Question How many sensefields are what is to be burnt and how many sensefields are what burns Answer  Of the sensefields there are four that are that which is to be burnt and also what burns what is to be weighed and also what weighs To be cut off and what cuts off are without difference Of the sensefields there are four that are that which is  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya to be burnt and also what burns Matter smell taste and tangible are what is to be burnt and also what burns because of not being without one another Some Say that these four sensefields are what is to be burnt because of not being without one another and that moreover one sensefield is what burns the element fire because it acquires the characteristic mark of burning Exactly the previously mentioned four sensefields are what is to be weighed and also what weighs because of not being without one another Some say that four sensefields are what weighs and that one kind is what is to be weighed because it acquires being heavy as characteristic mark To be cut off and what cuts off are without difference Exactly the previously mentioned four sensefields are what is to be cut off and also what cuts off What is the difference between earth and the element earth Answer  Earth is the condition of colour and configuration With the characteristic mark solidity the element earth is spoken of The other two are also twofold Wind is exactly wind or different Earth is the condition of colour and configuration The condition of colour and configuration is earth Included in the sensefield matter consciousness of the eye is conMiscellany  scious of it This is a worldly name With the characteristic mark solidity the element earth is spoken of The characteristic mark solidity concerns the element earth Included in the sensefield tangible consciousness of the body is conscious of it This is the highest truth The other two are also twofold Water and fire the condition of colour and configuration is water is the element water The condition of colour and configuration is fire heat is the element fire The rest is as has been said before Wind is exactly wind or different Some say that wind js exactly the element wind because it is not a worldly established name Some say that this also is a worldly established name there is hard wind and there is no hard wind it is to be compared in this way Question Of how many kinds are the roots of merit Answer  What is connected to merit is said to be one kind And what is connected to liberation Regarding merit there is that which is connected to penetration What is connected to merit is said to be one kind When being with fruit is acquiring to be the sovereign of the T  q  en world Sakra and to be of the group of the other selfdependent ones with great power of the realm of sexual passion that arise together with such as wisdom  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya through learning and the one through reasoning superiority giving and moral precept  of the realm of sexual passion as retribution and the possibility to acquire superior roots of merit of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness is called connected to merit  And what is connected to liberation What is connected to liberation is turning ones back to existence and going to liberation that are also arising together with such as the one through learning the one through reasoning giving and moral precept of the realm of sexual passion Although the one who cultivates all these roots of merit intermediately is with cutting away the roots of merit he is still said to be going against the stream Because of definitely having to obtain nirvana That is why it is spoken of in this way It is better to be Devadatta and not to be Udraka Ramaputra who abides outside the path The other two meanings are as always it is so that when blameworthiness of hell has ended there is the acquisition of the realisation of the pratyekabuddha regarding humans with a duration of life of forty thousand years With keen faculties there is being superior to such as Sariputra Although Udraka Ramaputra is free from eight stages and arises in the summit of existence it is so that when retribution ends there there is death and he comes to arise in the doctrinewood When he puts win S to make foxes fly all beings in the water and on earth are harmed and when dying a i Miscellany  he falls in the Avicihell The Worldhonoured One does not remember the moment He reached liberation The one who sows the seed of liberation has such characteristic marks as abiding in sitting to listen to the doctrine At the moment of learning the doctrine there is lamentation and crying the hair on the body is upright one sees the fault of transmigration and the good benefit of nirvana and there is worship and faith in the tight doctrine Because when understanding the noble truth such roots of merit as warmth are said to be connected to penetration because of being certain regarding the truths because of fulfilling the truths because there is going to the noble path subsequently This has been spoken of already in the chapter Nobility  The fourth is free from impure influence The pure root of merit is still having learning to do and having no more learning to do This has been said already previously Question How is the acquisition of uncalculated cessation regarding woeful courses Answer It should be known that such as giving can proceed regarding woeful courses This is definitely together with patience Such as giving are equal or different It should be known that such things as giving can proceed regarding woeful courses Sometimes there is giving so as not to fall in woeful courses sometimes it  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya also is moral precept sometimes the one through learning sometimes the one through reasoning sometimes warmth sometimes summit because when there is vision of the mistake of transmigration and of the good bene fit of nirvana one turns ones back to transmigration goes to nirvana and practises giving The one who is with such giving can proceed in relation to woeful courses The same applies to the other roots of merit Saying that it is not so that while giving can proceed in relation to woeful courses this is not so for summit is impossible Because of turning ones back to transmigration Sometimes the roots of merit connected to penetration are not acquired yet but one can be with extreme aversion in relation to transmigration this would then not be so for the one who acquires the roots of merit connected to penetration Furthermore giving is extremely contrary to the defiled action of woeful courses not to summit That is why there is no mistake Question When the roots of merit are not definitely free from woeful courses then what is definitely fixed Answer This is definitely together with patience because patience is contrary to all defiled action of woeful courses with the one who abandons patience the defiled action of woeful courses still is not produced how much more when not abandoning  Such as giving are equal or different From giving to summit there sometimes is being free from woeful courses sometimes not being free because not all giving can oppose the defiled action of woeful courses The same applies to the other roots of merit It should be known that the moment of being with nonattachment and the one of falling back the one of rearising and also the one of death the one of cutting away what is good and the one of the successiveness of them are with consciousness of the mind These six things are said to be with abiding in consciousness of the mind because of indecision because of the general supporting object Although the Worldhonoured One has been speaking of falling back from eyes that sce matter from ears that hear sound and from the body that feels the tangible they are also with falling back because they implicate consciousness of the mind being present Question Death and rearising occur when abiding in which feeling Answer All beings abide in the faculty equanimity with death and with rearising because of not being intense  All beings abide in the faculty equanimity with death  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya and with rearising All beings abide in the neitherpleasantnorunpleasant feeling with death and with rearising Question Answer Because of not being intense Because if one does not understand all parts of the state of birth and of the state of dying there is no awaking because regarding feelings neitherpleasantnorunpleasant feeling is the most not intense one there is no understanding That is why there is death and rearising when all beings abide in the neitherpleasantnorunpleasant feeling Question If it is so should the neitherpleasantnorunpleasant feeling not be without the pure noble path because it is intense Answer It is not so that the neitherpleasantnorunpleasant feeling is without the power of the pure noble path because of letting benefit be just as when water abides in something hot it is hot and when abiding in something bitter it is bitter The sameapplies to sweet sour salt and astringent Heart of Scholasticism with Miscellaneous Additions part one Composed by the venerable Dharmatrata Translated by the Indian Tripitaka Samghavarman of the Sung and others Although many factors have already been spoken of and there is certainty about all the many miscellaneous meanings one further has to investigate the essence regarding these unlimited objects  The Muni proclaimed that the path of vision is called the wheel of the doctrine because it is swift Sometimes it is said that it is the eight members of the seeker that reach the awareness of another when proceeding The Muni proclaimed that the path of vision is called the wheel of the doctrine because it is swift Because of extinguishing two kinds of delusion He is said to be the Muni  because of perfect silence He is said to be the Muni Proclaiming is manifesting  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Because vision increases the path of vision is spo ken of Because wisdom increases one seeks for jiieyam and because of reaching the categories of what is not the path is spoken of Swift is quick progress The path of vision is the intense path because it does not produce concentration The path of one class suddenly abandons the nine classes of fetters Because of this method the doctrine is spoken of Because of being free from beings and because when this is abandoned that is reached wheel is spoken of when abandoning frustration the origin is reached up to when abandoning cessation the path is reached Furthermore wheel is spoken of because of being similar to a wheel just as when a wheel proceeds in what is minor what is excessive is reached and when proceeding in what is excessive what is minor is reached In this way for the wheel of the path of vision it is so that when minor patience  proceeds excessive knowledge is reached When proceeding further patience is reached Furthermore wheel is spoken of because of the meaning of excessive and lower just as the lower part of a wheel reaches the excessive  and the excessive reaches the lower  In this way with the wheel of the path of vision it is so that after having taken the realm of sexual passion as supporting object the higher summit of existence is taken as supporting object after having taken the summit of existence as supporting object the lower realm of sexual passion is taken as supporting object Furthermore wheel is spoken of because of the directions of the truths that subject just as the wheel of the sovereign of the world Investigations  Sometimes it is said that it is the eight members of the seeker that reach the awareness of another when proceeding The venerable Ghosaka said that the eight members of the seeker that reach the awareness of another when proceeding is called the turning of the wheel of the doctrine That is why it is said that the Tathagata made the wheel of the doctrine turn at the place of the wise recluse of Benares Because of this meaning two vehicles differentiating the one of the sravaka and the one of the pratyekabuddha are with making the wheel of the doctrine turn out of their specific power Although such  as Kaundinya made the wheel of the doctrine turn in relation to themselves and developed the path themselves it was not in relation to others and it is because of depending on awakening as reason that it is said that it is the Worldhonoured One who made the wheel of the doctrine turn Although there is turning after patience regarding the law in relation to frustration is produced it is the production of subsequent knowledge in relation to the path that is said to be called turning because with this fact five reasons are supplied the socalled abandoning of the previous path the acquisition of the path not acquired yet the acquisition of unity with destruction of fetters the sudden acquisition of eight knowledges and the development of the sixteen aspects simultaneously Such five persons as Kaundinya and all the gods of the eightyfour thousand see the truths because when the Worldhonoured One and Kaundinya produce conventional awarenesses this is known by the ghosts of the earth Because of what is heard by the gods regarding the venerable one with great power be Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya cause of jumping up of joy and because of actual permanently protecting the ghosts of the earth who abide nearby raise music and sing loudly and the ghosts of the earth who abide remote proceed in manifesting this is no knowledge and vision because of their specific power Because of permanently being with superior awarenesses it are no weak When in this way the sound of the song of the gods of space proceeds during the time of a mament and reaches the gods of brahmas group  it does not reach the higher stages because consciousness of the ear of this specific stage is not being part of it Some say that by means of the Indian word they are called akanisthagods Although sound decreases with the instant it is stated that the sound reaches the gods of brahmas group because of being produced successively When the sovereign of the world rises in the world he leads beings to conversion by means of the ten good paths of action Because the ten good paths of action experience retribution in the realm of sexual passion the sound of the sovereign of the world who rises in the world reaches the gods controlling enjoyments magically created by others Because they are not yet without attachment it does not reach the stages of being with nonattachment Because the gods of brahmas group seek for the turning of the wheel of the doctrine of the Worldhonoured One urgently therefore the sound reaches the gods of brahmas group Because the gods of the clean residences encourage the accomplishment of the path without superior  therefore the sound reaches the gods of the clean residences Because when actions of fame are done this is limited to sound Investigations  Question What is the brahmawheel Answer Buddha said that the nobleness of the complete path is called the brahmawheel The whole of the even part the spanners and the axle cures unchaste Because all of the eightfold noble path equally depend on nobleness it is called brahmawheel Because this is said to be the right speech right action and right livelihood are not destroying they are called even Even is the rim Because right view right conceptualising and right effort are established depending on moral precept because they are with a wide supporting object they are called the spanners Because right mindfulness and right concentration include the spanners of right view right conceptualising and right effort they are called the axle Defilement is called impure because of the disliked fruit The path is the antidote for impure defilement that is why it is called the brahmawheel That the brahmawheel is the eight members of the noble has already been said The accomplishment of fasting shall now be spoken of  Upavasa At the moment it is accepted someone else and two are spoken of It is possessed of and one day and night  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Free from ornament and relating to deportment Upa is near vasa is abiding because of abiding close to samvara lasting for life abiding nearby is spoken of Sam is evenly vara is protection because of evenly protecting all beings In all scriptural texts and treatises it is stated that of all kinds of moral restraint it should be stated that they are evenly protecting  That is why it is said that following abiding in an awareness of a loving kindness of all beings restraint is acquired because when the mind js unclean this differentiated accepting is not with the acquisition of restraint because restraint is free from increase or decrease The moment is accepting at the moment the sun comes out Someone else is accepting from another person because it is from beings not from what is not relating to beings because it is no speech It are no small children it is not with sleepiness not with delusion and not when being disturbed  because in these  the prescriptions of fasting are not understood Because of the combination of this one and that one the acceptation is achieved In case of acquiring negligence in relation to rnoral precepts and in case deilement is produced fit is so that the one who can see the mistake accepts it from these Two both spoken of Giver and receiver these two are both spoken of The giver is spoken of first and the reInvestigations  ceiver is spoken of subsequently When the giver is not spoken of the giving is not accomplished because the giving is not accomplished also the receiving is not accomplished When the receiver is not spoken of the receiving is not accomplished Because the receiving is not spoken of it is not so that the gesture arises not being spoken of Because the activity does not arise also being without activity does not arise Because being without activity does not arise there is no arising of other qualities together with consciousness When two persons are spoken of simultaneously the receiving also is not accomplished because there would be no giving Possessed of is the accomplishment of the noble eight members to this the same applies as to a bhiksu who is not possessed of his restraint is no bhiksu One day and night Because a third limitation not being part of it There are two limitations as has been said previously  The restraint of fasting acquires the limitation of day and night and the other restraint acquires the limitation of lasting for life Free from ornament and relating to deportment Because bracelets and dress are ornament The ones who keep it should all abandon these when abiding in accepting restraint because ornament is the footing for heedlessness Abiding in discipline is heedfulness Heedlessness is doing what should not be done Because the one who abandons what is relating to deportment is not with respect he does not acquire restraint Eunuchs alternative eunuchs the one without distinctive marks and the one with two distinctive marks do not make restraint arise Because the attachment to sensual pleasure increases because shamelessness and disregard increase Abiding in the course humans it   s  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya only depends on three directions because of intense awakening The fivefold reason for its being clean has already been spoken of in the chapter Sitra Question How many of these fasting are members of sila how many are members of heedfulness and how many are members of religious vow Answer  Of members of Sila there are four One is a member of heedfulness The rest are members of religious vow   The first four are members of Sila translated Sila is stated to be conduct is also stated to be following samadhi in a right way is also stated to be cooling and is also stated to be quiet sleep Abandoning blameworthiness by nature is because of moral precept in relation to the specific nature Not drinking alcohol is a member of heedfulness Drinking alcohol is the footing for heedlessness because it lets the mind loose its mindfulness That is why being free from this is called member of heedfulness The rest are members of religious vow Because of being conformable to moral precept Some say that being free from eating at a wrong time is fasting and that the rest are members of fasting It is further said that being free from eating at a wrong time is fasting and also is a member of fasting the rest are all members to this the same applies as to right view Investigations  that is the path and also a member of the path investigation into factors that is enlightenment and also is a member of eniightenment When nine members are spoken of this is not right Being free from high beds big beds perfume because they together are the production of the condition of decorating just as decay and dying establish one member existence because they are mature together The same applies to this Question Being free from such as double talk harsh words and frivolity is being free from blameworthiness by nature Why then do they not establish restraint of fasting Answer Because of being hard to protect and because of being practised permanently by the ones who are near Already one who has left home to become a religious mendicant is hard to protect since he moves permanently how much more for one living in ones house In this way that which is relating to deportment and exception made for not drinking alcohol the other blameworthiness by contradiction does also not establish a member of fasting with the one who is hard to protect Question That bad moral precept is burntby heat is already known The sandalwood path of the restraint of fasting should now be spoken of Why is there no updsaka not possessed of restraint Is that because of which there is perplexity together with seeing its mistake And when there is an updasaka not possessed of the restraint of the updsaka why then is there no sramanera not possessed of the restraint of the sramanera When there is  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya no  why then are such as the upasaka with one part spoken of How is it to be achieved that what has been said is not nonsensical Answer  The upasaka supplied with restraint and the restraint of the bhiksu are one Because of the meaning of limitedness the Muni has been speaking of the one with one part The updsaka supplied with restraint and the restraint of the bhiksu are one There is one who is said to be called the updsaka possessed of the restraint of the upasaka it is not when he is not possessed of it The same applies to the sramanera and to the bhiksu As has been said A certain self took refuge with Buddha the Venerable with two feet took refuge with the doctrine the Venerable with nonattachment took refuge with the samgha the venerable order  have to realise that I know that abandoning beings lasting for life and accepting refuge is being with a clean mind Up to the third verbal activity the restraint of the updsaka is acquired Question This is the verbal activity of keing free from taking life How are the other forms of restraint to be acquired Answer It should be known that because of excluding the group I abandon such as beings lasting for life should be mentioned To this the same applies as to the adherence to such things as moral precepts and vows that since such things as are excluded therefore also is called adherence to moral precepts and vows Investigations  Furthermore abandoning beings is because of abandoning specific beings When one from now on achieves to abandon specific beings what is accepted as to moral precept is never neglected Furthermore the restraint of pratimoksa is acquired regarding beings as substratum It is saying From today on I do not kill beings do not take what is not given  do not commit improper sensitivity and do not lie Be cause of protecting this I do not drink alcohol That is why among every blameworthiness by contradiction being free from drinking alcohol establishes the restraint of the updasaka because drinking alcohol is the footing for every heedlessness Because it is hard to be protected regarding that which one accepts oneself being free from improper sensitivity  regarding someone elses is spoken of It should be known that double talk harsh words and frivolity are also to be spoken of in this way Because passing through another birth of the noble person is to be known as sure no negligence is spoken of When stating that there is no updsaka such as the one with one part this is not right In reality such upasakas as the one with one part are established How is this Because of the meaning of limitedness the Muni has been speaking of the one with one part Because of limited moral precept Buddha has been speaking about the upasaka with one part when the updsaka possessed of restraint keeps one and does not keep four this is called with one part Keeping two and not keeping three is called one part The same applies to the rest because the moral precept that is acquired makes know that this saying is not nonsensical   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question When a person accepts the restraint of the updsaka at nine years or at ten years but later takes a wife is the restraint in relation to what can be done regarding this woman primarily acquired or not since this woman is the state of the wife When acquired how then is this no negligence in relation to moral precepts When not acquired how then is this no acquisition of one part The acquisition of a member is no acquisition of being completely possessed of The condition of improper sensitivity not regarding someone elses does not achieve to be free from the condition of improper sensitivity It concerns no producing of improper sensitivity regarding someone elses after the one regarding the one in the state of the wife Because he is named after what is superior he was not called updsaka At the moment this sramanera returns to what is conventional there is the statement that says I am this updsaka and  have to realise that I know that this exactly is this updsaka If it were different the restraint of the updsaka should have to be accepted again The same applies to the bhiksu Restraint has already been spoken of The species of restraint shall now be spoken of  Two Sorms of restraint active good conduct paths of action primary acquisition action and Sila are spoken of Investigations  In this way there are the names of seven kinds  of restraint At the moment of that which is manifestirg of pratimoksa and of that which is unmanifesting of exactly this ksana  there are the names of in total seven kinds the first is called restraint the second is called restraint of pratimoksa the third is called active good conduct the fourth is called path of action the fifth is called pratimoksa the sixth is called action and the seventh is called sila Because of the antidote for all these bad moral precepts restraint is spoken of Because of obstructing bad moral precepts and including the seven groups of the Buddhist order restraint of pratimoksa is spoken of Because of being acquired regarding all beings and because of good activity active good conduct is spoken of Because of the acquisition of the desired fruit and because of the path of thinking paths of action are spoken of because thinking proceeds from these paths Because of primarily following disjunction pratimoka is spoken of because of being acquired following an a wareness of loving kindness of all beings Action is activity Stating that it is thinking is not right because this was said to be pratimoksa Because of this it should be known that it neither are the last three paths of action Sila is the meaning of being intensely good because of being produced by an awareness which is not harmful For all later that are unmanifesting there is a fivefold name exception made for pratimoksa and for the   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya paths of action Exception made for pratimoksa because of not being previous exception made for the paths of action because of abiding after the thinking that produces action The names of the species of restraint have already been spokenof The accomplishment and nonaccomplishment of the body and of bodily action shall now be spoken of  Accomplishment of the body is no action Sometimes action is spoken of no body Sometimes there are both body and action Sometimes neither is spoken of because no coarse awarenesses are present When coarse awarenesses are present bodily action can be produced but there subtle awarenesses are present In this way what isoriented inwardly and what is oriented outwardly the inward thing and the outward thing should all be known Furthermore no movement can proceed because in this state extreme frustration is suppressed How could activity be produced When arising in the realm of sexual passion there is no abiding in restraint and there neither is nonrestraint In the chapter Actions it has already been said that wien abiding in that which is bodily unmanifesting with sleepiness or when being distracted or Investigations  when intoxicated there is no seeking and no effort and the reason of what is manifesting is abandoned Sometimes action is spoken of no body Noble persons born in the realm of formlessness When they accomplish bodily action that is common with the path they have no body because matter is not being part of it When noble persons abide in the womb as a kalala a foetus in the second week a foetus in the third week or a foetus in the fourth week with abiding in pratimoksa in trance and in the one that is pure as forms of restraint with abiding in nonrestraint  with not abiding in restraint and also not in nonrestraint with not loosing what is manifesting of the body that is manifesting when arising in the realm of sexual passion when arising in the realm of form because these bodies are material abodes of beings  because bodily action sometimes is said to be restraint sometimes is said to be nonrestraint and sometimes is no abandoning of what is manifesting Sometimes neither is spoken of Worldlings of the realm of formlessness They have no body because it is immaterial there is no bodily action because it are worldlings The same applies to verbal action Question The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of four forms of descent into the womb How are these Answer  Descent without comprehension as well as abiding and leaving the womb The same is true up to descent with tranquillisation and abiding and leaving  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya When beings with scarce merit descent into the womb overturned conceptual identification proceeds and so does overturned resolve Socalled wind rain big cold big darkness and manifold disturbed sounds enter between flowers in woods grasses beds of flowers under trees and between walls When abiding in the womb there also is overturned conceptual identification and overturned resolve What is seen is as has been said before When leaving the womb there also are overturned conceptual identification and resolve What is seen is as before Beings with much merit see gardens of lust pools and palaces being sit in lotus position The rest is as has been said before This is said to be the first form of descent into the womb The second form of descent into the womb is when knowing oneself that one descents into the womb with nonoverturned conceptual identification and with nonoverturned resolve When abiding and leaving they are overturned as has been said before The third form of descent into the womb is when knowing oneself In this way I descent into the womb and in this way I abide in the womb When leaving they are overturned as has been said before The fourth form of descent into the womb is when knowing oneself In this way I descent into the womb and at the moment of abiding knowing oneself In this way I abide in the womb and at the moment of leaving knowing oneself In this way I leave the wom   Question With which persons are these forms of descent into the womb said to be Answer The first is with good action that is inaccurate There neither is seeking for knowledge The second is with action that is clean but is not with seeking for knowledge The third is seeking for knowledge but is with action that is inaccurate With the fourth both are accomplished Moreover it is said that the first form of descent into the womb concerns all beings the second concerns the sovereign of the world the third concerns the pratyekabuddha and the fourth concerns the Tathagata Question Does the srotadpanna have bad action If he has why does he not fall in woeful courses If he has none he should be with nonattachment but being with nonattachment is without these residences Answer The one who abides in the first fruit has one kind of foul action and does not fall in woeful courses Because action is not possessed The srotadpanna only has foul action to be abandoned through the spiritual path no action to be abandoned through the path of vision because there is no thing to be cured That is why he does not fall in woeful courses That is why it is not supplied because of not  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya being possessed To this the same applies as to a cart when the two wheels are together it can transport  when one wheel is broken then it cannot carry  A bird is also thus It is the foo who falls in woeful courses not the wise one Itare worldlings who fall in woeful courses not noble persons It is with negligence in relation to moral precepts that one falls in woeful courses not when fully taking the moral precepts It is with bad awarenesses that one  The four kinds of nutriment abide in the realm of sexual passion The same is true for four kinds of birth and the courses Three kinds of nutriment are in the higher two realms There is no solid food there The four kinds of nutriment abide in the realm of sexual passion The realm of sexual passion has the four kinds of nutriment The same is true for four kinds of birth and the courses The four kinds of birth and the five courses also have the four kinds of nutriment Although balls of iron and copper balls of hell make all misery increase they are called nutriment because of hunger and thirst Also cold wind that touches the body is called nutriment  Three kinds of nutriment are in the higher two realms Investigations  There is no solid food there The realm of form and the one of formlessness are without solid food because the body is light because of being immaterial Question As far as the courses  are concerned which kind of nutriment increases in these courses one by one Answer   In the course ghosts the food of representative cognition is the increase Equally so for being eggborn The same is true for three immaterial ones In the course ghosts the food of Tepresentative cognition is the increase In the course ghosts  there is the increase of the food of representative cognition  because its mental formations are manifold Also this is with the increase of the food of representative cognition because abiding in this being egg born is permanently with mindfulness on the mother not getting addle is achieved The same is true for three immaterial ones Exception made for neitheridentificationnornonidentification  the other three immaterial ones are also with the increase of the food of representative cognition because their mental formations are manifold  Being born form the womb is with increase of solid food This concerns the course humans  In hell the food of consciousness is the increase The same is true for the summit of existence  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Being born form the womb is with the increase of solid food This concerns the course humans Since being born from the womb concerns the course humans the increase of solid food is manifold because solid food sustains the body In hell the food of consciousness is the increase because consciousness sustains the psychophysical complex Also in neitheridentificationnornonidentification there is the increase of the food of consciousness because consciousness sustains name  The gods of the one of sexual passion are as the course humans In the realm of form the food of contact is the increase Equally so for being moistureborn in the course animal birth The gods of the one of sexual passion are as the course humans The gods of the realm of sexual passion are with the increase of solid food In the realm of form the food of contact is the increase The gods of the realm of form are with the increase of the food of contact because they experience the development of trance Equally so for being moistureborn in the course animal birth Being moistureborn in the course animal birth is with the increase of the food of contact The meaning of sustaining Just as when a branch grasps a jar it abides in balance and does not break when in this way the body is sustained with nutriment the body is not broken Because of implicating Investigations  existence nutriment is spoken of Question When it is so all impure factors have to be nutriment since they implicate existence Answer Because of supremacy power is spoken of because of the possibility to implicate existence nutriment is spoken of There are two things because of which is called nutriment being implicated by a previous effort and after having been implicated further sustaining Question Why are four said to be nutriment Answer This should not be asked All are difficult to be produced  but according to what is proper as to measure four are spoken of This solid food sustains the faculties and the four elements that is why it is said to be nutriment contact sustains awarenesses and accompanying mental factors that is why it is said to be nutriment re presentative cognition sustains the future existence that is why it is said to be nutriment That is why the four kinds of nutriment are spoken of Question When taking refuge with Buddha with the doctrine and with the samgha what does one take refuge with In Sanskrit the three treasures are called protection Taking refuge is with the meaning of approaching Taking refuge with the course Buddha as protection should be mentioned The same applies to the doctrine and to the samgha The three treasures each are twofold Buddha has a twofold body the physical body and the doctrinal body Also the doctrine is twofold the  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya doctrine of nirvana as the highest truth and the doctrine that everything is selfless Also the samgha is twofold the samgha as the highest truth and the conventional samgha It is taking refuge with which one Answer  It is taking refuge with the religious merit of the adept acquired by buddhas with nirvana as characteristic without superior and with the religious merit of the adept and the one of the seeker of the samgha The religious merit of the adept accomplished by buddhas is called Buddha Refuge is taking refuge with the religious merit of the adept acquired by Buddha It is said to be taking refuge with Buddha and not to be taking refuge with such impure  characteristics as being without fighting accomplished by Buddha because the specific nature is not disjunctioned Therefore it should be known that also the physical body is excluded When stating that bad awarenesses produced regarding the Tathagata and wounding the foot so as to draw blood do not acquire proximate blameworthiness this is not right Because of producing bad awarenesses Because when the foot is wounded when producing bad awarenesses regarding the religious merit of the adept acquired by Buddha proximate blameworthiness is acquired Furthermore because that on which the quality of having no more learn ing to do acquired by Buddha depends is harmed  Since the support is broken that which supports is also broken just as when a bottle is broken the milk is also broken Taking refuge with the destruction of craving is called Investigations  taking refuge with the doctrine because of being good and because of what is normative It should be known that other doctrines are excluded because other doctrines are without that which is good and are with absence of what is normative Taking refuge with the religious merit of the seeker and the one of the adept acquired by the samgha is called taking refuge with the samgha It is no taking refuge with the religious merit of neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do accomplished by the samgha and with the physical body because these are impure It neither is the conventional samgha Question What is the specific nature of taking refuge Answer Some say that verbal action is its specific nature because it is a supposed combination of teachings It is further said that it is the specific nature of both bodily and verbal action because of the specific nature of moral precept Question What is the meaning of taking refuge Answer The meaning of protecting is the meaning of basis the meaning of consolation is the meaning of basis because of this reason taking refuge is the gate In the chapter Sirra it has been said that the four forms of perfect faith shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter called Investigations This shall now be spoken of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya   When regarding the path of the pratyekabuddha and the one of thebodhisattva and regarding three noble truths faith is with absence of impurity it is perfect faith in the doctrine   When pure faith is produced with the three faculties and its dependence  acquired by the pratyekabuddha with all paths developed by the bodhisattva and with the truth of frustration the one of the origin and the one of cessation these factors as supporting object  this is called perfect faith in the doctrine with unmingled gupporting object The one with mingled supporting  object shall be spoken of later Buddha and the samgha are said to be a refuge There are two forms of these actual entities It is said that there is the name of four forms Tt is the perfectly clean morality that arises subsequently The bodily and verbal action that arise subsequently to what is pure is the restraint highly esteemed by the nobles and is called perfect faith in moral precept  Buddha and the samgha are said to be a refuge It should be known that Buddha and the samgha are as has been said with the previous refuge Pure faith with the religious merit of Buddha as supporting object is perfect faith in Buddha pure faith with the religious merit of the samgha as supporting object is perfect faith in the samgha Investigations  When the pure religious merit acquired by Buddha and the religious merit of the seeker acquired by the bodhisattva are taken as supporting object this is called perfect faith in the doctrine with mingled supporting object In this way also taking Buddha the religious merit of the pratyekabuddha and the religious merit of the sravaka up to every religious merit of the seeker and the one of the adept as supporting object is also called perfect faith in the doctrine with mingled supporting object Question How many actual entities do these forms of perfect faith have Answer There are two forms of these actual entities Faith and moral precept Faith is awarenesses that are clean moral precept is the four elements that are clean It is said that there is the name of four forms Because of being established by the actual entities as supporting object there are four  because of the difference of being with faith as supporting object there are three forms Knowing what is clean is either knowing or acquiring or grasping what is clean Question What is known Answer The four noble truths It is further said that they are called perfect faith just as the increase of sara These two kinds of increase both acquire the first path Mara cannot destroy or break  Each is named by depending on the specific explanation  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question How is their succession Answer Perfect faith in Buddha is first Buddha is the root because of his explanations Question What is the ability of Buddha Answer The doctrine of enlightenment  Question Who preserves the doctrine Answer The samgha Question How does this samgha acquire unity Answer Noble moral precept Furthermore the one who can explain is Buddha What does He explain The doctrine For whom is explained For the samgha Who preserves the doctrine Moral precept Furthermore the good doctor is Buddha that which cures the disease is the doctrine the one who nurses is the samgha the medicine is noble moral precept This is said to explain of the succession In the chapter Sutra it has been said that the fruits of Sramanaship shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Investigations This shall now be spoken of  The socalled fruits of Sramanaship are both unconditioned and conditioned The conditioned fruit of the seeker is the third The fruit of the adept is the fourth Two kinds of fruits of sramanaship conditioned and unconditioned The conditioned fruit of the seeker is the c third The conditioned fruit of the adept is the fourth All unconditioned ones are all neither still having learning to do nor having no more learning to do  Eightynine noble persons are with unconditioned fruits of Sramanaship All paths of the sramana are also spoken of regarding the conditioned ones These eight forms of patience of the path of vision are the Sramana eight knowledges are a conditioned fruit of Sramanaship The eight forms of abandoning defilement are an unconditioned fruit of sramanaship The nine proximate paths of being with nonattachment of the spiritual path of the realm of sexual passion are the sramana  the nine paths of liberation are a conditioned fruit of sramanaship The nine forms of abandoning defilement are an unconditioned fruit of Sramanaship In this way all should be known up to being with nonattachment in neitheridentificationnornonidentification Be Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya cause of what is manifested the Worldhonoured One has been speaking of four because five reasons are supplied in these conditions abandoning the already acquired path acquisition of the path not acquired yet with de struction of the fetters acquiring to be disjunctioned from a unity sudden acquisition of eight knowledges developing the sixteen aspects simultaneously This is because in these conditions there is certainty about the path and certain accomplishment When is abandoned there is what is made and the accomplishment of what is made Question Is there somehow in the duration of time of one instant one knowledge that knows all factors Answer Although all emptiness is known it is not so that everything is known Exception has to be made for its simultaneous and for the associated ones  and further also for its specific nature When a certain knowledge arises emptiness and selfless of all factors may be known but the own specific nature is not known because of not looking upon oneself To this the same applies as to the tip of a finger that does not touch itself Morecver because there are no two certainties in one knowledge there are no two certainties knowing oneself and knowing another Neither are the associated factors known because of together being with one aspect and one supporting object Investigations  All factors of the associated class are with equal aspect and equal supporting object because of being with one fruit because of proceeding in an equal certain This knowledge is wisdom through learning and wisdom through reasoning no wisdom through personal realisation Why Wisdom through personal realisation is with a segmented supporting object That is why it is said that it concerns the realm of sexual passion and the realm of form because the one through learning and the one through reasoning are not being part of the realm of formlessness uestion How many forms of antidote are there Answer The socalled antidote that is abandoning the one that is detraction the one that is support and the one that is removal These four should be known as called forms of antidote There are four forms of antidote the socalled antidote that is abandoning antidote that is detraction antidote that is support and antidote that is removal The antidote that is abandoning is the proximate path because of abandoning the acquisition of defilement The antidote that is detraction is that because regarding a Supporting object committing a mistake proceeds such as impermanence frustration emptiness and nonself itis to be compared in this way The antidote that is support is combined with the acqui Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya sition of abandoning defilement the path of liberation and is combined with the acquisition of all later abandonment of other defilement The antidote that is removal in first instance was the path of liberation Patience regarding the law in relation to frustration is the antidote that is abandoning and the antidote that is detraction for defilement to be abandoned through the vision of frustration Regarding all other factors of fetters of the realm of sexual passion it is antidote that is detraction With patience regarding the law in relation to frustration of the one without attachment to sensual pleasure and who has arisen free from beings  it also is antidote that is removal In this way all paths have to be known according to their meaning In the chapter Siitra it has been said that the meaning of spirituai practice shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Investigations  This shall now be spoken of  First the one which is obtaining or the one of enjoyment the one which is antidote and the spiritual practice which is expulsion It should be known that these four kinds are said to be with the meaning of spiritual practice The four kinds of spiritual practice are the spiritual practice which is obtaining the spiritual practice which is development the spiritual practice which is antidote and the spiritual practice which is expulsion The spiritual practice which is obtaining is the primary acInvestigations  quisition of conditioned qualities not acquired yet The spiritual practice which is development is the successive arising of good factors ever acquired The spiritual practice which is antidote is the development of the four forms of antidote called spiritual practice which is antidote Since this regards impure factors it is a match for the path that is antidote The spiritual practice which is expulsion is because of abandoning defilement Spiritual practice is with the meaning of abandoning the acquisition of defilement The above grasp the possibility to cure and the possibility to abandon as spiritual practice now what is cured and what is abandoned are taken to be spiritual practice Depending on the four underneath sentences it is to be known  Concerning factors that are the spiritual practice which is obtaining and the spiritual practice which is development and no spiritual practice which is antidote or spiritual prac tice which is expulsion four sentences are to be made The first sentence are pure conditioned factors the second sentence are bad factors and neutral conditioned factors the third sentence are good impure factors  the fourth sentence are unconditioned factors Some say that there are six kinds of spiritual practice the previous four and the spiritual practice which is judgement and the spiritual practice which is concealment The spiritual practice which is judgement is as has been said in a sutra hair fur nails and teeth on this body it is to be compared in this way The spiritual practice which is concealment are the faculties as has been said subjecting the six faculties well In this way it is spoken of elaborately  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya In this way what is right are the four kinds of spiritual practice as has been said first These two kinds of spiritual practice are included in the spiritual practice which is expulsion and in the spiritual practice which is antidote The certain characteristic marks of the path of vision and of the spiritual path have already been spoken of Defilement circulating in the three realms is when to be abandoned through vision of two kinds Three kinds are with two forms of abandonment Both proceed before the path of vision When defilement is bound to the three realms and is to be abandoned through the path of vision it are the five views and perplexity What is proceeding before this path of vision is of two kinds the five views and perplexity are definitely to be abandoned before the path of vision attachment pride and ignorance are extinguished by vision and by both Although not destroyed in reality yet the name already includes all What accepts name according to vision is said to proceed previously Because underneath spiritual path does not wait for the path of vision they proceed before the spiritual path either to be abandoned through the path of vision or to be abandoned through the path of vision and through the spiritual path Which are to be abandoned through the path of vision When fetters are bound to the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification they are to be abandoned through the proximate patience of the faithfollower and of the doctrinefollower These fetters of the sphere of Investigations  neitheridentificationnornonidentification are spoken of because the stage is fixed the faithfollower and the doctrinefollower are spoken of because the person is fixed proximate patience is spoken of because the antidote is fixed abandonment is spoken of because that which is done is fixed Which are to be abandoned through the path of vision and through the spiritual path What is in eight stages and is to be abandoned by worldlings is to be abandoned through the spiritual path what is to be abandoned by noble persons is to be abandoned through the path of vision Question Why is abandoning defilement by worldlings absolutely the spiritual path Answer Worldlings cannot abandon defilement partially In this way is that which is to be abandoned through vision and in this way is that which is to be abandoned through spiritual practice Furthermore because worldlings cannot abandon nine forms with a path of one modes With the five modes in the three realms it are attachment pride and ignorance that are these three kinds which proceed before the path of vision They either are to be abandoned through the path of vision or to be abandoned through the spiritual path or to be abandoned through the path of vision and through the spiritual path When this defilement is bound to the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification it is to be abandoned through the proximate patience of the faithfollower and of the doctrinefollower and is to be abandoned through the path of vision What is to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the seeker with the path of vision of the ninth stage is to be  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya abandoned through the spiritual path In the other eight stages it is when to be abandoned by worldlings to be abandoned through the spiritual path and when to be abandoned by noble persons to be abandoned through the path of vision With the five modes of proceeding of the defilement of the realm of sexual passion there are two forms They are said to proceed before the spiritual path because of the limitedness of this spiritual practice With the five modes of proceeding of the realm of sexual passion they are since they proceed before the spiritual path twofold either to be abandoned through the spiritual path or to be abandoned through the path of vision and through the spiritual path When to be abandoned through the spiritual path of the seeker with the path of vision they are to be abandoned through the spiritual path The rest are when to be abandoned by worldlings to be abandoned through the spiritual path and when to be abandoned by noble persons to be abandoned through the path of vision Since these are sure to be abandoned previously they are said to proceed previously Question Before the conditions have been spoken of When do these conditions act Answer  What the condition as direct antecedent does is said to be at the moment a certain factor arises Investigations  The action the condition as supporting object does is said to be at the moment a certain factor extinguishes What the condition as direct antecedent does is said to be at the moment a certain factor arises The moment of arising is future Because of being together with proceeding it could also be said to be the moment of proceeding At the moment a certain factor arises it is the condition as direct antecedent that does action Because of the meaning of giving appearance it is said to be the condition as direct antecedent because when a certain factor arises appearance is acquired When stating that matter and all formations dissociated from awarenesses that also arise with this acquisition should be spoken of as conditions as direct antecedent this is not right This case has already been spoken of in the chapter Formations The action the condition as supporting object does is said to be at the moment a certain factor extinguishes At the moment a factor extinguishes it is the condition as supporting object that does action because at the moment a factor extinguishes it is present and can include an object it is not when future because of not being produced yet it is not when past because of already being extinguished S  The action three causes do is at the moment a certain factor arises Jt should be known that what two causes do is said to be at the moment of disappearance The action three causes do is at the moment a certain factor arises At the moment a factor arises three causes  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya do action the socalled homogeneous cause the pervasive cause and the cause of retribution Because of the power of the homogeneous cause what is similar is successive when a factor arises that is why the homogeneous cause does action at the moment a factor arises Because the pervasive cause and the cause of retribution are conformable to establishing arisen factors they do action at the moment these factors arise Spoken of generally it is therefore said that three causes do action at the moment a factor arises Exception made for the primary pure for the rest that is good and exception made for the retribution for the rest that is nonobscuredneutral it is the homogeneous cause that does action With what is defiled it are the homogeneous cause and the pervasive cause that do action With retribution it are the homogeneous cause and the cause of retribution that do action Tt should be known that what two causes do is said to be at the moment of disappearance At the moment a factor with supporting object  extinguishes it are the associated cause and the simultaneous cause that do action because the action is equal because of being one fruit The dissociated factors are the simultaneous cause The dominant condition abides in not being obstructed at any time That is why it is not spoken of because it does not wait to be spoken of The same applies to the efficient cause Question Are equal awarenesses produceddo equal awarenesses abide and do equal awarenesses disappear with all beings or not The reason this is asked is that there are beings whose body either is big or small Is it when the Investigations  body is big that the awarenesses are big and when the body is small that the awarenesses are small Is everything equally Moreover the going of beings is unequal as to speed Is it with a slow go that the awarenesses are siow and with a quick go that the awarenesses are quick or is it all equally Furthermore beings sometimes are equilibrium with a reasoning as a mountain and sometimes they are unstable and move as   flying dust Are the calm ones with slow awarenesses and the movable ones with quick awarenesses or is it all equally Answer  With genesis with duration and with disappearance the awarenesses of all beings are equal The same is true when they are associated with and dissociated from such as greed The awarenesses of all beings are equally produced abide equally and disappear equally The moment is without measure Because of being instantaneous There also is no size because of being immaterial Because what the four elements produce is varied the body has size When the body is light it is quick when the body is heavy it is slow Because awarenesses proceed in relation to many supporting objects wakefulness is movable when awarenesses abide in one supporting object mindfulness is equilibrium The same is true when they are associated with and dis Samyuktabhidharmahydaya sociated from such as greed Whether awarenesses are with greed or without greed all these awarenesses are produced together abide together and disappear together because of being instantaneous Because awarenesses with greed do no action being heavy is present because awarenesses without greed do action being light is present Up to being with disjunction and without disjunction all should be known Being with greed and being without greed are as has been said in the chapter Elements  Question Being produced together abiding together and disappearing together of the awarenesses of all beings is already spoken of regarding the state of being with intention How is the state of being without intention further Is it equally When entering the meditative attainment without conceptual identification or the one of cessation these awarenesses are extinguished and the awarenesses of other beings are produced With wakefulness from concentration the awarenesses of other beings are further extinguished when these awarenesses arise How it be equally Answer It should be known that as has been said concerning being with intention they are also equal for being without intention When entering the meditative attainment without conceptual identification or the one of cessation these awarenesses of other beings are produced and this ksana of first meditative attainment is also produced At the moment of wakefulness from concentration the awarenesses of other beings are extinguished and the meditative attainment later than this is also extinguished At the moment of abiding in concentration the awarenesses of other beings both are produced and extinguished and this mediInvestigations  tative attainment is both produced and extinguished There further is a saying that states that the production of every awareness is not definitely equal sometimes the awarenesses are produced and not extinguished Four sentences are to be made the first sentence is produced from the meditative attainment without conceptual identification or from the one of cessation the second Sentence is the moment of entering meditative attainment the third sentence is being with intention the fourth sentence is the moment of abiding in meditative attainment This is without size because there is no configuration The production and extinguishing of awarenesses has already been spoken of The wide meaning of awarenesses shall now be spoken of In the realm of sexual passion there are four in the one of form and in the one of formlessness each three Also the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept They arise in the succession they are spoken of In the realm of sexual passion there are four in the one of form and in the one of formlessness each three Also the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept There are twelve awarenesses the socalled good awarenesses bad awarenesses obscuredneutral awarenesses and nonobscuredneutral awarenesses bound to the realm of sexual passion the good awarenesses obscuredneutral awarenesses and nonobscuredneutral awarenesses bound to the realm of form the same applies to the realm of formlessness and the awareness of the seeker  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya and the awareness of the adept Question How are these twelve awarenesses established Answer They are established by being bound and being unbound realm and mode Being bound and being unbound establishes two awarenesses when differentiating being bound as to realm and mode ten awarenesses are established when differentiating being unbound as to mode two awarenesses are established That is why twelve awarenesses are spoken of They arise in the succession they are spoken of These awarenesses arise one by one in succession These awarenesses shall now be spoken of  Good ones of the realm of sexual passion make nine arise They are further also produced from eight Two defiled ones make four arise and have also arisen from ten awarenesses Good ones of the realm of sexual passion make nine arise In succession to the good awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion nine awarenesses arise Four of the realm of sexual passion because of the specific stage Good awarenesses of the realm of form because the moment of entering meditative attainment with primary effort follows This is a general saying not everything of the realm of form is concerned Moreover it is said that it is the pretrance and the first trance Moreover it is further said to be intermediate trance The venerable Ghosaka said it is up to the second trance To this the same apInvestigations  plies as to the transgressing meditative attainment produced from the first trance the second trance and its dependence are transgressed and the third trance is present of the realm of form at the moment of rearising At death with good awarenesses these defiled awarenesses arise successively The same applies to the defiled awarenesses of the realm of formlessness And the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept because these also are following Nonobscuredneutral awarenesses of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness are not present successively because awarenesses are bound to the specific stage Good ones of the realm of formlessness are also not present because of being extremely remote from one another They are further also produced from eight Good awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion also arise successively to eight awarenesses Four of the realm of sexual passion because of the specific stage Of the realm of form it are the good ones and the defiled ones The good awarenesses are as has been said previously the defiled ones are defiled by the defilement of the stage of the first trance exactly because of depending on the protection of the good awarenesses of the realm of form Produced from the awareness of the seeker and from the one of the adept the good awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion are present Two defiled ones make four arise In succession to the bad awarenesses and the obscuredneutral awarenesses of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the realm of sexual passion four awarenesses of the specific realm arise It does not concern a higher stage because of being contrary And have also arisen from ten awarenesses These two b forms of defiled awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion arise successively to ten awarenesses the four of the specific realm and the six of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness at the moment of rearising In succession to neutral ones seven arise They are further also produced from five Good ones of the realm of form are with eleven These have also arisen from nine awarenesses In succession to neutral ones seven arise In succession to the nonobscuredneutral awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion seven awarenesses arise the four of the specific realm the good ones what arises successively to magic awareness and the obscuredneutral ones at the moment of rearising of the realm of form and also the obscuredneutral awarenesses of the realm of formlessness They are further also produced from five The nonobscured neutral awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion successively arise from five awarenesses the four of the specific realm and what magic awareness successively atises to the good ones of the realm of form Good ones of the realm of form are with eleven In succession to the good awareness of the realm of form eleven awarenesses arise exception made for the nonobscuredneutral awarenesses of the realm of formlessness These have also arisen from nine awarenesses The good awarenesses of the realm of form successively arise Investigations  from nine awarenesses exception made for the two defiled awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion and for the nonobscuredneutral awarenesses of the realm of formlessness Defiled ones of the realm of form are with six They are also produced from eight awarenesses In succession to the neutral ones six arise They have successively arisen Srom three Defiled ones of the realm of form are with six In succession to the obscuredneutral awarenesses of the realm of form six awarenesses arise the three of the specific realm and three of the realm of sexual passion exception made for the nonobscuredneutral ones of the realm of sexual passion They are also produced from eight awarenesses The obscuredneutral awarenesses of the realm of form successively arise from eight awarenesses exception made for the two defiled ones of the realm of sexual passion and for the two pure ones In succession to the neutral ones six arise In succession to nonobscuredneutral awarenesses of the realm of form six awarenesses arise the three of the specific realm the two defiled ones of the realm of sexual passion and the defiled ones of the realm of formlessness They have successively arisen from three They successively arise from the three awarenesses of the specific realm Good ones of the one of formlessness make nine arise They are also produced from six awarenesses  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Defiled awarenesses make seven arise They also have arisen from seven Good ones of the one of formlessness make nine arise In succession to the good awarenesses of the realm of formlessness nine awarenesses arise exception made for the good and the nonobscuredneutral awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion and for the nonobscuredneutral awarenesses of the realm of form They are also produced from six awarenesses The good awarenesses of the realm of formlessness also successively arise from six awarenesses the three of the specific realm the good ones of the realm of form and the two pure ones Defiled awarenesses make seven arise In succession to the defiled awarenesses of the realm of formlessness seven awarenesses arise the three of the specific realm the good awarenesses and the defiled ones of the realm of form and the two defiled awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion They also have arisen from seven The obscuredneutral awarenesses of the realm of formlessness also successively arise from seven awarenesses the three of the specific realm and the good and the nonobscuredneutral awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion and of the one of form  Neutral awarenesses make six arise They are further also produced from three The awareness of the seeker makes five arise It has also arisen from four awarenesses Neutral awarenesses make six arise In succession to the nonobscuredneutral awarenesses of the realm of formlessInvestigations  ness six awarenesses arise the three of the specific realm and three defiled ones of lower realms They are further also produced from three The nonobscuredneutral awarenesses of the realm of formlessness successively arise from the three awarenesses of the specific realm because they are not counted as a retribution of something else The awareness of the seeker makes five arise In succession to the awareness of the seeker five awarenesses arise the two pure ones and the good awarenesses of the three realms no defiled ones because the natures are contrary to one another no nonobscuredneutral ones because their nature is not intense Tt has also arisen from four awarenesses The awareness of the seeker also successively arises from four awarenesses exactly the awareness of the seeker and the good awarenesses of the three realms not the one of the adept because of being its cause Neither is it something else as has been said before  The awareness of the adept makes four arise It has also arisen from five awarenesses Twelve awarenesses have already been spoken of Twenty have to be spoken of The awareness of the adept makes four arise In succession to the awareness of the adept four awarenesses arise exactly the awareness of the adept and the good awarenesses of the three realms not the one of the seeker because of being its fruit as has been said before Tt has also arisen from five awarenesses the awareness of the adept successively arises from five awarenesses the  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya two pure ones and the good awarenesses of the three realms Twelve awarenesses have already been spoken of Twenty have to be spoken of  The successive arising of twelve awarenesses has already been spoken of Now shall be said that when differentiating these twelve awarenesses twenty are formed   Two good ones two defiled ones the ones arisen through retribution and the ones relating to deportment the ones of craftsmanship and the fruit of trance There are eight awarenesses in the realm of sexual passion The realm of sexual passion is with eight awarenesses good awarenesses arisen through application and good ones acquired by genesis bad ones obscuredneutral ones and nonobscuredneutral ones  the ones arisen by retribution the ones relating to deportment the ones of craftsmanship and magic awareness Exception made for the bad ones and for the ones of craftsmanship the rest abide in the realm of form Free from the fruit of trance and from the ones relating to deportment the other four abide in the one of formlessness Exception made for the bad ones and for the ones of craftsmanship the rest abide in the realm of form The Investigations  a realm of form has six awarenesses exception made for the bad ones and for the ones of craftsmanship The rest is as has been said before Free from the fruit of trance and from the ones relating to deportment the other four abide in the one of formlessness The realm of formlessness has four awarenesses exception made for the ones relating to deportment and for magic awareness In the realm of form and in the one of formlessness the ones of craftsmanship are excluded because of being without activity Bad ones are excluded because of being free from shamelessness and disregard In the realm of formlessness the ones relating to deportment are excluded because what comes or goes is not being part of it Magic awareness is excluded because the trances that include members are not being part of it  With the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept these form twenty The successive arising of these awarenesses is to be spoken of each according to its meaning With the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept these form twenty With the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept and the previous eighteen this forms twenty awarenesses Being bound and being unbound realm and mode are differentiated Previously this difference has been spoken of in general The good ones and the nonobscuredneutral ones are now also differentiated as to mode The successive arising of these awarenesses is to be spoken of each according to its meaning The successive  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya arising when proceeding of these awarenesses shall now be spoken of The ones arisen through application of the one of sexual passion make ten arise They are also produced from eight awarenesses In succession to the ones acquired by genesis nine arise These have also arisen from eleven The ones arisen through application of the one of sexual passion make ten arise In succession to the good awarenesses arisen through application of the realm of sexual passion ten awarenesses arise seven of the specific realm exception made for magic awareness because these arise in succession to the clean trance the good awarenesses arisen through application of the realm of form and the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept They have also arisen from eight awarenesses These good awarenesses arisen through application of the realm of sexual passion successively arise from eight awarenesses the two good awarenesses and the two defiled awarenesses of the specific realm the good awarenesses arisen through application and the defiled awarenesses of the realm of form and the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept In succession to the ones acquired by genesis nine arise In succession to the good awarenesses acquired by genesis of the realm of sexual passion nine awarenesses arise seven of the specific realm exception made for magic awareness and the defiled awarenesses of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness These have also arisen from eleven The good awarenesses acquired by genesis of the realm of sexual passion Investigations  successively arise from eleven awarenesses seven of the specific realm as has been said previously the good awarenesses arisen through application and the defiled awarenesses of the realm of form and the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept Two defiled ones make seven arise They are also produced from fourteen The ones arisen by retribution and the ones relating to deportment are with eight These have also arisen from seven Two defiled ones make seven arise In succession to the bad ones and to the obscuredneutral ones of the realm of sexual passion seven awarenesses of the specific realm arise exception made for magic awareness These two defiled ones successively arise from fourteen awarenesses seven of the specific realm exception made for magic awareness four kinds of the realm of form exception made for the good awarenesses arisen through application and for magic awareness and three of the realm of formlessness exception made for the good awarenesses arisen through application The ones arisen by retribution and the ones relating to deportment are with eight In succession to the ones arisen by retribution and the ones relating to deportment of the realm of sexual passion eight awarenesses arise six of the specific realm exception made for the good awarenesses arisen through application and for magic awareness and the defiled awarenesses of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness These have also arisen from seven These awarenesses  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya arisen by retribution and the ones relating to deportment of the realm of sexual passion have also successively arisen from seven awarenesses of the specific realm exception made for magic awareness  The awarenesses of craftsmanship make six arise They are further also produced from seven Magic awareness makes two arise It has also exactly arisen from two The awarenesses of craftsmanship make six arise In succession to the awarenesses of craftsmanship of the realm of sexual passion six awarenesses of the specific realm arise exception made for the good awarenesses arisen through application and for magic awareness They have further also arisen from seven These also successively arise from seven awarenesses of the specific realm exception made for magic awareness Magic awareness makes two arise In succession to magic awareness of the realm of sexual passion two awarenesses arise magic awareness of the realm of sexual passion and the good awarenesses arisen through application of the realm of form It has also exactly arisen from two It also successively arises from exactly these two awarenesses The ones arisen through application of the one of form are with twelve These are also produced from ten Jn succession to the ones acquired by genesis eight arise They have alse arisen from five awarenesses Investigations  The ones arisen through application of the one of form are with twelve In succession to the good awarenesses arisen through application of the realm of form twelve awarenesses arise the six of the specific realm three of the realm of sexual passion the good awarenesses arisen through application the good awarenesses acquired by genesis and magic awareness the good awarenesses arisen through application of the realm of formlessness and the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept These are also produced from ten The good awarenesses arisen through application of the realm of form successively arise from ten awarenesses four of the specific realm exception made for the ones relating to deportment and for the ones arisen by retribution two of the realm of sexual passion the good awarenesses arisen through application and magic awareness two of the realm of formlessness the good awarenesses arisen through application and the defiled awarenesses and the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept In succession to the ones acquired by genesis eight arise In succession to the good awarenesses acquired by genesis of the realm of form eight awarenesses arise five of the specific realm exception made for magic awareness two defiled awarenesses of the realm of sexual passion and the defiled awarenesses of the realm of formlessness They have also arisen from five awarenesses Good awarenesses acquired by genesis of the realm of form have successively arisen from five awarenesses of the specific realm exception made for magic awareness The defiled ones of the one of form make nine arise  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya They are also produced from eleven The awarenesses relating to deportment make seven arise They successively arise from five The defiled ones of the one of form make nine arise In succession to the defiled awarenesses of the realm of form nine awarenesses arise five of the specific realm exception made for magic awareness and four of the realm of sexual passion two good ones and two defiled ones They are also produced from eleven The defiled awarenesses of the realm of form successively arise from eleven awarenesses five of the specific realm exception made for magic awareness three of the realm of sexual passion the good ones acquired by genesis the ones relating to deportment and the ones arisen by retribution and three of the realm of formlessness exception made for the good awarenesses arisen through application The awarenesses relating to deportment make seven arise In succession to the awarenesses relating to deportment of the realm of form seven awarenesses arise four of the specific realm exception made for the good awarenesses arisen through application and for magic awareness two defiled ones of the realm of sexual passion and the defiled ones of the realm of formlessness They successively arise from five The awarenesses relating to deportment of the realm of form successively arise from five awarenesses of the specific realm exception made for magic awareness It should be known that also the ones  arisen by retribution of the one of form are said to be as the ones relating to deportment The fruit of trance Investigations  should be known as in the realm of sexual passion It should be known that also the ones arisen by retribution of the one of form are said to be as the ones relating to deportment In succession to the awarenesses arisen by retribution of the realm of form seven awarenesses arise and they have also arisen from five awarenesses as has been said with the ones relating to deportment The fruit of trance should be known as in the realm of sexual passion In succession to magic awareness of the realm of form two awarenesses arise the good awarenesses arisen through application and magic awareness of the realm of form They also arise successively from exactly these two awarenesses The first of the one of formlessness make seven arise They have also arisen from six The ones acquired by genesis also make seven arise It should be known that they are produced from four The first of the one of formlessness make seven arise In succession to the good awarenesses arisen through application of the realm of formlessness seven awarenesses arise the four of the specific realm the good awarenesses arisen through application of the realm of form and the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept They have also arisen from six The good awarenesses arisen through application of the realm of formlessness successively arise from six awarenesses three of the specific realm exception made for the ones arisen by retribution the good awarenesses arisen through application of the  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya realm of form and the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept The ones acquired by genesis also make seven arise In succession to the good awarenesses acquired by genesis of the realm of formlessness also seven awarenesses arise the four of the specific realm and the three defiled ones of lower realms Tt should be known that they are produced from four These successively arise from the four awarenesses of the specific realm  The defiled ones make eight awarenesses arise They are produced from ten awarenesses The awarenesses by retribution make six arise They have also arisen from four The defiled ones make eight awarenesses arise In succession to the defiled awarenesses of the realm of formlessness eight awarenesses arise the four of the specific realm the two defiled ones of the realm of sexual passion the good awarenesses arisen through application and the defiled awarenesses of the realm of form They are produced from ten awarenesses The defiled a warenesses of the realm of formlessness successively arise from ten awarenesses the four of the specific realm three of the realm of sexual passion the good ones acquired by genesis the ones relating to deportment and the ones arisen by retribution the same applies to the realm of form The awarenesses by retribution make six arise In succession to the awarenesses by retribution of the realm of formlessness six awarenesses arise three of the specific realm exception made for the good awarenesses arisen Investigations  through application and the three defiled awarenesses of lower stages  They have also arisen from four These awarenesses arisen by retribution successively arise from the four awarenesses of the specific realm In succession to the awareness of the seeker six arise It is successively produced from four The awareness of the adept makes five arise It has also arisen from five In succession to the awareness of the seeker six arise In succession to the awareness of the seeker six awarenesses arise the good awarenesses arisen through application of the three realms the good ones acquired by genesis of the realm of sexual passion since good ones acquired by genesis of the realm of sexual passion are strong they are keen since two realms are weak they are minor and the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept It is successively produced from four The awareness of the seeker successively arises from four awarenesses the good awarenesses arisen through application of the three realms and the awareness of the seeker The awareness of the adept makes five arise In succession to the awareness of the adept five awarenesses arise the good awarenesses arisen through application of the three reams the good ones acquired by genesis of the realm of sexual passion and the awareness of the adept It has also arisen from five awarenesses The good awarenesses arisen through application of the three realms and the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question Why is it that in succession to the good awarenesses arisen through application the ones relating to deportment the ones of craftsmanship and the awarenesses arisen by retribution arise and why do all these awarenesses successively make no good awarenesses arisen through application arise Answer Because the ones relating to deportment and the ones of craftsmanship are made by that which is pleasant for oneself because the awarenesses arisen by retribution are weak because of not being active Because the awarenesses relating to deportment find satisfaction with the practice of deportment therefore successively no good awarenesses arisen through application are produced Because the awarenesses of renunciation do not do zealous effort In succession to the good awarenesses arisen through application the awarenesses relating to deportment arise The same applies to the awarenesses of craftsmanship Because the awarenesses arisen by retribution are weak because of not being active and because of being that which is sown by former action is therefore impossible for the one who enters these awarenesses Because the awarenesses of renunciation do not do zealous effort They are what successively arises from the good awarenesses arisen through application When stating that the defiled awarenesses find satisfaction in attachment to objects and that because of being weak no good awarenesses arisen through application should successively arise from the object of defiled awarenesses this is not right Because the object is not different because of seeing the mistake because of not being weak When regarding this object a mistake proceeds it exactly is that qualities are produced That is why its object is not Investigations  different since it is because defilement is exhausted regarding these formations that exactly in relation to this object arising of practising defilement during a long time is understood The defiled awarenesses are not weak That is why these should successively make the good awarenesses arisen through application arise Although the good awarenesses acquired by genesis of the realm of sexual passion are intense they are not with effort Because they are intense they successively arise from the good awarenesses arisen through application of the realm of form and from the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept Because of not being with effort they cannot make these awarenesses successively arise The good awarenesses acquired by genesis of the realm of form neither are intense nor with effort Because of not being intense they do not successively arise from the awareness of the seeker and the one of the adept and from the good awarenesses arisen through application of the realm of formlessness Because of not being with effort they do not make these awarenesses successively arise The same applies to the realm of formlessness In succession to the defiled awarenesses of the realm of form the good awarenesses acquired by genesis of the realm of sexual passion arise because of being intense The defiled awarenesses of the realm of formlessness do successively not make the awarenesses acquired by genesis of the realm of form arise because of not being intense Question What is the right doctrine Answer  Scriptural texts Vinaya and Abhidharma are called the conventional right doctrine  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya The thirtyseven classes of enlightenment are said to be the highest truth Scriptiral texts Vinaya and Abhidharma are called the conventional right doctrine Sutra Vinaya and Abhidharma is the teaching of the right doctrine because of being produced depending on names as substratum It has been said already previously that the Buddhaword is with the specific nature of speech Words proceed depending on names Because of proceeding with something else as substratum they are therefore called worldly business Because of manifesting the highest truth they are called right doctrine because the meaning is manifested by means of names The thirtyseven classes of enlightenment are the right doctrine as highest truth because of being produced free from names Although impure wisdom through personal realisation proceeds free from names it is not said to be the right doctrine as highest truth because of being with impurity Just as the right doctrine is twofold dealing with the doctrine is also twofold practising the doctrine and spiritual practice Practising the doctrine is practising by reciting spiritual practice is the development of trance This is worldly business The right doctrine is spiritual practice Doctrine is with the meaning of grasping The right doctrine as highest truth is spiritual practice That is why it is said that when the one who practises the doctrine abides then also the right doctrine abides and that when the devotee is extinguished then also the right doctrine is extinguished Investigations  Because the Worldhonoured One encourages the devotee no limitation is spoken of As has been said previously that the diamondlike samadhi shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Investigations this shall now be spoken of  Fiftytwo and the rest Further also eighty are spoken of Sometimes thirteen are spoken of This is the diamondlike samadhi Some say that there are fiftytwo diamondlike samddhis that are included in the pretrance When the fruit of arhatship is acquired depending on subsequent knowledge in relation to frustration of the pretrance this is regarding the indecision of impermanence frustration emptiness and nonself of the four aggregates of the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification  When acquired by subsequent knowledge in relation to the origin it is in relation to the indecision of the aspects one by one of the four aspects of the truth of the origin When through knowledge of the law in relation to cessation it regards the indecision of the four aspects which develops cessation of the truth of cessation bound to the realm of sexual passion When through knowledge of the law in relation to the path it regards the indecision of the four aspects of the truth of the path which abandons development of the path bound to the realm of sexual pas sion When through subsequent knowledge in relation to cessation it either is the indecision of the development of cessation bound to the stage of the first trance or up to the indecision of the development of cessa Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya tion bound to neitheridentificationnornonidentification When through subsequent knowledge in relation to the path it is acquisition of the fruit of arhatship regarding the indecision of the four aspects of the one of the path of the class of subsequent knowledge of these nine stages When in this way knowledge aspect and supporting object are differentiated there are fiftytwo because of being different from the one of frustration the one of cessation is different Because the cases are divided the observation is differentiated That is why the one of cessation of eight stages has thirtytwo aspects Combined with the previous sixteen aspects of the four noble truths is fiftytwo Up to the fourth trance the same applies as to the pretrance Because the one of formlessness is without knowledge of the law knowledge of the law takes the realm of sexual passion as supporting object not the one of formlessness The development of cessation in lower stages takes frustration of lower stages as supporting object because they are no objects and because the supporting object of Investigations  the antidote of lower stages is cause when proceeding Some say that in the pretrance there is an eightifold diamondlike samadhi The difference is that since subsequent knowledge in relation to the path also takes the antidote in the stages one by one as supporting object the acquisition of the fruit of arhatship is spoken of When the four aspects of every stage are observed with subsequent knowledge in relation to the path of seven stages  there are twentyeight Combined with the previous fiftytwo is eighty Up to the fourth trance the same applies as to the pretrance The sphere of unlimited space is with forty the sphere of unlimited consciousness is with thirtytwo the sphere of nothingness is with twentyfour The venerable Ghosaka said that the diamondlike samadhi included in the pretrance is with thirteen the four samadhis associated with four subsequent patiences of the path of vision and the nine samddhis associated with the nine proximate paths of being with nonattachment of a neitheridentificationnornonidentification of the spiritual path These are all diamondlike samadhi as antidote summit of existence because it is no object for the worldly path The same applies up to the fourth trance The sphere of unlimited space is with nine The same applies up to the sphere of nothingness This is a general saying When saying that the difference in patience knowledge aspect mode and supporting object is included in the pretrance then the diamondlike samadhi is of one thousand four hundred ninetytwo forms The same applies up to the fourth trance The sphere of unlimited space is with four hundred sixtyeight the sphere of unlimited consciousness is with three hundred twentyfour the  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya sphere of nothingness is with two hundred sixteen Question Are all higher faculties of the higher faculties spoken of in the chapter Knowledge good or not Answer  Three higher faculties are said to be good The other two are neutral It should be known that they depend on the one of sexual passion and on the one of form The Worldhonoured One said that they are with the nature of wisdom Three higher faculties are said to be good The footing of supernatural power as knowledge the knowledge of the mental makeup of others and the knowledge of former existences these three higher faculties are said to be good Because of the desired fruit because of being produced by extreme effort because of subjecting something else because they let those who do not find satisfaction with faith find satisfaction with faith These three higher faculties let joy be because they let something else be extremely subjected Wisdom associated with goodminded awarenesses is good because of being associated with awarenesses of faith The other two are neutral Moreover they are neutral because they are produced regarding experiencing matter and sound Answer It should be known that they depend on the one of sexual passion and on the one of form The Worldhonoured One said that they are with the nature of wisdom These higher faculties are only present in the realm of sexual passion and in the one of form because of depending on matter and because this is first produced in the realm of sexual passion and later can be present in the realm of form These are not the competence of the beginner because of not being part of it They are with the nature of wisdom because of being produced from differentiating because the basis forms that which depends this explains eye in the name of a higher faculty because of being produced depending on the eye As has been said in the Karanaprajnaptisutra At that very moment the eye that is formed by the four elements of the realm of form is round and the divine eye is clean As it has been said in the chapter Sutra that the faculties shall be spoken of elaborately as to actual entities in the chapter called Investigations this shall now be spoken of  It should be known that the faculties have been differentiated well by the Wise One In name there are twentytwo The actual entities are said to be seventeen With the faculties spoken of by Buddha there are twentytwo names and there are seventeen actual entities because the male and the female faculty and the three pure faculties are without separate actual entity they do not es Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya tablish an actual entity because of being included in other faculties Because the male and the female faculty do not exist free from the faculty body That is why it is said I ask what the male faculty is It is one part of the faculty body The same applies to the female faculty Moreover because one form of consciousness depends on  When consciousness is produced depending on the faculty body it exactly is depending on the male and on the female faculty There is no faculty with other characteristic marks that together makes one form of consciousness arise Because the three pure faculties are settled in combination with nine faculties the nine faculties are the faculty mind the faculty satisfaction the faculty contentedness the faculty equanimity and such five faculties as faith With these nine faculties three faculties are established because of the difference tween path and person When differentiated as to path the path of vision is said to concern the faculty I shall come to understand the not yet understood the spiritual path is said to concern the faculty of understanding the path of the adept is said to concern the faculty of one who has fully understood When differentiated as to person the faithfollower and the doctrinefollower are said to concern the faculty I shall come to understand the not yet understood the one given to faith the viewattainer and the eyewitness are said to concern the faculty of understanding the one liberated through wisdom and the twicedelivered one are said to concern the faculty of one who has fully understood Question Which characteristic marks do the conventional and the highest truth have Investigations  Answer When at the moment that things are differentiated names are to be abandoned then something is said to be conventional If when differentiating there is nothing that is to be abandoned this is the highest truth because no certain things can be acquired Just as at the moment of differentiating a jar in matter smell taste and the tangible the name jar is abandoned there is no more the name jar when abandoning matter smell taste and the tangible This is why it is called conventional thing Everything is in this way  If when differentiating there is nothing that is to be a bandoned this is the highest truth When at the moment of differentiating things there is no abandoning of names this is the highest truth Just as the five appropriating aggregates are called truth of frustration even at the moment one differentiates the five things the name frustration is not abandoned because matter is frustra Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya tion Up to consciousness it is also in this way This matter further is of eleven forms All sense are one by one with frustration Even up to the moment of differentiating them as to ksanas and atoms the name frustration is not to be abandoned because of the acquisition of these characteristic marks Everything is in this way As it has been said in the chapter Miscellany the intermediate existence shall be spoken of elaborately in the chapter Investigations Question Is it fixed or unfixed Answer  The realms courses and stages are definitely fixed The intermediate existence is with the five It is unresisting It is said to be called smell as nutriment seeking for existence and undertaking mental formations The realms courses and stages are definitely fixed The realms courses and stages of the intermediate existence do not proceed The intermediate existence of the realm of sexual passion definitely arises in the realm of sexual passion of the realm of form it arises in the realm of form In this way of the course hell it arises in hell up to of the  course humans it arises with humans Of the gods of the group of the Four Great Kings it arises with the gods of the group of the Four Great Kings The same applies up to the akanisthagods The intermediate existence is with the five Intermediate existence is with the nature of the five aggregates Investigations  because there is coming and going It is not so that free from matter there is coming and going That is why the realm of sexual passion and the one of form have intermediate existence not the realm of formlessness because matter is not being part of it It is unresisting Because of atoms every configuration cannot be obstructed by obstruction Because of the power action there is abiding in the womb If it were different there would be no abiding in the womb It is said to be called smell as nutriment seeking for existence and undertaking mental formations Because smell is taken as nutriment smell as nutriment is spoken of Either the one with thin merit eats filthy smells or the one with great power eats clean smells Because of seeking for the existence at rearising seeking for existence is spoken of Because of arising from the mind undertaking mental formations is spoken of These beings either arise through action hell as has been said These beings are bound by their actions or arise through defilement the gods of the realm of form and of the one of formlessness the first humans of a kalpa what is created and intermediate existence Because it is free from the courses since it is produced in between two forms of existence it therefore is said to be intermediate existence Question With how many moments of abiding is the intermediate existence Answer  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Seven days Or seven times seven Up to reaching its combination Sometimes it is naked Seven days Some say that the intermediate existence is abiding seven days because the body is weak Question When they are combined it has to be this way How should death of this person be when his father and mother are at a different place Answer It has to be observed whether the action of these beings proceeds or does not proceed If it can proceed regarding the mother and cannot proceed regarding the father this father will then make the intermediate existence unite from another woman The same applies to the ability to proceed regarding the father as supporting object If both cannot proceed they are combined first when this person has not died yet This is speaking of the ones who permanently practise attachment With the ones who occasionally practise because of the action of these beings as reason one has to let them also practise at the wrong time Some say that sometimes there is arising in a similar condition because when the moment of having to arise is not the moment of the fact of this behaviour there is arising in a similar condition of permanent behaviour It is spoken of according to the species Seven times seven Some say that it is abiding seven times seven days Up to reaching its combination It is further said that it is unfixed as long as there is no combination yet there is permanent abiding in between Investigations  Question Is the intermediate existence with dress or without dress Answer Sometimes it is naked because in the realm of form there is increase of shame and modesty just as the doctrinal body is not naked the same is true for the physical body The intermediate existence of the bodhisattvas and of the white bhiksunis of the realm of sexual passion is with dress with other beings it is without dress because there is no increase of shame and modesty Question With which nutriment is the intermediate existence Answer It is with smell as nutriment That the intermediate existence of the realm of sexual passion takes smell as nutriment has been said already before The realm of form is free from solid food because there is greed in relation to bodily moleculity There are only three kinds of nutriment Question Are all faculties supplied or not The intermediate existence is supplied with all faculties Because the intermediate existence as retribution is intense Moreover because these beings are seeking for existence there is permanent seeking for existence regarding the categories of the six senses Question How is the configuration made Answer  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  It is according to movement The measure is unfixed Sometimes it has vision sometimes no vision The descent is from the gate of birth Sometimes arising is with overturned conceptual identification It is according to movement Each according to its course the intermediate existence in hell is as the configuration of hell up to humans and gods that are with the configuration of humans and of gods Question With which movement is the intermediate existence and how is the measure of the body Answer Movement and measure are unfixed Movement and measure of the body of the intermediate existence are unfixed The intermediate existence in hell moves with the feet up and with the head down the intermediate existence with gods is with the upper part upright as an arrow shoots in the sky the other forms of intermediate existence are with the body that moves on its size just as a painted man flies The measure  the measure of the intermediate existence in the realm of form is as the existence at former time the intermediate existence of the Bodhisattva of the realm of sexual passion is also as the existence at former time thirtytwo characteristic marks decorate his body that is why the intermediate existence of the Bodhisattva is with a dignity that shines in one hundred times a hundred times a thousand worlds Stating that the body of a white elephant enters the womb is not right because of already being free from animal birth the Bodhisattva Investigations  comes from ninetyone kalpas and is permanently free from animal birth Because of being described as to characteristic marks one lets the mother of the Bodhisattva see such a dream The measure of the body of the intermediate existence of other beings of the realm of sexual passion is as the configuration of a small child with knowledge because its faculties are keen Descent into the womb is with overturned conceptual identification Question Do one form of intermediate existence and another form of intermediate existence see one another or not Answer Sometimes it has vision sometimes no vision Sometimes the intermediate existence is the object for intermediate existence it is not always Some say that the intermediate existence in hell sees the intermediate existence in hell and that all are in this way Moreover it is said that the intermediate existence in hell sees the intermediate existence in hell that animal birth sees two courses that ghosts see three courses that humans see four courses and that gods see five courses The eye of the existence at rearising does not see them When the divine eye is extremely clean it can see  Question From which place is the descent into the womb Answer The descent is from the gate of birth One descents from the gate of birth That is why with twins the one growing in the back is the oldest Question With which conceptual identification is the descent into the womb Answer Sometimes arising is with overturned conceptual identification Not all beings have a descent into the  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya womb with overturned conceptual identification exception has to be made for the bodhisattva who abides close to the Buddhastage This bodhisattva who abides close to the Buddhastage has the conceptual identification of mother regarding the mother and the conceptual identification of father regarding the father With all other beings the descent into the womb is with overturned conceptual identification With a masculine intermediate existence there is defiled conceptual identification regarding the mother and conceptual identification of hatred regarding the father One makes this reflection If it were not for this man there would be unity with this woman One makes the conceptual identification of seeing this man gone and being united with this woman The moment of seeing this essence exactly is with the arising of joy for the own existence Because joy arises the aggregates become thick gradually After the aggregates have become thick gradually one is sitting kneeled in the direction of the back leaning on the right side of the mother When feminine it is spoken of in the opposite way The reasons for intermediate existence shall be spoken of later  Heart of Scholasticism with Miscellaneous Additions volume ten Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Heart of Scholasticism with Miscellaneous Additions Volume Eleven Investigations part two Composed by the venerable Dharmatrata Translated by the Indian Tripitaka Samghavarman of the Sung and others Question What are the factor knowledge the factor consciousness and the factor understanding Answer Knowledge is in relation to all factors The same is true for consciousness and understanding Knowledge consciousness of the mind and understanding are each spoken of according to their actual entities This knowledge of frustration knows frustration up to knowledge of the path knows the path Pure knowledge is because of being with a segmented supporting object Good conventional knowledge also knows frustration up to space calculated and uncalculated cessation because of generally taking all factors as supporting object Consciousness is also conscious of all factors This consciousness of the eye is conscious of matter up to consciousness of the body is conscious of the tangible be Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya cause of grasping specific characteristic marks Consciousness of the mind is consciousness of the eye of matter and of consciousness of the eye All are in this way because of the general supporting object Understanding also understands all factors according to their actual entities This patience of frustration and knowledge of frustration understand frustration up to patience of the path and knowledge of the path understand the path because of being with a segmented supporting object Also goodimpure wisdom understands frustration up to space and uncalculated cessation Question How are kalpas surpassed Answer  Sword sickness and famine are said to be called surpassing an intermediate kalpa With the exception of earth the other three elements are said to be called surpassing a great kalpa Sword sickness and famine are said to be called surpassing an intermediate kalpa The threefold surpassing of an intermediate kalpa concerns sword sickness and famine A kalpa of the sword is up to reaching the moment that the duration of life of humans is ten years with greed for coarse objects and practising false doctrines each abides in malicious awarenesses with the hands they grasp grasses and trees making these to swords and kill one another When in this way seven days have passed this is surpassing an intermediate kalpa of the sword A kalpa of sickness also concerns the moment that the duration of life is ten years there are many kinds of sickInvestigations  ness and there is no doctor who prescribes medicine to cure the diseases Because of thin merit the fool has a disease and dies abruptly When in this way seven months and seven days have passed this is surpassing an intermediate kalpa of sickness A kalpa of famine also concerns the moment that the duration of life is ten years hunger and thirst are dominant and the body is extremely weak The whole sky is hot and seeds and sprouts are not harvested one counts the grains of rice to eat them and cooks human bones to drink its juice When in this way seven years seven months and seven days have passed this is surpassing an intermediate kalpa of famine Spoken of in this way when in the present period of time the moral precept of not killing is kept during one day and night there finally is no arising in this kalpa of the sword Because of giving with one fruit of the Myrobalantree to the field of merit that is the samgha there finally is no arising in this kalpa of sickness When giving one meal to the field of merit that is the samgha there finally is no arising in this kalpa of famine These bad kalpas of Jambudvipa are present alternatively In other places there scarcely is what is similar as the kalpa of the sword is produced there this only is hatred that is dominant as the kalpa of sickness is produced there this only is being with weak and little power as the kalpa of famine is produced there this only is increase of hunger and thirst Question How is surpassing a great kalpa Answer With the exception of earth the other three elements are said to be called surpassing a great kalpa Three elements are said to be surpassing a great kalpa Because of not being sharp What is sharp breaks a great kalpa Furthermore when the element earth were to break a kalpa the broken kalpa would have to go up to the fourth trance and the fourth trance has never been reached yet Question Why does a broken kalpa not reach the fourth trance Answer Because of the gods of the clean residences They are without arising in a higher stage because they are exactly with this parinirvana  They also do not arise lower because lower stages are with uncalculated cessation That when they abide they pass through a broken kalpa also is not right because it is the power of dominant merit that made them arise in these residences because inward distraction is not being part of it c When in relation to this stage there were inward distraction then outward there would be disaster Because this first trance inward has the distraction of the fire of initial thought and sustained thought outward it is with being burnt by the destruction by fire Because the second trance inward has the distraction of the water of joy outward it is with being drowned by the destruction by water Because the third trance inward has the distraction of the wind of breathing in and breathing out outward it is with being destroyed by the destruction by wind Question The fourth trance has never had distraction yet How does it acquire impermanence Answer Because it is broken by the impermanence of being instantaneous It is spoken of in this way The stage of the fourth trance is not definitely successive According to its Investigations  arising with the gods palaces are produced together At death with the gods these also go down together Question Which destruction of a kalpa is first Answer  The surpassing that is successive to seven times the one by fire is one destruction by water With seven times seven the one by fire and seven times the one by water there further is the one by wind after seven more times the one by fire What is produced in succession to seven times the one by fire is the first production of a kalpa of fire Spoken of in this way it is stated that when a kalpa of fire shall be produced the duration of life of humans at that very moment is eighty thousand years Death in hell is without further rearising it should be known that when a kalpa is destroyed it is up to not having one being who abides in hell this is called the destruction of a kalpa of hell To animal birth and ghosts the same applies as to the destruction of a kalpa of hell When animals have a function regarding humans it is destroyed together with humans At that moment there is only one person in Jambudvipa who can enter the first trance without dispensation When raising the sound of singing after being produced from the first trance there is satisfaction in an extreme way as one is free from the arising of joy When in this way the sound develops there is telling one another in the whole Jambudvipa All other beings also enter the first trance without instruc Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya tor who instructs up to not having one being who abides in Jambudvipa This is called the destruction of a kalpa of Jambudvipa Only exception made for Uttarakuru all good courses of the realm of sexual passion are further also in this way death in Uttarakuru is without the one who acquires trance because nonattachment is not being part of it Moreover at that moment one being of the first trance does not have dispensation and enters the second trance When raising the sound of singing after being produced from trance joy is sure to arise and there is satisfaction in an extreme way The sound in this way reaches all the gods of brahmas group Other beings are further also in this way up to no being abides in the first trance This is called the destruction of the kalpa of the world of beings At that moment the world is one long space up to seven suns come up Question From which place do they come up Answer Some say that at the moment a kalpa is settled seven suncircles abide behind the Yugamdhara Mountain and that they come up from there Some say that one sun is divided into seven parts Some further say that one sun is sevenfold hot Some further say that it arises from the fire of Avicihell Spoken of in this way the insentient universe is produced as dominant fruit because of the power action of a beings When this action is destroyed distraction arises in this way the same applies up to the burning of gods of brahmas group The surpassing successive to seven times the one by fire is one destruction by water After surpassing seven destructions by fire there is one destruction by waInvestigations  ter up to breaking the second trance Question From which place is water produced Answer Some say that it rains warm rain of dust from the third trance Some further say that it is driven from a watercircle The production of distraction is as has been said previously With seven times seven the one by fire and seven times the one by water The surpassing successive to seven destructions by fire is one destruction by water Seven times seven such a destruction by fire is one time seven destructions by water There further is the one by wind after seven more times the one by fire Later after surpassing seven more destructions by fire there is one destruction by wind The destruction by water and the destruction by wind are successively produced from the destruction by fire This is spoken of well The entirely magnificent ones are with a duration of life of sixtyfour kalpas What is drowned by the destruction by water is when reaching the second trance What is broken by the destruction by wind is when reaching the third trance The one hundred times one hundred times one thousand four worlds are simultaneously broken In nineteen intermediate kalpas the world is emptied in one intermediate kalpa the insentient universe is broken in one intermediate kalpa the insentient universe is settled in nineteen intermediate kalpas there was gradual and successive abiding When a residence originally is empty this residence eventually is abiding when a residence eventually is empty this residence originally was abiding   Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Question How is the mind disturbed Answer By disturbance by retribution of former action by fear and by calamity For dismemberment of the limbs the Noble has been speaking about water fire and wind By disturbance by retribution of former action by fear and by calamity The mind is disturbed by four reasons disturbance of the four elements retribution of former action fear and calamity of the body Disturbance of the four elements is that the four elements are disturbed because beverage and nutriment are unfit Because the four elements are disturbed they let the mind be disturbed Retribution of former action is the maturation after the retribution of action that has originally disturbed the mind Question What is this Answer Liking to give decay and misfortune letting others in frustration or further scolding You foolish fool with disturbed awarenesses drives beings so that they fall in an abyss burns the swamps on the mountains and forces humans to drunkenness Sometimes one explains the Buddhaword overturned because of a mental construction Action that is to be compared in this way acquires a disturbed mind as fruit Fear is having fear when seeing the configuration of an inhuman coming Because of fear the mind is disturbed Calamity of the body is because of being beaten by an inhuman This is polluting the gathering place Investigations  of the order and the pagoda of the Buddhist samgha with that which is unclean therefore one is condemned to the anger of inhumans and one gets beaten limb after limb That is why the mind is disturbed Noble persons are without a mind that is disturbed by the proceeding of the retribution of former action When they first sow action with a fixed retribution there is arising free from beings after first having felt the retribution When they sow action to be felt in an unfixed time this action is extinguished when they arise free from beings The mind that is disturbed abides in the realm of sexual passion This hell is without a mind that is disturbed because of permanent distraction Animal birth ghosts and humans are with a mind that is disturbed Exception has to be made for Uttarakuru Also the gods of the realm of sexual passion have a mind that is disturbed Question Which noble persons have a mind that is disturbed Answer The srotadpanna the sakrdagamin the andgamin the arhat and the pratyekabuddha Only the mind of Buddha is not disturbed He is not broken by sound his hair does not become white and his face not rumpled because for the Worldhonoured One disturbed action has disappeared already a long time ago and because there is the practice of active good conduct Disturbed is consciousness of the mind no awarenesses of five forms of consciousness because of not differentiating Impure awarenesses are disturbed no pure ones because of proceeding in the highest truth  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Is this the reason why when awarenesses are said to be disturbed there is being divided Four sentences are to be made the first sentence concerns goodimpure awarenesses and nonobscuredneutral awarenesses of the fool the second sentence concerns defiled awarenesses of the one who abides with himself the third sentence concerns defiled awarenesses of the fool the fourth sentence concerns good awarenesses and nonobscuredneutral awarenesses of the one who abides with himself Question Which elements can dismember the limbs Answer For the possibility of dismemberment of the limbs the Noble has been speaking about water fire and wind Three elements can dismember the limbs not the element earth because it is not sharp Dismembering the limbs by the element fire is that at the moment of death the element fire increases and burns the muscles fully After the muscles have been burnt limb after limb is dismembered After limb after limb has been dismembered death is soon after Dismembering the limbs by the element water  is that at the moment limb after limb is dismembered one first lets the muscles rot After the muscles have rotten the rest is as has been said before Dismembering the limbs by the element wind is letting the muscles be dispersed After the muscles have been dispersed the rest is as has been said before After dismembering the limbs there is death before day and night have passed because of the disturbance of the four elements In hell there is no dismembering of the limbs because the limbs are dismembered permanently Because of the retribution of action there is no dying Animal birth ghosts   Investigations  and three directions are with dismembering of the limbs exception made for Uttarakuru because there is no evil action The same applies to the gods Worldlings and noble persons are with dismemberment of the limbs only exception made for Buddha because it is the retribution of what is evil that is with dismemberment of the limbs and Buddha is without the retribution of what is evil The dismemberment of the limbs has already been spoken of Falling back shall now be spoken of  There are three forms of the one who falls back from that which is acquired Srom that which is not acquired yet and from the enjoyment Sometimes one person is with one form of falling back Falling back from that which is not acquired yet is said to concern two There are three forms of the one who falls back falling back from that which is acquired falling back from that which is not acquired yet and falling back from the enjoyment Falling back from that which is acquired is falling back from the acquired qualities when meeting with the reasons for falling back Falling back from that which is not acquired yet is not acquiring the qualities that should be acquired because of heedlessness Falling back from the enjoyment is not acquiring the enjoyment of the qualities that are already acquired because of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya certain reasons Question Which persons are with which fact of falling back Answer Sometimes one person is with one form of falling back Falling back from that which is acquired concerns the sravaka with minor faculties not the one with keen faculties Keen faculties are because of the power of samadhi How is it to be known that there is falling back from that which is acquired Answer Because two kinds of arhat are spoken of the one who falls back and the one who does not fall back When stating that falling back from the path is not falling back from the fruit this is not right Because the acquisition of annihilation is combined with the path The acquisition is included in the truth of the path That therefore falling back from the path does not concern annihilation is not right When stating How does the kind that is already free from defilement make arise it has to be said that to this the same applies as to the primary pure awareness that arises without previous cause  Because there furthermore neous cause it concerns the defilement of infinite transmigration that arises from the state of the homogeneous cause Stating that defilement produced from three conditions is a wrong explanation is not right In order to fulfil the production of defilement it is said that defilement produced by beings has three reasons in all the power cause  is the state of the homoge  Investigations  the power object and the power preparation that is not abandoned yet and not known yet is the power cause  factors that adhere to the fetter attachment to sensual pleasure is the power object this unreasoned attentionS is the power preparation This is the idea said by these from their saying that the unreasoned attention is not being part of the former unreasoned attention would then not be produced since if there were former unreasoned attention this would be nonfinal Moreover good and neutral awarenesses would never arise When unreasoned attention were successive and nonfinal then the other forms of mindfulness would not achieve to arise If they do not arise also being disjunctioned would not be part of it When defilement is burnt there will be no new arising just as when fire burns trees ashes are formed ashes have never made a tree again When in this way the arhat burns defilement as firewood by means of the fire of knowledge he will not make defilement again This will not be the case Because the example is not fit How could it be as burning firewood and having ashes If it were in this way defilement of an arhat would have a rest such as ashes If there is a rest this is no arhat because there is defilement If there is none it is not as compared above In this way it is not this noble path that burns firewood as fire does But the noble path produces the abandonment of defilement the acquisition of being disjunctioned and the acquisition of its realisation If this were free from the noble path there should also be abandonment of the acquisition of being disjunctioned with the acquisition of fetters being produced again As falling back  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya would be contrary to that which has been said in the scriptural texts it should be known that this is said because of the one unconditionally liberated Falling back from that which is not acquired yet is said to concern two This falling back from that which is not acquired yet concerns the srdvaka and the pratyekabuddha not Buddha because of abiding in all most superior faculties The sravaka does not acquire the superior faculties of Buddha and of the pratyekabuddha the pratyekabuddha does not acquire the superior faculties of Buddha that is why there is falling back from that which has not been acquired yet Generally spoken all beings all have to acquire the noble eye of wisdom when practising when not practising and entering the psychophysical complex there is falling back from that which has not been acquired yet Question How is it to be known that there is falling back from that which has not been acquired yet Answer Because of having faith in the explanations of Buddha as the Worldhonoured One has said because of not seeing the noble truths With falling back from the enjoyment the same is true for three nobles With falling back from the enjoyment it are the sravaka the pratyekabuddha and the Tathagata The three nobles all have it because of all sorts of intermediate reasons the acquired qualities cannot be present permanently Question How is it to be known that there is falling back from the enjoyment Investigations  Answer Because falling back from awarenesses and accompanying mental factors is spoken of As the Worldhonoured One has been saying I say that the acquisition of pleasant abiding in the present regarding these four kinds of awarenesses and accompanying mental factors is one by one with falling back as has been spoken of elaborately in the sitras Moreover it is said With the accomplishment of being the eyewitness the one with steadfast emancipation of the mind abides and is not with falling back That is why it is known that also the Worldhonoured One has falling back from the enjoyment That is why it is said that the Worldhonoured One mostly abides in the one that is not reached yet not in the fundamental stages Why Because of being near to the realm of sexual passion Although the one with steadfast emancipation of the mind has falling back from the enjoyment it is so that at the moment all these are present that which is acquired subsequently proceeds permanently because he accomplishes the spiritual practice which is obtaining These awarenesses and accompanying mental factors are developed presently That which is not present is said to be with falling back The one who falls back from the enjoyment the most is the Worldhonoured One Because gualities are infinite just as the sovereign of the world widely grasps objects Moreover it is said that is called steadfast because of including something else Because of including oneself awarenesses and accompanying mental factors are spoken of The Worldhonoured One mostly includes something else seldom himself The great compassion and great giving of the Worldhonoured One are in this way    Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Questicn Which residence is without falling back Answer  Gods are not with falling back When falling back from the fruit there finally is no dying Also not doing this action not done when abiding in the fruit Gods are not with falling back Gods are not with falling back because with keen faculties gods are with the acquisition of a fruit and those with keen faculties are not with falling back When humans with minor faculties are with the acquisition of a fruit and later arise with the gods they are also not with falling back because of passing through birth Passing  through birth of noble persons is not with falling back this has been said already before because they are not being part of the whole of falling back The Worldhonoured One has been speaking of the whole of five forms of falling back it is such as much activity Because these gods do not share the five of falling back they are not with falling back It should be known that because gods are not with falling back falling back definitely is among humans because falling back is to be acquired by all When falling back from the fruit there finally is no dying The one who falls back from the fruit finally does not die he has to acquire the fruit again Because arising in a lower stage is uncalculated cessation The factor uncalculated cessation finally is not present again because of nonarisen factors because the path included by the fruit is with certainty and with certain accomplishment Because the path of the fruit is a residence of peace Investigations  these humans acquire peace Moreover because the abode of the fruit does protect itself well Because the abode of the fruit is supplied with the three reasons and the five reasons This has been spoken of already previously  These three forms of falling back from the fruit do not concern the fruit of srotadpannaship because the defilement to be abandoned through the path of vision is not b the thing that is to be opposed The defilement to be abandoned through the path of vision proceeds depending on a self as substratum and there is no self The defilement to be abandoned through the spiritual path is the thing that is to be opposed The defilement to be abandoned through the spiritual path proceeds with that which is clean as substratum It has clean conceptual identifications and unclean conceptual identifications These reflect upon formations being unclean and upon the acquisition of the indecision of nonattachment being clean while falling back concerns the vision of what is unclean There is no falling back from the vision of nonself with the indecision of a self and what belongs to a self of a factor Furthermore when preparing the fruit of srotaapannaship such precious as giving moral precept and spiritual practice that tend to getting disjunctioned are wide it is to be compared in this way Moreover since the fruit of srotadpannaship is acquired by the path of vision and the path of vision is without falling back because of the quick path because of being keen because of the antidote sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification It should be known that when falling back from the fruit of arhatship to the fruit of srotaapannaship there is falling back from three fruits because the cured defilement achieved accomplishment  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Also not doing the action that is not done when abiding in the fruit what is not done by the person who acquires the fruit is also not done by the person who falls back to the fruit Because of the acquisition of the restraint with absence of action Because after the noble path misconduct is extinguished just as ever drinking medicine Furthermore because of the hope that one is possessed of because this person cured misconduct when longing for cessation as fruit Question What is limited of which is should be stated that it is a bodhisattva Answer  When developing primary and secondary characteristic marks effort produces this action and from this there is increase when proceeding this is said to be called bodhisattva c When there are beings who by means of giving one meal produce certain awarenesses and who when uttering fearlessness I will be Buddha can produce the characteristic marks as retribution and make this action grow this is limited to be called bodhisattva because from this similar successive action can be done If it were not in this way it would only be an empty name Although the bodhisattva has the primary production of awarenesses of not falling back this is certainty about bodhi but no certainty about the course Course should be explained as arrival it is the same name as course After having made the action with the characteristic marks as retribution there are both certainties Investigations  That is why the name is limited to the action with the characteristic marks as retribution Because this is free from four reasons free from woeful courses free from what is not masculine free from lower lineages and free from faculties that are not supplied The acquisition of one reason is the nature of being conscious of the former existences because of being conscious of the former existences when arising Learning exactly is grasping its dependence is being free from the mistakes of beings when being with agreement  Surpassing three asamkyeyas of kalpas is the sowing action with the characteristic marks as retribution in one hundred kalpas Exception has to be made for Sakyamuni because of energy the bodhisattva Sakyamuni is with exception of nine kalpas with the other ninetyone kalpas Some say that two of the three asamkhyeyas are no asamkhyeya of kalpas asamkhyeya of kalpas asamkhyeya of forms of birth and asamkhyeya of active good con duct  Question With which nature is the action with the characteristic marks as retribution Answer because of being weak no wisdom through personal realisation be cause the realm of sexual passion is unfixed Of the form of Jambuavipa it is no other direction being masculine it is no woman with Buddha rising in the world it is not when not rising in the world with seeing Buddha it is not without seeing Buddha taking forming  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya action as supporting object it is not taking something else as supporting object Some say that since one form of thinking is the action that is with the thirtytwo characteristic marks manifold later actions fulfil them Moreover it is said that the whole of awarenesses determined by one aspect and one supporting object is present by means of a multitude of forms of thinking There is the wish of peacefully abiding with the feet down as fruit there is the wish up to the usnisaS These characteristic marks are one by one the dependence of one hundred merits Concerning the measure of one merit some say that one merit of the sovereign of the world is said to be the measure of one merit Moreover it is said that it is one merit of Sakra Some say that since at the moment a kalpa is settled the action of all beings is excessive and the insentient universe arises this is said to be the measure of a merit Some say that exception made for the bodhisattva who abides close to the Buddhastage the selfdependent action that is satisfaction as merit of other beings is said to be the measure of one merit Buddha and the religious merit of the adept is bodhi the knowledge of destruction and the knowledge of nonorigiBecause a sattva seeks for this knowledge he is called bodhisattva The one who has acquired this bodhi is called Buddha because he has awakened for all factors Only after the action with the characteristic marks as retribution the sovereign of the world is acquired it should be known that the characteristic marks of the sovereign of the world are the retribution of other action  Investigations  Question How many forms of Sarvastivada are there Answer  One form is with difference in nature Sometimes different characteristic marks are spoken of Sometimes the difference in state is spoken of Sometimes the mutual difference is further spoken of These are the four forms of Sarvastivada One form is with difference in mode This is saying that at the moment factors proceed according to the periods of time it is their mode that is different not the substance that is different Just as when milk changes to koumiss the abundance of the power of its taste is abandoned not matter is abandoned just as when gold and silver vessels are broken and other vessels are made the configuration is abandoned it is not matter that is abandoned The same applies to factors that reach the present from being future It should be known that these are the Sarvastivadins of Change Difference in characteristic marks Factors of the past are combined with characteristic marks of the past and are not free from the characteristic marks of the future and the present To this the same applies as to a person who adheres to one matter is not not adhered to another This explanation is wrong When factors of the past are not free from the characteristic marks of the future and of the present then what is finally settled just as when a person adheres to one matter there is adherence in relation to one matter and there both are commitment and accomplishment Regarding another there is accomplishment  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya without commitment That is why this saying is with the periods of time in disorder The comparison is also contrary Difference in state This is saying that at the moment factors proceed according to the periods of time their state is different it is not their substance that is different This is the undisturbed establishment of the periods of time Because their action is different When a factor does not do action yet  it is said to be future doing action it is said to be present after having done action it is said to be P ast Mutual difference This is saying that since at the moment a factor proceeds according to the periods of time there is mutual adherence before and after it neither concerns difference of substance nor difference of state Just as one woman is both called daughter and mother when observing the daughter the mother is known when observing the mother the daughter is known  This is the most confused establishment of the periods of time This is saying that one Asana of the past time has the three periods of time This is stating that observing the previously produced characteristic marks is called future and that observing the later produced characteristic marks is called present  Question The sayings of all instructors about higher realisation of the truth each are different The Sarvastivadins and Vatsiputriyas say it is a successive higher realisation of the truth Which one is true Answer Now it shall be truly spoken of by means of the Investigations  five members five members the first is called proposition the second is called cause the third is called illustration the fourth is called application the fifth is called conclusion and the sixth is called meaning  as is explained in the stanza below It isa successive higher realisation Because the knowledges and the truths have different characteristic marks When seeing a bottle it is no dress that is seen That is why the same is true Sor this The devotee is with higher realisation of frustration  first and later up to the one of the path Question Answer Because the knowledges and the truths have different characteristic marks Knowledge of frustration the one of the origin the one of cessation and the one of the path each have different characteristic marks because of different aspects When an aspect is of knowledge of frustration this aspect is of no other knowledge If it were not so there would be no establishment of four knowledges Also the truths have different characteristic marks SupPressing is the characteristic mark of the one of frustration arising is the characteristic mark of the one of the origin silence is the characteristic mark of the one of cessation escape is the characteristic mark of the one of the path In relation to the truths with undifferent knowledges and with different characteristic marks there is not one higher realisation  An illustration is that at the moment a bottle is seen no dress is seen because a bottle and a dress are with dif Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya ferent characteristic marks Because of different character istic marks it is so that when seeing a bottle it is no dress that is seen when seeing a dress it is no bottle that is seen The same applies to this Regarding the truths with different characteristic marks it is so that at the moment the one of frustration is seen the other ones are not seen The same applies to all That is why there is a successive higher realisation One higher realisation is spoken of This is saying that there is one higher realisation regarding the truths Because of faith in the Noble As the Worldhonoured One has said When a bhiksu is without perplexity regarding the one of frustration he also is without perplexity in relation to the one of the origin The same applies to the one of cessation and to the one of the path  Just as a torch makes four actual entities in total fuel a taper a vessel of oil and breaking darkness In this way one knowledge knows frustration up to develops the path That is why there is one higher realisation This speaking of different characteristic marks of knowledges and of truths is not right because of the one characteristic mark Since all wisdom is with the characteristic marks of one knowledge it is the aspect without self regarding all factors as object just as the Worldhonoured One has said All factors are selfless The wise one can see this At the moment of this aversion regarding frustration this exactly is the path that is clean The same applies to the characteristic marks of the truths Speaking of different characteristic marks of a bottle and a dress is also not right Because higher realisation of the specific characteristic marks is not being part of it Since it is higher realisation of general characteristic marks as object not of specific characteristic marks Since such five aggregates as Investigations    matter are with mingle characteristic marks mingled characteristic marks exactly is the characteristic mark impermanence it is one higher realisation of knowledge of the general object If it were different a mistake would arise automatically The ones of successive higher realisation state that what you said about that which the Noble has said is a secret language This saying has another meaning as the Worldhonoured One has said that When there is no perplexity in relation to the one of frustration there is no perplexity regarding all this is spoken of because of this proceeding of perplexity when this higher realisation of frustration arises perplexity never proceeds because of uncalculated cessation In order to exclude other sayings the Worldhonoured One has said that in the sitras about Anathapindada it is stated in this way Oh Highest One regarding the four noble truths there is a successive higher realisation In this way it is spoken of elaborately With saying that it is as a torch there is the mistake of many natures and of the many actions of the torch I do not take the actual entities of the torch That at the moment of differentiating the specific name torch is abandoned has been said already previously  This radiance is included in the sensefield matter its power can break darkness this heat is included in the sensefield tangible and can make other things If this were not so the meaning of what is certain would be mingled Wisdom is not in this way When stating that it is equal then there is a mistake When stating that it concerns one characteristic mark this also is not right because the aspects are different Knowledge of the aspect impermanence js different knowledge of such aspects as frustration emptiness and without sef each are also different it is to be com Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya pared in this way If it were not in this way there would be no gates of liberation The aspects that are not to be mingled are the gates of liberation observing in a mingled way is called to be mingled because the three liberations are observed differently they are not to be mingled When you say Taking all factors as supporting object constitutes the aspect without self this is the unfixed part of the indecision because there is sudden observation of all factors That is why At the moment of aversion regarding frustration this exactly is the path that is clean should be stated One cannot because of the proceeding of aversion take cessation and the path as supporting object because cessation and the path are loved actual entities Taking everything as supporting object is not general because of being contrary because the aspect without self does not proceed in exactly this aspect without self because the specific nature does not observe itself Neither is it the observation of that which is associated because of together being with one aspect and one supporting object Neither is it the observation of that which is simultaneous because of together being with one fruit and one certainty Moreover it is said that all aspects are impermanent and that it neither is the aspect impermanence that constitutes the higher realisation of cessation because cessation is permanent it should be known that it is spoken of because these aspects are remote and tend to the noble truths  has been said that when observing the accomplishment of bodily verbal and mental misconduct of these beings during a long  Investigations  time these beings exactly are stated to be with hell and other woeful courses and in reality are no humans exactly are inhabitants of hell The same applies to this When it moreover were higher realisation of emptiness it then would not be the one of aimlessness or the one of signlessness Do not state that there is a mistake because the objects of all these factors are not being part of this That is why the aspect without self of all factors is an unfixed indecision A fixed indecision concerns impure supporting objects If it were not so the gates of liberation would be reduced When stating that higher realisation of the specific characteristic marks is not being part of it it is not right Because when observing it concerns specific characteristic marks and general characteristic marks The characteristic mark suppressing is the characteristic mark of frustration because when observing three truths it is a specific characteristic mark because when observing the aggregates it is a general characteristic mark In this way everything is to be known as that everything because of observing is said to concern specific characteristic marks andgeneral characteristic marks Stating that this is not so is not right Because there is no mingled observation this has been said already previously Previously it has been said that the intermediate existence shall be spoken of later Now this shall be spoken of Question Is there intermediate existence or not Answer It should be known that there is intermediate existence This has been said by the Worldhonoured One It is to be compared with a path between villages This has the mistake of a combination This explains that there is intermediate existence Because it has been said by the Worldhonoured One As the Worldhonoured One has said The seven courses of the true man have intermediate liberation If there were no intermediate existence then there would be no intermediate liberation When stating that since there are intermediate gods there is parinirvana from this this is not right because of not being spoken of with the course  Among those that have been spoken of in the sitras of the Worldhonoured One the gods of the group of the Four Great Kings up to the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification having intermediate gods is not spoken of Also the rest would have a mistake When liberation after one rebirth is spoken of is there further that which is called gods of arising All are in this way Also the andgamin should in this way have to be explained as wrong This is why this is said to be a mental construction When stating that there is parinirvana in life this is not right Exception made for Uttarakuru and for the bodhisattva at the last limit there are many beings who die when their duration of life has not ended yet Is all this intermediate liberation That is why all this has a mistake Question How is this Answer It is to be compared with a path between vilInvestigations  lages The existence at death and the existence at re arising are as reaching one village from one village The same applies to being with the existence at rearising as course from the existence at death As the Avalayanasiitra says When coming from this residence In this way it is spoken of elaborately When there were no intermediate existence then there would be no going and coming That is why there has to be intermediate existence When stating Because exception made for the ones with other sayings it is the stitras n the siitras and stanzas said by the Worldhonoured One it is stated After the five proximate blameworthinesses have been made there is successive arising in Avicihell Moreover for the brahmanas He said the stanza stating You are without state and also without provisions That is why there is no intermediate existence this is not right sdtra and stanza are spoken of because of the actions and the courses that are directly antecedent After the proximate actions have been done there definitely is experiencing the retribution of the proximate ones first and experiencing the retribution of other actions later there also is having to arise in the course hell definitely in no other course As you understand  the Worldhonoured One said in the sitras After the five proximate actions have been done there is successive arising in hell Is there need to have the five proximate ones fcr arising in hell or are two three or four  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya  Do other forms of blameworthiness make arise in the course hell The meaning of this scriptural text and stanza should be known When stating that it is as a reflection it should be as with the moon that is extremely remote and of which the reflection is visible in the water It is not this moon that comes and reaches the water When the existence at death and the existence at rearising were as a reflection what then would be the function of the intermediate existence in relation to the birth of beings This also is not right This has the mistake of a combination the combination of moon and water The existence at death and the existence at rearising are not together that is why there is a mistake Consciousness of the eye and consciousness of the body under the feet are also to be compared in this way That when first grasping the existence at rearising the existence at death is abandoned just as a caterpillar is not right Because the course is not different and because of the mistake of the combination of two forms of consciousness That is why it is said that there is intermediate existence As has been said there are four forms of Sarvdstivada Question What is existing and what is not with everything that exists Answer Jt should be known that everything that exists does not have all characteristic marks Everything does not have everything There is no factor with the characteristic marks of another Investigations  This existence is what is established by Sarvastivada Everything is the twelve sense The gesture that is different has been spoken of already previously  Everything does not have everything in the religious merit of the seeker there is the religious merit of the seeker and not the religious merit of the adept In the religious merit of the adept there is the religious merit of the adept but not the religious merit of the seeker Just as there are also no footsteps in the sky it is to be compared in this way Question This is speaking of existence How is nonexistence Answer There is no factor with the characteristic marks of another Just as the characteristic marks of the eye are of the sense eye and are no characteristic marks of another sense because the characteristic marks are different That is why it is said that all factors are not to be mingled  Not contrary to that which is proper all periods of time exist This has been said by the Muni The samgha of sravakas is without Buddha That the three times are sarvastivada is what is established by Sarvastivada Question Answer Because the present period of time that ob Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya serves the past and the future is nominal designation When there were no past and future then there would be no present period of time if there were no present period f time there would also be no conditioned factors That is why there are the three periods of time Do not state that there is a mistake When stating that what is remote is past and that what will exist is future does not exist and that there only is the present this is not right Because there is retribution of action The Worldhonoured One has been saying There is action and there is retribution It is not the case that this action and retribution are both present When the action is present it should be known that the retribution is future when the retribution is present it should be known that the action is already past When stating that when spoken of in relation to the world of that which is made it is also said that it cannot be acquired or when stating that when spoken of in relation to the world there is being with action and with retribution this is also not right When the Worldhonoured One also said that what is made cannot be acquired this is also a saying relating to the world What has been said by the noble mouth are the siitras of emptiness as highest truth and you say in a mental construction that since this does exist that that therefore exists it is to be compared in this way It should be known that it is not so that as you say that what is remote is past and that what will exist is future does not exist and that there only is the present Do not make this saying I can also say that what is present is future regarding that which has gone and is past regarding what shall exist This is not what has been said by the Wise One Investigations  As has been said If there are no such five faculties as faith I say that this is the generation of worldlings When the seeker is the one who is bound by envelopers such five faculties as faith are not present because the path is not together with defilement That is why it should be known that there are past and future If it were different noble persons would have to be worldlings When stating that there is arising according to what is acquired this would also not be right because the acquisition of a factor that does not exist is not being part of it because of the fact that the basis is not being part of it The samgha of Sravakas is without Buddha The samgha of Sravakas does not include Buddha Because the three treasures do not decrease When the Worldhonoured One were included in the sradvakas there would be two treasures and no three because Buddha would not constitute a separate body The same applies to such as taking refuge perfect faith and mindfulness Do not state that there is a mistake That is why the samgha of Sravakas does not include Buddha As has been said in the sitras of the Worldhonoured One Oh Gautami Giving to the samgha also is reverencing me Know that this is said to concern the samgha of bhiksus the samgha of nobles and the samgha of the field of merit The Worldhonoured One is included in these three samghas because of breaking defilement because of nobleness because of the field of merit that is the highest truth Not the samgha of Sravakas When arranging wide chapters and sentences the multitude of beings is with great fear Now I only speak concisely about  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the characteristic marks that are without higher and that are very profound When speaking elaborately beings are with fear That is why I do not speak elaborately now The Abhidharma with its farreaching chapters and sentences and the subtle meaning of the sounds of the discussion in which is explained with clear clean wisdom are spoken of concisely here The great masters of old exposed the unlimited meaning Now differentiating according to what I understand Jonly say a little Deliberating with little wisdom and selecting from that which the honoured Dharmaresthin has said I now compile chapters and sentences to comment and complete the doctrine as it has been transmitted It is not because of wishing pride and seeking for glory He has said the same The arising of defilement is said to be impure by the Noble Also cessation and the path make defilement arise but are not impure because the increase of defilement is not being part of them That by pure supporting objects defilement is reduced and that there is no increase has been said already previously that is why  speak about that which is increase That pure supporting objects do not increase from minor over middle to excessive is not right because of the increase of the bases When the subtle meaning of the chapters and the sentences of this treatise are known with certainty Investigations  there is agitation and no fear regarding this multitude of wise ones With the one who can be certain regarding the meaning of the chapters and the sentences of this treatise and whose knowledge differentiates well when explaining the mind is not with fear regarding wise beings because of understanding the essential marks wel Now I make the treatises increase With this mind there is no greed it is in order to let the knowing ones have satisfaction and to let them acquire the satisfaction of silence quickly Sayings with very concise meanings that are the fundament of this scripture are extremely wide and hard to grasp just as an empty treatise They are hard to understand this has been said already previously That is why being conformable to the meanings of the siitras when expanding the fundament of this treatise lets one understand more easily because the meaning is known defilement is abandoned Chapter Eleven Discussion The Chapter Investigations has already been spoken of Now for the pleasure of the knowing ones the points of discussion will be spoken of concisely JSrom restraint and from nonrestraint there is no acquisition of progress because of this The one who can ascertain this explain Answer Indeed At the moment of arising in the realm of form having gone down in the realm of formlessness Worldlings of the realm of formlessness are said to be with neitherrestraintnornonrestraint because good and bad restraint are not being part of the realm of formlessness At the moment of arising in the realm of form with death there good restraint is acquired because the re straint of the realm of form is together with awarenesses This does not concern progress because the realm of formlessness is the supreme realm  Is there somehow the acquisition of JSruits of Sramanaship by the noble who is free from all faults whereby conditioned good factors are acquired and this is not called practised assiduously  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya Answer Indeed When the noble path that is included in a frui was extinguished falling back later not having perfectioning of faculties again acquires that previous path included in the past fruits Because it was extinguished first it is not developed because a present cause is not being part of it because of not being conventional conditioned because of not being unconditioned good because of not being bad or neutral At the moment the path is not produced yet one is remote from all faults when one is free from what is bad at the moment of getting disjunctioned  The one who can ascertain this explain Answer Indeed When the devotee abides in the diamondlike samadhi he is exception made for the first knowledge of destruction with the other religious merit of the adept and this is the moment of not being produced yet because of not approaching  The moment of getting disjunctioned is the moment the destruction primarily arises with the sudden disjunction from all paths of the adept This moment of arising is the moment of getting disjunctioned Being free from all faults is because of not being impure  Is there somehow with the production of fetters by the shining ones whereby these are associated with concentration falling back to the clean first trance that is the acquisition of being the one who falls back Discussion  Answer Indeed At the moment of falling back of the fetters of the second trance by the arhat being with the first trance acquired through the knowledge of destruction because falling back is combined with the knowledge of destruction There is falling back with mixed spiritual practice because the first trance is combined with the fourth trance The same is true for the anagamin That it is stated to be the clean one is that falling back is by the knowing one because this does not concern the one having no more learning to do  Is there somehow a good factor that this acquired in the path of vision of the truth whereby this factor is with a supporting object and whereby noble knowledge does not see the supporting object Answer Indeed of the realm of sexual passion at the limit of higher realisation of frustration that is together with subsequent knowledge in relation to frustration does not see the supporting object of this knowledge because this takes the realm of sexual passion as supporting object and subsequent knowledge in relation to frustration does not take the realm of sexual passion as supporting object The same applies to the limit of higher realisation of the origin and to the one of cessation Subsequent patience in relation to the path acquires the knowledge that takes three truths as supporting object and does not observe these truths because of abiding in a different object Just as when acquiring the religious merit of the adept abiding in the religious merit of the seeker is the acquisition of the religious merit of the adept and not of the religious merit of the seeker the same  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya applies to reaching the class of subsequent knowledge from the class of knowledge of the law and further reaching the class of knowledge of the law from the class of subsequent knowledge  Is there somehow a fruit that since it is impure wisdom is abandoned by pure wisdom whereby that on which the fruit relies for its production is wisdom of not being with nonattachment Answer Indeed The noble person who being without the desire of the realm of sexual passion is not yet free from the desire of the first trance It is magic awareness of the realm of sexual passion as fruit of the first trance that is with nonattachment because of the destruction of craving of the realm of sexual passion Wisdom of the first trance is not being with nonattachment yet because this craving is not destroyed yet The same applies to every magic awareness according to their meaning Exception made for the one of the specific stage as fruit Is there somehow when abiding in the proximate path  the acquisition of all cessation whereby it is defilement that is contrary to these not this pure view Answer Indeed The proximate path of the moment of developing higher faculties by the worldling Since this abandons the defilement that is contrary to higher faculties cessation is acquired It is no pure view that is contrary Discussion  Why At the moment the noble person is with nonattachment patience regarding the law is present because there is acquisition of the cessation of defilement to which patience is contrary  Is there somehow cessation of defilement acquired by the one with nonattachment whereby there is no abandoning of defilement but whereby it was destroyed when acquiring what is with absence of impurity Answer Indeed At the moment of arising in the brahmaheaven with death in a higher stage When acquiring the abandonment of the defilement of the realm of sexual passion this defilement is not abandoned because it was already abandoned previously All other stages are also in this way Is there somehow a clean stage with absence of impurity that is acquired when it was not acquired yet whereby one is not with nonattachment and not with falling back and one does not depend on the path of vision Answer Indeed When being with nonattachment in the first trance arising free from beings depending on the first trance and the adjacent ones and when with arising of subsequent knowledge i in relation to the path  the fruit of anagaminship of three stages is accomplished one acquires the second trance that is pure when entering the second trance produced from this concentration At the moment of the acquisition of this pure one one is not with  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya nonattachment because one first was with nonattachment This is not with falling back This does not concernthe path of vision because the path of vision is accomplished It should be known that the higher stages and the growing of faculties are also in this way  Ts there somehow the acquisition of what was never acquired yet and the acquisition of silence  whereby something is not abandoned and not acquired The one who can know explain Answer Indeed Exception made for the ones acquired through patience regarding the law in relation to frustration and its dependence the ones acquired through other pure paths When abandoning the primary pure every ordinariness is not acquired  The rest do not abandon something because of being abandoned already previously  When accomplishing eight forms of patience and when also seven knowledges are accomplished this pure view does not see everything that is pure Answer Indeed When this person accomplishes the wisdom of all of the paths of vision when abiding in subse quent patience in relation to the path all cessation and all paths are seen only exception made for the dependence of subsequent patience in relation to the path This patience does not see its specific nature because of not observing oneself because there are no two natures Discussion  Also what is associated is not seen because of one as pect and one supporting object That which is simultaneous is not seen because of one fruit and being one certainty  Js there somehow a factor that is not acquired yet that is impure and with its object at the limit whereby it only is the steadfast one who can rout good factors Answer Indeed Signlessness of signlessness Regarding the nonfinal transmigration it is never acquired yet and because the noble path of emptiness is acquired it is said to be with an impure supporting object Because of uncalculated cessation it is said to be with its object at the limit The rest is not being part of it that is why it is said only the steadfast one Because of the noble path of emptiness routing good factors is spoken of After pure wisdom is produced it is although arisen previously no cause for that which is later regarding that which is not produced yet The one who can know explain Answer Indeed The former excessive because the fruit is similar or exces sive  Is there somehow free from the desire of six stages the noble who also settles this fruit  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya but does not settle the pure trance The one who can know explain Answer Indeed When one is with nonattachment in the sphere of unlimited space and arises free from beings when depending on the pretrance patience regarding the law in relation to frustration has arisen and subsequent knowledge in relation to the path has not arisen yet Because of the eightynine fruits of Sramanaship That is why it is stated Settles this fruit Because knowledge of the law in relation to frustration is the natural fruit and the fruit of human effort of patience regarding the law in relation to frustration and the destruction of defilement to be abandoned through the vision of frustration is the fruit of liberation and the fruit of human effort Are there among the pure factors somehow those that are included in the elements whereby that which can make these factors arise does not belong to that element Answer Indeed Being included in the elements it is not what is included in that which is impure Moral precept is what is formedby the four elements because of being its fruit The four elements are that which is included in the element tangible because of the object of consciousness of the body  Is there somehow one kind of elements that when being extinguished is not produced in the stage of trance Discussion  Two kinds of elements abide previously The one who can explain explain Answer Indeed When the noble person arises in the realm of sexual passion whereby the impure first trance is present in succession to the pure first trance One kind of the four elements is extinguished the four elements of the realm of sexual passion because that which is pure proceeds subsequently Because when present when arising in this one it exactly is formed by the four elements of that stage That two kinds of the four elements are present concerns the four elements of the realm of sexual passion and of the stage of the first trance Moral precept that is together with the path is said to be that which is pure that proceeds subsequently when arising in this realm of sexual passion it exactly is formed by the four elements of that realm of sexual passion Therefore these four elements are produced and extinguished together with that which is pure  Is there somehow a factor that when relying on three paths is with a threefold specific nature and that being threefold is with one stage and moreover also abides in three stages Answer Indeed Wisdom of the adept It has the path of vision the spiritual path and the path of the adept as cause it is with the specific nature of the knowledge of destruction the knowledge of nonorigination and the right view of the adept Because of the difference in minor middle and excessive it is said to be threefold Because of being included  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya in the stage of having no more learning to do one stage is spoken of Because of the difference of such as being with initial thought and with sustained thought abides in three stages Is there somehow a feeling that is impure whereby two are settled and one is not settled whereby two faculties are settled in two kinds and this is said to be the eyewitness Answer Indeed The perfectioning of faculties when depending on the first trance on the adjacent one of the first trance and on the second trance of the person who is the eyewitness Higher stages are not present It is the accomplishment of the faculty frustration and of the impure faculty satisfaction This person first acquires the pure faculty satisfaction of the stage of the third trance and because of the proceeding of faculties there is no further acquisition when abandoning Because of depending on lower stages there is the perfectioning of faculties it is no development of the path of the seeker of a higher stage just as the acquisition of the fruit of still having learning to do Depression as only faculty is not accomplished because of being with nonattachment The faculty contentedness and the faculty equanimity each are twofold impure and pure These  are all accomplished Because the pretrance and the intermediate one include the faculty equanimity therefore there is the acquisition of the faculty equanimity The first trance and the second trance include the faculty contentedness therefore there is the acquisition of the faculty contentedness  Discussion   When the defilement of nine stages is extinguished trances are acquired but immaterial meditative attainments are not acquired Or further their acquisition should be known Answer Indeed When the arhat can obtain trances it are no immaterial ones The trances are both acquired and present when the immaterial ones are accomplished they are not committed One Jactor is with a multitude of natures Sometimes one or three Existence or nonexistence Since this is the religious merit of the adept it is what is supported by the power cause Answer Indeed The faculty of one who has fully understood Because one faculty is established the statement says Because of the combination of nine faculties a multitude of natures is spoken of Because of these multiple natures it is not said to be one Because of the one stage of having no more learning to do one stage is spoken of Because of the difference between initial thought and sustained thought three stages are spoken of Existence is having a name nonexistence is being no separate substance Because of the acquisition of having no more learning to do the religious merit of the adept is spoken of Because of being settled by three causes being supported by causes is spoken of  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya soy Is there somehow a factor that is homogeneous and arises abides and is abandoned similarly with a partially homogeneous one The one who can know explain Answer Indeed The sensefield matter is partially homogeneous and its characteristic marks birth duration and disappearance are together with the sensefield because of being one fruit Because the sensefield matter is no gesture it is said to be partially homogeneous Its characteristic marks are included in the factor sensefield that is why they are homogeneous sy Are there somehow associated factors that either are said to be partially homogeneous or said to be homogeneous The one who can know explain Answer Indeed The sense mind among the future nonarisen factors Other accompanying mental factors are homogeneous because of being included in the factor sensefield  Are there somehow two anagamins who arise simultaneously in one stage whereby the supreme factor is sometimes settled and whereby they together acquire one stage as fruit Answer Indeed One andgdmin depends on the second trance and arises free from beings the second andgdamin depends on the third trance At death they both arise in the Discussion  third trance The one who depending on the second trance arises free from beings abandons the highest worldly factor because of growing trance Exactly the one who depends on the third trance accomplishes it and does not abandon it The same applies to the higher stages The acquisition of one stage as fruit is the trance with out initial thought and without sustained thought  Are there somehow steadfast ones who both experience one existence whereby one accomplishes goodimpure ones of nine stages and one is without Answer Indeed One arises in the realm of sexual passion and one arises in the first trance The one who arises in the realm of sexual passion accomplishes the impure factors of nine stages the one who arises in the first trance is with eight stages exception made for the stage of the realm of sexual passion Because with increase and abandonment both experience one existence one existence is spoken of Impure is that since that which is pure arises in higher ones it are lower ones that are accomplished That is why impure ones are spoken of   Is there somehow the acquisition and the abandonment of three gates of liberation when abiding in one ksana sometimes further the abandonment of two and when abandoning one again acquiring  Answer Indeed When arising in the realm of formlessness having to acquire the diamondlike samadhi in which  Samyuktabhidharmahrdaya the arhat abides When acquiring the three gates of liberation of the adept there is the abandonment of the three gates of liberation of the seeker It is abandoning the meditative attainment of cessation of conceptual identification and feeling and of the sphere of neitheridentificationnornonidentification When abandoning everything that is connected to falling back there is the acquisition of everything that is connected to progress Because in one instant there is both abandonment and acquisition one instant is spoken of The acquisition of the full overcoming comprehension of meditative attainment of cessation of conceptual identification and feeling and of nonidentification is said to be the abandonment of two That is why when abandoning one one is acquired  Is there somehow when settling the fruits of Sramanaship the accomplishment of the noble and of the nonnoble but no acquisition of the knowledge of destruction The one who can know explain Answer Indeed When knowledge of frustration of higher realisation arises knowledge of the origin has not arisen yet At that very moment there is accomplishment regarding what belongs to the eightynine fruits of sramanaship but regarding the four fruits of sramanaship there is no accomplishment There neither is the acquisition of a full overcoming comprehension Transgressing this invincible sea is what cannot be done with scarce power Discussion  According to my ability I now expose the very profound meaning Letting abundance be complete in relation to poor humans of the world is what is not possible with incompetence There surely is need for great effort Worldly treasures are easy to acquire the treasure wisdom is extremely difficult to acquire that is why when studying zealously one gradually has to enter the very profound knowledge for right liberation and for the road to nirvana as well as concerning the path of transmigration with false feelings Wisdom can extinguish bewilderment Just as the sur expels darkness Because of seeking for liberation one has to develop wisdom zealously The Sarvastivada bhiksu decorated the Abhidharma stanzas with the wish to let the wisdom of all beings gradually increase and to let them acquire liberation quickly THz ENGLIsH TRANSLATION Homage to the Omniscient One  The BuddhaSun The Taintless Disc Whose Words radiance doth shatter The minds darkness of gods and men The Source of evil abodes Homage to the Basis Of the Omniscients Words Which by abhidharma norms Uproot ignorance Of the Marks of Dharmas Homage to the Kindlers Of the bright lamp Which lights up the Munis words Veiled by the darkness of false assertions By those of lesser intelligence are frightened away Nevertheless the desire for proper understanding is always present in both cases It is with the intention of enabling them to enter with ease and delight into the deep whirlpool within the ocean of the characteristics of dharmas  the abhidharma that I have composed the present treatise   Part II The Category of Matter   Matter is of two kinds The Great Elements  and the derived matter   There are four Great Elements ie They are called spheres  as they sustain their specificallycommon characteristic  and the secondary matter These four Great Elements have respectively  solidity  humidity  heat and mobility as their specific nature  They are called the Great Elements because of their being both great and having the nature of an Element  Thus space  is not included among the Great Elements as by Element is meant the ability to produce its own fruit  They are said to be great as they are found in all secondary matter Thus there are only four Great Elements  because there is no use for more and there will be inaptitude  with regard to the fulfilment of the four functions if any one of them is lacking as in the case of a couch legs  The derived matter are of eleven kinds They are called derived matter because they exist in relation to the Great Elements that is to say they arise in dependence on the Great Elements   Among these  the eye is the basis for visual consciousness  Its function is the seeing of visible and its essence consists of subtle matter  The auditory gustatory olfactory and tactile faculties are to be understood in the same manner  The visible is of two kinds colours and shapes  Thus the Bhagavat has spoken of bad colours and bad shapes Among them there are twelve kinds of visibles which are colour blue  yellow  red  white  cloud  smoke  dust   ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE mist  shadow  sunlight  luminosity and darkness  There are eight kinds of visibles which are shapes long  short  square  round  high  low  even  uneven  Thus we have a total of twenty kinds of visibles  Herein mist is the water vapour from the earth Sunlight is the radiance of the sun Luminosity is that of the moon stars fire herbs gems and lightning etc Shadow is that which is born from obstruction to sunlight and luminosity  and where other visibles visible darkness is the contrary to this ie  A square shape is that whose boundary is square A round shape is one is circular A regular shape is even An irregular shape is uneven Other visibles will not be explained as they can be easily understood sesam sugamatvan na vipaiicitam These twentyone kinds are the objects of the visual consciousness as well as the mental consciousness induced thereby There are two kinds of sound differentiated as to whether they are caused by the Great Elements which are appropriated  or by those which are not appropriated  What is integrated into the human organism is said to be appropriated  which is to say conscious otherwise they are said to be unappropriated Those produced by the former are said to be caused by appropriated Great Elements  sounds of speech and the hands etc Those produced by the latter are said to be caused by unappropriated Great Elements  sounds of wind the forest etc Among the first kind of sound human speech relates to a being the other sounds do not relate to a being  These again are divisible as being agreeable or disagreeable manojiia amanojfa thus making a total of eight different kinds of sounds which are all objects of the auditory consciousness and the mental consciousness induced thereby There are three kinds of smell That which nourishes the Great Elements of the sense faculties is said to be a good smell That which does damage to them is said to be a bad smell All these three kinds of smell are the objects of the olfactory consciousness and of the mental consciousness induced thereby  There are six kinds of taste sweet  sour  salty  pungent  bitter and astringent  All these six kinds are the objects of the gustatory consciousness and the mental consciousness induced thereby  There are seven items which form part of the tangibles  smoothness  coarseness  heaviness  lightness  coldness  hunger and thirst   What is soft is said to be smooth its meaning being an agreeable tangible What is hard and rough is said to be coarse What can be weighed is said to be heavy otherwise light Coldness  hunger and thirst are respectively those under whose oppression there arises a desire for warmth  food and drink  In the last three cases the cause is designated by the name of its effect  It is like when one says The appearance of Buddhas is bliss etc This is a designation via negativa for a thing  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE which is analogous in nature to another Thus one calls a ksatriya a nonbrahmana etc  from a specific information action thought and Great Elements there arises in the actor a continuous series of wholesome or unwholesome matter which is noncumulative and which persists in the states of sleep wakefulness distracted thought nondistracted thought thought or unconsciousness  This is avijfapti Were this nonexistent it could not be legitimately established that there exist bhiksus etc  the Bhagavat for instance has this in view when he says that the merit of one who performs the meritorious act of material giving increases incessantly   this noninformation matter is of three kinds restraint  nonrestraint and neither restraint nor nonrestraint   Restraint is divided into three discipline  restraint meditation restraint and pure restraint bhiksu restraint bhiksuni restraint sramanera restraint siksamand restraint Sramaneri restraint updsaka restraint updasikd restraint and upavasa restraint These eight kinds of restraint belong to the sensesphere alone  The meditation restraint is a matter which coexists with the concentration of the finematerialsphere  It belongs to the finematerialsphere alone  The pure restraint is a matter which coexists with the pure concentrations  This does not belong to any of the three spheres  There arises a continuous series of unwholesome noninformation matter in the following persons butchers hunters birdcatchers robbers prisonwardens elephantcatchers  those who cook dogs  deertrappers  and executioners  The continuous series of various wholesome or unwholesome noninformation matter generated by the following acts is of the class of neither restraint nor nonrestraint the building of vihdra stupa and sangharama etc worshipping caitya burning incense scattering flowers singing religious hymns of praise making wishes etc as well as striking  ete  There is also some noninformation matter which is momentary It is with reference to the noninformation matter as a general class that we have described it as a continuous series  The acquisition and relinquishment of the three kinds of noninformation  The discipline restraints are acquired by making vows to undertake them The first seven kinds last until the end of ones life The eighth kind lasts for one day and one night  The first seven are terminated by four  conditions the giving up of the training that one has undertaken   death  the cutting off of the three roots of wholesomeness  and the simultaneous arising of both the sex organs ubhayavyafjanotpatti dvivyaiijanodaya The eighth discipline restraint is terminated by any of the aforesaid four conditions or by the end of the night  The meditation restraint belonging to the wholesome thought pertaining to the finematerialsphere is acquired when this wholesome thought is acquired and terminated when it is relinquished ie when one is out of the meditation The same is true for the acquisition and termination of the pure restraint which follows those of the pure thought  The nonrestraint is acquired by both doing and wilfully undertaking to do  By doing an action as for instance with a pure and ardent thought one worships a stipa with hymns or out of intense defilement one strikes  I shall never eat before having first made a mandala for the Buddha etc By the act of giving as for instance building monasteries making beds and seats  putting up parks and making offerings to the bhiksus etc This noninformation matter is terminated when the originating thought and the material base by making which the noninformation matter is induced are completely destroyed  All this noninformation matter and the aforementioned five faculties of vision etc are the objects cognizable by mental consciousness alone With this the exposition of the first Category matter is concluded   however concerning the characteristics of dharmas  They are in brief of three kinds specificallycommon characteristic  partiallycommon characteristic  and universallycommon characteristic   It is called riipa because it deteriorates or because it obstructs This is to say that it is susceptible to being oppressed or hurt  As the Dharmaking said Oh bhiksus the rijpaupadanaskandha is so named because it is subject to deterioration What causes the deterioration As soon as it is touched by the hand it deteriorates  This is like giving the name horse to which moves speedily  and cow to one which goes  etc  The partiallycommon characteristic is impermanence and unsatisfactoriness of all conditioned dharmas etc  The universallycommon characteristic is soullessness and emptiness  etc In this manner one is to understand the three characteristics with regard to all dharmas  Part II THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION II The Category of Sensation   There are three kinds of experience  pleasurable  Gi unpleasurable and neither pleasurable nor unpleasurable  As the Bhagavat has said conditioned by contact there arises sensation conditioned by sensation there arises craving  They are also divided into six following the six kinds of consciousness sensation born of visual contact etc up to sensation born of mental  contact Those which are conascent with the five consciousnesses are named physical sensations those which are conascent with mental consciousness are named mental sensation The pleasant physical sensations and the pleasant mental sensation of the third meditation where owing to the absence of the five consciousnesses there is no physical sensation are named the faculty of pleasure  Being pleasant means being beneficial  The unpleasant physical sensations are named the faculty of displeasure  Being unpleasant means being harmful  All the pleasant mental sensations with the exception of that in the third meditation are named the faculty of joy  The unpleasant mental sensations are named the faculty of sorrow  The physical and mental sensations which are neither pleasant nor unpleasant are named the faculty of equanimity  The detailed explanation on these is to be found under the expositions on faculties  etc The Category of Ideation   This is that which comprehends by combining conceptually the appearance  name and the signified  That is with regard to matter like blue yellow long and short  etc sounds like those of a conchshell a drum etc smells like those of gharuwood and musk etc tastes like those of saltiness and bitterness etc tangibles like those of hardness and softness etc dharmas like males and females etc  it comprehends them  by conceptually combining together their appearances names and signification It is the cause of reasoning and investigation  Thus this is named ideation  It is divided into six after the six consciousnesses as in the case of sensation It is differentiated into three accordingly as it is small big or immeasurable That is when it has a few objects it is named a small ideation  when it has big dharmas like Mount Sumeru etc as its objects it is named a big ideation  when it has the abode of infinite space etc as its objects it is named an immeasurable ideation   The differentiation of these three ideations may also be made after the three spheres of existence The Category of Conditionings   There are two kinds of conditionings conditionings conjoined with thought  and conditionings disjoined from thought  volition  contact  predilection  mental application  resolve  memory  concentration  understanding  reasoning  investigation  faith  vigour  modesty  shame  heedfulness  calm  harmlessness  equanimity  delight  disgust  faithlessness  slackness  heedlessness  the roots of wholesomeness  the roots of unwholesomeness  the nondefined roots  the fetters  the bondages  the proclivities   the secondary defilements  the envelopments   the outflows  the floods  the yokes  the clingings  the bodily ties  the hindrances  the knowledges  the receptivities  etc  These are said to be conjoined because of their being on a par with thought in five respects have the same basis  have the same object  have the same mode of activity  are simultaneous and because each of them has only one substance   The disjoined conditionings are those which do not conform to the five conditions above and which belong to the category of neither material nor mental They are  namely acquisition  nonacquisition  the ideationlessattainment  the cessationattainment  ideationlessness  the vital faculty  the grouphomogeneity  production  duration  deterioration  impermanence  the collection of words  the collection of complete phrases  and the collection of syllables  etc  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DocTRINE  All these conjoined and disjoined conditionings are collectively named the aggregate of conditionings  Thus has the Great Sage declared the agglomeration of the aggregate of conditionings is like the trunk of a banana tree IVa The Conjoined Conditionings    Volition is that which renders thought creative  it is mental karma This is also to say that it moves forth the thought It is differentiated into three kinds wholesome unwholesome and nondefined   Contact is that which is born of the coming together  of the faculty the object and consciousness and which enables thought to come in contact with the object It has the characteristic of enlivening the thoughtconcomitants  It is differentiated into three after the three sensations that which accords with the pleasurable sensation   the unpleasurable sensation  the neither pleasurable nor unpleasurable sensation  that of a trainee  of a nontrainee  and of one who is neither atrainee nor a nontrainee  The outflowfree mental applications in the seven trainees are named mental applications of trainees The outflowfree mental application in an arhat is named mental application of a nontrainee The mental application with outflows in an ordinary person is named mental application neither of a trainee nor a nontrainee it enables one to be free from diffidence with regard to an object perceived   Mindfulness is that which enables thought to remember an object clearly  ie not to forget what has been done  is now being done  or will be done in the future   Concentration is that which causes thought to be focused on an object It controls the monkeylike thought so that it operates on one object alone The Vaibhasika says thus Just as a snake that is confined in a bamboo pipe does not move in a crooked manner thought when concentrated  proceeds upright  Understanding is the discernment of dharmas It is the examination  as the case may be of the following eight kinds of dharmas It is also named discriminative reflection  Struck by the wind of ideation  it operates in a gross manner It is this dharma which serves as the projecting cause of the five consciousnesses  Investigation has the characteristic of causing thought to be subtle It is this dharma which serves as the cause that accords with the operation of mental consciousness on its object   Faith is that which causes the clarification of thought with regard to its object It is named faith on account of being receptivity based on direct realization  to the Three Jewels the causeeffect relationship and the existence   It is a dharma which removes mental turbidity  Just as a water cleansing gem  when placed inside a pond at once clarifies the turbid water likewise  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE the faithgem within the mindpond at once gets rid of all its turbidities Faith to the Buddhas attainment of Enlightenment to the Dharma as being wellexpounded  to the Samgha as being endowed with good conduct  as well as to dependentorigination  the true nature of dharma  which is not understood by the heretics  such is the domain of activities of faith  Vigour has the nature of being energetic in the production and cessation  of the wholesome and unwholesome dharmas That is it goads the thought of those sunk in the mire of transmigration to get out quickly  Modesty is that which conforms to the proper It is produced on account of the dominant influence of oneself and of the Dharma It is a mental freedom opposed to the emanation of craving  By virtue of this one abides respecting virtues and the virtuous  Shame has the cultivation of virtues as its precondition  It being opposed to the emanation of delusion  one scorns at lowly dharmas By virtue of this one dreads evil   Heedfulness is the cultivation of the wholesome dharmas  It is opposed to heedlessness  and is of the nature of guarding thought  Calm is the aptitude of the mind  It is opposed to torpor  and accords with the wholesome dharmas  Harmlessness is the mental goodness  By the force of this one does not harm others and becomes averse to the harmful activities in which others indulge  The equilibrium of thought is named equanimity  as it is the equanimity with regard to the aversion to the untrue and the inclination towards the true THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION  Delight  is gladness and inclination Seeing the virtue in what conduces to centrifugal process ones thought aspires for it and accords with the cultivation of the wholesome Because of the presence of this dharma ones thought rejoices in nirvana conjoined with this is named mental application to delight  Disgust is repulsion  Seeing the faults in what conduces to the centripetal process ones thought becomes averse to it and accords with detachment  Because of the presence of this dharma one is disgusted with samsara conjoined with this is named mental application of disgust  Faithlessness is the nonclarity of thought cetaso prasGda It is a dharma opposed to the faith  mentioned above  Slackness is the nonenergeticness of thought cetaso nabhyutsaha it is opposed to the vigour  mentioned above  Heedlessness is the noncultivation of wholesome dharmas  and is opposed to the heedfulness  mentioned above It is the inability to guard thought These last three dharmas faithlessness etc are not classified under the classes of proclivities  envelopments and taints  since their faults are light and they are easily abandonable nongreed  a dharma opposed to greed  nonhatred  a dharma opposed to hatred  and nondelusion  a dharma opposed to delusion and having the aforementioned understanding as its specific nature  These three dharmas are named the roots of wholesomeness because they are wholesome in their specific nature and are also productive of other wholesome dharmas Or again wholesome means being skilful through training  by reason of which one can  produce beautiful images greed  hatred and delusion  which are counteracted by the previous three  the greed belonging to the five classes in the sensesphere the hatred belonging to the five classes  and the thirtyfour forms of ignorance in the sensesphere excluding those conjoined with satkayadrsti and antagrahaarsti These three dharmas are named the roots of unwholesomeness because they are unwholesome  Or again unwholesome means insecure  as can bring about the germs of an undesirable existence Or again unwholesome means unskilful through lack of training asiksitay by reason by of which one produces bad images Thus in the world people call an artist akusala for producing unattractive images a There are four nondefined roots  craving  view  conceit  and ignorance  ie the greed belonging to the five classes in both the finematerial and immaterial spheres the twelve views in both the finematerial and immaterial spheres together with the satkayadrsti and antagrahaarsti in the sensesphere the conceit belonging to the five classes in both the finematerial and immaterial spheres all forms of ignorance in the finematerial and immaterial spheres together with those conjoined with the satkdyadrsti and the antagrahadrsti in the sensesphere b These four nondefined roots are acknowledged by us  for in the meditators there may be dominance in craving  or views  or in conceit  and these three are produced by reason of ignorance The Vaibhasikas acknowledge only three nondefined roots namely nondefined craving ignorance and the veilednondefined and nonveilednondefined understanding  Doubt and conceit are also excluded for they are not dharmas which are roots being unfirm and upwardmoving respectively c They are said to be nondefined as they cannot be defined as being either wholesome or unwholesome They are also undefinable as either  Part I THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION desirable or undesirable fruit They are named nondefined roots because they are nondefined by nature and are also productive of other nondefined defiled dharmas or nondefined dharmas It is named lust as it has the characteristic of attachment like melted lacquer  Lust itself is the fetter therefore it is named lustfetter  The hostility fetter is the hatred belonging to the five classes  It is named hostility as it is characterized by the delight in harming  and not being benevolent to sentient beings etc  just like bitter seeds Hostility itself is the fetter therefore it is named hostilityfetter  The conceit fetter is the conceit in the three  spheres It is named conceit as it is characterized by mental elevation  when one compares ones own virtues with those of others as in the case of an arrogant person  depreciating others It is further divided into seven kinds mdna atimdna manatimana asmimana abhimana inamana mithyamai  If with regard to these  clan  lineage  wealth  appearance  strength  observance of the precepts  learning  skill in the arts and crafts etc  others are inferior and one claims that one is superior or others are equal to one and one claims that one is equal the mental elevation so produced is named mana  If others are equal to one and one claims one is superior or if others are superior and one claims one is equal the mental elevation so produced is named atimana  If others are superior and one claims one is superior the mental elevation so produced is named manatimana  If one clings to the five aggregates of grasping paficopadana skandha as the Self or what pertains to the Self  the mental elevation so produced is asmimana  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE  If one has not attained the distinctive attainment of the fruit of streamentry and one claims that one has the mental elevation so produced is abhimana  If others excel one greatly in respect of clan and lineage etc and one claims that one is only a little inferior the mental elevation so produced is named tinamana  If one claims that one has virtues when in reality one has not the mental elevation so produced is named mithyamdna These seven kinds of conceit are collectively named the conceitfetter  The ignorance fetter is the nescience in the three spheres It is characterized by nondiscernment It is named avidya  nonknowledge because it is opposed to vidya  knowledge like a blind man  This is an expression negating the opposite  It is like calling those who are not friends  enemies  and words which are not true  etc untrue words  etc Ignorance itself is the fetter therefore it is named ignorancefetter  The view fetter is the three views namely satkayadrsti antagrahadrsti and mithyddrsti  The defiled understanding which clings to the idea that there truly exists the Self and what pertains to the Self in the five aggregates of grasping when in actual fact it does not exist is named satkayadrsti kdya means accumulation It is sati  existing and it is kaya therefore it is named satkdya  existing accumulation which is none other than the five aggregates of grasping The view which arises with regard to this is named satkayadrsti  The defiled understanding which clings to the ideas of annihilation and eternality with regard to these five aggregates of grasping when there is in fact neither is named antagrahadrsti as it is a clinging to the two extremes   Ifthe defiled understanding clings decisively to the nonexistence of karma the fruit of karma liberation and the path which leads to the attainment of liberation denying their reality it is named mithyddrsti These three views are named the viewfetter THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION  The irrational adherence fetter consists of two irrational adherences  those to views and to abstention and observances as ends in themselves rather than means to emancipation  The three aforementioned views and the five aggregates of grasping while in fact not excellent are irrationally adhered to as being excellent  this defiled understanding is the irrational adherence to views Irrational observances refer to the practices of the ways of crows chickens wild beasts  dogs of being naked pulling out the hair  fasting lying on ashes or repeatedly bathing in rivers which are falsely imagined to accrue merit and eradicate evils or surviving on roots fruits grasses vegetables and herbs alone or again applying ashes on the body keeping hairbuns etc  all these are called observances  The irrational adherence to abstention and observances is the defiled understanding which erroneously grasps at these two  abstention and observances  as paths leading to purification when in reality they are not The learned ones among the brahmins mostly cling to these as paths of purification but they are unable to attain ultimate purity These two irrational adherences are named the irrational adherencefetter  The doubt fetter is that which causes  hesitation in the mind with regard to the Four Noble Truths It is like being undecided when confronted with an intersection or a strawman The doubt itself is the fetter therefore it is named the doubtfetter  The jealousy fetter is that by virtue of which the mind becomes unable to bear the excellences of others When others acquire respect offering wealth learning and other excellences a person having this fetter becomes envious  This is the meaning of being unable to bear Jealousy itself is a fetter therefore it is named the jealousyfetter  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE  The avarice fetter is that which causes the mind to be hoarding with regard to ones own belongings and wealth What belongs to me must not go to others The avarice itself is the fetter therefore it is named the avaricefetter  The meaning of fetter is bondage  As the Bhagavat has said It is not the eyes that fetter the visible  nor the visible the eye The greed of desire therein is said to be the fetter Just as it is not the black bull that fetters the white bull nor the white bull the black bull and so on  The fetters that have been described above are also the bondages  as the meaning of the two terms are identical the greed bondage  which comprises all greed and is characterized by what has been described of the lust fetter the hatred bondage  which comprises all hatred and is characterized by what has been described of the hostility fetter and the delusion bondage  which comprises all delusion and is characterized by what has been described of the ignorance fetter The individual characteristics of these seven have been explained in the description of the fetters  Sensuality greed is so named as it is greed for sensual desire  the sensualgreed proclivity abandonable by insight into unsatisfactoriness and so on up to that abandonable by cultivation   The hostility proclivities are likewise five belonging to the five classes of abandonables in the sensesphere only  Parr I THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION  There are ten existence proclivities belonging to the five classes of abandonables of the finematerial and immaterial spheres only The greed in the two higher spheres is given the name existencegreed because it operates inwardly  and it is for the sake of stopping the notion that the meditations of the finematerial and immaterial spheres constitutes liberation   There are fifteen conceit proclivities  belonging to five classes of each of the three spheres  The same applies to the ignorance proclivities   There are thirtysix view proclivities there being twelve in each of the three spheres as follows In the sensesphere all the five views abandonable by insight into unsatisfactoriness only two views namely mithyddrsti and drstiparamarsa abandonable by insight into the origin and cessation only three views namely mithyaadrsti drstiparamarsa and Silavrataparamarsa abandonable by insight into path  thus totalling twelve  There are twelve doubt proclivities four belonging to the four classes of each of the three spheres namely those abandonable by insight into unsatisfactoriness its origin its cessation and the path leading to its cessation respectively  Among theseproclivities the sensualgreed and thehatred proclivities are classifiable with respect to the different classes only and not to the spheres or the modes of activity  The existencegreed doubt conceit and ignorance proclivities are classifiable with respect to the spheres and classes but not to the modes of activity spheres classes and modes of activity The view which is activated by the erroneous notion of the Self and what pertains to the Self is named satkayadrsti The view which is activated by that of annihilation and eternality is named antagrahadrsti The view which is activated  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE by that of nonexistence is named mithyddrsti The view which is activated by that of excellence is named drstiparamarsa The view which is activated by that of purification is named Silavrataparamarsa Developing in concordance with means growing by ways of taking objects and of being conjoined with the thought concomitants  These seven kinds of proclivities when subdivided with respect to the spheres the modes of activity and the classes become ninetyeight in number  In the sensesphere there are ten proclivities abandonable by insight into unsatisfactoriness namely satkdyadrsti antagrahadrsti mithyddrsti drstiparamarsa Silavrataparamarsa doubt greed hatred conceit and ignorance There are seven proclivities abandonable by insight into the origin  namely the aforementioned ten less satkdyadrsti antagrahadrstiand Silavrataparamarsa These seven proclivities are also abandonable by insight into the cessation  There are eight proclivities abandonable by insight into the path leading to the cessation of unsatisfactoriness namely aforementioned seven with the addition of silavrataparamarsa There are four proclivities abandonable by cultivation namely greed hatred conceit and ignorance Thus the total number of proclivities in the sensesphere is thirtysix There are thirtyone proclivities in the finematerial sphere namely the thirtysix in the sensesphere less the hatred under each of the five classes The same applied to the immaterial sphere  Thus the total number of proclivities in the three spheres is ninetyeight  Among these eightyeight are abandonable by the path of insight and ten by the path of cultivation   Part II THe ENGLISH TRANSLATION  Thirtythree are said to be universal  namely the views doubt together with the ignorance conjoined with these two and the unique ignorance  which are found in each spheres and which are abandonable by insight into unsatisfactoriness and its origin The rest are nonuniversal   Eighteen take outflowfree objects  namely the mithyadrsti doubt together with the ignorance conjoined with them and the unique ignorance which are in each of the three spheres and which are abandonable by insight into the cessation of unsatisfactoriness and the path leading to it As these eighteen take the cessation and the path as their objects they are said to take outflowfree objects The rest all take objects with outflow  Here those which take objects with outflow become intensified in concordance with the objects they take and the concomitants conjoined Those which take outflowfree objects become intensified only by being conjoined with their own group ie with those of their own class and spheres   Nine take unconditioned objects namely the mithyadrsti doubt together with the ignorance conjoined with them and the unique ignorance which are in each spheres and which are abandonable by insight into the cessation  They are said to take unconditioned objects as they take the Truth of Cessation as object The rest all take conditioned objects   Ten proclivities arise sequentially as follows  First owing to ignorance one does not understand the Four Noble Truths  That is there is the disinclination with regard to the examination of the Truths of Unsatisfactoriness etc up to the disinclination with regard to that of the Path   From not understanding there arises doubt  Having listened to both the true and the false  one becomes doubtful miidhasya paksadvayam Ssrutva vicikitsotpadyate Is it unsatisfactoriness or not etc up to Is it the Path or not  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE  From this doubtfulness there arises false view  Meeting with evil companions one from hearing the false and thinking erroneously gives rise to erroneous conclusions   From this false view there arises satkayadrsti One denies that there is unsatisfactoriness in the aggregates of grasping and clings to that there are the Self and what pertains to the Self  From satkdyadrsti there arises antagrahadrsti as one then clings to the extremities of eternality or annihilation of the Self  From antagrahadrsti there arises silavrataparamarsa as one then believes that the extreme to which one clings to is conducive to purification   From Silavrataparamarsa there arises drstipardmarSa as one believes that this being conducive to purification is the best   From this drstipardmarsa there arises greed as one then becomes deeply attached to ones own views   From this greed there arises conceit as one being deeply attached to ones own views become arrogant and despises others  From this conceit there arises hatred Being arrogant with ones own views one is unable to tolerate others and definitely gives rise to resentment Or this resentment may arise when with regard to ones own views one adopts and gives up  Such is the order of the ten proclivities THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION  The defilements are so named because they perturb and afflict  the psychophysical series These are none other than the proclivities  The defilements are also called secondary defilements  There are also secondary defilements comprising all the other defiled thoughtconcomitants included under the aggregate of conditionings as they are included under the same aggregate as the defilements But they are not named defilements as they are not fundamental What then are these They are deceptiveness  pride  harmfulness  depraved opinionatedness  enmity  dissimulation  etc  There are innumerable kinds of them as explained in the Noble Teaching  Deceptiveness is the deluding of others   Pride has the nature of being arrogant and caring for noone  which results from an attachment to ones own physical appearance strength lineage purity of precept learning and eloquence etc  Harmfulness is the harming of others as a result of which one practises the acts of beating and scolding etc  Depraved opinionatedness is the clinging to various reproachable things  as a result of which one would not accept any rightful admonition   Enmity is the harbouring of hatred within and not letting go of it which results from the repeated thinking over of the objects of anger  Dissimulation is the crookedness of the mind   These six being born of the defilements and gross in their defiling nature are named defilement taints   Among the six deceptiveness and pridearetheemanations of greed as they are derived from hatred greed   Harmfulness and enmity are the emanations of hatred as they are derived from hatred   ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DocTRINE  The depraved opinionatedness taint is just the emanation of drstiparamarsa as he who clings to his own views as being the best vexes himself as well as others  The dissimulation taint is just the emanation of the various views as those in whom views predominate are mostly dissimulative thus it is said By crookedness is meant the evil views  These taints and envelopments as well as the remaining defiled thoughtconcomitants included under the aggregate of conditionings are all named secondary defilements as they are born of the defilements  There are ten envelopments It is the heaviness   Drowsinessis the inability to sustain the psychophysical series  It causes mental compression  This is classified as an envelopment only when it is defiled  Restlessness is that which causes nontranquility of the mind   kaukrtya is the being of that which is badly done  a distinct thoughtconcomitant which arises by taking this kaukrtya as its object  is given the name kaukrtya Its meaning is remorse  This is the case of giving the name of the cause to its fruit It is just like giving the name emptiness to that which takes emptiness as its object and impurity to that which takes impurity as its object Similarily in the world one speaks in terms of the habitat  as when one says coming from all the villages towns meaning the people coming from these places It is classified as an envelopment also only when it is defiled  The characteristics of jealousy and avarice have already been discussed in the section on fetters   Part II THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION  Immodesty is that which causes disrespect to virtues and those who are virtuous It is a dharma opposed to respectfulness  Shamelessness is one not to see the fearful consequences of evil  evil means that which is condemned by the good ones   Anger is excluding hostility and harmfulness that which causes hatefulness with regard to the sentient and the nonsentient  Concealment is the hiding of ones own evil  These ten are given the name envelopments as they envelop ones psychophysical series Among them torpor drowsiness and immodesty are the emanations of ignorance Remorse is the emanation of doubt Shamelessness avarice and restlessness are th e emanations of greed Jealousy and anger are the emanations of hatred Concealment is the emanation of craving and ignorance    The modes of activity of the thoughtconcomitants are subtle  It is difficult enough to analyse each individual series of a single thoughtconcomitant how much more so when they coexist in a moment  Those of fine intelligence who have on the basis of the Buddhas teachings understood the differences in their nature by observing the differences in their effect expound them to the students without falsification  There are however some of lesser intelligence who do not have the opportunity of receiving personal instructions from those masters who explain the Buddhas words without falsification As a result they are deluded as regards the thoughtconcomitants and deny asserting that there exist only three or that they do not exist at all  There are three kinds of outflows   The sensuality outflow consists of all the defilements and envelopments in the sensesphere with the exception of ignorance There are altogether fortyone entities hati namely thirtyone proclivities and ten envelopments  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE  The existence outflow consists of all the defilements and envelopments in the finematerial and immaterial spheres with the exception of ignorance There are altogether fiftyfour entities namely twentysix proclivities in each of the two upper spheres as well as torpor and restlessness The name existence outflow is given to the two spheres collectively because they all are morally nondefined  operate inwardly and pertain to the stage of concentration   The ignorance outflow consists of all the ignorance in the three spheres There are altogether fifteen entities namely the ignorance belonging to each of the five classes of abandonables in each of the three spheres Ignorance is separately classified as an outflow etc as it is the root of all forms of existence  The outflows are so named because they keep beings for a long time in the three spheres of existence hindering their progress towards liberation Or because they cause beings to flow round from the highest plane of existence to  the Avici hell Or because they incessantly discharge inexhaustible impurities through the six woundlike entrances  the six sense faculties  of beings   There are four floods  sensuality flood  existence flood  view flood and ignorance flood   The sensuality flood consists of all the sensuality outflows with the exception of the views There are altogether twentynine entities   The existence flood consists of all the existence outflows excluding the views There are altogether thirty entities  The view flood consists of the views in the three spheres There are altogether thirtysix entities  The ignorance flood consists of the conjoined and the unique ignorance in the three spheres There are altogether fifteen entities THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION  They are given the name floods as they drift away the good things of beings as does a flood  There are four kinds of yoke  Their descriptions are as those on the floods They are given the name yokes as they join beings into unsatisfactoriness in the various planes of existence  births and stages   The sensuality clinging consists of the sensuality floods with the addition of ignorance There are altogether thirtyfour entities namely five categories each of greed hostility conceit and ignorance four doubts ten envelopments   The Soultheory clinging consists of the existence flood with  the addition of ignorance There are altogether forty entities namely ten each of greed conceit ignorance eight doubts as well as torpor and restlessness  The view clinging consists of all the views excluding the irrational adherence to abstentions and vows There are altogether thirty entities  The clinging to abstentions and vows are none other than the irrational adherence to abstention and vows There are altogether six entities Among the five views the irrational adherence to abstentions and vows is singled out and given the name clinging because this alone is a foe to the Noble Path  and it deceives both the householders and those who have left the homelife  deceived by this the householders believe fasting consuming air and falling from mountain cliffs etc to be the paths leading to heavens  deceived by this those who have left the homelife believe the complete abandoning of agreeable objects and the practice of asceticism to be the means of purification   ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE  The meanings of clingings are as follows Fuel y because it enables the fire of karma to continue blazing and growing Just as when there is fuel the fire can keep blazing likewise when there are defilements the karma of beings can grow Forcefulness  Envelopment Just as a silkworm within a cocoon envelops itself with its silkthreads to death likewise beings enveloped by the four clingings go round the cycle of births and deaths losing their wisdomlife  There are four bodily ties  bodily tie of covetousness  bodily tie of malice  bodily tie of irrational adherence to abstentions and vows  and bodily tie of dogmatism  The greed belonging to the five classes in the sensesphere constitute the first bodily tie The hatred belonging to the five classes in the sensesphere consititute the second kdyagrantha The six Silavrataparamarsas constitute the third kayagrantha The five drstiparamarsas constitute the fourth kayagrantha They are given the name kdyagrantha as they variously tie round sentient beings The hatred belonging to the five classes in the sensesphere constitutes the second hindrance The torpor and the unwholesome drowsiness in the sensesphere constitute the third hindrance The restlessness and the unwholesome remorse in the sensesphere constitute the fourth hindrance The doubts belonging to the four classes constitute the fifth hindrance They are given the name hindrances because they are the obstacles for the Noble Path for detachment and for the two roots of wholesomeness which are preparatory for these two x Earlier on  it was mentioned that suffer in the various spheres planes of existence forms of birth and stages We shall now explain what these spheres planes of existence births and stages are x The sensesphere comprises twenty regions as follows Eight great hells Four human regions in the four continents Six heavens of sensuality namely Thus we have a total of twenty regions x There are sixteen regions in the finematerial sphere as follows Two regions in the first dhyana namely Brahmakayika Brahma purohita Three heavens in the second dhyana namely Parittabha  Apramanabha Abhasvara Three heavens in the third dhyana namely The number of heavens is not eighteen  since the two heavens Mahabrahma and Asamjtin do not form separate regions being merely an elevated abode in the Brhatphala heaven and the Brahmapurohita heaven respectively  x Although in the immaterial sphere there is no spatial division into upper and lower regions there are four different dimensions of existence  namely the dimension of infinite space  the dimension of infinite consciousness  the dimension of nothingness  and the dimension of neitherideationnornonideation   ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DocTRINE x There are four forms of births namely birth from eggs  birth from wombs  birth from moisture and apparitional birth  x There are eleven stages  namely the sensesphere the notyetreached stage  the intermediate dhyana   the dhydnas in the finematerial sphere and  the four in the immaterial sphere x  the sensesphere and the bhavagra stages are always with outflows The remaining nine stages may either be outflowfree or withoutflow  There are ten kinds of knowledge  namely the knowdge of dharma  the subsequent knowledge  the conventional knowledge  the knowledge of others mind  the knowledge of unsatisfactoriness  the knowledge of the origin  the knowledge of the cessation  the knowledge of the Path  knowledge of exhaustion  knowledge of nonarising   The knowledge of the dharma comprises the outflowfree knowledge with regard to the conditionings of the sensesphere and to their cause cessation their preparatory path  their unhindered path their path of liberation  their path of progressadvancementdistinction  and the outflowfree knowledges with regard to the stage of the knowledge of the dharma Beings from the beginningless time have constantly been obsessed by the attachment to the Self  By virtue of this knowledge one now for the very first time sees the dharmas thus it receives the name knowledge of the dharma  The subsequent knowledge comprises the outflowfree knowledge in the conditionings of the finematerial and immaterial spheres and in their cause their cessation their preparatory path their unhindered path their path of liberation their path of progressadvancementdistinction  Part I It receives the name subsequent knowledge as its arising follows that of the knowledge of the dharma  The conventional knowledge comprises those understanding which are withoutflow It is named conventional knowledge as it operates mostly on things of conventional existence such as jugs garments etc This knowledge is of two kinds defiled and undefiled those which are of the nature of view and those which are not The former comprises the five views  satkayadrsti mithyadrsti drstiparamarsa and silavrataparamarsa The latter comprises the understanding conjoined with doubt greed hatred conceit ignorance anger harmfulness etc The wholesome ones if coexistent with the five consciousnesses are also not views and are both understanding and knowledges If they coexist with the mental consciousness  they belong to the category of mundane right views  as well as being understanding and knowledges  The knowledge of others mind is a knowledge born of concentration  It knows the mind and thoughtconcomitants of others belonging to the sensesphere and the finematerial sphere and some of the outflowfree mental states which are present and similar in kind  This knowledge is of two kinds outflowfree and withoutflow The ones with outflows can know the mind and thoughtconcomitants of others belonging to the sensesphere and the finematerialsphere The former ones know the mind and thoughtconcomitants belonging to the category of the knowledge of the dharma The latter one knows the mind and thoughtconcomitants belonging to the category of the subsequent knowledge  This knowledge does not know matter the unconditioned the conditionings disjoined from the mind It also does not know the mind and  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE thoughtconcomitants pertaining to the past the future and the immaterial sphere or to those who are superior when considered from the point of view of faculty stage or the states of attainment of the noble persons   The knowledge of unsatisfactoriness is the outflowfree knowledge which realizes with regard to the five aggregates of grasping as fruit  their aspects of being impermanent  unsatisfactory  empty and soulless   The knowledge of origin is the outflowfree knowledge which realizes with regard to the five aggregates of grasping as cause  their aspects of being cause  origin  successive causation and condition   The knowledge of cessation is the outflowfree knowledge which realizes with regard to the cessation of these  the aspects of being cessation  calm  excellence and escape   The knowledge of the path is the outflowfree knowledge which realizes with regard to the path which is the counteraction to these and which leads to Nirvana its aspects of being a path  right method  course of practice and conducive to exit   The knowledge of exhaustion is the outflowfree knowledge which gives rise to the realization of exhaustion when it reflects thus The unsatisfactoriness has been known by me its origin has been annihilated by me its cessation has been realized by me the path has been cultivated by me  The knowledge of nonarising is the outflowfree knowledge which gives rise to the realization of nonarising when it reflects thus The unsatisfactoriness has been known by me there is no more to be known the knowledges of exhaustion and of nonarising are not of the nature of view  as they do not make  Part II The knowledge of others mind is always of the nature of view The remaining six knowledges may be either of the nature of view or not of the nature of view  The conventional knowledge is always with outflows The knowledge of others mind may be either with outflow or outflowfree The remaining eight knowledges are always outflowfree  The knowledge of cessation takes only the unconditioned as its object  The knowledge of others mind of unsatisfactoriness of origin and of the path take only the conditioned as their objects The remaining five knowledges may take either conditioned or the unconditioned as their objects  The knowledges of unsatisfactoriness and of origin take only objects with outflows The knowledges of cessation and the path take only outflowfree objects The remaining six knowledges may take either outflowfree objects or objects with outflows  The knowledge of the dharma exists in six stages   namely the four dhydanas the notyetreached stage and  the intermediate dhyana The subsequent knowledge exists in nine stages namely the aforementioned six stages and the first three of the immaterial dhyanas The knowledge of others mind exists in four stages namely the four dhydnas The conventional knowledge exists in all the stages Among the remaining six knowledges those belonging to the category of the knowledge of the dharma exist in six stages and those belonging to the category of the subsequent knowledge exist in nine stages  There are eight kinds of receptivity  ie the receptivity to the knowledge of the dharma with regard to unsatisfactoriness its origin its cessation and the path leading to its cessation and the receptivity to the subsequent knowledge  with regard to the same  These eight are distinct kinds of understanding which conduce to the knowledges of certitude free from doubt They are named receptivities as they are receptive  to the Four Noble Truths of unsatisfactoriness etc Among the various kinds of receptivities these eight are exclusively of the nature of the examination of dharma They are views and understanding and not knowledges  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE in their ownnature The meaning of knowledge is certitude In these eight the desire to investigate has not ceased and as they are not yet capable of judging decisively they are not named knowledges  The receptivity to the knowledge of the dharma with regard to unsatisfactoriness ceases at the same time as the acquisition of the ten proclivities abandonable by insight into unsatisfactoriness  in the sensesphere the first when the proclivity is being counteracted the second when the proclivity has been fully abandoned  they counteract the ten kinds of proclivities abandonable by insight into unsatisfactoriness in the sensesphere just as  one man stays indoors and drives the thief out while the other closes the doors so as to prevent him from entering again  The receptivity to the subsequent knowledge with regard to unsatisfactoriness ceases at the same time as the acquisition of the eighteen proclivities abandonable through insight into unsatisfactoriness in the finematerial and immaterial spheres Immediately following this the subsequent knowledge with regard to unsatisfactoriness coarises with the disconnectionacquisition of these  The rest of the description is as above  These four thought effect a direct comprehension of the Truth of Unsatisfactoriness in the three spheres Similarily there are four thought for each of the Origin Cessation and the Path  These sixteen thought effect a direct comprehension of the Four Truths the abandonment of the eightyeight proclivities abandonable by insight  and the attainment of the fruit of streamentry   There remains ten kinds of proclivities abandonable by cultivation  four in the sensesphere and three each in the  Part II THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION finematerial and immaterial spheres The four kinds of proclivity in the sensesphere is like a bundle of straw grouped into nine parts  from the upperupper division to the lowerlower division Their counteractive paths  the unhindered paths and liberationpaths  are likewise divided into nine from the lowerlower division which counteracts the upperupper division of proclivity etc up to the upperupper division which counteracts the lowerlower divisions of proclivity  When six divisions are gotten rid of one acquires the fruit of oncereturnership   When all the nine divisions are gotten rid of one acquires the fruit of nonreturnership   Just as in the case of the four proclivities in the sensesphere which are divided into nine corresponding to which there are also nine divisions of thecounteractive paths of irresistibility and liberation Likewise there are four stages each in the finematerial and the immaterial spheres and in each of these stages both the counteractive and the counteracted have nine divisions When the lowerlower division in the stage of the existencepeak is gotten rid of one acquires the fruit of arhatship  The paths in between the four fruits and the preceding path of insight are named the four progresses  Accordingly as the fruit it precedes it is named the progress towards that particular fruit  Thus there are eight noble persons namely four progressing towards and four dwellers in the fruits  These progresses and fruits are divided into six by reason of the difference in the families  as follows  Worldlings belonging to the families of blunt and sharp faculties in the fifteen thoughtmoments of entering into the path of insight receive the names of faithpursuer aand doctrinepursuer  respectively from the sixteenth thoughtmoment up to the stage of Vajralike  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE concentration  receive the names of faithliberated and viewattained respectively  The same two persons on reaching the stage of the nontrainee  ie from the first knowledge of exhaustion up to the final thoughtmoment  receive the names of contingentlyliberated and noncontingentlyliberated respectively  The word etc refers to the fact that the different categories of thoughtconcomitants are innumerable They are named thoughtconcomitants as they exist in dependence on the mind  just as mine indicates that which exists in dependence on the I  All these thoughtconcomitants receive the name of conjoined conditionings Conditionings disjoined from the mind   The disjoined conditionings are opposed to those discussed above One is in possession of a certain dharma   There are three kinds of dharmas pure  impure and nondefined  The pure dharmas comprise faith etc the impure greed etc and the nondefined the mind of transformation  etc One who possesses these dharmas is said to be in possession of the dharma The cause of certitude for such an assertion is named acquisition  obtainment  and endowment    Were it nonexistent when defilements like greed etc manifest in a trainee  he would not be an arya since he is then without an outflowfree mind  when a wholesome or nondefined mind arises in a worldling  he ought then be known as one who is already detached   Moreover in the absence of the acquisition of Nirvana the arya and the worldlings would be mutually alike on and ought to be both named worldlings or arya  Parr Il Thus the Dharmaking has said By reason of the arising  the obtainment  the endowment of the ten dharmas of a nontrainee one is named an Grya who has completely abandoned the five members of the lower section of the fetters  etc Again the Bhagavat has said O bhiksus among beings who possess wholesome and unwholesome dharmas I perceive that in their mental series the wholesome and unwholesome acquisitions increase infinitely has spoken thus O bhiksus you should not make any comparison as regards the superiority or inferiority of beings You should not falsely imagaine the depth or shallowness of the virtues of the persons Hence we know that apart from the dharmas there are definitely acquisitions which are real entities  This acquisition is of two kinds The obtainment abha pratilambha at the present moment of what has not been acquired or what has been lost  the endowment of what has been obtained and not lost Nonacquisition is the contrary to this  Of what dharmas are there acquisitions and nonacquisitions There are acquisitions and nonacquisitions of ones own series  and of the two cessations  There are no the series of another person as noone can be endowed with dharmas belonging to a different person or of a nonseries as noone can be endowed with dharmas not belonging to a sentient being or of the  Space  of which noone can have endowment What do not have acquisition likewise do not have nonacquisition  There are three kinds of acquisitions acquisitions which coarise with the dharmas acquired  like a shadow which follows the figure Acquisitions which are anterior to the dharmas acquired  like the leading bull in front of the herd Acquisitions which are posterior to the dharmas acquired  like a calf which follows behind   The first kind of acquisitions are mostly like those of nonveilednondefined dharmas All the nonveilednondefined dharmas and the veilednondefined information matter  have only simultaneous acquisitions excluding the supernormal faculties of vision and audition and the transformationthought which being strong and achieved through a special effort  can have all the three kinds of acquisitions and excluding a small part among the arts and crafts and deportment which have been intensely practised They do not have anterior and posterior acquisitions on account of their feebleness  All the remaining dharmas can have the posterior anterior and simultaneous acquisitions  The acquisition of a wholesome dharma can be wholesome only The acquisition of an unwholesome dharma can be unwholesome only The acquisition of a nondefined dharma can be nondefined only  The acquisition of a sensesphere dharma to the sense sphere only The acquisition of a finematerial sphere dharma to the finematerial sphere only The acquisition of an immaterial sphere dharma to the immaterial sphere only  The acquisitions of outflowfree dharmas may belong to any of the three spheres or they may be outflowfree By outflowfree dharmas are meant the Truth of the Path and the three unconditioned dharmas as all of them do not belong to any of the three spheres  The acquisition of the Truth of the Path is outflowfree only the acquisition of the cessation independent of deliberation may belong to any of the three spheres As for the acquisition of the cessation through deliberation  It may belong to the finematerial sphere or the immaterial sphere accordingly as the nirodha is acquired by a path of the finematerial sphere or of the immaterial sphere It is with outflows if the cessation is acquired by a worlding by means of a mundane path  and outflowfree if acquired by an drya It is outflowfree when the cessation is acquired by an outflowfree path THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION Thus in general the acquisitions of outflowfree dharmas are fourfold   The acquisitions of the trainee dharmas are of the trainee type only The acquisitions of nontrainee dharmas dharmas pertaining to a nontrainee  are of the nontrainee type only The acquisitions of neithertraineenornontrainee dharmas  dharmas pertaining to one who is neither a trainee nor a nontrainee  are of three kinds the neithertraineenornontrainee dharmas comprise those which are with outflows and the unconditioned  The acquisitions of the dharmas with outflows and of the cessation independent of deliberation are of the type neithertraineenornontrainee only For the cessation through deliberation if it is brought about by a trainee path its acquisition is of the trainee type only ifit is brought about by a nontrainee path its acquisition is of the nontrainee type only if it is brought about by a mundane path its acquisition is of the neithertraineenornontrainee type only  The acquisitions of dharmas abandonable by insight are of the type  abandonable by insight only The acquisitions of dharmas abandonable by  cultivation are of the type abandonable by cultivation only the nonabandonable dharmas comprise the Truth of the Path as well as the unconditioned  The acquisition of the Truth of the Path is of the nonabandonable type only The acquisitions of cessation independent of deliberation are of the type abandonable by cultivation only as they are nondefiled  and without outflows if they are brought about by a mundane path their acquisitions are of the type abandonable by cultivation only if they are brought about by an outflowfree path their acquisitions are of the nonabandonable type only  Allnonacquisitions are of the nonveilednondefined nature only  However each of the past and future dharmas has nonacquisitions belonging to the three periods of time  For the present dharmas they have no present nonacquisitions as acquisitions and  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DocTRINE nonacquisitions are contradictory to each other in nature and hence do not coarise and as it is impossible that what can be possessed in the present moment is not possessed They have however past and future nonacquisitions  Dharmas belonging to the sensuality finematerial and immaterial spheres as well as the outflowfree dharmas each has nonacquisitions belonging to the three spheres There can be no outflowfree nonacquisitions as there is in a nonacquisition the worldlingquality which is never outflowfree Thus it is said What is the worldlingquality It is the nonobtainment of the dharmas of the Noble Ones  Now this nonobtainment is just a synonym for nonacquisition Besides all nonacquisitions being of the nondefined nature only cannot be outflowfree  The ideationless attainment   When one has been detached with regard to the third but not to the fourth dhyana there is a disjoined dharma named the ideationless attainment which can cause the cessation of the thought and thoughtconcomitants of one in the stage of the fourth dhyana Although all thought and thoughtconcomitants are ceased when one produces this attainment it receives the name Tdeationless as it is for the special purpose of eradicating ideations  It is like the name Knowledge of Others Thought given to that knowledge specially concerned with the knowing of others mind even though it knows both the thought and the thoughtconcomitants of others  This Ideationless attainment is wholesome and is subsumed under the fourth dhydna It is produced in the series of a nondrya only for it is produced with the thought of seeking liberation falsely conceived as the state of ideationlessness The arya  think of this state as an evil plane of existence and are deeply disgusted with it From the point of view of retribution it is necessarily retributed  It is retributable in the following existence only  It is acquired by exerting effort and not by detachment   The cessation attainment   When one has been detached with regard to the abode of nothingness  there is a disjoined dharma the cessation of the thought and thoughtconcomitants of one in the existencepeak As it causes the even continuation of the Great Elements it is named the cessationattainment   Part I It is retributable in the following existence  or in the existence after the next  or not necessarily retributable  It is not necessarily retributable because having produced this attainment one then attains Parinirvana without having acquired its retribution  This attainment can effect the retribution of the four aggregates in the existencepeak stage as the latter is immaterial in nature  Only the dryas are capable of producing this attainment not the ordinary people for it is produced by virtue of the Gryapath The worldings  dread it as annihilation  and being without the strength of the aryapath are incapable of producing it The dryas obtain it through exertion  and not by detachment It is only in the case of a Buddha Bhagavat that its obtainment is said to be by detachment At the very moment of obtaining the Knowledge of Exhaustion He is already capable of producing this attainment at will  the qualities  of a Buddha are not through any exertion they appear before Him as soon as He desires them  it is that He is said to have obtained it  For those born among the deities who are ideationless beings there is a dharma named ideationlessness which causes the cessation of the thought and thoughtconcomitants It is a real entity  It is said to be born of retribution  being the retributionfruit of the ideationlessattainment and nondefined  The heaven named the Ideationless Heaven is an elevated abode in the Greatfruit heaven  just as in the heaven of the Brahmapurohita of the first dhydna there is an elevated abode named the Intermediate Dhyana which is the residence of the Mahdbrahman deities  These ideationless beings are so named because they possess ideation at birth and death they are without it in between At the time of  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE death they produce mentation anew like one waking up after a long sleep Shortly after they pass away to be reborn in the sensesphere and nowhere else for those who are to be born in the Ideationless Heaven necessarily possess a karma retributable in the sensesphere in the existence after the next just as those who are to be born in the Uttarakuru necessarily possess a karma which will lead to rebirth in a heavenly plane of existence   projected by previous karma serving as the cause for the uninterrupted series of the six entrances of the human personality and forming the basis for the designation of the four births and the five planes of existences  this is named the vital faculty It is the lifeprinciple of the three spheres of existence It has a substantial essence and sustains heat and consciousness  as the gatha goes When Life heat and consciousness  these three dharmas  leave the human body The abandoned body lies stiff Unconscious like a log When the retribution has been experienced it is called hell  and so on up to the plane of neitherideationnornonideation Now apart from the vital faculty there could be no any other dharma of the nature of a faculty found in all the three spheres  continuing uninterrupted for a given period of existence and forming the basis for the designation of the four births and five planes of existence  born in the immaterialsphere when he gives rise to a wholesome or defiled thought pertaining to his own stage or to a higher one or an outflowfree thought pertaining to a lower stage  at these times by means of what can his existence a retribution which is necessarily always withoutflow and nondefined in nature be designated in terms of birth and plane of existence since in this case there exist neither the five material entrances constituting the body retributed by karma nor the nondefined mental consciousness retributed by karma When born transformationally into a heavenly  Part II THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION plane of existence gives rise to a wholesome or defiled thought we ought to say that he is dead And when he gives rise to a nondefined thought we ought to say that he is born anew  Such are the serious incongruities if one denies the existence of the vital faculty  Grouphomogeneity   The grouphomogeneity is the cause for the similarities in striving and inclination among sentient beings sattvandm ekartharucih sadrSyahetubhiita nondifferentiated  and differentiated   In the first case all sentient beings equally have selfattachment  aresimilarily nourished by food and have similar inclinations This cause of sameness is named the grouphomogeneity  In the second case sentient beings may belong to different spheres stages planes of existence births caste  they may be male female updsaka bhiksu trainee nontrainee etc Within each being   there is a dharma which is the distinguishable cause  for the similarity in striving and inclination among members of the same category If this were nonexistent there would be confusion in all the conventional a  usages such as arya nonarya etc  What difference is there between the worldlingquality and the grouphomogeneity of worldlings  The cause for the homogeneity in inclination etc is said to be their homogeneity  The worldlingquality is that which causes the doing of all unprofitable things  Thus it is said in the siitra O bhiksus I say that there is not the slightest evil which the foolish uninstructed worldlings are incapable of committing Again the Bhagavat has said If he comes to the human world and acquires the humanhomogeneity  Now unlike the case of homogeneity it is not the case that at the times of birth and death there is the acquisition and relinquishment respectively of the worldlingquality Hence there is a  difference between the worldlingquality and the homogeneity  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DocTRINE The four characteristics of the conditioned dharmas  When dharmas are produced there is a force of internal cause which makes them achieve their specific functions vrtti  vyapara  samarthya It is this internal cause that is called the productioncharacteristic  The causes of production of dharmas are twofold internal and external The former is the productioncharacteristic and the latter comprises the six causes or the four conditions  If the productioncharacteristic were nonexistent the conditioned dharmas would be just like the Space etc which in spite of the assemblage of external causes and conditions never arises Or like Space etc are also capable of arising and hence become conditioned in nature This indeed is a great incongruity Thus we can infer from this that there exists a distinct productioncharacteristic  The cause which enables to stay temporarily so as to be able to project a distinct fruit is named the durationcharacteristic  When a conditioned dharma is staying temporarily it has the power of projecting a distinct fruit This internal cause which enables to stay temporily in this power of projecting a distinct fruit is named the durationcharacteristic If this durationcharacteristic were nonexistent when the conditioned dharmas are staying temporarily they ought not be further able to project a distinct fruit Hence it can be inferred that there exists a distinct duration characteristic  Deterioration is that which impairs a dharmas efficacy of projecting fruit rendering it incapable of further projecting another distinct fruit If a conditioned dharma did not have the change  characteristic which impairs its activity  how is it that it does not keep on projecting one distinct fruit after another and thus leading to ad infinitum Besides if this be the case ought not be momentary in nature Hence we can infer from this that there exists a distinct dharma named the deteriorationcharacteristic  Impermanence is that which causes a present dharma whose activity having been impaired to enter into the past There exists a distinct dharma named disappearance  characteristic which causes to go from the present into the past If this were nonexistent  Part  THE ENGLisH TRANSLATION dharmas ought not to disappear Or Space etc would also disappear  a These four are the conditionedcharacteristics of the conditioned  possessing these four conditionedcharacteristics is said to be conditioned This is not the case for Space etc b The Bhagavat however has said There are three conditioned characteristics of the conditioned The arising of the conditioned can be known Their disappearance and durationchange can also be known Duration is the characteristic which supports the conditioned dharmas and make them stay and to which beings easily get attached unlike the other three characteristics which cause the transitoriness of the conditioned dharmas helping them traverse through the three periods of time Thus in order that beings to be trained may get disgusted with the conditioned the Bhagavat did not enumerate duration separately as one of the four characteristics  The two characteristics duration and change are spoken of together as one just as S and Kalakarni    Thus there are definitely four characteristics of the conditioned lc It is not the case as the Sautrantika assert that these four characteristics are identical in substance with the conditioned dharmas characterized If they had exactly the same substance the consequence would be that just as the characterized and the characteristics are identical in substance the characteristics ought also not be mutually different If so dharmas ought to be produced when they are actually disappearing and disappearing when they are being produced Or they are never produced at all d These four primary characteristics  being themselves conditioned like the dharmas they characterize possess four secondary characteristics  viz e This however does not lead to an infinite regression Each of the four primary characteristics characterizes eight dharmas each of the secondary characteristics can characterize only one dharma Now it has to be understood that when a dharma is produced nine dharmas  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE including itself coarise the dharma itself the four primary characteristics and the four secondary characteristics Among the primary characteristics production produces the other eight dharmas excluding itself Among the secondary characteristics production produces only the primary production of all the nine dharmas owing to its weakness  The same applies to the duration deterioration and impermanence on the one hand and the three corresponding secondary characteristics on the other f The primary characteristics are established as being conditioned on the basis of the dharmas  and the secondary characteristics are on the basis of the characteristics By virtue of the characteristics the dharmas can manifest their actions  by virtue of the secondary characteristics the characteristics can manifest their actions And what are these actions They are production duration deterioration and destruction What is produced etc is the function WHE gong neng of projecting a fruit  g Thus although the intrinsic nature of a conditioned dharma always exists  its function is not permanent  It achieves its function by the force of the four characteristics the internal  ne causes and the external causes  ra The groups of words  phrases  syllables   Words phrases and syllables are those which are produced with the support of speech  and which causes the understanding in each case the respective signified  in a similar manner as knowledge  manifesting with the representationimage  of the signified  These are the synonyms respectively for name  sentence and phoneme  Just as visual consciousness etc are produced with eyes etc as their support manifesting with the representation of the signified  the visible etc and comprehend the respective objects  The same applies to words etc  It is not the case that vocal sound can directly manifest the signified it cannot be that when one utters the word fire ones mouth is immediately burnt Words like fire etc must rely on speech for their production From these words the signified fire etc are then manifested  Part II THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION  By manifesting is meant producing in others a comprehension of the signified to be illuminated  It does not mean that unites with the signified As sound is resistant and as the eternal sound falsely held by the grammarians vaiyakaranena parikalpita are unreasonable there cannot be any dharma such as sound apart from these three  words phrases and syllables  which are capable of manifesting a corresponding signified These four dharmas  sound word the sigified and knowledge  however are similar in form  a Here by a word is meant a name like ripa etc By a phrase is meant that which expresses complete meaning as for example the verse Not to do evil etc In the world people also utter Devadatta drive the white cow here for milking etc By a syllable is meant a phoneme like a i etc When the three are assembled into their collection  they are known respectively as a group  b There are scriptural evidences to prove that these three dharmas  are real Thus the Great Sage has said O bhiksus when the Tathagata  has arisen in the world there are the groups of words phrases and syllables which can be known This refers to those of the Truths  the Jewels  the aggregates  the entrances  the spheres  the fruit of the ascetic  the conditioned coarising  etc Again the Bhagavat has said The Tathagata acquires such and such groups of words phrases and syllables This refers to those pertaining to the dharmas unique to the Buddha obtained by the Tathagata etc c The word etc indicates that there are subdivisions among the categories discussed herein Thus ends the Category of conditionings   ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DocTRINE V The Category of Consciousness   The specific cognition  in a general manner of an objectbase such as a visible etc without its particular details is named consciousness  That is the present function with regard to the six objects of vision etc which arise with the accompanying assistance of the visual faculties etc  and which apprehend visibles and other objects only generally are named consciousnesses  That which is able to apprehend the particular characteristics of is named a thoughtconcomitant such as sensation etc Consciousness does not have this function it serves only as the support  The function of consciousness exists only in the present moment within the single moment of which the specific cognition takes place It is also that by which the fundamental essence of a sentient being may be designated Its function is the specific cognition of the visibles and other objects It is divided into six types by reason of the different faculties different objects These are named visual consciousness etc up to mental consciousness  The Buddha Himself has spoken of its characteristic in the siitra It is named consciousness because it cognizes discriminatively  Hence we know that its characteristic is discriminative cognition internal external The former is the productioncharacteristic and the latter comprises the six causes or the four conditions  Now we must consider What are these causes and conditions  There are six causes THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION  The thought and thoughtconcomitants which are mutually conjoined with one another and which apprehend a common object are named conjoined causes  Eg thought with sensation etc sensation etc wih  etc sensations etc with thought in each case the mental dharma cannot be for itself  The conditioned dharmas which are the fruits of one another or which together bring about a common fruit are named coexistent causes eg the mahabhiitas the characterized and the conditioned characteristics the thought and the thoughtaccompaniments  The merchants by rendering mutual assistance to one another are able to pass through a risky road  this is coexistent cause They consume the same food and drinks  this is conjoined cause  They are so named because with respect to time they belong to the same perod of time as the thought they arise stay cease together with thought With respect to fruit they have the same fruit the same uniform emanation and the same retribution they are wholesome unwholesome or nondefined accordingly as the thought  For these ten reasons they are called thoughtaccompaniments  The dharmas born anteriorily and belonging to a given stage and class are  in a similar manner to seed dharmas  the homogeneous causes for the similar posterior dharmas belonging to the same stage and class Thus a dharma in the sensesphere and abandonable by insight into the truth of suffering is the homogeneous cause only for a later dharma in the sensesphere and similarily abandonable  The universal dharmas born anteriorly in a given stage are the universal causes to the posterior defiled dharmas belonging to the same stage  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE  All unwholesome dharmas and the wholesome dharmas which are withoutflow are the retributive causes for their retribution  When dharmas are produced they have all dharmas excluding themselves as their efficient causes They are either in the sense of being nonobstructive or in the sense of being capable of producing   These six causes have all the conditioned  as their fruits as are produced by them  These conjoined causes and the coexistent causes acquire the fruits of manly action  because by the force of this  that  the fruit  is produced  The homogeneous causes and the universal causes acquire the uniformemanation fruits  It is said to be uniform because the fruit is similar to the cause It is further said to be an emanation because it is produced from the cause The fruit itself being the uniformemanation it is named a uniformemanation fruit  The retributive causes acquire the retribution fruits  because the fruit is dissimilar to the cause and pac because it is matured and fit for being experienced The fruit itselfbeing the retribution itis named the retribution fruit It pertains to sentient beings only and is nondefined in nature  The efficient causes acquire the fruits of dominance  by force of this dominance  that is produced For example the visual faculty etc with regard to visual consciousness etc the farmer etc with regard to the crops etc  From the anterior dominance the posterior dharma is produced Being the fruit of the dominance it is named a fruit of dominance  The cessation through deliberation  an unconditioned is named disconnection fruit  it is not produced by the Path it is acquired by virtue of the Path by means of the Path the practitioner obtains the acquisition of the disconnection The fruit itself being the disconnection it is named the disconnection fruit  Part I THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION  There are four conditions  condition qua cause  uniformimmediate condition  condition qua object  and condition of dominance  Excluding the efficient cause the other five causes are named the conditions qua cause All past and present thought and thoughtconcomitants excluding the last thought etc of an arhat are named the uniformimmediate conditions All dharmas receive the name conditions qua object Those of the nature of efficient cause are named conditions of dominance  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE VI The Category of Space   Space has the characteristic of accommodating resistant things as it is by the dominant force of this that they are capable of being produced and as it is the nature of Space to be accommodative If it were nonexistent there ought not to be the production of resistant things since there would be nothing to accommodate them  Thus the Bhagavat has said O brahmana Wind is supported by Space The brahmana asked By what is Space supported The Buddha further told him Your question is unreasonable Space is immaterial  invisible and nonresistant  what can be its support Nevertheless Space can be known on account of the existence of light  Therefore we know that there really exists the unconditioned Space If this substance were nonexistent on what can Wind be supported What is the basis for the assertion immaterial etc What is it that is discerned by reason of light THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION VIL The Category of the Cessation through Deliberation   The absolute annihilation of all unsatisfactoriness is named cessation through deliberation  What is unsatisfactoriness Births and deaths Thus the Bhagavat has said The very production of becoming is said to be unsatisfactoriness The becomings are synonymous with births and deaths  The cessation through deliberation is that which causes the nonproduction of unsatisfactoriness  likea dike holding back the water or a screen blocking the wind By deliberation is meant the deliberating  The cessation through deliberation is the name given to that cessation acquired through the repeated deliberation of this with regard to the Four  There are innumerable entities  accordingly as the amount of abandonables which is innumerable If there were only one  it would become useless to cultivate the paths that are to follow once one has acquired the first path If one maintains that one at first realizes partially and not completely it should follow that one cessation consists of several parts an entity consisting of several parts is illogical it is proper to say that there are as many cessations through deliberation as there are dharmas with outflows since this accords with logic  in accordance with the different paths are established as eightynine In accordance with the abandonmentknowledges they are established as nine In accordance with the five different classes they are established as five In accordance with the different fruits of spiritual cultivation they are said to be four  streamentry etc In accordance with  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DOCTRINE the three different elements  of abandonment detachment and cessation   they are established as three In accordance with the abandonment of unsatisfactoriness and the origin of unsatisfactoriness and also accordingly as the nirvana with or without remainder  they are established as two From the point of view of the abandonment of births and deaths collectively it is established as one  The cessation through deliberation has many synonyms such as exhaustion  detachment  cessation  nirvana etc Thus it is said in the Manusyakasiitra O bhiksus the four immaterial aggregates and the eyes and the visibles etc taken collectively are called a human being Herein is the assertion  I see the visibles etc with my eyes etc is the generation of various conventional manners of speech  This venerable has such a name he belongs to such a caste  such a lineage  etc These O bhiksus are mere ideations  mere manners of speech  All these dharmas are impermanent  conditioned  and dependently arisen  This being so there is unsatisfactoriness unsatisfactoriness at the time of being produced  unsatisfactoriness in staying etc With regard to all these unsatisfactoriness the complete abandonment  casting aside  expurgation  exhaustion  detachment  cessation  appeasement  disappearance  the nonlinking up with other  this is known as the absolute nonarising  namely the casting aside of all substratum  the exhaustion of craving  detachment  cessation  nirvana   casting aside of all substratum means that in this cessation there is the complete relinquishment of the unsatisfactoriness of the five aggregates of grasping  Exhaustion of craving means that in this cessation all cravings are presently exhausted It is detachment because when one has acquired this cessation one is completely freed from the defiled dharmas It is cessation because when one has obtained this cessation all unsatisfactoriness cease It is nirvana because when one has realized this cessation the defilementfire of all calamities is extinguished  Parr I THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION VIII The Category of the Cessation Independent of Deliberation   The cessation independent of deliberation is a distinct dharma which absolutely obstructs the production of a future dharma It is acquired simply by the deficiency in the conditions necessary for the production of the dharma not through deliberation na pratisamkhyaya labhyate  For example when the eye and the mind are focusing on a particular visible the other visibles sounds smells tastes and tangibles all wither away  As a result of the acquisition of these cessations the five sensory consciousnesses which had these as conditions become absolutely obstructed and remain in the future never to arise again   The deficiency in the conditions is also due to the force of  this cessation Hence there definitely exists a real entity named cessation independent of deliberation   For example the Bhagavat has said If at that moment the pleasurable sensation appears the other two sensations  unpleasurable and neutral  cease Now what can this cessation be apart from the  since it definitely is not the cessation of impermanence or the cessation through deliberation Again it is said in the satra O bhiksus if one attains streamentry one has exhausted hells the infernal regions and the animal region The exhaustion here refers to the cessation independent of deliberation since at the moment one has not acquired the cessation through deliberation for the retributive dharmas  ENTRANCE INTO THE SUPREME DocTRINE In order that the beginners may take a keen interest in their studies this treatise has been composed succinctly without the questions and answers  Those who have not mastered the profound characteristics of the abhidharma have indulged in compiling numerous theoretical views  These they put forward fabricating objections with the evil intention of slandering one another  they are in fact slandering the Buddhas teachings  Thus the Bhagavat has said There are two kinds of people who slander the Buddhas Teachings  Those who not having faith generate hostility towards them and those who though having faith grasp them wrongly   Among the factors that are without form we have finished discussing thought and thought concomitants Next we will discuss the conditioned forces dissociated from thought The verse states The conditioned forces dissociated from thought are possession  nonpossession  homogeneous character  the state of nonconception  the two states of equipoise  vitality  the characteristics  the name set  and so on and type The phrase and so on includes the phrase set  the syllable set  and the complete assemblage namely that are precisely of the same type as those of the previous categories That is to say have falsely imagined intrinsic nature such as the acquisition of the aggregates  and so on apart from the possession and so on   Dissociated Forces  Since such factors as these are not associated with thought they are given the name conditioned forces dissociated from thought they are not like thought concomitants which have the same basis and objectsupport as thought and arise associīated with it The word thought in order to indicate that the possession and so on referred to here fall within the same category as thought insofar as they are not form  thought concomitants share the same bases and supports as thought are also of the same category as thought In order to distinguish those are said to be dissociated nconditioned factors also fall into the same category as thought They are without a basis or support and therefore are also dissociated In order to distinguish those are said to be conditioned forces These have been cited together They should be further interpreted separately First among these we will dīscuss the characteristics of possession and nonpossession The verse states Possession refers to acquisition and accompaniment Nonpossession is the opposite of this Possession and nonpossession apply only to ones own lifestream and to the two cessations Even though the referent of possession acquisition and accompaniment is the same they are given distinct names in accordance with differences in perspective There are two varieties of possession namely of that which has not yet been attained and of that which has already been attained The possession of that which has not yet been attained is given the name acquisition  the possession of that which has already been attained is given the name accompaniment It should be known that nonpossession is the opposite of that which has not yet been attained and of that which once attained has been lost The   Possession and Nonpossession nonpossession of that which has not yet been attained is given the name nonacquisition  and the nonpossession of that which and lost is given the name nonaccompaniment Accordingly the phrase the nonacquisition of the noble factors is used to define the nature of an ordinary person   To what factors do possession and nonpossession apply This is because one can be either accompanied or not accompanied by the aggregates that fall into and abide in ones own lifestream one can never be either accompanied or rot accompanied by the aggregates within another lifestream or by the aggregates included among factors not constituting sentient beings Next among the unconditioned factors  possession and nonpossession occur only with respect to the two cessations No sentient being has nonaccompaniment of the cessation not resulting from consideration Therefore the following statement appears in the Abhidharma Who is accompanied by the factors not tending toward the flixes  All sentient beings With the exception of those noble ones in the first moment  who are bound by all bonds  and all ordinary persons who are bound by all bonds the remaining sentient beings are accompanied by cessation resulting from consideration t is established that there is no accompaniment of space  since there is no possession of space Likewise there is no nonaccompaniment If there is possession of a factor there is also nonpossession of it if there is no possession of a factor nonpossession of it is also impossible This principle is established  Existential Status   The following passage refers to possession The form ageregate and the forces aggregate are possessed by one possession remaining aggregates and the forces aggregate can also be described in this way Factors tending toward the fluxes and those not tending toward the fluxes are possessed by one possession Conditioned and unconditioned factors are possessed by one possession Other such categories should be considered in accordance with this principle On this point the ūtra master asked the following queston How do we know that there is a discrete entity referred to as possession We should reply that because the term is mentioned in the sūra According to the sūtra the Lord has said One should know that such an individual is accompanied by virtuous and unvirtuous factors One might claim that a categorical fault the sūtra passage which states There is a wheelturning king who is accompanied by the seven jewels This crīticism is untenable because  the wheelturning kings unhindered mastery over the seven jevels is referred to as accompaniment It would be untenable to claim that the term accompanied mentioned in the former sūra passage should also be taken  because one who is in the present can only have the power of mastery with regard to present  and not with regard to past or future In other words the wheelturning king has the power of mastery with respect to the seven jewels in the present which he manipulates according to his desire  because they are sovereign effects  and because they are constantly present before him  virtuous or unvirtuous factors is not restricted Now    Possession and Nonpossession that individual can be said to have accompaniment of those present virtuous factors With regard to what discrete factor would one use the term mastery The examination of virtuous factors when unvirtuous factors are present before one in the same way How much greater the problem is for those who claim that past and future factors are completely without intrinsic naturel With regard to what would there be mastery which might then be referred to as accompaniment If one claims that the capability of production in the future is to be referred to as accompaniment this is untenable since undesired faults are incurred then those abiding in the last state of existence as ordinary persons who are destined thereafter producing the factors not tending toward the fluxes should already be noble ones arhats abiding in the last moment of thought who will never again be able to produce factors not tending toward the fluxes should not be arhats In that case should retrogress and abide in the mundane as ordinary persons or since the defilements once severed by the first stage of the path of vision will never arise again these arhats should the realization of the fruit of the streamenterer Why is it unreasonable to posit that there is a discrete real entity referred to as possession the possession that is maintained has no intrinsic nature that can be discerned like form and sound or passin and hatred  and so on and it has no activity that can be discerned like the eyes and ears  and s on Therefore snce a discrete real entity referred to as possession is impossible your claim that it exists as a discrete real entity is unreasonable This objection is untenable because is not unreasonable possession as posited has an activityḷ as the cause of  Theory of Seeds  the nondisappearance of factors that have been acquired Further it is to be known that it is the marker of the knowledge that this belongs to that Aside from this  is there another discrete entity these activities thereby superseding allowing one to claim that it does not exisṭ that is seeds that are not plucked out  seeds that are not yet damaged  and seeds that are to be nourished to the point of mastery Hene there is no dippearance oif fnctors thai havs beon obūained and a marker of the knowledge that this belongs to that How further First there are in brief two varieties of virtuous factors one variety is not produced through efiort and the other variety is produced only through efiort These are referred to and those that are acquired through application As for those that are not produced through effort one is said to have accompaniment when their seeds have not been damaged within the corporeal basis Those seeds of the roots of virtuous factors within the corporeal basis should be known as eradicated in the sense that they are damaged by false views  it is not the case that they are referred to as eradicated in the sense that these seedstates of the roots of virtuous factors within the corporeal basis are absolutely obliterated As for those that are produced only through effort one is said to have accompaniment when these factors have already arisen within the corporeal basis and ones mastery with regard to the effort that produces them is undamaged The opposite of this is referred to as nonaccompaniment As for unvirtuous and indeterminate factors the seeds of unvirtuous and path that counteracts defllements  or have been   Possession and Nonpossession suppressed  or when there is no effort that can produce the present operation of  The opposite of this is referred to as accompaniment Therefore the possession that you have posited is without an activity These contorted theories First what īs this that is given the name seed It is that name and form that has capability in the production of its own effect either remotely or immediately  through a distinctive characteristic in the transformation of the lifestream What is name and form It is the five aggregates Why do you claim that these are the nature of the seed can act as the cause of the production of virtuous factors and so on If you respond that combine  the nature of the seed must be provisional  and it is not reasonable that a provisionally existing entity acts as the real cause If you respond that they each separately  how can you maintain that a seed of indeterminate form is the cause of the production of virtuous and unvirtuous factors If you respond that they according to their own category then of what type is the seed when unvirtuous factors are produced immediately after virtuous factors or vice versa Due to a distinctive volition produced together with a prior moment of thought a capability is distīnguished and arises in a subsequent moment of thought This distinctive capability in the subsequent  Saṅghabhadras Refutation of Seeds  moment of thought is called a seed An effect will then originate from this distinctive characteristic in the transformation of the lifestream For example within an unvirṭuous moment of thought there lies a distinctive capability that has been projected by a virtuous  iḥ will produce its effect either remotely or immediately and is considered to be a seed From this  a virtuous factor can be produced immediately lafter the destruction of that unvirtuous moment of thought Or within a virtuous moment of thought there lies a distinctive capability tbat has been projected by a unvirtuous  remotely or immediately and is considered to be a seed From this  an unvirfuous factor can be produced immediately ow is the seed or distinctive capability that you have proposecl an entity separate from or not separate from that virtuous or unvirtuous moment of thought in which it appears This is not an entity separate Wouldnt admit that a virtuous acts as the seed of an unvirtuous and likewise that an unvirtuous acts as the seed of a virtuous  Who would maintain that though heat and fire are not discrete entities only heat and not fire is capable of burning Suppoṣe that a seed or a distinctive capability is projected by a distinctive virtuous volition capable of bringing about desirable matured effects How can be implanted in a pure and virtuous moment of thought that is capable of bringing about matured effects such as that of a human being and so on are not capable of bringing about desirable matured   Possession and Nonpossession effects and pure and virtuous moments of thought are not capable of bringing about undesirable matured effects how can one say that each of these two can bring about either a effect Thus included among the ten powers aṭtained by the Buddhalords Further you must allow that the seedthat is the distinctive capability projected by a distinctive volitionand the thought tending toward the flxes would appear within a moment of thought not tending toward the fluxes then that moment of thought not tending toward the flxes itself should also be able to bring about such as existence in the three realms Since also allow the implanting of seeds of defilements within a moment of thought not tending toward the fluxes then that moment of thought not tending toward the fluxes should also be able to act as the cause in the production of defilements Or defilements that are to be abandloned by the path of cuttivation within the body of a noble one origi nate automatically without seeds Since also allow the implanting of seeds not tending toward the fluxes within a defiled moment of thought then that defilled moment of thought also should be able to act as the cause of the production of factors not tending toward the ftuxes Or those factors not tending toward the fiuxes which are produced within the body of a noble one after a defiled moment of thought originate without seeds Or then this moment should be referred to as the first moment of thought not tending toward the fluxes  Further retrogression from the stage of the realization of the fruit of arhatship can occur due to the arising of defilements Thus the defiled seeds of the three realms exist within a thought of  Saṅghabhadras Refutation of SeedsII  an arhat who is beyond training Retrogression resulting from defllements will be discussed extensively at a later point Moreover it has never been observed that factors are distinguished in moral quality and yet are not discrete entities Therefore his position is fallacious S Nexi how do the distinctive volition that arises in a prior and the distinctive capability within the subsequent moment of thought function as cause and effect and with one another What is the objection here This distinctive capability in the subsequent moment of thought is produced only through a distinctive volition in the prior  if there were no distinctive volition in the prior  the distinctive capability of the subsequent moment of thought would not arise Therefore these two are able to act as cause and effect and hence are associated If that  which is to be produced existed to any extent at the time when that prior volition occurred the fabove interpretation would be possible However future do not exist that is to be produced is completely nonexistent when that prior volition occurs an existent prior volition and a nonexistent subsequent moment of thought cannot be contiguous How could one claim that they act as cause and effect and are associated Such matters will be examined further in the discussion of the past and future He should simply have said they are absolutely not obliterated because there were never any seeds in the first place Moreover his statement contradicts the sūtra because the sūtra declares that are absolutely eradicated As the Lord has said One should know that in such an individual the virtuous factors are concealed and the evil factors are manifest There are roots of virtuous factors that have not yet been eradicated and that accompany to arise from these roots of virtuous t a later time for this  all will be eradicated If all the subtle roots of vīrtuous factors are eradicated how they are not absolutely obliterated In making these statements the has simply been beguiled by the demons of his own discursive speculation Moreover if the capability of the seeds virtuous were damaged by the power of false views causing them not to produce sprouts even if one claimed that were not absolutely eradicated since they would be without the capability of producing sprouts of the roots of virtuous  what other activity ould they have  one should not refer eradicated the roots of virtuous Given his accepted doctrine mentioned previously that future do not exist to what would the power of mastery be applied Precisely because a cause of production does not reasonably exist he should not seek another cause for their nonproduction ince there is no cause of their production what is he referring to in his statement ones mastery with regard to the effort that produces them is undamaged In accordance with this are also refuted his falsely imagined theories concerning the grades and groups of deflements to be abandoned Saṅghabhadras Cri sm of tatementsTII Further the has stated Just as seeds that have been burned completely by fire transform to become different from before in that they lack the activity of production so also a noble one who lacks the capability of producing defllements within his corporeal basis is referred to as one who has abandoned defilements Or when the seeds of defilements in the corporeal basis have been damaged by the mundane path  likewise is referred to as one who has abandoned opposite of these are referred to as those who have not yet abandoned defilements Now the should explain the distinction between abandoning defllements by the path not tending toward the fluxes and abandoning defllements by the mundane path in both cases are compared to seeds burned completely by fire that lack the activity of production Seeds of defilements damaged by the mundane path are like seeds that are not profoundly damaged such that they are permanently incapable of producing sprouts In this way like before are still able to produce effects of action and will be able to give rise to various defilements are like seeds that have been damaged The fact that seeds have been damaged means that they cannot produce sprouts If they can produce sprouts then they should not be referred to as damaged Abandoning   Possession and Nonpossession defileaments through the mundane path should be understood in the same way if one damages the seeds of defilements then they should no longer be able to produce If afterward the were able to produce  they should not be referred to as damaged If they cannot be referred to as damaged how can they be referred to as abandoned Further it is unreasonable for that which is able to abandon and those that are to be abandoned both to exist in the same moment of thought Since the meaning of abandoning canot be established  his statement that name and form that has capability either remotely or immediately in the preduction of its own effect is called a seed is not reasonably established Further has stated through a distinctive characteristic in the transformation of the lifestream What is this that is referred to as transformation  It is the change between prior and subsequent moments within the stream What is this that is referred to as the stream  It refers to conditioned forces having the nature of cause and effect within the three time periods What is this that is referred to as the distinctive characteristie  It is the capability of producing an effect immediately All such statements of the Venerable one contradict the meaning and expression as well as the central point Without accepting the existence of past and future factors the Dārṣṭāntikas cannot uphold change between prior and subsequent moments within a stream conditioned forces having the nature of cause and effect within the three time periods or the capability of producing an effect immediately This will be discussed further subsequently If one allows the real existence of possession what contradiction is there to the meaning of scriptures Even though there are many statements made here by the Sūtra master in accordance with his own viewpoint none of them is established because his theory of seeds is not reasonably established Sīnce the seed does not exist it is known that the possession which we maintain definitely has the following activities it is the cause of the nondisappearance of factors that have been obtained and the marker of the knowledge that this belongs to that Sīnce the existence of these activities is established it is known that there exists separately that has intrinsie nature In the arguments among the various bhidhārmikas the Dārṣṭāntikas often appeal to their own of seeds and thereby pervert the correct meaning and cause it to become unclear There are certain masters who give different names to these seeds each according to his own understanding Some call them subsidiary elements  others call them traces  stil others call them capability  or nondisappearance  or accumulation Therefore through extensive analysis of we have demolished these and have established the correct accepted doctrine First what are the o possessin The verse states Factors of the three time periods have in each case three Virtuous  and so on have only viriuous  and  that are connected have possession ṣion of that are not connected extends through four varieties their own realm the pos   Each of the factors of the three time periods has three types of possession that is to say past factors have past possession as well as future possesslon and present possession likewise future and present factors each have three varieties of possession Now we make these statements concerning the theoretical possibility At a later point we will discuss the particular instances within this The possession of virtuous factors and so on is only virtuous and so on that is to say virtuous  unvirṭuous  and indeterminate factors have respectively virtuous unvirtuous and indeterminate possession The possession of factors connected belongs only to their own realm that is to say the factors of the realm of desire  the realm of form  and the formless realm only have respectively possession belonging to the realm of desire the realm of form and the formless realm The possession of factors not connected to any realm extends through four varieties That is to say in terms of general categories factors not connected to any realm have altogether four varieties of possession that connected to three realms and that not connected In particular they are differentiated The possession of cessation not resulting from consideration is connected to any of the three realms The possession of cessation resulting from consideration is connected to the realm of form or the formless realm or is not connected The truth of the path has only possession that is not connected Further the factors belonging to one in training have only belonging to one in training The factors belonging to one beyond training have only belonging to one beyond training Therefore those factors of one in training and of one beyond training each have only one varietyS  Particular VarietiesExceptions  In general there are three varieties of possession of factors characteristic of those neither in training nor beyond training In particular they are differentiated All five appropriative aggregates and the three unconditioned factors are in general referred to as factors belonging to one neither in training nor beyond training First the fire appropriative aggregates and cessation not resulting from consideration as well as cessation resulting from consideration realized by the path of the nonnoble one  have only possession belonging to one neither in treaining nor beyond training In the case of cessation resulting from consideration reelized by the path of training  there is only belonging to one in training In the case of cessation resulting from consideration realized by the path beyond training  there is only belonging to one beyond training Further the factors that are to be abandoned by the vision or cultivation have possession that is to be abandoned respectively either by the vision or cultivation In general there are two varieties of possession of those factors that are not to be abandoned In particular they are differentiated Those factors that are not to be abandoned are not tending toward the fluxes the ation not resulting from consideration as well as the cessation resulting from consideration realized by the path of the nonnoble one Their possession is of one variety only that is it is to be abandoned by cultivation The cessation resulting from consideration realized by the path of the noble one as well as the truth of the path have only one variety of possession that is possession that is not to be abandoned Particular VarietiesExceptions Previously it was stated that the three time periods each have three of possession Are all coditioned factors determined in this way They are not Why is this Is the possession of all unobscured indetermnate factors determined to be such It is not Why is this Further the possession of the four aggregates produced by the modes of proper deportment is in most cases exclusive with respect to time period and exclusive with respect to moment by the various buddhas by the monk Aśvajit and by others who practice modes of proper deportment intensively is excepted The possession of the four aggregates produced by skill in the creative arts is also in most cases exclusive with respect to time period and exclusive with respect to moment of Viśvakarmadeva and others who practice the creative arts intensively is excepted Are unobscured indeterminate factors alone in having possession that arises simultaneously  They are not Why is this The possession of obscured indeterminate form also  NonpossessionParticular Varieties  This refers only to the possession of the defiled manifest corporeal and vocal actions within the first level of trance of the realm of form which as in the case of  arises only simultaneously with Even though these actions arise obseured by excessive deflements since they cannot give rise to unmanifest actions  they are weak and are definitely without possession prior to or subsequent to them Are the various types of form within the realm of desire also determined to have only possession that arises simultaneously  They are not Why is this There is no possible prior arising of the possession of virtuous and unvirtuous form and is connected to the realm of desire they have only possession that arises simultaneously or subsequently  Thus we have discussed the characteristics of the particular varieties of possession What are the characteristics of the particular varieties of nonpossession The verse states Nonpossession is undefiled and indeterminate the three realms and those that are not connected to any realm have three It is held that the nonpossession of the noble path is referred to as the nature of an ordinary person is dīscarded by the possession of that and by passing to another stage Distinguished by moral quality all nonpossession is grouped whose moral quality is unobscured and indeterminate Distinguished by time period past and future each have three varieties of That is to say past and future factors in each case have nonpossession that belongs to the three time periods In the case of present factors there is only past and future nonpossession   Possession and Nonpossession there is definitely no present nonpossession because a present factor and its nonaccompaniment do not operate simultaneously There are those who claim that present factors lack present nonpossession because are mutually contradictory in nature Distinguished by realm the factors connected to the three realms and those not connected to any realm have in each case three varieties of nonpossession That is to say the factors connected to the realm of desire have three varieties of nonpossession connected to the realm of form and the formless realm as well as those not connected to any realm also  There is definitely no nonpossession not tending toward the fluxes Why is this This is because the nonpossession of the noble path is held to be the nature of an ordinary person As the śāstra states What is the nature of an ordinary person It is the nonacquisition of the noble factors onacquisition is a synonym for nonpossession To the nonacquisition of which factors does the nature of an ordinary person refer is either the general nonacquisition of all noble factors or the nonacquisition only of the presentiment of the knowledge of the doctrine with regard to suffering There are those who claim that is the nonacquisition of all noble factors If this were so isnt ib the case that there would be no nonordinary person since there is no general accomplishment of all noble factors as a  Sūtra Masters Interpretation  whole lb The nonacquisition that is not mixed with the acquisition constitutes the nature of an ordinary person that is mixed with the acquisition constitutes the nature of a nonordinary person If this were so the śāstra should have used the restrictive word alone  As in the case of such categories and those who live on air  even though the word alone does not occur it is known that lie on water alone or on air alone and do not mix with other There are who claim that is the nonacquisition of the presentiment of the knowledge of the doctrine with regard to suffering However after this knowledge is discarded one does not again become an ordinary person because the nonpossession has already previously been permanently destroyed In this connection the ūtra master makes the following comments The particular state of the stream that has not yet produced the noble factors is referred to as the nature of an ordinary person Why would the ūtra master then make the following statement The nature of an ordinary person is totally without existence as a real entity If this were so to the state of whose stream does  It is namely the state of the stream of the cyes and ears and so o   Possession and Nonpossession Is it possible to claim that the state of the eyes and so on in one moment becomes the nature of a nonordinary person and yet also claim that the stream of the eyes and so on alone constitutes the nature of an ordinary person it is not possible to refer to moment as a stream because that would result in the fallecy that a moment is not real is fallacious not only because the term contradicts the meaning  it also incurs the fault of contradicting the sūtra Therefore the Lord has said is said to be one who practices in accordance with faith one enters the stage in which the eventual attainment of enlightenment is assured  that one surpasses the stage of being an ordinary person The stage of being an ordinary person referred to in this stra passage is precisely the nature of an ordi nary person How is it known  because it is stated that one acquires and discards even though one acquires noble factors that had not been possessed previously it cannot be discerned that one discards at that time even a small portion of the various factors such as the eyes and so on which were possessed previously A noble one in the first stage of the path of vision is accompanied by all the grades and groups of eyes and so on with no exception just as they were in the prior stage If the nature of an ordinary person did not exist separately as a real entity it would contradict this sūtra since at that time there would be no discrete real entitythat is the stage of being an ordinary personthat one could surpass If one were to claim that this stage of being an ordinary person refers to existence in a bad rebirth state  then when the stage of presentiment is attained and one overcomes the possi  Saṅghabhadras Refutatio  bility of birth in a bad rebirth state one should no longer be an ordinary person One might claim that since one is separated from the noble factors when the eyes and so on has not yet attained the noble one the name ordinary person is provisionally established as the nature of an ordinary person on the basis of that Since when one enters the path of vision one surpasses that  one can be said to have surpassed the stage of being an ordinary person this is untenable Since at that time the various factors of the eyes and so on continue as they were originally how can it be said that one surpasses them Further one might claim that is like surpassing the eyes and so on through the realization of the fruit of arhatship this also is untenable At that time  one realizes completely the severance of the bonds eyes and so on Even though one is still accompanied by these eyes and so on one is referred to as having surpassed Now in this case  one is accompanied by the eyes and so on bound by all bonds just as they were originally Therefore the exemple of is not equivalent  One might then claim that  is similar to a noble one not yet free from passion who has surpassed bad rebirth states This also is untenable because has already attained cessation not resuting from consideration with regard to fhose Since noble ones who are not yet free from passion have no force that instigates  no proceeding toward  and no operation  they can be said to have surpassed them Now in this state of the path of vision what eyes and so on has one surpassed  This is untenable because it is not reasonably established that one discards the potnature and so on without breaking the physical pot and so on when a moment of thought not tending toward the fluxes arises  one discards the nature of an ordinary person even though the eyes and so on remain as they were originally Thus the example is not equivalent Through this  other examples  such as that of cownature end so on are refuted If one objects Why is not like that between the nature of a brāhmaṇa because no established distinction is observed as there is between the noble one and the ordinary person There is a particular established distinction between a noble one and an ordinary person because no force that instigates and no proceeding toward an ordinary person has both this instigating force and this proceeding  and dexterity If the brāhmaṇa alone among the various castes were able to perform these actions and those of other were not able to perform them it would then be possible for this reason to posit a nature of the brāhmaṇa One might claim ṭthat the noble factors constitute the nature of a noble one and that one is called a noble one because one is accompanied by this intrinsie nature In the same way then shouldnt the factors of an ordinary person constitute the nature of an ordinary person and shouldnt one be called an ordinary person because one is accompanied by this intrinsic nature This analogy is untenable Since the various noble factors are possessed by a noble one alone it is possible to claim that the noble factors constitute the nature of a noble one factors of an ordinary person are also possessed by a noble one how would it be possible to establish the as the nature of an ordinary person If the factors of an ordinary person belonged to ordinary persons alone and were found among ordinary persons everywhere  they could be considered to be the nature of an ordinary person since a bad rebirth state the state of nonconception and Uttarakuru and so on are not found among ordinary persons everywhere they do not constitute the nature of an ordinary person Even though the remaining factors such as vitality are found among ordinary persons everywhere they do not belong to ordinary persons alone they also do not constitute the nature of an ordinary person Further of an ordinary person fulfills these two criteria of being that within the lifestream which belongs to an ordinary person alone and that which is found among ordinary persons everywhere contrary to the acquisition of the noble path Further this nature of an ordinary person can then indeed be established as a real entity by its activity that is to say there exists a factorthe nature of an ordinary personthat acts as the cause of production for the body of an ordinary person Isnt it the case that prior actions and defilements act as causes of production for the body of an ordinary person Of what use is the nature of an ordinary person When one surpasses that  one is said to have surpassed the stage of an ordinary person Only through this interpretation does the sūtra expounded by the Lord have meaning Now we should consider when nonpossession will be discarded The nonpossession of a factor is discarded when one acquires that factor and when one passes to another stage by the case of the nonpossession of noble factors which is referred to as the nature of an ordinary person As soon as one acquires a noble factor one discards the nonpossession of three realms Or one who is abiding in the first moment of thought not tending toward the fluxes knowledge of the doctrine with regaerd to suffering as one progresses up to the state of the adamantine concentration  in which one discards accordingly the nonpossession of the stage of preparation for the realization of arhatship as soon as one acquires that factor Thus realization of the fruit of arhatship in which one who has liberation limited by the occasion discards the nonpossession of liberation not limited by the occasion as soon as one acquires that factor the nonpossession of other factors should be understood in the Thus we have finished discussing the characteristics of possession and nonpossession What is homogeneous character The verse states Homogeneous character s the uniforrity of sentient beings There is a discrete real entity referred to as homogeneous character it is the mutual similarity of sentient beings In the śāstra it is given the name homogeneous character of the group  The homogeneous character of the group refers to the cause of the mutual similarity of the body  the appearance  the various controlling faculties  the modes of behavior  the sustenance  and so on or to the cause of the mutually similar aspirations of the various categories of sentient beings born in the same rebirth state just as subtle form  has action the moment of thought and the four fundamental material elements as its causes in the same wayḷ the body the appearance and so on of sentient beings within the   Homogeneous Character same category do not have only action as their cause Even though it is observed that the body and appearance are effects projected by similar action since there are distinctions among the controlling faculties modes of behavior sustenance and so on It is untenable to claim that these distinctions result from distinctions in actions that have a specific feshing effect  or that the body and appearance originate only from similar actions that have a generic skeletal cliect There are distinctions in the modes of behavior and so on because there are distinctions in the homogeneous character of the group If the body and appearance and so on were the effects of action alone one would be unable to engage freely in modes of behavior such as discontinuing and performing  sa indicates the mutual similarity of the body the appearance the modes of behavior and the aspirations bhāga  which we refer to as homogeneous character  The Lord applied homogeneous character only to sentient beings and not to grass and trees Accordingly the sūtra states The homogeneous character of these gods the homogeneous character of these human beings and so on as is presented in detail There are innumerable varieties of homogeneous character of sentient beings in accordance with distinctions in realm  rebirth state  mode of birth  region  body and so on  Discarding Homogeneous Character  Further there is homogeneous character of the factors included among those factors constituting sentient beings that is in accordance with the aggregate  sense sphere  and element classifications  the homogeneous cheracter of an ordinary person is discarded when one enters the stage in which the eventual attainment of enlightenment is assured  the homogeneous character of a sentient being is discarded when one enters nirvāṇa  Isnṭ the nature of an ordinary person precisely this homogeneous character of an ordinary person  This is untenable because the activity differs from that of That is to say the cause of the mutual similarity of the bodies the appearances the modes of behavior and the aspirations is referred to as homogeneous character the cause of the state of being an ordinary person which cause is opposed to the accompaniment of the noble path is referred to as the nature of an ordinary person Further when one enters the stage in which the eventual attainment of enlightenment is assured one both discards and acquires homogeneous character of the group  one discards the nature of an ordinary person and yet does not acquire Homogeneous Character Since homogeneous character has no form  One knows that has that  because one observes its effect just as one knows that there was an action performed in a former life because one observes a present effect attained through action Why dont you allow that there is homogeneous character of insentient objects  ince you also allow that there are the rebirth states of human beings gods and so on and modes of birth by the womb egg and so on why do not likewise allow the rebīrth state of a mango and so on and modes of birth by the lentil or bean and so on since the Lord never expounded We must consider carefully why the Lord stated that only sentient beings have homogeneous character and not grass and so on Further how does one know that such homogeneous character exists separately as a real entity Now we have understood in this way did not state that grass and so on has a homogeneous character because it is without the mutually respective similarity in modes of behavior and aspirations because grass and so on is inevitably produced only so long as it has sentient beings  ObjectionIV  as its cause it is claimed that there is homogeneous character only with regard to sentient beings īnce erass and so on has neither of these two causesit is without homogeneous character It is precisely through the existence of these two causes that the existence as a real entity is proven even though images that are wooden plain lacquered carved and painted and their actual model have mutual similarity of form and appearance it is said that one is real As a result one discerns that the distinguished factor really exists and the word real arises on the basis of that factor due to previous statements  What was stated previously Namely it was stated that even though it is observed that the body and appearance ere effects projected by similar action since there are distinctions among the controlling faculties the modes of behavior sustenance and so on homogeneous character are distinguishedl from one another  how could one give rise to a notion and a provisional designation of homogeneous character in general  without yet homogeneous character  The various types of homogeneous character are by nature causes of similarity among things in the same category is precisely the cause for notion and provisional designation of their nuṭual similarty as constituting the same category It s like the case of the visual sense organ auditory sense organ and so on which are only established in their nature as form because they are creations of the fundamental material elements Even though these fundamental material   If the Vaiśeṣika school maintained that these two categories were not singular were momentary and impermanent were without support and were distinguished  we could accept their opinion and suffer no categorical fault The Buddha did not reject the view that the visual sense organ is able to operate with form and suggest other interpretations simply because the Vaiśeṣika maintain Therefore this objection represents mere partisan bias those who seek the correct principle should not heed it We have finished discussing homogeneous character What is the state of nonconception The verse states The state of nonconception is the cessation of thought and thought concomitants among without conception It is a matured effect abide among the Bṛhatphala gods  For those born among the gods who are sentient beings without conception  there is a factor rcferred to as the state of nonconception that is able to cause the cessation of thought and thought concomitants it is a real entity that can obstruct future thought and thought concomitants and can cause them not to arise for a period of time  likc the damming of a river  This factor is exclusively a matured effect produced by the equipoise of nonconception asarṅ   Among those gods who are sentient beings without conception the state of nonconception as well as form are matured effects produced by the equipoise of nonconception alone This equipoise because the homogencous character of the group and vitality are effects produced only by the fourth level of trance  in which thought occurs The remaining aggregates are the matured effects of both because for those born among the gods who are sentient beings without conception thought occurs for a long period of time before entering and after emerging from that state of nonconception However because this state of being without thought lasts for an extremely long period of time these gods are referred to in general as gods who are without conception  In what region do these sentient beings without conception abide They abide among the Bṛhatphala That is to say among the Brhatphala eods in a particular region  there are who are referred to as gods who are without conception just as in the case of the intermediate stage  The state without thought has only past contact and so on as its sustenance present is totally nonexistent in states that have thought have both  Sentient beings fall from this region through the arising of conception It is determined that having fallen they will be reborn in the realm of desire and in no other place ince the power of life produced by the conditioned forces of the previously cultivated equipoise has been exhausted and since these are not able to cultivate that equipoise further like arrows which having been shot into the air fall when their momentum is exheusted Sentient beings who will be reborn in that state necessarily have action whose effects are received in the third lifetime or after within the realm of desire This is similar to the case of those sentient beings who will be reborn in the Uttarakuru they necessarily have action whose effects will be received as rebirth among the gods We have finished discussing the state of nonconception What are the two states of equipoise They are the equipoise of nonconception and the equipoise of cessation Fīirst what are the characteristics of the equipoise of nonconception The verse states In the same way  the equipoise of nonconception  the last level of trance  lit is cultivated with a desire for deliverance  it is virtuous  īts effects are received only in the next lifetime  it is not noble ones and it is acquired belonging to one time period  As stated previously there is a factor referred to as the state of nonconception that is able to cause the cessation of thought and thought concomitants s also there is a discrete factor referred to as the equipoise of nonconception that is able to cause the cessation of thought and thought concomitants Equipoise of Nonconception indicates that this equipoise is like the state of nonconception insofar as a cessation of thought and thought concomitants There are other masters who claim that the appropriate or equilibrated operation is to be referred to as equipoise because that equipoise equilibrates thought and the four fundamental material elements Ordinary persons are not able an aversion to feelings because they enter this equipoise aṭttached to feelings  In what region is this equipoise located Ii occurs in the last level of trance that is in the fourfh level of trance and in no other  Practitioners  There was no need to state here Why is this This equipoise is able to produce the matured effect of the state of nonconception and it was stated without conception abide among the Bṛhatphala gods This criticism is untenable because there has been no statement it has not yet been stated anywhere that the equipoise of nonconception is considered to be the cause of the state of nonconception Didnt the previous verse state that the state of nonconception is a matured effect In the autocommentary the was then said to be the effect of the equipoise of nonconception This also is untenable because there has not yet been a verse stating is established the statement in the present  Why is this equipoise rcferred to as an eqiipoise of ordinary persons because one cultivates this equipoise with a desire for liberation Claiming that the state of nonconception is the true liberation  and claiming that the equipoise of nonconception is the path of deliverance cultivate this equipoise in order to realize nonconception No noble one would claim that a factor tending toward the flixes is the true liberation or the true path of deliverance Therefore this equipoise is said to be the equipoise of ordinary persons   Equipoise of Nonconception  Sīnce previous the state of nonconception is a matured effect  its inclusion among having an indeterminate nature is established without statement Here the equipoise of nonconception exclusively virtuous Since this factor is the cause of a matured effect isnt its inclusion among factors having a virtuous nature established without statement This is the cause that has as its matured effect the fie aggregates of the gods who are sentient beings without conception is unfounded because it has not yet been stated in the verse Further who would be able to refute defiled indeterminate naṭure If virtuous alone should have been used in this This is not necessary because a meaning is evident even apart from the of the word Here one should follow the previous interpretation the nature of an ordinary person Or simply by stating that is virtuous it is clearly indicated that it is not otherwise  Since this equipoise is by nature a cause of maturation  when does one receive its effects One group of masters adamantly claims that one receives its effects only in the next lifetime  and not in the present lifetime  nor in the third lifetime  Practitionerscontinued  or after  nor are its effects undetermined Why is this It is possible that one who accomplishes this equipoise also will be able to enter the stage in which the eventual attainment of enlightenment is assured  Having entered  one is necessarily without the present arising of this equipoise the equipoise of nonconception is referred to as the equipoise of ordinary persons in reference to its present operation and not in reference to ones accompaniment of it  Further it is held that this equipoise is attained by both Buddhist and nonBuddhist ordinary persons but not by noble ones because noble ones see this equipoise of nonconception as a deep pit and do not desire to enter into it The phrase a desire for deliverance  altready mentioned in the verse indicates prccisly that this equipoise belongs only to ordinary persons This further statement it is not noble ones then is useless  When one first attains in how many time periods is it attained In the various stages this  it is aṭtained separately moment after moment like the prātimokṣa vows of discipline In ṭthe first moment  since it has never been attained there is no possession of it as past ince there is no thought  one cannot cultivate it as future Therefore when one fitst attains it it is acquired only as belonging to one time period that is as present In the second and following moments until one is about to emerge from it one is also accompanied by it as past After emerging from it until one is on the point of discarding it one is only accompanied by it as past There is no cultivation of it as future as divine sight  Equipoise of Nonconception and divine hearing It is only attained through application  and not through mere detachment Next what are the characteristics of the equipoise of cessation The verse states The equipoise of cessation is also thus in order to a tranquil abode  it īs the summit of existence  it is virtuous  its effects are received at two and are undetermined  it is attained by noble ones through application  because one in thirtyfour moments  Like the previously described equipoise of nonconception the equipoise of cessation is also thus That is for one who is already detached from the passions of the third level of trance there is a factor referred to as the equipoise of nonconception that is able to cause the cessation of thought and thought concomitants so also for one who is already detached from passions in the sphere of nothing at all  there is a factor referred to as the equipoise of cessation that is able to cause the cessation of thought and thought concomitants I   Equipoise of Cessation  The distinctions between these two states of equipoise are as follows In the previously deseribed equipoise of nonconception one develops an aversion to conception through a desire for liberation is attained if preceded by attention the concept of deliverance In the present equipoise of cessation one develops aversion to agitation through a desire for a tranquil abode is attained if preceded by attention directed toward the concept of a tranquil abode The previously described equipoise of nonconception is located in a peripheral region of the realm of form and the present equipoise of cessation is located in a peripheral region of the formless realm Since rebirth in the sphere of neither conception nor nonconception is projected by the highest type of action it is referred to as the summit of existence Or as in the case of the uppermost limit of a tree referred to as the summit of the tree this region is referred to as the summit of existence because it is the extreme limit of existence The equipoise of cessation is found only in this region Why do the lower regions lack this equipoise One is able to attain this supreme liberation only when all states of thought are rejected and thought at the extreme limit is abandoned first one shuns all states of thought If this equipoise were to occur in a lower region then J One could not shun all states of thought because one would not yet be able to shun the states of thought above Also it would not be referred to as thought at the extreme limit has been abandoned because  DistinctionsMoral Quality  thought in the upper regions still would not have been abandoned it should be referred to as a certain portion of states of thought are shunned and as a thought of the middle region has been abandoned In terms of the three moral qualities this equipoise of cessation like the previous  is only virtuous and is neither defiled nor indeterminate Noble ones do not renounce agitation and seize a defiled or indeterminate considering it to be a tranquil abode the previously described equipoise of nonconception are received in the next lifetime or are undetermined That is to say in reference to the maturation of its effects has those that are received in the next lifetime or are received in the third lifetime or after or are undetermined Or its effects are not received at all That is to say after one has given rise to this equipoise in a lower region one then enters nirvāṇa without being reborn into a higher region This equipoise of cessation is able to produce as its matured effect the four aggregates within the summit of existence The previously described equipoise of nonconception is attained only by ordinary persons This equipoise of cessation is attained only by noble ones Ordinary persons are not capable of giving rise to the equipoise of cessation because they have not yet abandoned the obstacle which is characteristic of their own stage to the arising of the equipoise of cessation That is to say one is absolutely incapable of giving rise to the equipoise of cessation until the defllements of the summit of existence that are to be abandoned by the path of vision are surpassed Since no ordinary person is able to   Equipoise of Cessation surpass the defllements of the summit of existence that are to be abandoned by the path of vision only noble ones attain the equipoise of cessation There are other masters who claim that because ordinary persons dread complete extinction and because noble ones enter having a resolution nrvāṇa in the present life  only noble ones and not ordinary persons This theory is unreasonable because the equipoise of nonconception would be the same as this  since they cannot be distinguished on the basis of either the extinction of thought or a resolution nirvāṇa With regard to the  some masters claim that because in the fourth level of trance in the realm of form thought and thought concomitants are gross and still have a corporeal basis not dreading the extinction because the purpose of the cultivation of the equipoise of nonconception give rise to the concept of deliverance and then cultivate the equipoise of nonconception When they cultivate the equipoise of nonconception the concept of deliverance they should also enter it with a resolution nirvāṇa Therefore these theories do not represent correct reasons  When noble ones attain the summit of existence do they all attain this equipoise of cessation or not It should be said that they do not attain it because this equipoise is not attained through detachment Through what then is it attained It is attained through application alone Since it is attained only through application when it is first realized its possession like that of the equipoise of nonconception is only of the present time period There is no past possession of it There is no cultivation of it as future because one can only have future cultivation through the power of thought In the second  Equipoise of Cessation Attained by the Lord  and following moments until one is about to abandon it one also has past accompaniment of it Did the Lord also attain through application He did not He acquired it when he became a buddha that is the Lord acquired it snṭ i the case that the knowledge of destruction cannot be said to be acquired at the time when one becomes a buddha because bodhisattvas can be said to acquire the knowledge of destruction when they abide in the state of alamantine concentration  since when the acquisition nature is produced is referred to as acquired It should be said that the knowledge of destruction is present before one at the time one becomes a buddha but not through application as soon as aspiration arises the perfection of all qualities having arisen in accordance with his desires is present before him none of these qualities within the body of the Buddha was acquired at the time when he became a buddha how could it be maintained that the Buddha acquired this equipoise at the time of the knowledge of destruction Since one is permanently separated from all defillements and adventitious defllements when one is a bodhisattva  qualities are able to arise in ones body as a buddha the qualities of the Tathāgata are all attained through detachment Thus statements are erroneous the proximate stage in the remote stage in which one actually becomes a   Or Since bodhisattvas in the adamantine concentration will inevitably become buddhas could also be referred to as having already become buddhas because they will definitely become buddhas in the immediately succeeding moment When the Lord the knowledge of destruction without having given rise to the equipoise of cessation how is he established as one who has the most complete liberation through both parts  Since he is forever separated from the obstacle to the equipoise lof cessation and has discarded its nonaccompaniment he has attained mastery over the arising of the equipoise of cessation Therefore like one who has already given rise to that equipoise he is established as one who is liberated through both parts ṛhe Westerners claim that bodhisattvas first give rise to this equipoise in the stage of training and afterward aṭtain enlightenment The Vaibhāsika masters of Kaśmīra claim that one does not give rise to the equipoise of cessation first and only afterward produce the knowledge of destruction What reasons do the this country give as to why  How can one not condemn the reasons for the arising the masters of the Western region we masters of Kaśmīra maintain that enlightenment is attained in thirtyfour moments of thought That is to say it is established that various bodhisattvas only enter the comprehensive observation of the truths after fitst attaining detachment from passions in the sphere of nothing at all there is no further need to abandon defilements of the lower regions they attain the great enlightenment in thirtyfour moments that is sixteen moments in the the comprehensive observation of the ṭruths and eighteen moments in the attaining detachment in the summit of existence One abandons the nine grades of defilement of the summit of existence  that is those in the nine stages of the path of immediate succession and those in the nine stages of the path of liberation Thus when these eighteen are appended  Equipoise of Cessation Attained by the Lord  to the previous sixteen there are altogether thirtyfour moments It is not possible to give rise to a dissimilar moment of thought in the midst of this Therefore it is determined that it is not possible to give rīse to the equipoise of cessation in the stages prior If were to give rise to the equipoise of cessation in the prior stages they would then swerve from their intention  However it is determined that the various bodhisattvas do not swerve from their intention It is true that bodhisattvas do not swerve from their intention However it is not the case that they do not swerve from the noble path not tending toward the fluxes If this were so  how would they not also swerve from their intention   means the following s long as I have not attained the destruction of fuxes  I will not break this crosslegged position  It is determined that by not swerving from such an intention all things will arrive at perfection in one sitting wouldnt they have already violated their intention that seeks to give rise to the noble path not tending toward the fluxes In order to exhaust all the fluxes bodhisattvas cultivate the two paths of vision and of cultivation that have not yet been attained desire to pluck out the roots of defilements of the summit of existence to be abandoned by the path of vision and they desire to expel the enemy that is the defllements of the summit of existence the path of cultivation Vowing  bodhisattvas sit crosslegged with this intention In the midst of this  when the great work has not yet been brought to perfection how could bodhisattvas discard the intended path not tending toward the fluxes that counteracts and laud the types of worldly equipoise which from beginningless time have been able to delude us Since it has thus been well established that bodhisattvas attain enlightenment in thirtyfour moments this is the reason not prior  According to the sūtra it is said When one emerges from the equipoise of cessation one will have three types of contact These include contact that is motionless  contact that is of the nature of nothing at all  and contact that is signless What are these three types of contact and how is such contact made Some claim that associated with thought that has emerged from the equipoise of cessation there are three types of contact having the nature of voidness  of the wishless  and of the signless When one emerges from the equipoise of cessation one has these three types of contact in that order There are other masters who claim that the type of contact that is associated with thought in the sphere of the infinity of perceptual consciousness or the sphere of the infinity of space is referred to as contact that is motionless This is due to the fact that these two produce the concepts of perceptual consciousness and space alone The type of contact associated with thought in the sphere of nothing at all is referred to as contact that is of the nature of nothing at all because there is nothing that exists before The type of contact associated with thought in the sphere of neither conception nor nonconception is referred to as contact that is signless because the characteristics of conception and nonconception are not clearly diseriminated the four spheres of the formless realm are referred to as levels of concentration with conception Thought that has emerged from the equipoise of cessation either tends toward the fluxes  Distinctions Between the Two States of Equipoise  or does not tend toward the fluxes When one emerges from the equipoise of cessation one either enters these spheres of concentration  consecutively in reverse order or one enters one sphere bypassing others in reverse order It is possible that one will have present before one any of these types of thought that have emerged from the equipoise of cessation Still other masters claim that thought is limited to that does not tend toward the fluxes is in the sphere of nothing at all and has  or nirvāṇa es its object it is said that upon emerging from the equipoise of cessation one has three types of contact since does not tend toward the fluxes is referred to as motionless since belongs to the sphere of nothing at all is referred to nothing at all since has nirvāṇa as its object is referred to as signless  Though we have already mentioned many similar and distinguishing characteristics of the two states of equipoise they have still other similar and distinguishing characteristics The verse states These two states of equipoise have their corporeal basis in the realm of desire and the realm of form The equipoise of cessation occurs first among human beings The phrase these two refers to the equipoise of nonconception and the equipoise of cessation These two will arise supported the realm of desire or the realm of form However on this point there are those who claim that one enters the equipoise of nonconception only from the three lower levels of   Equipoise of Cessation trance and not from the fourth level since cause Others claim that one enters the equipoise of nonconception also in the fourth level of trance the region of the gods without conception is excluded because birth in that heaven is received as the matured effect of that Oṭher masters claim that one enters the equipoise of nonconception in the realm of desire but not in the realm of form contradicts the following passage in the śāstra Or there may be a type of existence in the realm of form that is not endowed with the five aggregates This refers to sentient beings entangled in the realm of form  who are abiding in a dissimilar moment of thought among the gods who have conception  those practicing the equipoise of nonconception or the equipoise of cessation or those born among the gods without conception who are in the state of nonconception such sentient beings have types of existence in the realm of form that are not endowed with the five aggregates From this  it is proven that these two states of equipoise will arise supported the realm of desire or the realm of form this is their common characteristic the distinguishing characteristics  whereas the equipoise of nonconception can arise for the first time either in the realm of desire or the realm of form the equipoise of cessation arises for the first time only among human beings  and then retrogresses from it is one then able to cultivate it once again after being reborn in the realm of form where one is supported by a body in the realm of form One who has been reborn in the formless realm cannot enter the equipoise of cessation because there is no corporeal basis in that realm to  Retrogression  act as the support for this equipoiseJ Vitality necessarily occurs in conformity with form or thought If one who had been reborn in the formless realm were to enter the equipoise of cessation since there would be neither form nor thought vitality would be abandoned Sīnce the various aggregates abide in mutual dependence upon one another there is no sentient being who is endowed with only one aggregate Further since thought and thought concomitants cannot be separated from one another there is no sentient being endowed with only ṭhree ageregates It is known on the authority of the Udāyisūtra which states There are monks in this world who having perfected morality  concentration  and insight  are able to enter and emerge repeatṭedly from the cessation of conception and feelings  it is known in accordance with fact that this is possible Having been reborn there they will again enter and emerge repeatedly from the equipoise of the cessation of conception and feelings it is known in accordance with fact that this is possible The Lord has explained that the divine body made of mind is in the realm of form this equipoise of the cessation of conception and feelings is located only in the summit of existence If there were no retrogression from this equipoise once īt is aftained one would not be able to be reborn into the realm of form Thus we have extensively elaborated the distinguishing characteristics of these two states of equipoise In general there are six varieties  their location  their intended purpose  the lifestreum in which they occur  their matured effcts  the manifestation of their matured effects  and the place where they are first produced one produces this equipoise by opposition to those two views and desires one opposes them in particular As has already been extensively analyzed in the discussion of the five aggregates these two factors numerous dangers Therefore one enters the equipoise of cessation by opposing them in particular Other masters maintain that all associated factors originate or cease are attained or are abandoned or undergo any such event together at the seme time Those who expound the doctrine teach through many different perspectives in accordance with means suitable The Abhidharma relying only upon correct principle discriminates the categories of intrinsic nature and phenomenal characteristics for all factors and determines whether the purport of the sūtras is real or provisional  one should acknowledge that thought concomitents likewise should not be separated If they state that the various mental forces are extinguished in this equipoise  one should acknowledge that thought likewise should be extinguished in that state Other sūtras also contain vague passages Thus there are sūtras that claim that the right complete enlightenment of the buddhas in every case takes heedfulness as  ObjectionII  its essence In other sūtras nanda is reported as saying the incomparable enlightenment is attained through striving Some claim that insight is able to destroy defilements and others state that if one cultivates the concept of impermanence one is able to abandon passion for desires in the realm of desire and so on as is presented in detail The Dārṣṭāntikas make the following statement  This theory is unreasonable because all states of thought are produced or destroyed together with conception and feelings What scrip tural authority is there to prove that this interpretation is correct As is stated in the sūtra The eye and form constitute the conditions that produce visual perceptual consciousness Contact the collocation of these three Feelings  conception  and volition arise together with  No sūtra passage states that there is a seventh type of perceptual   Equipoise of Cessation consciousness thereby allowing one to claim that some type of perceptual consciousness is produced apart from conception and feelings Further because the basis is extinguished in this equipoise of cessation that which is supported by this basis is likewise extinguished It is not possible that the various thought concomitant factors are capable of arising independently without a basis Therefore thought and thought concomitants are all extinguished in this is untenable because there is a distinction  It is true that the term saha appearing in the passages concerning king Mandhātā and so on indicates immediately successive arising since it is established that a disagreeable action and a disagreeable eftect should not be produced at the same time As that sūtra passage states since king Mandhātā gave rise to an evil moment of thought he fell immediately  this means that he fell from that state only at a later time because the impure and the imb of enlightenment are distinguished in nature as tending toward the fluxes and not tending toward the flxes they do not arise at the same time if the term saha in the sūtra indicates arising at the same time neither scriptural authority nor reasoned argument is contradicted in any way Further if one maintained that the term saha indicates immediately ṣuccessive arising the fault of errancy would be incurred  General Response  of the four noble truths occurs together with happiness and together with joy One cannot further maintain that this has the same as the sūtra concerning Mandhātā and so on that is that the comprehensive observation of the four noble truths is produced only immediately after happiness and joy Further as the sūtra states Since moments of thought and so on that have passion are simultaneous with passion they are referred to as moments of thought having passion This should not be interpreted as meaning that the moment of thought that arises immediately after passion is referred to as a moment of thought having passion If it is in this way a categorical fault is incurred Moreover conception and feelings and so on are referred to as thought concomitants because they rest upon thought as their basis conception and feelings and so on cannot be produced apart from this basis If one claims that thought that acts as the contiguous condition is referred to as the basis since thouglit also is produced in immediate succession in dependence upon a thought it should be referred to as a thought concomitant Similarly since thought is produced in immediate succession in dependence upon thought concomitants the thought concomitants also should be established as having the nature of the basis Such points as these will be discussed extensively in the section on the six causes Further the sūtra states When one enters the equipoise of cessation mental forces are extinguished Turther if the stream of perceptual consciousness were not extinguished for a period of time in this equipoise the collocation of the basis objectsupport and perceptual consciousness would definitely occur because perceptual consciousness cannot be produced apart from its basis and its   Equipoise of Cessation objectsupport Then with the collocation of these three contact would inevitably result and together with the arising of contact there would be feelings conception and volition in the equipoise of cessation the two factors conception and feelingsalso would not be extinguished The sūtra states Craving has feeling as its condition However even though an arhat has feelings do not serve as the condition for craving Contact also should be understood in this way that is not all types of contact produce feelings and so on is not appropriate  because there is a distinction sūtra passages explicitly qualify as follows Feelings produced by contact having ignorance constitute the condition that produces craving Since arhats are without contact having ignorance even though they have feelings do not produce craving the production of feelings Therefore through the simple presence of contact feelings and so on are inevitably produced Other masters claim that even though the nature of perceptual consciousness remains in th equipoise of cessation there is no contact It is not known what they understand contact to be All types of perceptual consciousness necessarily arise in dependence upon a basis and an objectsupport The Buddha has explained that the collocation of the three factors of the basis objectsupport and perceptual consciousness results in contact Since contact is the condition for the production of feelings and conception and so on to allow the collocation of the three in the equipoise of cessation and yet claim that there is no contact is merely vain prattle As for the first reason offered by the Dārṣṭāntikasthat there are no sentient beings who are without thoughteven if one were to claim that thought alone exists in the equipoise of cessation there would be no volition or discernment because it is stated that all mental  Refutation of the Dārṣṭāntikas  forces are completely extinguished in the equipoise of cessation If thought is without volition  then it is without volition and discernment A moment of thought without volition and discernment similerly is not permitted Since thought in every case has activity due to volition when there is no volition there is also definitely no thought it is reasonable that there must be sentient beings without thought is different from death because have vitality  and so on Sentient beings need not have both form and thought If thought definitely existed  form also should be so there are times when form does not exist Therefore a sentient being is defined as one who has vitality However vitality necessarily depends upon either form or thought the quotation from the sūtra  which states that perceptual consciousness is not separated from the body does not disprove the fact that thought is absent in the equipoise It is said that is not separated  precisely because perceptual consciousness will necessarily be produced once again in the body that acts as the corporeal basis That is to say the stream of perceptual consciousness flows within the homogencous collection of components constituting one lifestream and is not absolutely eradicated It can be illustrated by the example of illness caused by spirit possession though the symptoms may not be manifest for a period of time since the possessing demon has not yet been permanently ousted it is referred to as not separated the statement  which states that life warmth and perceptual consciousness are not separated from one another also does not disprove the fact that thought is absent in the equipoise of cessation Since in the formless realm one has no warmth at all but one is not without life or perceptual consciousness similerly in this equipoise one has no perceptual consciousness at all but one is not without life or warmth The fact that there is no form of any kind in the formless realm will be extensively discussed at a later point the equipoise of cessation is necessarily without thought  Thought is capable of being produced once again after the equipoise because it is projected by the moment of thought prior to equipoise acts as the contiguous condition for thought upon emerging from equipoise  Is the nature of the equipoise of cessation provisional or real One should say that the nature of this equipoise is real and not proviīsional because it obstructs thought and causes it not to arise On this point the ūtra master adopts a different interpretation and states The moment of thought just prior to equipoise is able to obstruct That is to say the moment of thought just prior to equipoise arises opposed to other moments of thought and because it arises other moments of thought are caused merely not to operate for a period of time That is able to project a corporeal basis opposed to other moments of thought and causes to continue The state of the mere nonoperation that constitutes this provisional equipoise does not exist either before entering or after emerging from it and therefore one can provisionally claim that this is included among conditioned factors Or precisely that corporeal basīs which is projected by the moment of thought equipoise and is caused to arise in such a way that  is provisionally established as an equipoise If were accepted from what would the moment of thought after arise states that the arises in dependence upon the body possessed of sense organs  because the body possessed of sense organs and thought contain each others seeds How is this theory reasonable since  the perceptual consciousness of all objects would arise simultaneously at all times For those who claim that the moment of thought after arises in dependence upon the moment of thought prior even though the corporeal basis and the objectfield exist at the same time there is no simultaneous arising of all objects if one maintains that perceptual consciousness arises in dependence not on causes and conditions of its own kind but rather on the body possessed of sense organs what factor constitutes the obstruction to the simultaneous arising of the perceptual consciousness of all objects at all times I have heard that there are other masters who have proposed this view maintaining that there is the simultaneous arising of many types of perceptual consciousness in one body Now if one examines  it seems that since resembles his own inherited tradition he has made these statements with the desire to be consistent with their theory Our statement that perceptual consciousness arises after not from the moment of thought just prior to  but rather from the body possessed of sense organs was   Equipoise of Cessation made with regard to states without thought Since the seeds of thought are in the body possessed of sense organs and is not dependent on the moment of thought prior In states in which there is thought  do not arise from those This is also unreasonable because there should not be different causes for the arising of thought in each case Consequently when the various types of perceptual consciousness arise in states in which there is thought they should further depend reciprocally upon seeds within the body possessed of sense organs Why is this when one is in states without thought there are within the body possessed of sense organs seeds of the moment of thought prior to equipoise which oppose other moments of thought The seeds of other moments of thought within the body possessed of sense organs are suppressed by  there should then be no predominant force ṭhat can cause the arising of these other states of thought One might claim that in these states there are within the body possessed of sense organs unlimited seeds of thought that do not oppose moments of thought and that other moments of thought are produced from the predominant force of these seeds states in which there is thought should also be so How could be produced without depending upon the body possessed of sense organs Moreover is like maintaining that sprouts of wheat or rice and so on are capable of being produced from ground and so on alone without depending upon seeds of their own kind as their cause What thinking person could hear this and not roar with laughter Now if one maintains that the nature of the equipoise of cessation is merely provisional it is not clear which factors serve as the basis of this provisional  it is not possible for a provisional entity to exist apart from its basis Further  Conclusion  were the mere nonoperation and its nature were nonexistence how could he say that it is included among conditioned factors It would not exist before  after or in the present because its nature as existent would forever be impossible Nevertheless he says that it exists and is included among conditioned factors This is mere vain prattle and is totally without meaning might respond that this provisional equipoise does indeed have a basis corporeal basis which is projected by the moment of thought equipoise and is caused to arise in such a way that  is provisionally established as an equipoise then this equipoise should be included among the indeterminate factors Since it is not possible for an indeterminate factor to be virtuous  Therefore thought should only arise in dependence upon thought It is not the case that the power of the moment of thought just prior to equipoise is capable of obstructing other moments of thought From this it is known that apart from the moment of thought just prior  there definitely exists a discrete factor that is capable of obstructing thought Even though the causes of the thought exist in the state without thought thought does not arise because of this factor Precisely this diserete factor is referred to as the equipoise of cessation Its nature is conditioned and is real not provisional is projected by the intensity of the intention of thought just prior to equipoise by one who cultivates discernment the force of the equipoise of cessation and allows it to diminish gradually until it reaches a state of complete extinction When there is no activity of obstruction mental perceptual consciousness is produced once again having the mental organ and factors that were present prior to equipoise as its conditions one should interpret accordingly the previously  Equipoise of Cessation discussed equipoise of nonconception and the state of nonconception We have finished discussing the two states of equipoise What is vitaliby The verse states The controlling faculty of vitality is life  which is the support of warmth and perceptual consciousness  The nature of vitality is precīsely life Thus the śāstra states What is the controlling faculty of vitality  It is life of the three realms Even though is given as a synonym  the intrinsic nature has not yet been presented in detail and should now be described What factor is referred to as life There is a discrete factor which acts as the support of warmth and perceptual consciousness and is given the name life Therefore the Lord has said When the three factors of life warmth and perceptual consciousness discard the body having been cast off it collapses unconscious like a piece of wood Therefore that discrete factor which is the support of warmth and perceptual consciousness and is the cause of the abiding of their stream is referred to as life   Vitality If  what factor acts as the support of life We claim that the support of life is previous action  because since it is not exclusively the matured effect of previous action Even though there are cases in which perceptual consciousness operates continuously for the period of one lifetimesince it is not exclusively the matured effect of previous action one cannot claim that perceptual consciousness is supported by previous action perceptual consciousness produced through the maturation of within one homogeneous collection of components can be interrupted and then continue it is supported by life Further how is it known that life supports warmth because one has warmth only if one has life Since there are cases in which those who are without warmth have life it is known that life is not supported by warmth Arent there cases  in which there is warmth without life Even though such cases are observed they are not being discussed here snce this discussion concerns that warmth that ocecurs together with life and perceptual consciousness Thus it can be known that there is a discrete real entity whose power is such that it is able to support the warmth that is included among factors constituting sentient beings and perceptual consciousness this is referred to as life  Exisential Status   With regard to this the ūtra master makes the following statement Now we do not say that life does not exist at all we only claim that life is not a discrete real entity If this is so what factor is referred to as life It is the momentum of the period of abiding of the six sense organs together with their basis as projected in accordance with action in the three realms Due to the momentum which is projected by action of the period of abiding of the six sense organs together with their basis the lifestream is determined and in accordance with the that period of abiding for that period of time abide This momentum is referred to as life It is like the momentum of the period of development as projected by a seed of grain  or the momentum of the period of flight as projected by an arrow that has been shot If in these cases the matured effects of action operated continuously without interruption from the moment of birth until death it would be possible to say that there is a momentum of the period of abiding as projected by action the lifestream is determined and which is referred to as vitality But since there is no continuous and uninterrupted operation of the momentum of the period of abiding as projected by previous action how can he claim that vitality exists Given the ūtre masters principle concerning the nature of lifel what factor would be referred to as the momentum of the   Vitality period of abiding as projected by action When there is no determination of the stream in what sense would he claim in accordance with the that period of abiding for that period of time abide is then referred to as life Therefore the lengthy explanation of the meaning of that febricated by the Sūtra master alone is completely without a referent sīx sel Further the examples cited by cannot be used to prove Since the stream projected by a seed is without interruption and operates continuously throughout the time of its development and since the stream projected by an arrow that has been shot is without interruption and operates continuously throughout its flight it is possible that these two have momentum that lasts throughout their period of developmnent or their period of flight the stream of the matured effects of action īs not wīthout interruption at all times action has been expended it is still the projected momentum of the period of abiding the lifestream is determined and in accordance with the that period of abiding for that period of time abide Therefore these examples cannot be used to prove Thus life is a discrete real entity that supports warmth and perceptual consciousness and is referred to as vitality  This vitaliby does not operate only in conformity with the body since vitality exists in the formless realm nor does it operate only in conformity with thought since vitality also exists in the state without thought If this īs so then in conformity with what does vitality operate It operates in conformity with the action from a previous lifetime that is able to project it and in dependence upon homogeneous character in the present  Death  lifetime  Now we should consider further whether the various types of death occur as a result of the destruction of life  or as a result of other causes The Prajñaptiśāstra states There is death results from the destruction of life and not from the destruction of merit elaborated in terms of four alternatives first alternative the exhaustion of the force of actions that have life as their matured effect second alternative the exhaustion of the force of actions that have enjoyment as their matured effect third alternative the exhaustion actions that have both effects fourth alternative an inability to avoid unfavorable circumstances relinquishment at will of the conditioned forces of ones life should not be mentioned because its sense is included within the first alternative In the state in which life is exhausted exhaustion of merit has no further capability to effect death Therefore actions means death that occurs at the time when both actions are exhausted The Jñānaprasthānaśāstra states Should it be said that life continuously operates bound to the lifestream  or that it abides having arisen once  It should be said that the life of those sentient beings entangled in the realm of desīre who have not entered the equipoise of nonconception or the equipoise of cessation continuously operates bound to their lifestream who are cultivating the equipoise of nonconception or the equipoise of cessation as well as all sentient beings of the realm of form and the formless realm should be said to abide having arisen once What is the significance of this passage When the corporeal basis is   Viṭality damaged life accordingly is damaged the first case in which continuously operates bound to the lifestream When the corporeal basis is not capable of being damaged abides as it arose the second case in which abides having arisen once the first case refers to that that has an obstacle  the second case refers to that that is without an obstacle Through this it is determined that untimely death is possible Therefore the sūtra states There are four varieties of acquiring modes of personal existence  that is to say there is a mode of personal existence whereby mortal injury can occur only through ones own volition  and not through the volition of another  and so on in detail there are four alternatives those for whom mortal injury can occur only through their own volition and not through the volition of another includes those born in the realm of desire as gods who are carried away with amusements  and those who are corrupted in mind with anger Further regard each other with hostile thoughts after giving rise to excessive anger For these reasons and no others they fall from their current state Here one should also mention those who are able to relinquish their life at will since they relinquish their life through their own volition and not through the volition of another those for whom mortal injury can occur only through the volition of another and not fthrough their own volition includes those still in an egg or those in the wombthat is in the five stages of fetal development of kalala arbuda peṣin ghana and praśākhā ḷa those for whom mortal injury can occur through both their own volition and the volition of another includes the majority of other sentient beings in the realm of desire namely those in hell  in the Uttarakuru those correctly abiding in the path of vision  those in the equipoise of sympathetic joy  in the equipoise of cessation and in the equipoise of nonconception sages  messengers of the Buddha  those predicted by the Buddha Dharmila Uṭttara Gaṅgila and the youth Yaśas who is the son of a leeding merchant Jīvaka and so on all bodhisattvas in their last lifeṭime  and mothers who are carrying bodhisattvas all wheelturning kings and mothers who are carrying wheelturning kings If it is the case  why is this stated in the sūtra Lord who are those sentient beings whose mode of personal existence is not capable of having mortal injury either through their own volition or through the volition of another āriputra those are the sentient beings belonging to the sphere of neither conception nor nonconception in that sātra by giving the last  the previous ones are included implicitly just as other sūtras give the first As is stated in the sūtra in the first level of trance there is happiness that is produced through separation Here by giving the first level the sūtra implicitly includes the later stages that also have this happiness the previous stages are implicitly included by giving the last sentient beings born either in the formless realm except for those in the summit of existence or in the levels of trance can also having mortal injury only through their own volition like the gods of the realm of desire who are carried away with amusements and those also fall from their current state through the production of defilements of the same category that is defllements charac  In the summit of existence these two types of mortal injury are not possible Therefore maintains that is not subject to either type of injury Isnt it the case that the summit of existence also has mortal injury caused by the noble path of other stages should be referred to as having mortal injury through the volition of another This interpretation would also be consistent with reason However the word another in this case refers to higher regions because the word another is also applied to something that is surpassing Or something is said to be another only if one is without mastery with regard to it īnce in all cases the higher regions have mastery with regard to the lower regions the word another does not refer to However the following criticism of this should be offered If the Buddha  used the phrase injury through ones own volition or through the volition of another in the sense of abandoning defilements through the path of ones own stage or another stage then one should not say that one reaches the point of death as a result of injury through oneself or another It is not the case that one either has death or does not have death as a result of abandoning or not abandoning defilements Further this would not be consistent svith the prior interpretation  helbeings and so on neither type of mortal injury occurs Lord do those sentient beings fall from their current state or not āriputra if those sentient beings have not yet abandoned defilements they will fall once again but if they have already abandoned deflements they will attain final nirvāṇa precisely in that state Why did the Venerable ask the Lord this question only about the final mode of personal existence He asked this question in order to expel the excessive pride permanence that occurs in beings in this final mode of personal existence pride that results from their lack of mortal injury either through their own volition or through the volition of another  and so on as is presented in detail  What is the distinction between the conditioned forces of vitality and the conditioned forces of life  The conditioned forces of vitality refer to life that is destined to arise while the conditioned forces of life refer to life that is not destined to arise Some have made the following statement The conditioned forces of vitality refer to that which is not to be discarded while the conditioned forces of life refer to that which is to be discarded Further others state The conditioned forces of vitality refer to the effects of the four bases of supernormal power while the conditioned forces of life refer to effects of actions in a previous lifetime Still others state The conditioned forces of vitality refer to that which is produced under the sovereignty of clear intuition while the conditioned forces of life refer to that which is produced under the sovereignty of ignorance Or others state The conditioned forces of vitality refer to that which is attained only in the lifestream of one who is free from passion while the conditioned forces of life refer to that which is attained also in the lifestream of one who has passion These are the distinctions between the conditioned forces of vitality and the conditioned forces of life   Vitality We have finished discussing the controlling faculty of vitality What are the four characteristics The verse states The characteristics are the nature of birth  continuance  senescence  and desinence of conditioned These four are the characteristics of conditioned Since they indicate the nature characteristics   Among these because it is able to draw out end enable their production Being able to draw out means that this factor has as its nature the ability to act as the predominant condition of those at the time when they are being produced Even though all arising of conditioned forces could be referred to as birth this name birth is given only to the predominant cause of nonobstruction when conditioned forces are in a state of being produced   Four Characteristics Continuance is a diserete factor that acts as the predominant cause of the nonobstruction of conditioned forces which have already been produced but have not yet been destroyed projecting their own effect Senescence is a discrete factor that acts as the cause of the fact that subsequent within the stream of conditioned forces differ from prior ones Desinence is a discrete factor that acts as the predominant cause of the destruction of conditioned forces that are produced together with it  Doesnt the sūtra state There are three conditioned characteristics of conditioned factors IS Continuance acts as a virtuous friend that is able to stabilize conditioned Why was it not mentioned  The fact that the sūtra did not mention it must have a reason and should be clarified The sūtra mentioned those characteristics that indicate only the conditioned The characteristic of continuance does not indicate only the conditioned because unconditioned factors by nature also have continuance as their partīcular inherent characteristie land therefore can also be described by the term continuance Or here four kinds in order to indicate completely the qualities and defects of conditioned factors In that sūtra passage only three are mentioned in order to indicate only the defects of conditioned factors Or just as another sūtra passage states only that conditioned forces are factors that have production and destruction and yet it is not to be assumed that they lack senescence so also in the case of this sūtra pasumed that lack the nature sage it is not to be a  ūtra Mentions Only Three Characteristics  of continuance only mentions that there are three in consideration of certain specific reasons Therefore that four does not contradict three In consideration of what reasons did mention only these three  Since  the sūtra mentions only three characteristics in order to prevent disciples from questioning whether conditioned and unconditioned factors are mutually similar Or that this sūtra passage implicitly refers to continuance because it mentions three explicitly but does not use the restrictive word only If were different from this Or in the sūtra because the compound change in continuance  is mentioned If were not  the word continuance would be without a function The purpose of the compound is to indicate that the continnance of conditioned factors necessarily involves change Unconditioned factors are distinguished from conditioned factors because they have continuance without change That the compound change in continuance is mentioned in that sūtra passage does not indicate that continuance is precisely change it only indicates that conditioned factors have arising passing away continuance and change One might claim that the continuance of unconditioned factors is not established This however would be unreasonable because is necessarily established The fact that unconditioned factors have continuance is established precisely by establishing that there are three unconditioned factors   Four Characteristics Therefore it is determined that there are precisely four conditioned characteristics  Since these characteristics of birth and so on are conditioned  they should have four additional characteristies of birth and so on If these additional characteristics existed it would incur the fault of infinite regress because those would have still other characteristics of birth and so on Why is this The verse states These of the birth of birth  and so on Those function wīth regard to eight and one In this  the verb to have also conveys a restrictive meaning Its intention is to indicate that these have only four and no others these refers to the four primary characteristiecs mentioned previously The phrase the birth of birth and so on refers to the four secondary characteristics  that is the birth of birth birth on down to the desinence of desinence desinence Conditioned forces are conditioned due to the four primary characteristics the primary characteristics are conditioned due to the four secondary characteristics Where did the Lord expound these four secondary characterisbics That is to say since the characteristics of birth and so on also are conditioned the characteristics of the birth of birth and so on likewise have arising and so on as their nature When the sūtra states there are three condi tioned characteristics of conditioned  the arising of that which is conditioned also can be discerned the passing away  and the change in continuance also can be discerned how can the secondary characteristics not be included here Further since the word also appears in connection with each of these characteristics the secondary characteristics are also of that which is conditioned also can be discerned  the word arīsing refers to the primary characteristic of birth and the word also indicates the the birth of birth The phrase the passing away  and change in continuance also can be discerned would be understood correctly according to this interpretation of the words arsng and alsor If this were not so what function would the word also have With regard to unconditioned factors it is stated in the sūtra that it can be discerned that they are even without arising and so on The intention of this passage is that it can be discerned that unconditioned factors are even without the primary characteristie of birth and so on If this were not so would have stated simply it can be discerned that are wīthout arising and so on the sūtra would not have used the word even Further the Lord states in the sūtra that the conditioned characteristics have further characteristics Further the sūtra mentions the birth and so on of old age and death Therefore it is known from these characteristics have further characteristics   Four Characteristics If this were so each primary characteristic just as any factor that is characterized would have four secondary characteristics Those characteristies would each in turn have four other the fault of infinite regress This fault is not incurred because the capability of the four primary characteristics and that of the four secondary characteristics are distinguished as applying respectively to eight factors and to one factor This means that the four primary characteristics each function with respect to eight factors and the four secondery characteristics each function with respect to one factor What is the meaning of this When a factor is produced nine factors arise simultaneously including ītself that is the factor itself constitutes one factor and the primary and secondary characteristics constitute eight factors Birth among the primary characteristics is able to act as the proximate condition in producing the other eight factors with the exception of itself factors do not have the function of production with regard to themselves The birth of birth among the secondary characteristics is able to act as the proximate condition in producing only ṭhat primary characteristic of birth among the nine factors the production of one and the production of many is a distinction based on their respective capabilities Since their nature as productive is not different how is there a distinction in their capability It is like the case of feelings though they are not different in their nature as experienced sensation  there are distinctions in their capability for injury or benefit It is like the case of the five types of perceptual consciousness and mental perceptual consciousness Similarly continuance among the primary characteristics is able to act  Existential Status  as the proximate condition in causing the other eight factors to abide that is with the exception of itself The continuance of continuance among the secondary characteristics is able to act as the proximate condition causing only that primary characteristic of continuance among the nine factors to abide The capability of continuance is such that it acts as the proximate condition causing factors to abide for a period of time thereby enabling them to project their own effect Senescence among the primary characteristics is able to act as the proximate condition in causing the other eight factors to change that is with the exception of itself The senescence of senescence among the secondary characteristics is able to act as the proximate condition causing only that primary characteristic of senescence among the nine factors to change Desinence among the primary characteristics is able to act as the proximate condition in causing the other eight factors to be destroyed that is with the exception of itself The desinence of desinence among the secondary characteristics is able to act as the proximate condition causing only that primary characteristie of desinence among the nine factors to be destroyed Therefore the characterīstics of birth and so on have additional characteristics since there are only four secondary characteristics there is no fault of infinite regress  Why are the characteristics discriminated in this way It would not be reasonable to discriminate them otherwise Why is this If one were to discard the correct principle by which the bhidharma establishes these characteristics and accord oneself with other schools one would scarcely be able to establish the conditioned characteristics at all All notions that are opposed to the correct principle of the Abhidharma concerning the true meaning of these characteristics and so on are mistaken In every case such common notions pervert the truth We will now discuss this extensively Now that Sūtra master relying upon others states Why is there such splitting of space It is not the case that the characteristics   Four Characteristics of birth and so on exist as real entities in the way in which they have been discriminated Why is this It is because there is no means of valid cognition  That is to say these characteristics cannot be proven to exist as real entities through means of valid cognition by direct perception  by inference  or by scriptural authority  as can form  and so on Would say that these characteristics of birth and so on discriminated in some other way exist as real entities He would not If  his statement the characteristics of birth and so on do not exist as real entities in the way in which they have been discriminated would be useless Then is there a means of valid cognition by direct perception inference or scriptural authority that would prove that these characteristics exist provisionally as in the case of a pot While rejects their existence as real entities he should definitely allow that these characteristics of birth and so on exist provisionally because it is necessarily unreasonable to posit a third form of existence This is due to the fact that if one denies that birth and so on have the distinctive characteristic  one should accordingly acknowledge that they are not to be admitted at all because they would be absolutely nonexistent First the nature of the characteristics of birth and so on cannot be proven by direct perception to exist provisionally because there is debate Likewise the nature of those characteristics of bīrth and so on cannot be proven by scriptural authority to exist provisionally because there is no passage that asserts their If their provisional existence were by inference then their existence as real entities could also be Thus isnt it you on the contrary who cuts up space by maintaining that exist provīsionally  Proof of Real Existence  We will present at a later point the reasoned arguments that prove the existence of the characteristics as real entities Now we will fitst cite those scripṭural passages that serve as proof The sūtra has said The corporeal verbal and mental actions and intentions belonging to one possessed of false views belong  the conditioned forces belonging to are all of the category of those The intention of this sūtra passage is that since the various conditioned forces such as the characteristics of birth and so on occur in conformity with those  since all have the same effect and since those are considered to be their cause it is said that are of the category of those Since the three types of action are mentioned in this sūtra passage the does not refer to the forces aggregate of feelings and so on  Further only if entities occur in conformity with one object  can it be said accordinely that they are of one If this sūtra passage is not as we have interpreted it what other meaning do you propose that it has Regardless our interpretation does not contradict the sense of this sūtra passage Further the sūtra on the three characteristics is sufficient as a scriptural authority That sūtra states There are three conditioned characteristics of conditioned The arising of that which is conditioned also can be discerned the passing away and change in continuance also can be discerned If  it would have said nmerely three conditioned characteristics You who claim that the three conditioned characteristics of birth and so on do not exist as discrete real entities apart from the factors that they characterize should consider what the purport of these phrases f conditioned factors and also can be discerned You might reply that if had not mentioned the phrase of conditioned the phrase conditioned characteristicss would be sufficient to enable one to discern that the characteristics belong to conditioned Therefore a reason would be subject to the fault of errancy  Isnt it the case that if the characteristics do not exist apart from the thing characterized then this sūtra passage should have been worded previously would be established even apart from the use of the genitive case Furthermore your adducing of in which the genitive does not refer to two separate entities as a reason justifrying your interpretation of this sūtra passage is equally subject to the fault of errancy How can one conclude with certainty from this that the three characteristics mentioned in the sūra passage are provisional and not real Fooll You cling to the words and miss the meaning The meaning is the reliance What is the true meaning of this sūtra passage It is that fools blinded by ignorance are obsessed throughout the long night of transmigration since they are convinced that the stream of conditioned forces self and of what belongs to the self The Lord for the sake of removing their conviction made the following statement in order to indicate ṭhat the stream of conditioned forces has the nature of being conditioned and of being dependently originated  There are three conditioned characterstics of conditioned not indicate that conditioned forces have all three characteristies within a single moment since the of arising and so on as applied to a single moment cannot be discerned That which cannot be discerned should not be established as a characteristic Thus it is further stated in this sūtra that the arīsing of that which is conditioned also can be discerned the passing away and the change in contīnuance also can be discerned  and not to a single moment  Now this interpretation by should not the meaning of the sūtra First one should not allow that there is only one arising one passing away and one change within the stream of conditioned forces Further if it were admitted  it would not need to be expounded Even if those who grasp the self had never heard that there is arising and passing away and so on in the stream of conditioned forces they would still be capable of discerning it automatically Since even though they discern it they still grasp the self the further expounding of this teaching would be superfluous Four Characteristics already discerned and grasping for the self is still prevalent  further expounded this teaching We should consider the purpose for which the Lord expounded this doctrine to his disciples Ordinary persons oblivious to the subtle production and destruction within the stream of conditioned forces grasp self and what belongs to the self The Lord desiring to remove that grasping clearly indicated that there is a particular production and destruction for the many moments within one lifestream of the various conditioned forces Therefore he made the statement that there are three conditioned characteristics of conditioned  and so on as is presented in detail Thus there was a profound purpose dictating the expounding of this sūtra If one claims do not observe the birth and so on of conditioned forces in moment expounding them is without benefit you equally do not observe this Isnt it is the case that if one searches in accord with correct principle one will not fail to discern  If one does not discern the birth and so on of each moment one will never be able to discard the grasping of sel and of what belongs to the sel ROnly the Buddha is able to use skill in expedient means to enable those to search in accord with correct principle and thereby become able to discern Not having already discerned  they produce the view of self When they come to discern them at present the view of self is discarded Therefore one knows that this passage about the three characteristics of conditioned factors is made only in reference to moments and does not depend upon the stream the birth and so on of a moment is not observed expounding them has a function However since given your interpretation of the meaning of the sātra is without a function your interpretation is necessarily unreasonable Therefore our understanding of the sūtra passage does not agree with your interpretation Now you should respond to the following do those who are blinded by ignorance and have given ie to the view of self with regard to the stream of conditioned forces observe those characteristics of birth and so on as applied to the stream of conditioned forces before they have heard this teaching or not If you respond that they do observe them then  and to expound them further would be useless If do not observe  then even after the  Saṅghabhadras ResponseLocus of Application  Buddha has expounded them they still would not discern them because there would be no other cause If you respond that the power of expounding causes to be discerned the principle would be the same for the characteristics as applied to a moment if the characteristics of the stream are gross and easily discerned then those should know them even apart from the power of the Buddhas expounding the If the characteristics of the stream of conditioned forces are not observed and yet one allows that expounding causes them to be discerned thereby enabling one to remove grasping of the self the characteristics moment should also be so How then can you further say that since those do not observe birth and so on as applied to a moment expounding them is without benefit Moreover who is not capable of discerning the birth and so on among conditioned forces as applied to the stream Since it was necessary to further expound  the interpretation of the must contradict the meaning of the sūtra Further birth and so on as applied to a single moment  they can be discerned by subtle discriminative intellect that is to say if one closely examines the immediate succession of moments one will be able to discern them Subtle discriminative intellect is produced as a result of the exposition of  and it discerns the impermanence of conditioned forces and is able to remove grasping of the self Since this is discerned by subtle discriminative intellect it is unreasonable to claim that the three characteristics of arising and so on as applied to a single moment cannot be discerned Next as for staṭement that which cannot be discerned should not be established as a characteristic one cannot state unequivocally that an entitys not being discerned constitutes a sufficient reason for its not being a characteristic Even though gross discriminative intellect cannot discern characteristies such as feelings and so on it is not the case that they are not characteristics Therefore statement that which cannot be discerned is not a characteristic is not reasonable Finally the statement in the sūtra the arising of that which is conditioned also can be discerned the passing away and change in continuance also can be discerned is made with regard to moments The   Four Characteristics intention of this sūtra passage is that when the arising and so on of a moment is examined it can be discerned Therefore the Lord made this statement in order to motivate his disciples to examine Further the fact that the sūtra repeats the word conditioned enables us to recognize that these characteristies indicate are conditioned It does not mean that these characteristics indicate the existence of conditioned as in the case of the presence of a waterfowl which indicates that water does not fail to exist nearby TThis criticism contradicts the accepted doctrine of own school If one allows that a conditioned factor exists in the state of not yet having been produced one can maintain that birth does not indicate the existence of that conditioned factor because that already exists prior to its production when one maintains that a conditioned factor in the state of not yet having been produced is nonexistent how can it be that birth does not indicate the existence of that conditioned factor The example of the waterfowl which indicates the water is then consistent with his own accepted doctrine birh must indicate the existence of conditioned factors If birth did not indicate the existence of conditioned factors in the sense that something not having existed exists  then this would also undermine accepted doctrine which maintains that conditioned factors alone exist The nature of birth is to be equated with the nature s conditioned Sīnce birth and conditioned do not exist as discrete real entities a factors nature as conditioned and existence also are not distinguished How these  Sthaviīras Interpretation  characteristics can indicate  conditioned and not its existence Further if  the first of the two references to conditioned would be without a function The phrase the arising of conditioned factors also can be discerned would be sufficient to establish this meaning Therefore this should indicate the sense that separately that is whether these characteristics indicate the nature as having form and so on or their nature as having flavor and so on or their nature as virtuous or unvirtuous and so on In order to avoid this confusion the word conditioned is repeated is likewise unreasonable Since has already stated there are three characteristics of conditioned  how could these characteristics possibly indicate having form and so on It is not the case that separate factors lack distinguishing characteristics that may be considered separate from that factor Further the sūtra passage will then state the arising of that which is conditioned also can be discerned and so on and will deny that ṭhese three characteristics of arising and so on are to be applied to unconditioned factors These are sufficient to allow one to recognize that these characteristics clearly indicate the nature as conditined What nced would there be for the word conditioned to be repeated Further how could possibly question whether these various characteristics are able to indicate other the nature of   Four Characteristics a factor as having form Since having form and so on are particular inherent characteristics  if arising and so on indicated such they would become particular inherent characteristics and one real entity should not have three particular inherent characteristics Why then would the sūtra state that have three such characteristics Therefore it is impossible for to raise this question Further the word also will also convey the sense of collection thereby enabling one to know that the three characteristics indicate the single conditioned There is no possibility of questioning whether these three characteristics in each case have separate referents Therefore claim is definitely not to be accepted The initial arising of the stream of conditioned forces is referred to as production in the state of extinction it is referred to as destruction the continuous operation of the stream in the interim is referred to as continuance the distinction between prior and subsequent is referred to as change in continuance Next claims that the Lord relying on this sense  addressed Nanda saying The son of the good family knows well that feelings are produced he knows well that feelings abide he knows that feelings deteriorate and are destroyed What is specified by the term stream of conditioned forces t refers to the uninterrupted flow of conditioned factors Then what factor constitutes its intrinsie nature is a provisional factor How could one seek intrinsic nature  Rather moments are mutually similar they are interconnected cause and effect  Saṅghabhadras ResponseI  the conditioned forces produce effects which occur in succession without termination this is referred to as the stream If  it is not reasonable for the ūra master to claim that this stream has one birth because do not arise simultaneously Given that the uninterrupted production of an unlimited number of moments of conditioned forces is referred to as a stream how can he claim that the stream has birth It would only be possible for him to establish the birth of conditioned factors with regard to those conditioned forces that have already been produced eand have not yet been destroyed because with regard to those that have not yet been produced or with regard to those that have already been destroyed Further if this stream exists provisionally is its basis only present  or does its basis also extend to both past and present  If its basis were only present  then this should not be said to be a provisionally existent entity because it is unreasonable for a factor in a single moment alone to be considered the basis of a provisional factor consisting of a stream Rather the characteristic of provisional existence is that one thing is established as a whole on the basis of many factors as in the case of a pot or of motion If the basis of extended to past and present  then since this stream which is provisional takes of previously produced moments and present factors as its basis it would be meaningless to speak of birth of the stream This is due to the fact that it is impossible to say that birth occurs in the past Further if the factors were present then would not constitute a stream because a stream present Thus since it is only possible to establish birth in the present one should only moment and should not refer to a stream   Four Characteristics Saṅghabhadras ResponseIIContinuance of the tream If not this sense sūtra passage would be contradicted The sūtra states Or there is a certain group whose bodies abide for as long as  years It is not possible for one moment to abide for  years Who has said that the body in one moment abides for  years simply means that within this stream of similar the body moments of a different category are not produced for a period of time That is to say similar subsequent moments continue to be produced without interruption from the prior moments body this is provisionally referred to as one body abiding for  years What contradiction does this present to the statement in the sūtra Further should not maintain that the stream has continuance since the name stream  is established on the basis of numerous moments and these numerous moments never abide at the same time Dont we both allow that a moment  a state  and the homogeneous collection of components  are all three established together in the present How then can one say that it is not possible for continuance to be applied to the stream  If there were no the stream  the last twothat is the state and the homogeneous collection of componentswould not be found that is the last two are provisionally referred to as present and birth and so on are likewise provisionally applied to them If one allows that exist in the three time periods this sense of  can be accepted if one claims that do not exist as real entities in the past or future but only exist in the present how can one maintain that there is birth and so on of a stream within the period of one moment  Saṅghabhadras ResponseII   At that time when conditioned forces of the prior moment are not yet destroyed those of the subsequent moment are not yet produced how can one maintain that these twvo share a single characteristic of birth Further how would the two characteristics of birth and desinence not both be established simultaneously within a single moment Further when there is mutual similarity moments or when the conditioned forces are produced without interruption it might be possible to maintain that there is birth and so on of that stream virtuous moment of perceptual consciousness and then an indeterminate state of perceptual consciousness arises without interruption from moment of perceptual consciousness at such times the nature of the prior and subsequent states of perceptual consciousness would not be the same how could one maintain that there is birth and so on of the stream  If one claimed that since prior and subsequent are of the same category as perceptual consciousness one can refer to them as a stream characterized by similarity then such a stream would be without birth This is due to the fact that this single stream of perceptual consciousness has come down from beginningless time this stream should continue without desinence until one is just about to enter nzrvāṇa without remainder Further if an unvirtuous state of arises after a virtuous moment of perceptual consciousness has already been produced and destroyed or if an indeterminate state of perceptual consciousness arises after that unvirtuous moment of perceptual consciousness has already been produced and destroyed how can the two characteristics of birth and desinence at such times not be established simultaneously in the period of one moment Just as rejected that the stream of conditioned forces has birth so also would reject that has continuance and desinence What person sound in mind and body could maintain that what has already been destroyed or has not yet been produced has continuance or that there is a sṭream in a single moment   Four Characteristics Further if the Dārṣṭāntikas do not allow that the conditioned forces of form and so on have birth and desinence in each and every moment then they also maintain that conditioned factors abide over a long period of time In that case then how would their position be different from that of the nonBuddhist Vaiśeṣika masters However if they reply that because there is destruction in the last moment  every moment has desinence  cant they be accused in attempting to refute the accepted doctrine of these other schools by saying one thing and thinking another Further since it is merely the nonexistence of factors that is referred to as the nature of desinence it is their accepted doctrine that this desinence takes the nonexistence of factors es its intrinsic nature In that case factors should not be impermanent because nonexistence of factors cannot possibly be referred to as a factor If factors are said to be impermanent the nature of desinence should not take nonexistence as its intrinsie nature because all factors take existence as their naṭure The intrinsic nature of the characteristic of desinence is referred to as the nature of desinence Further it would not be reasonably established that conditioned forces are factors having desinence because desinence has nonexistence as its intrinsic nature Further if the nature of impermanence had nonexistence as its intrinsic nature then the genitive case should not be used in the phrase the impermanence of form because nonexistence lacks a relation of connection to either self or other Further senescence also the stream it would not  Saṅghabhadras ResponseIV  be possible to allow that there is a distinction between prior and subsequent at all times and in all circumstances Therefore it is said that since maintains that the body and so on do not have the characteristic of senescence in every moment when there is no change in external causes how would it be possible for the body at a subsequent time to be distinguished from the way it presently exists If there is no change in external causes then what produces the distinction between the prior and subsequent moments of the stream  One should not say that the distinction occurs automatically the characteristic continually in the same way and should be without change Futhermore one would be forced to maintain that birth occuts automatically Moreover one should not claim that the apparent distinction is caused by of the same category because of the same category is without change If one claims that there is change in the stream because the prior production within that same category is considered to be the cause or condition of subsequent  in that case earth and so on in dependence upon the prior  should alone give rise to the transformation of cooking quite apart from the collocation of fire and so on However since does not actually arise  it is not reasonable Thus rejects the characteristic of senescence that is produced simultaneously  and yet given cases in which there is no distinction between prior and subsequent due to external conditions he nevertheless firmly maintains that the characteristic of senescence is found in the stream at all times and in all circumstan There is no reason for this and yet he obstinately advances his claim Further he should not maintain that since the prior moment of the cause has the nature of being the condition in conjunction with external conditions it is able to produce the subsequent moment which has the nature of being an effect and that through these there are differences between the prior and subsequent moments of the stream Nor should he   Four Characteristics maintain that in other cases when conditioned forces do not depend upon external conditions due to the characteristic of senescencewhich conditioned factors possess as their nature There are those who maintain that the subtle deterioration in the characterized stream over a long period of time is referred to as senescence This also is not acceptable since the entire stream would not at every point have the characteristic of senescence as its nature As has been said the body formed from the combination of the four findamental material elements and the derived material elements īs at certain times seen to grow and at other times to deteriorate Further what is the cause for this deterioration of the stream  The fault here would be the same as in the immediately preceding example Thus we have refuted that birth and so on are to be applied to the stream the son of a good family knows well future and past feelings That is to say his present knowledge knows future feelings because production is applied to that which is just about to be produced not to fhat which is in a state of having already been produced knows past feelings because the word desrucṭion s applid to that which hes aleady been destroyed not to that which is in a state of being about to be destroyed It is not the case that he knows feelings in the state of having already been produced or in the state of not yet having been destroyed because this would not be reasonable  Sūtra Masters InterpretationII  The phrase the son of the good family knows well that feelings abide and deteriorate was not given in the original Sīnce past and future have birth and so on in the sense that they have existed and will exist these characteristics of birth and so on must exist at all times Therefore on the basis of the scriptural authority and reasoned arguments one should accept that birth and so on exist as real entities within conditioned forces in each and every moment and are not the stream Next the Sūtra master states The four characteristics can also be established for conditioned factors in each and every moment if it is not maintained that they exist as real entities How can this be established In each moment that which not having existed exists is rcfetred to as production and that which having existed no longer exists is referred to as destruction The arising of each subsequent moment in connection with prior moments is referred to as continuance and the distinction between the prior and subsequent that is referred to as change in continuance When similar consecutive moments are produced the dependence between prior and subsequent is not without distinction Therefore so long as one does not maintain that the four characteristics of birth and so on exist as real entities they can be established in the span of one moment doesnt now unwiīttingly establish precisely that previously dreaded theory that his own accepted doctrine would not allow that is that the characteristics of birth and so on exist as discrete real entities how can one conditioned in the span of one moment take the four factors of birth continuance senescence and desinence as its nature without the   Four Characteristics fault that one factor is at the same time produced abides decays and is destroyed If he replies that these because they are each connected to various conditions these conditions should in the same way as these  become conditions at one time ince each one of those conditions takes the four characteristics of birth continuance senescence and desinence as its intrinsic nature for what reason are there four such conditions and why does the first act as the condition of birth and does not itself cause desinence Further for what reason do conditioned factors take only the condition having the nature of birth as that condition which first makes them arise and do not take the condition having the nature of desinence as that condition which would make them not arise at all Further when birth and desinence are established on the basis of one factor whether are different or not a fault is incurred Why is this If they were different  that would be different from itself which is unreasonable If they were not different from one another then when that is produced it should bedestroyed and when it is destroyed it should be produced Therefore should be without the two characteristics of birth and desinence because they are contradictory Further that factor having the nature of birth would be precisely that factor having the nature of desinence Nevertheless maintains that there is no fault of confusion between birth and desinence This would only be possible as an illusion created by the god Viṣṇu Further one should determine whether or not exist in the past and the future Only then would it be possible to claim that the four characteristics are merely provisionally established as applied to either the stream of conditioned factors or a moment not having existed exist and having existed no longer exist Next in what sense does he use the compound characteristic of continuance as referring to the arising of each subsequent moment in connection with prior moments This arising in connection with prior should be precisely birth Since birth would be mentioned twice there should be  not four characteristics  Four Characteristies Simultaneous Activity  Further what condition causes the dissimilarity between the prior and subsequent moments in the stream  The fault mentioned previously would also be incurred here Further if the nonexistence of factors is referred to as the nature of desinence the fault incurred would be as previously discussed Therefore it is known that the birth and so on exist separately as real entities  Next the ūtra master states If birth and so on existed as real entities apart from the intrinsic nature of the conditioned factors of form and so on then one factor at one time would be produced abide decay and be destroyed since allow that exist together with If one maintains that the characteristics of birth and so on do not exist as discrete real entities apart from the conditioned factors  this fault cannot be resolved because it is not reasonably established that there are distinctions in the capability of one factor at one time No such fault is incurred when one allows that the characteristics of birth and so on exist as discrete real entities apart from conditioned factors because gīven the fact that the intrinsic nature are not the same their activities are separate It is observed that among the other conditions that assist such internal factors as fetal stages or such external factors as seeds in the production of their own effect have predominant capability That is to say  for example assisted by perceptual consciousness has the nature of being the predominant cause in producing the second and subsequent fetal stages Even though it is not the case that the second and subsequent fetal stages do not depend upon perceptual consciousness perceptual consciousness is not the predominant cause in producing them It is maintained that perceptual consciousness also acts as a simultaneous condition assisting such as seeds in their production of sprouts and so on In the same way seeds for example assisted by such as the earth have the nature of being the predominant cause in producing such as the earth the earth is not the predominant cause in producing them This is due to the fact that it is the seeds that produce the sprout without interruption However it is not the case that such such leffects as the sprout because the existence or nonexistence of the sprout depends upon that of he earth Further such as the earth are not simultaneous conditions assisting such as seeds in the production of such as sprouts Thus other factors which act as conditions assisting causes in the production of their own effect should be explained in this way Further since calls himself a disciple of the Buddha he should also allow the existence of simultaneously produced causes since the sūtra states Perceptual consciousness and name and form act as reciprocal conditions and thereby are able to abide In this case the first fetal stage and seeds are previously produced causes perceptual consciousness and the earth and so on are simultaneously produced conditions Compared with the previously produced causes the power of these simultaneously produced conditions is predominant This is due to the fact that even given the presence of such previously produced causes as the first fetal stage and seeds if there were no simultaneously produced conditions such  Saṅghabhadras ResponseII  as perceptual consciousness or the earth then the effects such as the second fetal stage or sprouts would never be produced From this it should be known accordingly that even though conditioned factors have many types of external assisting causes and conditions they must also have internal birth continuance senescence and desinence to act as immediate assisting causes  only then would they be able to pass through the time periods Moreover the states of conditioned factors are not the same In brief there are three types that is distinguished the activity of projecting its own effect is not yet attained is just attained or has already been destroyed Conditioned factors are further of two types that is those that exist with activifty and those that exist only with intrinsie nature The former refers to the present The latter refers to the past or future Each of these has two further types that is those whose capability is predominant or subordinate That is to say if conditioned factors are able to act as the cause in projecting their own effect  this is referred to as activity  if they are able to act as conditions assisting of a different category this is referred to as capabiīlity These two types will be extensively considered in the discussion of the three time periods By holding in ones mind the principle of dependent origination distinctive  one will produce conviction and understanding concerning the distinctive capability of those birth and so on Thaṭ is to say when a factor has not yet acquired the activity of projecting its own effect gives rise to n internal condition through the assistance of external conditions that have not yet acquired are about to acquire or have lost the activity of projecting their own effect which has the capability of assisting in carrying out its appointed task is the charac of birth Or when a factor is just about to acquire the activity of projecting its own effect it gives rise to internal conditions through the assistance of external conditions in those Those internal   Four Characteristics conditions which have the capability of assisting in carrying out its appointed task are the three remaining characteristics Birth acts as the internal condition that gives rise to a factor that is to be produced when it is in a state of being about to be produced and reach the state of having already been produced this factor to be produced is referred to as having already arisen Continuance acts es the internal condition that stabilizes a factor that is to be maintained enabling to project its own effect when it is in a state of being about to be destroyed and reach the state of having already been destroyed this factor to be maintained is referred to as having already been able to project its own effect Desinence acts as the internal condition that terminates a factor that is to be destroyed precisely when it is in a state of being about to be destroyed and this factor to be destroyed is referred to as having already been terminated The characteristic of senescence should also be understood in this way Other masters claim that because causes deliver their effects only in dependence upon a location a time period a particular time a state or associates there is a distinction in the time of the arising of their activities that is either when produced or when they have been produced That is to say there are causes that deliver ṭtheir effect in dependence upon a location as in the case of the rain which is produced only in dependence upon a location in which there are clouds or as in the case of the incomparable right complete enlightenment which is realized only in the adamantine seat in Jambudvīpa Or there are some causes that deliver their effect in dependence upon a time period as in the case of causes of maturation or as in the case of causes leading to liberation  which deliver their effect only when they are in the past time period Or further there are some causes that deliver their effect in dependence upon a specific time as in the case of the actions that lead to rebirth as a wheelturning king lead to that state only after a number of cycles Further there are causes that deliver their effect in dependence upon a state as in the case of seeds which are able to produce a sprout only after having reached a transformed state Even though exist as real entities beforehand they are able to have an effect only in that future state in which they are about to be produced There are causes that deliver their effect in dependence upon associates as in the case of the four fundamental material elements or as in the case of thought and thought concomitants which are able to have an effect only when associated with one another In accordance with the principle of dependent origination distinctive  the states in which the activities of the four characteristics arise are shown to be not the same That is to say when are about to be produced the characteristic of birth gives rise to its activity when reach the state of having already been produced the three of continuance senescence and desinence each give rīse to their distinct activities together at one time Thus since the activities and the times of the four characteristics are distinct how can one raise the objection that one factor should at one time be produced abide decay and be destroyed When the factor that is characterized is about to be destroyed it abides for a while and is able to project its own effect due to the distinct characteristic of continuance that acts as the predominant cause At precisely that time is made to decay due to the distinct characteristic of senescence that acts as the predominant cause t precisely that time it is destroyed due to the distinct characteristic of desinence that acts as the predominant cause Therefore the fact that the three at one timepresents no contradiction Now this will be determined The three of continuance senescence and desinence each give rise to their functions separately in   Four Characteristics the state in which the factor has already been produced and cause that characterized factor to have at one time points of dependence that are not the same Altogether there are three What contradiction to reason is there in an interpretation such as this Therefore his objection should not be considered reasonable Further has stated previously If one allows that birth has activity future how is it established as future One should state the characteristic of the future When that factor is present the activity of birth has already faded how is it established as present One should state the characteristic of the present There is no contradiction because there is no activity at any time other than the present Dont the characteristic of birth is able to produce factors while it is still future and precisely this is its activity  Why then do you say that this activity occurs only in the present Fooll You do not understand this activity If conditioned factors are able to act as the cause in projecting their own effect  this is referred to as activity If they are able to act as conditions assisting of a different category this as capability All present but not all present are able to act as conditions assisting of a different category For example an eye in the dark or whose capability has been damaged is not capable of acting as a condition that assists in enabling visual perceptual consciousness to arise However its activity is not damaged by darkness because it is definitely able to act as a cause in projecting a future eye In this way there is a distinction between activity and capability  Saṅghabhadras ResponseActivity and Capability  Moreover in the production of the effect within a stream defnite and indefinite the power of projecting is referred to as activity and is also referred to as capability In the case of the production of an effect within a stream of a different category acts only as the condition that assists in enabling to arise this is only capability and not activity Havent you argued that these three factorsthe presentiment of the knowledge of the doctrine with regard to suffering  and the characteristic of birth jātall are able to give rise to their activities when they are in the future time period Actually the name activity refers only to to project its effect Some raise the following objection If the of birth and so on do not exist in the state in which they are about to be produced how does birth perform its activity at that time and not continuance senescence and desinence If the of birth and so on do exist in the state in which  why do continuance and so on lack activify while birth alon has it This objection is untenable First it is not the case that the of birth and so on do not exist in the state in which since at that time the characteristics of continuance are not in the present time period at that time they have not yet realized their capability and cannot be assumed to functionJ Four Characteristics we assumed that the of birth and so on do not yet exist in this state in which would be as reasonable as your of the relation of cause and effect For according to the accepted doctrine of your school you allow both immediate and remote causes regardless of whether the cause that is capable of producing exists or does not exist in the state in which the effect is about to be produced With the following statement the Sūtra master provisionally acknowledges three of the four characteristics but rejects the characteristic of senescence Now it can reasonably be allowed that one factor having already been produced and having not yet been destroyed is referred to as continuance and being destroyed after having already abided is referred to as desinence senescence through any deliberations whatsoever cannot reasonably be said to exist in reference to a single factor Why is this Senescence refers to the transformation in the nature and characteristics in prior and subsequent  it is not the case that a given factor can be said to be different from itself Therefore the verse states precisely before senescence would not be established if it were different from before it would not be a single factor Such is the problem that the ūtra master must consider The issue that I am to consider will be presented clearly in a later passage that examines the meaning of the three time periods is pertinent to the sense of this  we will present it briefly in order to dispel possible confusion From the beginning factors have only the stable abiding of their intrinsic nature their distinctive activity is not found When a factor encounters ṭhe power of conditions produced prior to or produced simultaneously  its distinctive activity though not having previously existed is caused to arise Precisely this is referred to as its present activity  is also referred to as the capability is able to project its own effect The Lord has made the following statement with regard to this  Not having existed this exists having existed this no longer exists just as the discriminated capabilities of loss or benefit are not different from the intrinsic nature of the experience of those feelings one cannot say that the activity is different from its intrinsic natureFurther as the maintains the traces projected by the distinctive characteristic of a prior moment of thought that are found within a subsequent moment of thought cannot be said to be different from that subsequent moment of thought Or further is illustrated by the nature of that action virtuous derived form which is seen and which has resistance even though it is not dicerent from form the distinctive characteristics of this specific category are well established That is to say the activity whereby a conditioned factor is able to project its own effect within its intrinsic nature is referred to as continuance precisely the deterioration of this activity is referred to as senescence It is not possible that possesses this abiding and deterioration within itself instead there should exist separate factors that cause the abiding and deterioration The causes of these two are precisely the characteristics   Four Characteristics of continuance and senescence How can one claim that the activity changes but not its intrinsic naṭure This fault is incurred in the accepted doctrine of  which maintains that intrinsic nature does not exist in the past or future but is not those who allow the permanent existence of intrinsie nature in the three time periods Why is this When the activity ceases it merely discards the present the intrinsic nature of that factor still remains The intrinsic nature is referred to as having senescence due to the deterioration of its predominant activity Precisely for this reason the compound change in continuance was used causes activity of projecting its effect to deteriorate cause In the moment of this particular effect another characteristic of senescence that arises simultaneously with that effect acts as the condition causing the deterioration As a result it is also able to act as the condition for the weakening of a subsequent effect In this way since every moment in a stream of conditioned factors causes a subsequent moment to change it is established that all prior moments have senescence When this meaning has been established the following inference can be made if one observes that there is a particular distinctive characteristic in the last moment  then  Saṅghabhadras ResponseII  the prior moments definitely have this distinctive characteristie This is not like the principle of illusory senescence as applied to the stream of moments  which was set forth by the Dārṣṭāntika master If this were so then when the stream of is gradually flourishing there should be no characteristic of senescence because its effect is not observed This fault is not incurred because the power of the characteristic of continuance assisted by external causes is predominant at that time and suppresses senescence Other masters claim The activity of factors cannot abide beyond the period of one moment therefore conditioned factors are referred to as having senescence They do not attain the name senescence by discarding their particular inherent characteristic and yet the fault that conditioned factors have the nature of permanence is not incurred The nature of all factors is such that the intrinsic nature is permanent  does not instigate activity  is without transmutation  and cannot vary Therefore fire always takes heat as its intrinsic nature apart from heat no nature of fire can be attained However since the activity of fire must avail itself of various conditions it is established by the accepted doctrine of our school that fire is by nature impermanent If it is the intrinsic nature that changes then a discrete factor would be established since intrinsic nature is without transformation should not be impermanent That is to say if one maintained that exists only in the present time period and does not exist as a real entity in the past and future then the nature of factors that are conditioned forces should be permanent because there would be no change Why would there be no change because the nature of both existence and nonexistence are firmly settled and are without change Since maintain that factors are momentary by nature and exist in the present time period alone it is not possible for to change Since their intrinsic nature does not exist in either the past or future time periods how could one say that nonexistent factors change Therefore since the opponents cannot say that factors   Four Characteristics change in the past present or future time periods they cannot claim that conditioned forces are impermanent Nor can the opponents reply that existence refers to that which is without transformation and nonexistence to that which has transformation and call change The two natures of existence and nonexistence do not cooperatively establish because existence and nonexistence are contradictory in nature Further because it is not possible for the effectto change and the cause in dependence upon cause because the nature of existence is itself impermanent is also unreasonable because the nature of existence cannot be established as anything other Since the nature of existence characterizing factors has never been nonexistent and since that which exists and that which does not exist are established separately change in conditioned forces is as a result impossible Therefore conditioned factors would all continue permanently One might allow that in the past and future time periodsboth exist and do not exist from nonexistence in the state of not yet having been produced can be produced and become existent and from existence in the state of having already been produced can be destroyed and become nonexistent The existence in the present time period in that it is at all times permanent and without variation since activity either exists or does not exist in conjunction with its intrinsic nature which always exists one can say that conditioned factors have change in their states  this is not the case for those who accept the doctrine that exists only in the present since   Simultaneous Production of Factors in the Future  senescence is not found in either the moments or the stream as stated previously of bīth while n its iiture  produces the factor that is to be produced then why arent all future factors produced together since in each case the causes capable of producing would always be provided This has been discussed previously What was discussed previously That is to say when a factor has not yet acquired the activity of projecting its own effect gīves rise to an internal condition through the assistance of external conditions that have not yet acquired are about to acquire or have lost the actīvity of projecting their own effect which has the capability of assisting in carrying out its appointed task is the characterīstie of birth t is in precisely this sense that we say that The verse states Birth is able to produce that which is to be produced  but not apart from the assemblage of causes and conditions The power of the characteiitie of bitth alone apart from the complete assemblage of other causes and conditions  is not able to produce that which is to be produced Therefore future factors do not all arise together The characteristic of birth acts as the simultaneously arising immediate cause that is able to produce that are to be produced Nevertheless conditioned factors nls invitably depend upon the assstance of the complete assemblage of previous causes of their own category and other external causes Thiīs case of assisting causes and conditions īn the production of any given factor is llke that of the distinctive causes and conditions such as a seed and earth and so on that assist in the production of such effects as a sprout and cause the sprout to be produced   Four Characteristics If this is so then we observe only the various causes and conditions that have the capability of production there is no discrete characteristic of birth factors are produced precisely when there is a complete assemblage of causes and conditions and are not produced when there is no such What is the use of this characteristic of birth Therefore there is production only through the power of causes and conditions This criticism is untenable because the same criticism can be offered against those who allow that the production of factors is due only to an assemblage of conditions That is to say if one were to allow that future factors could be produced only through a complete assemblage of causes and conditions then the same criticism could be offered namely since the causes and conditions of these fuṭure factors are not distinguished from not all be produced simultaneously Further even if one among the assemblage of causes and conditions is lacking since the rest are provided the effect should be produced For example the visual sense organ which is projected by previous actions should be produced even apart Or the visual sense organ should be able to arise through the power of the fundamental material elements alone and not through previous actions Or the visual sense organ which is projected in accordance with actions should be able to produce the fundamental material elements because there is no time when the visual sense organ is not assembled  when one is produced the others should also arise Or the fundamental material elements should be without capability with reṣard to the visual sense organ because one does not observe that the fundamental material elements alone produce apart from the prior visual sense organ the subsequent visual sense organ could be produced with the prior visual sense organ alone as its cause the claim that the fundamental material elements are able to produce the  Saṅghabhadras ResponseII  visual sense organ should be determined to be useless In the case of the seed water earth and so on when one of these conditions is lacking the sprout definitely will not arise Therefore one knows that the power of the seed and so on is unequivocally established since this power of the fundamental material elements is not observed it should not be a cause in producing the visuel sense organ Further you maintain that there is transformation within the stream of seeds of action What then acts as the obstacle preventing the simultaneous production of all effects action If one claimed that the seeds of action are only able to produce through the assistance of conditions then one should those conditions alone are able to produce the effect of action is produced through the assistance of various conditions and is not produced when these conditions do not exist Since depends upon the assistance of conditions the seeds of action are not nonexistent how can they reject the characteristic of birth simply because it avails itself of various conditions Further it is observed that when the first moment of not tending toward the fluxes is produced birth is able to act as the cause that gives rise to the possession do not tend toward the fluxes The existence of possession having its own particular inherent characteristic has already been unequivocally established should explain what discrete factor other than birth is able to act as the prior or simultaneously arising cause of this possession If there were no cause at all then their possession would not arise in that case the first moment of not tending toward the fluxes could not be established When the characteristic of birth produces  are there additional separately existing and simultaneously produced causes or not Four Characteristics should say that there are also These are the factors aside from the real entity birth that have the same effect How are senescence and desinence causes that assist in production The ancient masters all offered the following interpretation Factors that have the same effect are reciprocal causes just like the fundamental material elements that accord with one another The following interpretation can also be offered ince conditioned factors all are produced and so on by nature when each of the four characteristics of birth and so on functions the other three taking that one as their occasion become assisting forces To support this interpretation one can cite the case of the four applications of mindfulness  in which one observes the body and so on are of the nature of impermanence If conditioned forces were able to abide for the shortest period of time then why wouldnt they abide for an hour a day a month a season a year or a cycle since the cause would not be different  Further because the scriptures have also stated that conditioned forces are without continuance When all conditioned forces are about to be destroyed they are without continuance and also without destruction Now statement if conditioned forces were able to abide for the shortest period of time and so on is not acceptable The shortest period of time is one moment If there were no continuance even for a moment then conditioned forces would be absolutely nonexistent To those who maintain that conditioned factors are completely without continuance because they are destroyed immediately after they have acquired their own nature   since there is a time when acquire their own nature couldnt that very  Saṅghabhadras ResponseII  be referred to as the shortest period of time during which conditioned forces abide even though there is such a time there is no continuance then to what state does your statement there is no continuance refer to the time when they acquire their own nature or to the time after they have acquired their own nature The cleim that there is a state without continuance can refer only to these two periods of time If are without continuance even at the time when they acquire their own nature then you cannot escape the fault mentioned previously If they are without continuance only after they have acquired their own nature then since do not claim objection is superfluous The time that you refer to as that time when the acquire their own nature is precisely the time when we claim that continuance enables to project their effect The accepted doctrine of our school does not hold that conditioned forces have continuance after the time when they project their effect how can you deny that there is a time when conditioned forces abide while we laccept itl Just as you is necessarily established only when their activity is produced in dependence upon other factors so also upon which it depends is given the name continuance Your claim presents numerous contradictions to both reasoned arguments and scriptural authority Didnt the sūtra state that conditioned forces are without continuance If one claims that there is continuance this seriptural authority is contradicted Your claims contradict because the various falsely imagined theories are contrary   Four Characteristics to the true meaning What fault of contradiction does the principle of interpretation presented by the bhidhārmikas entail Furthermore the statement in the sūtra that are without continuance was made in order to deny permanent continuance The next statement they are also without destruction denies tṭhat the conditioned forces are annihilated If this statement that they are without destruction does not deny that the conditioned forces are annihilated what else then does it deny The destruction of conditioned forces can only be of two types one is destruction immediately after production  the other is absolute annihilation Therefore the sūtra stated that conditioned forces are without both continuance and destruction in order to refute the two extremes of permanence and annihilation It was not intending to refute established by the bhidhārmikas that continuance acts as the cause enabling to project its effect We implore the learned ones to discern accurately whose statement contradicts reasoned argument and seriptural authority Why then did sūtra passage state that are about to be destroyed they are also without destruction The phrase without destruction means without rest The meaning of this sūtra passage is that conditioned forces having been produced will inevitably be destroyed without interruption that is without even a short period of rest since this meaning is already cleerly indicated in the phrase are without continuance then the further phrase they are also without destruction is useless We likewise do not state that conditioned forces having been produced absolutely abide permanently If this is so why do you claim that conditioned factors having been produced have continuance are without continunance means that they stop for a period That is to say when conditioned forces are about to be destroyed they abide for a period One  Saṅghabhadras ResponseII  cannot apply the term continuance when they have already been destroyed or are about to be produced because has no activity As has been stated previously conditioned forces only have the activity of projecting their efiect at the time when they are about to be destroyed In spite of these statements continuance is necessarily nonexistent because no sūtra passage states that there is continuance has never been denied  can one state unequivocally that it does not exist Further since is urged by reason one should accept that it exists Even if there is no seriptural authority presents no contradiction to reasoned arguments What fallacy is there in the statement that exists Moreover there is scriptural authority that proves that continuance exists For example it has been said in the on handclapping O monks Conditioned forces are like a mirage like a flame They abide for a period and quickly pass away Isnt the statement by the bhidhārmikas that conditioned forces abide for a short period of time proven through this  Through this the Vaibhāṣika interpretation is also established that is the statement are without continuance is made in implicit reference is completely nonexistent However statements indicate that he has interpreted the venerable sūtras by applying falsely imagined theories in accordance with his own individual ideas the sūtra has never stated that there is continuance indicates that he and his group have not yet read this sūtra or that he follows his own feelings and rejects the authority of  or perhaps the claims of those in his school have sullied his mind and even though he has culled numerous passages  he does not remember them Moreover the first statement of the Lord in the sūtra passage when all conditioned forces are about to be destroyed they are without continuance could have been made in consideration of the future time period Not accepting these words of the Great Master offers the following criticism Why do you allow that l is made only in implicit reference after the present moment and not after the homogeneous collection of components  What distinction can possibly be drawn between the a moment and this  This criticism is not reasonable because there is a distinction Continuance for the period of a moment has a cause that arises simultaneously The continuance of the homogeneous collection of components however has no such cause Therefore this criticism is not reasonable offers yet another criticism If the power of continuance is able to cause conditioned forces to abide for a period of time then why doesnt this cause conditioned factors to abide through a period of ten billion moments Why would that very cause that makes conditioned forces abide for one moment not make them abide for ten billion moments This atticisn ikevise is unreasonable ince he does not allow  DesinenceI  that conditioned forces are produced apart from the cause that is capable of production why would that cause of the production of conditioned forces in one moment not itself cause their production in ten billion moments The method of reasoning would be the same in every way The following sūtra passages  One should know that both the birth and continuance of pleasant feelings are pleasant or One should know that form and so on has birth and has continuance It would not be reasonable to claim that the sūtras use because in thatcase the meaning would not be established That is to say if one does not allow that moment has continuance then how can the meaning of the phrase continuance of the stream be established Thus the characteristic of continuance is well established by both reasoned argument and scriptural authority However the Dārṣṭāntika master Sthavira ftmly states that does not exist We do not know what grievance he has with continuance The correct principle is evident and yet he will not accept it  Another objection has been raised  If the characteristit of impermanence exists separately as a real entity apart from the nature impermanence why isnt there also a characteristic of suffering existing separately apart from suffering Saṅghabhadras ResponseIDesinence Objections using examples such as these are not rcasonably established If one were to claim that exist having a nature as impermanent due to a should likewise   Four Characteristics exist having the nature of suffering due to a characteristic of suffering However conditioned factors that are impermanent by nature are simply destroyed with the characteristie of desinence as their condition just as conditioned factors that are impermanent by nature are simply produced with the characteristic of birth as their condition What would be the use of proposing that the nature suffering similarly has yet another characteristic of suffering that acts as its condition Therefore objections using such examples are not reasonably established hrough this objections voidness and nonself are refuted Further that very characteristic of impermanence is also the characteristie of suffering because the intrinsic nature is impermanent and as is stated in the sātras on the topic of suffering Further opponent could also be challenged with a similar objection If he admits that a facṭor that is to be produced is only able to be produced through separate conditions of production then he must allow that the factors suffering are only able to be established as suffering in dependence upon separate conditions of suffering then any factor that is to be produced should be produced auṭomatically apart from the conditions of production in the same way as suffering and so on a previous statement What was stated previously Whereas you the existence of conditioned forces for a certain tṭimeis necessarily established only when their activity is produced in dependence upon other factors according to the accepted doctrine of our school in the same way as the nature existent Therefore one knows that there exists separately apart from that factor that is to be destroyed an internal cause which is capable of causing destruction and which is referred to as the characteristic of impermanence  Saṅghabhadras ResponseII  If claims that conditioned forces have no separate cause of destruction production also should be so it should occur without depending upon a cause This is due to the fact that these twoare factors both simultaneous with but distinct from the real entity Or he should explain the reason for this distinction befween them respond that there is a distinction between these two namely since the production of conditioned forces is necessarily dependent upon causes one will observe distinctions in the interval of time in the case of production If the destruction of conditioned forces were also dependent upon causes then there should also be differences in the interval of time destruction If for destruction like production there were an interval of time then this would contradict the accepted doctrine that conditioned forces are momentary Therefore one should know that factors are destroyed automatically without causes This fault is not incurred because the cause of destruction necessarily exists simultaneously with the conditioned forces  there is no distinction in time The cause of production is either simultaneous or not simultaneous with the conditioned forces Since it can act as the cause even if temporally separated  there can be an interval of time in the case of the production of conditioned forces If the destruction of conditioned forces were not due to causes then they should be destroyed precisely when they are about to be produced Or there should be no destruction even in a subsequent state because you allow that prior and subsequent are the same in being without a cause respond how could one object that there should be destruction in this state in which conditioned forces are not yet produced In that case then one should allow that production is the cause of destruction because it is observed that there is destruction only when there is production If allows that the destruction of conditioned forces is necessarily dependent upon their production how could it be said that they are destroyed without a cause Further one can prove by scriptural authority that destruction has a cause The sūtra states Siīnce this factor is destroyed that factor is   Four Characteristics destroyed Further it is saidt Everything has a cause Therefore one should know that conditioned forces are destroyed due to a cause Another criticism states Since there is no cause of continuance factors are destroyed automatically without further causesJ What is the use of a cause of destruction For those who claim that previously produced alone act as causes that which is to be produced would not yet exist at the time when the cause is about to exist since they also maintain that factors do not exist as real entities in the future time period In the state in which the subsequent effect is produced the prior cause has already become nonexistent Even if there were no cause of continuance how could one deny that there is continuance Therefore their claim cannot there is no cause of destruction Further it has been explained previously that conditioned forces that have already been produced abide for the period of one moment with the characteristic of continuance as their cause Why does then claim that continuance is without a cause respond that because conditioned forces are necessarily without existence after one moment they are destroyed automatically If there were no characteristic of desinence then what would send them back to nonexistence The cause of the destruction of that which has already been produced is in all cases the characteristic of desinence Therefore the characteristic of desinence exists as a real entity apart from the conditioned factor  Discrete Existence  Further one should not maintain that the characteristic of desinence does not exist as a real entity in the sūtra passage quoted previously The arising of that which is conditioned also can be discerned the passing away and change in continuance also can be discerned It is not the case that one can arouse discernment with regard to a nonexistent factor because the statement can be discerned is a syuonym for existence Further just as there is necessarily a distinctive characteristic that is capable of production and that causes those factors that are to be produced to reach the state in which they have already been produced in the same way there is necessarily a distinctive characteristic that is capable of destruction and causes factors that are to be destroyed to reach the state of having already been destroyed Therefore it is established that desinence like birth exists as a discrete Just as one is able to establish factors such as existence singularity longness shortness conjunction and disjunction and so on even without a separate nature of existence singularity longness shortness conjunction or disjunction and so on upon which they depend continuance and so on should be likewise without a separate upon which they depend This  in turn incurs the fault of selfcontradiction because according to the accepted doctrine of his school the factors such as existence singularity longness shortness conjunction disjunction and so on must be established in dependence upon other exist in dependence upon causes and conditions factors are dependent upon others and that nature of existence must also have something upon which it depends ccording to your accepted doctrine conditioned forces not having   The bhidhārmikas however claim that this nature of existence of factors exists at all times and is not dependent upon causes and conditions Therefore objection contradicts the accepted doctrine of his own school ince one is only established by denying other of the same category the meaning of one is also established in dependence upon others Longness and shortness are established reciprocally in mutual dependence or they are established in dependence upon a arrangement of atoms Therefore does not exist in and of itself but is necessarily established in dependence upon the other Further the cause of the production of factors would also be refuted through these examples If the nature of existence and so on were established without anything upon which they depend then production also should be so Therefore the distinctive states of conditioned factors are all established in dependence upon different causes and conditions they do not exist automatically Therefore it is unequivocally established that the characteristics of conditioned factors exist separately as real entities within each moment Those characteristics of conditioned factors as proposed by the Dārṣṭāntika mastersthat is a provisionally existing birth and so on that are applied to the stream are not consistent with reasoned arguments and contradict the sūtra Only our accepted doctrine conforms to the sūtre and is consistent with reason Therefore learned ones should exert effort in the cultivation of training We have finished extensively discriminating the characteristics of conditioned factors What do the categories of the name set and so on mean The verse states The name set  and so on are the socalled collection of concepts  sentences  and phonemes  The phrase and so on includes the phrase set and the syllable set  since the name phrase and syllable sets are mentioned in the śāstra The name set is precisely the collection of concepts the phrase set is precisely the collection of sentences and the syllable set is precisely the collection of phonemes The term collection has the meaning of gzathering  because the verb root uc is used in the sense of gathering Concepts refer to concepts that grasp a factor through conceptual discrimination and are issued forth from phonemes that have been established in common for example the eye the ear a pot clothing a cart and so on Such a concept set is precisely the name set that is the eye the ear and so on   Name Phrase and Syllable Sets Sentences refer to explications Worldly treatises are interpretations consisting of inexhaustible explications and containing various distinct sentences is able to bring to completion the explication of the objectreferent that desires to express  for example merit brings a pleasurable matured effect and sṣo on Such a sentence set is precisely the phrase set As has been said Merit brings a pleasurable matured effect All that one desires at will and one quickly realizes the highest eternal and peaceful nrvāṇa Such is the phrase set Phonemes refer to such phonemes as a a i  and so on Such a phoneme set is precisly the sylable sets ka kha ga and so on  There are other masters who state It has been said in the śāstra What is the set of many names It refers to names appellations and so on Those mmasters of the śāstra desiring to discuss names and so on as actually existing characteristics do not raise this question with the assumption that are provisional collocations Therefore their deliberative questions about the set of many names and so on should definitely be taken as questions about names and so on as characteristics that exist as real entities In this consideration of names and so on as characteristics ṭhat exist as real entities what use is it to question whether names and so on are provisional collocations Further each of the three characteristics of name are to be distingnished The characteristic name is manifested by articulated sound and is able to manifest the objectreferent It is a specification established in common  which both manifests that which is produced by an intention and is able to represent the intrinsic nature of objectfields that are known in the same way as an echo The characteristic phrase is able to explicate the objectfield that is known from both a detailed and cursory perspective The characteristic syllable when a speakers articulated sound is in the state of having been destroyed causes that utterance  ObjectionIName Phrase and Syllable are not Distinct  to be ficed in memory preserves precluding doubt and allows to be transmitted to another Here name means that which accords with and directs one back toward ll names accord themselves with the intrinsie nature of and summon whatever the point of return is in what is uttered A phrase is able to explicate the objectreferent that has been expressed is able to explicate the objectreferent from the perspective of its distinctive characteristics A syllable is able to act as the basis of that which manifests  because the that manifest depend upon and have their origin in this this is precisely this phoneme that is to say it causes fixed in memory there is no forgetting or further it is able to preclude doubt because are preserved through this and transmit them to another Consequently there are those who say like the characteristics of objects that serve as expedient means for those in a trance state these objects that are to be realized in trance act as a ladder Syllables function similarly with regard to name phrase and the objectreferent Certain masters claim Since phonemes such as a and i are able to manifest names and phrases they are said to be syllables these very phonemes either separately or together are able to specify the intrinsic nature  they are said to be names this very assemblage of is able to bring to completion the explication of the objectreferent from the perspective of its distinctive characteristics these names are said to be phrases In this way these threeshould be established as having the same nature Further they do not exist as real entities and therefore cannot be relied upon Still other masters  One and the same passage in the sūtra contains the three characteristics For example as the  the phonemes individually are syllables desire is a name the colleetion of names is a phrase These do not escape the fault mentioned previously Therefore the first explanation of the three characteristics of name and so on is to be accepted because it withstands investigation In the sūtra arent the four nonmaterial aggregates of feelings concepts forces and perceptual consciousness collectively referred to as ṇame Also the sāstra has said Corporeal activity and verbal activity ṭhat are contained within the factors sense sphere are included within form The other factors within the factors sense sphere are all included within name Why is it claimed here that name is by nature only a factor dissociated from thought contained within the forces aggregate  the sūtra and the śāstra both attempt to include all factors within two categories those having the nature of form are collectively referred to as form the others that are not form are collectively referred to as name Since names are included in the group that is not form is collectively referred to as name in accordance with this distinct instance ow name  Relation Between Names and the Objectreferent   s it possible for the objectreferent to be expressed  or not ctually one should respond that the objectreferent cannot be expressed If that were so then how could ones understanding of the objectreferent elephant and so on based upon the word elephant and so on not be mistaken Further this would contradict the sūtre which states I will briefly expound the essence of the doctrine for you with meaning and with syllables This fault is not incurred because is established provisionally That is to say people at the beginning of a cycle establish in common particular conceptnames for certain objectreferents is then handed down and in this way there is no mistake in understanding these nameconcepts Further as it is said Speech is able to issue forth in name and name is able to manifest the objectreferent Moreover the sūtra states The syllables and the meaning are skillful However there is no statement  with meaning and with syllables Even if we allow that  no fault is incurred because the Lords statements are complete in both syllables and meaning That is to say the teaching of the Lord is able to correctly manifest the objectreferent from unlimited perspectives The syllables are entirely complete and there are no omissions For these reasons one can make this statement   Name Phrase and Syllable Sets  Further all of the factors in the three time periods have names that belong to the three time periods That is to say in the case of past factors past buddhas have already indicated them with past names Future buddhas will indicate them again with future names Present buddhas are now indicating them with present names Future and present should be understood in the same way  Further there is no factor that is without a name If there were then it would result in the fallacy that is not known Thus the Lord states as follows ame is able to iluminate all factorsl there is nothing that eludes name Therefore the single factor name operates freely in accord with all factors Some masters state Objectreferents are few and names are numerous because there are many names for one objectreferent Other masters state Names are few and objectreferents are numerous because names are included as a part of only one of the elements  while objectreferents encompass all eighteen elements And still others state Boṭh few or numerous Just as desire is referred to as love fire a snalce a creeper thirst a net poison a spring a river longreaching widespread a needle and thread and so on so also all things can be referred to by an unlimited number of names  ātra Masters Objections   Next the Sūtra master makes the following statement Isnt it the case that since these threehave speech as their intrinsic nature they use sound as their essence and are included among those having form as their intrinsic nature How can it be said that they are factors dissociated from thought included within the forces aggregate This criticism is not reasonable Why is this It is known on the basis of both scriptural authority and reasoned argument that exist separately The sūtra states The pover of speech the power of syllables If syllables and speech were identical then why would they have been mentioned separately It is stated further One should preserve the syllables and the phrases of the true doctrine Further it is said Rely on the meaning do not rely on the syllable Meter means the measure through which a verse is composed it has speech as its nature Further the sūtra has said Know a factor and know the objectreferent A factor refers to names and so on and the objectreferent is that which is specified Further the sūtra has said The syllables and the meaning are skillful Further it is said One should recite the true doctrine by using wellexpressed syllables and phrases If one were to recite the true doctrine by using poorly expressed syllables and phrases then the objectreferent would be difficult to understand Further it is said The athāgatas have acquired sets of names phrases and syllables that are extraordinary From such scriptural references as these it is proven that the sets of names phrases and syllables which are able to specify various objectreferents exist separately  and that like the sound of speech they are real and not provīsional reasoned arguments It is observed that at certain times one hears the   Name Phrase and Syllable Sets sound and does not grasp the phoneme at certain times one grasps the phoneme and does not hear the sound Therefore one knows that exists separately as a real entity Hearing the sound without grasping the phoneme occurs in those cases in which one hears the sound but does not apprehend the objectreferent It is observed that there are people who only vaguely hearing what another has said ask what did you say In all such cases hear the sound of the speech and do not apprehend the objectreferent because they have not yet comprehended the syllables that were issued forth How then can one maintain that the syllable is not different from sound Grasping the phoneme without hearing the sound occurs in those cases in which one apprehends the objectreferent without hearing the sound It is observed that there are people who apprehend what has been expressed by seeing the movements of the lips and so on without hearing what has been said In all such cases apprehend the objectreferent without hearing the sound because they have already comprehended the syllables that were issued forth Further it is commonly observed that incantations are muttered under ones breath Therefore one knows that the phonemes of these incantations are different from their sound Further it is commonly observed that even though the articulated sounds of the words used by two debaters may sound similar one loses and one wins The cause for this victory or loss must exist apart from the sound Further since the objectfields of the two types of special knowledge the teaching and expression are separate it is known that the phoneme is different from sound Therefore  sound is merely the articulated sound of words it is without any distinguishing characteristic The variations within that necessarlty depend upon ka ca ta ta pa and so on Phonemes which are issued forth only in dependence upon the articulated sound of speech combine in a sequence and produce a name speech is able to issue forth in name and name is able to manifest the objectreferent Therefore it is unequivocally established by reasoned argument that name and sound are different It should be known that in this case sound is that which is able to express and the syllable is that which is expressed the objectreferent is neither of these two In this way are established without confusion Next the ūtra master makes the following statement It is not the case ṭhat mere articulated sound is always interpreted as speech Only that articulated sound through which the objectreferent can be apprehended is interpreted as speech that specification established in common by speakers with regard to objectreferents If the objectreferent of a phrase is manifested through name this function of manifesting has already been explained through sound What then is the use of positing that name exists separately as a real entity Saṅghabhadras ResponseName and peech To what does the specifkation established refer Doesnt it refer to those conceptnames established in common with regard to objectreferents It is these That is to say certain phonemes that speakers have previously set down in common with regard to certain objectreferents are definitely able to specify those objectreferents through a process of successive dependence Since certain phonemes have been set down in common certain names are issued forth from those phonemes It is precisely ṭhese names that are the specifications established are about to issue forth speech they must first reflect upon a certain specification In this way they are able to understand the objectreferent manifested in their own speech or in the speech of others Therefore sound alone is not able to manifest the objectreferent Only when speech issues forth in phonemes and phonemes further issue forth in names are the names then able to specify the objectreferent that one desires to express Just as speech issues forth in phonemes and   Name Phrase and Syllable Sets phonemes further issue forth in names so in this way also one should consider the method of reasoning as to how a phrase is issued forth Continuing the ūtra master offers the following statement Further it is not yet known how this name is isued forth by speech i it manifested by speech or is it produced by speech If it were produced by speech then since speech has articulated sound as its intrinsic nature all articulated sound should be able to produce name If one claimed that there is a particular articulated sound that produces name then that would be sufficient to manifest the objectreferent How could it depend upon a discrete name If were manifested by speech then since speech has articulated sound as its intrinsic nature all articulated sounds should be able to manifest name If one claimed that there is a particular articulated sound that manifests name then that would be sufficient to manifest the objectreferent How could it depend upon a separate name If one maintained  that articulated sound is able to speciiy the objectreferent then this objection would apply equally That is to say if the nature of articulated sound were such that alone is able to manifest  then there would be no articulated sound that is incapable of manifesting If one claimed that there is some particular articulated sound that is able to manifest  then that particular would be precisely do not constitute a criticism Speakers first hold the intended name in thought and only then form intention I will issue forth such and such a word and express such and such an objectreferent to others In this way at a subsequent time speech is issued forth in accordance with ones intention and phonemes are issued forth in dependence upon speech Phonemes further issue forth in names only names manifest the objectreferent  is reasonable if established relying upon the perspective  ObjectionIVOnly Syllable Exists  of this principle of successive dependence such that speech issues forth in names and names manifest the objectreferent If name were not first held in thought even if one were to issue forth speech there would be no definite specification and would not enable others to understand the objectreferent The ūtra master further states Or should maintain only the discrete existence of syllables as a real entities Precisely the collocation of these exist would then be useless there is no time in which syllables operate simultaneously a collocation of syllables is not reasonably established and it is not the case that no single syllable can manifest an objectreferent It is like a tree that is established through the combination of fundamental and derived material elements  A shadow is not produced separately without depending upon Even though that name and phrase are issued forth in dependence upon a provisional entitythat is the collocation of syllablestheir nature is not provisional This is the preferred interpretation because it is established unequivocally by reasoned argument If this were so then all provisional factors could be established to exist as real entities possessed of intrinsic nature names consisting of one phoneme there is no provisionally existing factor that can be as   Name Phrase and Syllable Sets identical to a real entity Therefore name cannot be subsumed under the category of provisional factors Since a name can consist of a single phoneme how much more iṃpossible is it to acknowledge that names exist apart from phonemes A single phoneme of the type does not specify anything  just like a phoneme that is without an objectreferent A name arises separately taking this as its condition and only then is able to indicate the objectreferent However just as it is dificult to distinguish two patches of light on a wall so also is it difficult to apprehend the separateness are extremely close  If one were to maintain that it is precisely articulated sound that is able to manifest the objectreferent without any separate name and so on then what fault is incurred It would contradict the characteristics of those particular factors how could not be fallacious There is no articulated sound that can be grasped by mental perceptual consciousness alone this is not the case for phonemes and so on Therefore the intrinsic natures of are not the same One might object that mental perceptual consciousness becomes able once again at a later point to apprehend the objectreferent because it grasps a particular articulated sound and this particular articulated sound is nothing other than arṭiculated sound This also is unacceptable because it is not reasonably established that this consensus which is able to specify  is merely a particular articulated sound If this consensus established in common that is able to specify were merely a particular articulated sound should be like particular colors that are capable of being apprehended even though they are not established by common consensus It is not the case that the two particular colors blue and yellow are apprehended only after being established by common conensus Even though the distinction between the two colors is ntestablished initially by common consensus since the distinguishing characteristics of the particular colors blue and yellow are not different from form mental perceptual consciousness is able to apprehend each particular color through conceptual discrimination after they have been grasped by visual perceptual consciousness Further it would not be reasonable to construct yet another consensus on top of that consensus even though one hears an articulated sound because that depends upon yet another established consensus  one would not yet be able to distinguish c the disnctire characterisics of this artitulated sound from another articulated sound Further if the established consensus were nothing other than a particular articulated sound then one should be able to apprehend the distinction between sounds that have an objectreferent and those without an objectreferent even without initially establishing a common consensus That is to say one articulated sound would have that particular distinctive characteristie indicating that it has an object   When the consensus with regard to the distinctive characteristics is not yet established and one hears two articulated sounds as in the case of two colors then one should be able to grasp the characteristic distinguishing a particular articulated sound that has a consensus and one that does not even without apprehending the objectreferent Therefore  it is known that the sets of names phrases and syllables exist separately that they are produced in dependence upon articulated sound and that they are able to manifest the objectreferent  Moreover Sthavira states further on this point Mental action occurs first it arranges the phonemes and determines their distinctive characteristies in the state in which sound is about to be produced and thereby establishes names and so on It is unreasonable to assume that this exist separately through intrinsic nature apart from articulated sound In the same way on the basis of the previous reasoned arguments and scriptural auṭhority we should demonstrate that Sthavīras statements are untrue One cannot establish that the nature of name and so on is precisely articulated sound only on the basis of his vain prattle If one were able to establish that name and so on are precisely articulated sound only on the basis of his vain prattle then one would likewise be able to establish that all factors that are unequivocally established as existing separately through intrinsic nature are without that discrete iīntrinsic nature For example precisely that moisture that collects and congeals should be referred to as solidity  precisely that solidity that is dispersed and dissolved should be referred to as moisture precisely that solidity or moisture that deviates  ObjectionIISpeech and Initial Inquiry and Investigation  from coolness should be referred to as warmth  precisely those above three natures when stirred slightly should be referred to as motion the form element perceived through visual perceptual consciousness should be included within the sense sphere of odor  or that the four fundamental material elements should be possessed of an objectsupport and should be referred to as thought and thought concomitants Further since an objectreferent can be apprehended through the characteristics of odor and physical sensation and so on that act as present stimuli one should not establish the name phrase and syllable sets as having only articulated sound as their intrinsic nature Therefore our position that the three of name and so on exist apart from sound can be demonstrated to be reasonable If it could be validly demonstrated that is incorrect in any way then I would concede one is not able to overturn the valid principle vain prattle alone also maintains the following s the Lord has stated Through initial inquiry and investigation one utters speech One does not utter speech without initial inquiry and investigationS Since cound is issued forth frrm sound  the three name and so on do not exist separately as real entities As that sūtra states Equanimitygivīng results in pleasure same way The cause of speech It is like the causes of contact and so on that are referred to  or   Name Phrase and Syllable Sets contact Further that raises the  I will speak to another without commonly apprehending that these sets of names phrases and syllables are forces dissociated from thought Since it is not commonly apprehended  in dependence upon what is speech issued forth This objection is not reasonable because in the world even without any particular discriminative effort As is said in the world is burned by fuel or decomposed by mud Even though one does not understand  one is able to follow should also be in the same way Further it is like the case of the eye observing light one says I see not I apprehend form Or as in the case of the cause of a sound produced by clapping the hands one says I have made a sound not I have clapped Further those without knowledge say simply one defecates through a desire to purge oneself The actual occurrence is that one begins the process of defecation through a desire to purge able to issue forth an intention to exert pressure  this intention in turn issues forth pressure only this pressure is able to purge Thus it is not the case that one is able to cognize objectreferents without apprehending the cognition of names and so on it is simply that one is not able to be aware because the characteristics of the cognition of names and so on are very subtle Even though an unsettled thought is not capable of discriminating  this is the cognition of articulated sound this is the  Sūtra Masters Objection  cognition of names and so on and this is the cognition of the objectreferentstill actually it is not the case that do not Therefore when one investigates the distinctive characteristics of factors in accordance with the truth statements produced by untutored worldly thoughts are not sufficient to stand as proof Moreover in the world one is not able to become aware of those objectfields within the range of ones own cognition All such considerations that grasp the self and so on arise merely with regard to the five appropriative aggregates Thus since the world are not even able to apprehend these gross and superficial matters without hearing the teaching how much less can they undeistand the subtle name phrase and syllable as included among the factors dissociated from thought within the forces aggregate without relying upon instruction Therefore Sthaviras objection is definitely unreasonable  The ūtra master futther states The various moments of sound are not able to meet  and there is no gradual production of a single factor part by part How then can the production of name occur through speech issuing it forth How is the last moment of manifest able to produce unmanifest in dependence upon those past moments of manifest  If this is so then sound in the last moment produces name one should be able to apprehend the objectreferent only by hearing the last moment of sound If one maintains that speech is able to produce syllables syllables further produce name and only name manifests the objectreferent then the fault in this would be the same as that stated previously because the syllables in various moments cannot be assembled If speech manifest name instead of producing it then the fault would be the sane as in the case of production In   Name Phrase and Syllable Sets accordance with the speech is produce or to manifest syllables it is not reasonable to allow that speech name objection refute the accepted doctrine of his own school He claims that are without intrinsic nature in both the past and the future the prior and subsequent moments of a sound could not be produced at one time how would syllable name or phrase be established If through the successive and mutual dependence of each of the prior moments the last moment establishes the syllable name or phrase then one should be able to apprehend the objectreferent by hearing only the last moment Moreover there can be no mutual dependence because no past or future exists Since there is always the one moment  how can there be mutual dependence that is to say a subsequent moment like the fist moment would be unable to specicy through a mutual dependence of prior and subsequent moments is not reasonably established Since according to our accepted doctrine no fails to exist in all three time periods the last is able to produce the name and so on in dependence upon prior Even though name and so on are only produced in the last moment one cannot apprehend the objectreferent by hearing only that This is due to the fact that one has not heard all the sounds that were issued forth in accordance with an initial consensus established in common with regard to the name and so on However there are cases of apprehending even though one sound is heard this is due to custom One compares the with other Therefore this objection raised by the Sūtra master undermines his  not ours  Interpretation of Name in the Mahāvibhās  The Vibhāṣā states that the three name phrase and syllable have three varieties each The three varieties of name are name the name set and the set of many names Phrase and syllable should also be be so Names are found in many states that is to say that are produced from one phoneme from two phonemes or from many phonemes Names produced from one phoneme When one phoneme is uttered only name is possible When two phonemes are uttered precisely that is a name set ome claim that when three phonemes are uttered precisely that is a set of many names Others claim that only when four phonemes are uttered is there a set of many names are produced from two phonemes When tvo phonemes are uttered only name is possible When four phonemes are uttered precisely that is a name set Some claim that when six phonemes are uttered precisely that is a set of many names Others claim that only when eight phonemes are uttered is there a set of many names Among those names that are produced from many phonemes Others claim that only when twelve phonemes are uttered is there a set of many names Through this method other names name sets and sets of many names that arise from many phonemes are to be explained in accordance with principle Phrases also many states that is middlelength phrases beginning phrases ending phrases short phrases and long phrases If a is produced from eight phonemes it is referred to as a midalelength phrase because it is neither long nor short Thirtytwo phonemes produce four middlelength phre these four phrases form a verse The sentences of the sūtra and śāstra largely depend upon this unit The that is produced from the initial six phonemes is referred to as the beginning phrase that is produced from the final twentysīx phonemes is referred to as the   Name Phrase and Syllable Sets ending phrase A phrase that is produced having fewer than six phonemes is referred to as a short phrase and those that are produced having more than twentysix phonemes are referred to as long phrases Moreover there are three varieties of middlelength phrases When eight phonemes are uttered only phrase is possible When sixteen phonemes are uttered that preciīsely is referred to as a phrase set Some claim that when twentyfour phonemes are uttered precisely that is a set of many phrases Others claim that only when thirtytwo phonemes are uttered is there a set of many phrases Since syllables are precisely phonemes they exist in only one state When one phoneme is uttered only a syllable is possible When two phonemes are uttered precisely that is a syllable set Some claim that when three phonemes are uttered precisely that is a set of many syllables Others claim that only when four phonemes are uttered is there a set of many syllables The following statements should be made in dependence upon this principle When one phoneme is uttered there is name but there is no name set or set of many names There is no phrase phrase set or set of many phrases There is syllable but there is no syllable set or set of many syllables When two phonemes are uttered there is name and there is name set but there is no set of many names None of the three phrase and so on is found There is syllable and there is the syllable set but there is no set of many syllables When four phonemes are uttered there are the three name and so on None of the three phrase and so on is found There are the three syllable and so on When eight phonemes are uttered there are the three name and so on There is phrase but there is no phrase set or set of many phrases There are the three syllable and so on When sixteen phonemes are uttered there are the three name and so on There is phrase and phrase set but there is no set of many phrases There are the three syllable and so on When thirtytwo syllables are uttered the three name phrase and syllable each can appear in all three varieties Through this method other cases are to be explained in accordance with principle  We have already briefly discussed these three We should consider them further To which are this name  Location  and so on connected  Are they factors included among those constituting sentient beings  or included among those not constituting sentient beings  Are they produced as a matured effect  as the effect of accumulation  or as the effect of uniform outftow  re they virtuous  unvirtuous  or indeterminate All these points should be discussed The verse states desire and form  are factors included among those constituting sentient beings  are the effect of uniform outflow  and are indeterminate These three name and so on are connected only to the two realms of desire and form Concerning  within the realm of form there are those who claim that these are found only in the first level of trance Others claim that they extend throughout the three upper levels of trance the region to which these three are connected is determined either in accordance with speech or in accordance with the body  in accordance with speech  when one born in the realm of desire produces speech that is characteristic of the realm of desire that speech name and so on as well as the body are all connected to the realm of desire The objectreferent that is being expressed by that can be connected to of the three realms or not connected to any realm When that one produces speech that is characteristic of the first level of trance that speech and name and so on are connected to the first level of trance and the body is connected to the realm of desire The objectreferent is as was described previously In the same way the case of one born in the first level of trance  who produces speech that is characteristic of the two regions  should also   Name Phrase and Syllable Seṭts be considered in accordance with the same principle The case of one born in the second third or fourth levels of trance  who produces speech that is characteristic of these two regions  should also be considered in accordance with the same principle claim that these three factors  are connected in accordance with the body  for one born in the realm of desire or in any of the four levels of trance  name and so on as well as the body are each connected to the particular region Speech is either connected to that particular region or to another region The objectreferent is as was described previously Further the three name and so on are actors icluded among those constituting sentient beings because one does not have accompaniment of conditioned factors included among those not constituting sentient beings One only has accompaniment in the present one does not have accompaniment of them in the past or future The three name and so on are only the effect of uniform outflow  they are neither the effect of accumulation nor the effect of maturation  Nevertheless when it is said that name and so on are produced from action it means that they are the sovereign effects produced by action when those whose roots of virtuous factors have been eradicated express a virtuous factor even though they are ompanied by the name and so on of that virtuous factor they are not accompanied by that virtuous factor itself Likewise one who has become free from passion is not accompanied by unvirtuous factors Those beyond training are not accompanied by defilement  one is accompanied by the name and so on that is able to specify  and not by the factor that is specified  Now I will briefly discuss that have not yet been explained for the remaining factors dissociated from thought mentioned above The verse states Homogeneous character is also thus īit īs further the formless realm and is a matured effect Possession and the characteristics have these three varieties Nonpossession and equipoise are effects of uniform outflow The term is also thus indicates that homogeneous character like the name set and so on extends through the realm of desire and the realm of form is a factor included among those constituting sentient beings is the effect of uniform outflow and has an unobscured indeterminate nature The phrase it is further the formless realm indicates that it is not only to the realms of desire and form The expression it is further a matured effect indicates that it is not only an effect of uniform outHow That is to say the realm to which it is connected homogeneous charac   Discrimination From Various Perspectives ter has three varieties and two types Which is a matured effect It is that homogeneous character the rebirth state hell and so on and that the type of birth birth from an egg and so on Which is the effect of uniform outflow It is the homogeneous character that belongs to those in a certain realm a region a place a family or caste or a śramaṇa or a brāhmaṇa or to one in training  or to one beyond training  and so on Other masters state Among homogeneous character that homogeneous character which is projected by action in a previous is a matured effect that homogeneous character which arises from application in the present life is the effect of uniform outflow Possession and the characteristics each have three varieties That is to say they can be momentary the effect of uniform outflow or the effect of maturation Nonpossession and the two states of equipoise are only the effect of uniform outftow The merit of Bodhisattvas with The first intention far exceeds That which would make all beings on earth Become universal monarchs There are no Tathagatas other than Subduers things as they are There is no functional thing without a cause Nor anything permenent which has a cause If the unproduced is permanent Because impermanent are seen to be products Seeing that the produced exists Would make the permanent nonexistent That space and so forth are permanent Is a conception of common beings For the wise they are not objects perceived Even by conventional  Therefore it follows that Causes must be effects Anything that undergoes change Should not be called permanent Whatever happens by itself Cannot have a cause Never are the two cause and effect Seen to have incongruent characteristics That of which some sides are causes While other sides are not is thereby Multifarious The cause which is spherical Is not present in the effect One particles position is not Asserted as also that of another Thus it is not asserted that Cause and effect are the same size Whatever has eastern side Also has an eastern part Those whose particles have sides admit That they are not particles The front takes up the back relinquishesWhatever does not have Both of these Is not something which moves The effect destroys the cause Therefore the cause is not permanent Alternatively where the cause Exists the effect does not A permanent thing that is obstructive Is not seen anywhere Therefore Buddhas never say That particles are permanent If liberation which is other than What binds is bound and the means existed It should not be called liberation Since nothing is produced from it In nirvana there are no aggregates And there cannot be a person What nirvana is there for one Who is not seen in nirvana Also to exist without consciousness Is clearly the same as not existing If at liberation a self existed There could be a seed of consciousness When the inner self is not Female male or neuter It is only out of ignorance That you think your own self male When all the elements are not Male female or neuter How is that which depends on them Male female or neuter Your self is not my self and thus there is No such self since it is not ascertained Does the conception not arise In relation to impermanent things It is illogical for yours to be Separate from the body and permanent If your self is permanent Because of remembering other lives How can your body be impermanent When you see a scar previously formed If the self when possessing that Which has mind is a knower By that that which has mind would be Mindless and the person permanent A life force which has pleasure and so forth Appears as various as pleasure and so forth Thus like pleasure it is not Suitable as something permanent If consciousness is permanent An agent is superfluous If fire is permanent Fuel is unnecessary Because of being like molten iron The person undergoes change It is unacceptable to say that It is obscured by itself What is more illogical Than that the attributes should always Know how to construct homes and so forth But not know how to experience them Why do you not prefer selflessness Some see it as ubiquitous and for some The person is the mere body Some see it as a mere particle The wise see it as nonexistent How can what is permanent be harmed Or the unharmed be liberated Liberation is irrelevant For one whose self is permanent If it exists at liberation It should not be nonexistent before If the impermanent discontinues How could there be grass at present Even if the self exists Form is seen to arise from other  To continue by virtue of others And to disintegrate through others Just as the sprout which is a product Is produced from a product the seed Similarly all that is impermanent Comes from the impermanent Since functional things arise There is no discontinuation And because they cease There is no permanence Since both would be future The future would not exist If a disintegrated thing exists as A future entity in the future How can what is future in nature Become that which is past Because of being future in nature A future functional thing Is thus present And cannot be future If the future past and present exist What does not exist If it has passed beyond the past Why is it the past If it has not passed beyond the past Why is it the past If the future is produced Why is it not present If it is unproduced Is the future permanent or what If the future is impermanent because Though not produced it disintegrates Since the past does not disintegrate Why not consider it permanent If the past and present Are not impermanent The third which is different From these is also not If a thing which will be produced Later exists beforehand The contention of Niyativadins Is not erroneous To say something which will be made to occur Already exists is unreasonable If that which exists is produced What has been produced will arise again If future things are seen Why is the nonexistent not seen For one for whom the future exists There can be no distant  If virtue exists though nothing is done Resolute restraint is meaningless If even a little is done The effect cannot exist That which has a beginning and end is called impermanent in the world Liberation will occur without exertion The transformation of things also Is not perceived even by the mind Those who lack wisdom nevertheless Think that the present exists How can there be things with no duration If they had duration first They would not grow old in the end Just as a single consciousness Cannot apprehend two objects Similarly two consciousnesses Cannot apprehend one object If time has duration Duration is not time If it has not without duration There will also be no end If impermanence and things are separate Things are not impermanent If they are one since things are precisely that which is Impermanent how can they have duration If impermanence is not weaker And is present in all things None of them will have duration Or nor all are impermanent If there is always impermanence There cannot always be duration or else that which was permanent later becomes impermanent If things have duration And impermanence together Either it is wrong that things are impermanent or duration is a fallacy Things seen do not reappear Nor does awareness arise again Thus memory is in fact deceived With regard to a deceptive object Having understood that phenomena are like optical illusions Learn how the three times are perceived These strange people all agree that by Giving up everything one attains nirvana For what reason do they dislike That which puts an end to all Whoever doubts what the Buddha said About that which is hidden Should rely on emptiness And gain conviction in him alone The unwise take no delight in letting Their mind follow a guide Who has done that which is Most difficultattained nirvana Because of unfamiliarity They fear that which extricates them Through ethics one gains a high rebirth The supreme state is reached by means of the view That which is the object of All Buddhas is called selflessness The unreceptive are terrified Just by its very name What socalled strong man is seen Who does not frighten the weak This principle is not taught By Tathagatas for the sake of debate Yet it burns up others contentions As fire does its fuel Whoever knows this teaching Will not relish others Seeing the many Forders Who are seeds of futility Who would not feel pity For people who long for a teaching Brahmin practices are said Mainly to be an outward show Brahmins are revered Because they adopt the orthodox Nirgranthas are pitied Because they adopt the deluded To ordinary people their own position Like their birthplace is attractive The intelligent who seek what is good Adopt what is worthwhile even from others Does the sun not belong to all On earth who have sight Who that knows Reality would claim that the pot Is directly perceptible also By means of this very analysis Those with superior intelligence Should refute individuality All that is fragrant sweet and soft There is no direct perception Of just the form alone Because it has a close and distant As well as a central part This also applies when one examines Whether particles have parts or not Thus to prove a thesis by that Which must be proved is not feasible Everything too is a component As well as being a composite Thus even a spoken syllable Does not have existence here If a shape is distinct from color How is shape apprehended If not distinct why would the body Not also apprehend color Only the form is visible But the forms causes are not seen Earth is seen as firm and stable And is apprehended by the body Since it was produced as something visible It is of no use at all to the pot As with the production of visibility It lacks even the entity of existence The eyes see while the others do not Because the conditions are incomplete There is no awareness before looking While afterwards awareness is of no use If the eye travels that which is Distant would take long to see Why are extremely close And very distant forms not clear If the eye travels when the form is seen Its movement is of no benefit If the eye perceives without traveling It would see all these phenomena For that which does not travel there is Neither distance not obscuration If the nature of all things First appears in themselves Why would the eye not Be perceived by the eye itself The eye does not have consciousness And consciousness lacks that which looks If form has neither of these How can they see form If sound makes a noise as it travels Why should it not be a speaker Yet if it travels noiselessly how could Awareness arise in relation to it If sound is apprehended through contact What apprehends the beginning of sound If sound does not come alone How can it be apprehended in isolation While sound is not heard it is not sound Without the sense organs what will mind Do after it has gone If it were so why would that which lives Not always be without mind An object already seen Is perceived by mind like a mirage In dependence upon the eye and form Mind arises like an illusion When there is nothing on earth That does not amaze the wise Why think cognition by the senses And suchlike are amazing The pot that has form is not separate The pot does not have form Nor does the form have a pot Since the two are seen to have dissimilar Characteristics if the pot is separate From existence why would existence Not also be separate from the pot If one is not accepted as the pot The pot is not one If the form is the size of the substance Why is the form not large If the opponent were not different Scriptural sources could be cited Because the pot is not separate From its characteristics it is not one Form is a component of the pot And thus for a start is not the pot If the definition of form Applies without incongruity To all forms for what reason Is one a pot and not all others If you assert that form is distinct from Taste and so forth but not from the pot How can that which does not exist Without these not be distinct from form The pot has no causes And is itself not an effect Thus there is no pot at all Apart from form and so forth If the pot exists by virtue of its causes And those causes by virtue of others How can that which does not exist By virtue of itself produce something disparate Though they meet and come together Form cannot be smell Therefore like the pot The composite cannot be one Just as the pot does not exist Apart from form and so forth Likewise form does not exist Apart from air and so forth That which is hot is fire but how Can that burn which is not hot Thus socalled fuel does not exist And without it fire too does not Even if it is hot only when Overpowered why is it not fire Yet if not hot to say fire contains Something else is not plausible If the particle has no fuel Fire without fuel exists Because there is no singleness There is no plurality either When the continuum is misapprehended Things are said to be permanent Things do not assemble Unless there is an effect Aggregation for an effect Is not included for the Exalted When selflessness is seen in objects The seed of existence is destroyed How can that which exists be produced If what exists from the outset is produced Since the effect destroys the cause That which does not exist will not be produced There is no production at that time Nor is there production at another If not produced at that time nor another When will there ever be production Just as there is no production Of that as the thing it is Neither is it produced As something else How can each begin Without the other two Thus there is no coming into existence Either from self or from other It cannot be said to exist Before after or simultaneously Therefore production does not occur Simultaneously with the pot That which was previously produced Was not old when first produced Also that which afterwards has been Constantly produced is not old A present thing does not Come into existence from itself Not come into existence from the future And also not from the past There is no coming of the produced Likewise no going of that which has ceased Since it is thus why should existence Not be like a magicians illusions If for production and all the others All of these occurred again Disintegration would seem like production And duration like disintegration Alternatively existence of all four is unclear A thing is not produced from a thing Nor is a thing produced from a nonthing A nonthing is not produced from a nonthing Nor is a nonthing produced from a thing A thing does not become a thing Nor does a nonthing become a thing A nonthing does not become a nonthing Nor does a thing become a nonthing A thing in the process of production Since halfproduced is not being produced Alternatively it follows that everything Is in the process of being produced For anyone to whom the two are Impossible without an intermediate There is nothing in the process of production For it too would have an intermediate Since the process of production is the arising of the produced through cessation That which is presently being produced Appears to be a different entity When a thing is produced there cannot be Anything in the process of production If the produced is in the process of production why is it being produced A thing in the process of production is said To be the entirely unproduced arising Yet also since other than produced The unproduced is being produced That which is presently being produced Though not yet existent is later said to exist The unproduced is thus being producedBut the nonexistent does not arise When there is nothing in the process of production What is being referred to as such Since without a cause There is no effect Both starting and stopping Are not feasible When the author and subject also exist It is incorrect to call them empty Also with regard to these three whatever Arises in dependence does not exist If through flaws concerning emptiness were established as not empty Why would emptiness not be established Through flaws concerning lack of emptiness In refuting the thesis of others And in proving your own thesis If on the one hand you like to disprove Why do you not like to prove Then all three such as oneness Also are not theses Where a pot is directly perceptible The argument of emptiness is meaningless Here reasons appearing in textual systems Are not  elsewhere they are When there is nothing that is not empty How can emptiness be so When the one does not exist Why should the antidote exist If there were a thesis absence of the thesis Would in entity be a thesis But where there is no thesis What can be the counterthesis How can fire be hot When things do not exist it was said That even hot fire does not exist Even for Buddhas it does not exist If that is reasonable to you also Why raise further arguments Regarding the nonfunctional of all things Differentiation are inappropriate That which is seen in all substantial entities Is not differentiable Though the world says it is easy To find reasons with which to refute Why can the errors regarding The others thesis not be stated If a thing is not nonexistent Because the term existent is ascribed Neither is it existent because the term existent is applied Since a thing does not exist A nonthing cannot exist If things are not empty because They are empty by virtue of reasons The thesis would not be distinct from the reasons And thus the reasons would not exist If things are not empty because There are analogies for emptiness Can one say Just like the crow So too the self is black If things exist inherently What good is it to perceive emptiness To say one exists and the other does not Is neither reality nor the conventional Therefore it cannot be said That this exists but that does not How many aggregates  elements and spheres are there There are five aggregates the aggregate of matter  the aggregate of perception  the aggregate of formations and the aggregate of consciousness  There are eighteen elements the form element  and  the visual  In the category rupa sabda etc rupa means visible form and not matter as in the category of the five aggregates In this context translating the term nlpa by matter would lead to contusion since such things as sound  odor  etc  are also constituted of subtle matter  A bh idha rmasa m u ccaya consciousness element   the sound element and the auditory consciousness element  the odor element and the olfactory consciousness element  the tongue element  the gustatory consciousness element   the body element  the tangibility element and the tactile consciousness element  the mental object element and the mental consciousness element

sphere of tangibility  the sphere of the mental organ and the sphere of the mental object  Why are there only five aggregates Because of the five methods by means of which of self atman makes its appearance self as physical apprehension self as experience self as expression self as the agent of all right and all wrong and self as the basis of all that Why are there only eighteen elements Because due to two things the body idebd and appropriation  there is support of the past and present sixfold experience atitavartamanasadakaropabbogadharanata Why are there only twelve spheres Because due to two things the body and appropriation there is an entrance to the future sixfold experience  Why are the aggregates called clinging  The aggregates are so called because they are associated with clinging What is clinging The desire and craving of the aggregates Why are desire and craving called clinging Desire and craving are so called because of the continuation and nonabandonment of future and present aggregates because of desire of the future and attachment to the present Why are the elements and spheres considered as associated with clinging The explanation here is the same as in the case of the aggregates What is the characteristic of matter Change is the characteristic of matter What is change in contact It is the alteration caused by contact by a hand a foot a stone a weapon a stick cold heat hunger thirst a mosquito a gadfly a snake a scorpion etc It is the imagination of form through determined or undetermined mental conception as such and such or some such other

a reaction having the body as its basis and the tangible as its object What is mental consciousness It is a reaction having the Hence five kinds of matter the aggregates of feeling perception and formations and these eight unconditioned dharmas these sixteen are called the element of mental objects  The ten elements of matter themselves constitute the ten spheres of matter The seven elements of consciousness themselves constitute the sphere of the mental organ mana ayatana The element of mental objects is the sphere of mental objects  It is mentioned that there is the eye and the eye element  Is there the eye when there is the eye element or is there the eye element when there is the eye A case may exist where there is the eye but not the eye element as with the final eye of an arhat A case may exist where there is the eye element but not the eye as in an egg or an embryo or arbuda orpesl or like the eye yet to be obtained or the eye obtained and lost in the maternal womb And also like the visual potential of an ordinary man born in the formless realm In other cases there may be both the eye and the eye element A case may exist where there is neither eye nor eye element as in the case of him who has attained Nirvana without a remainder or in the case of an arya born in the formless realm In the same way as the eye and the eye element the ear nose tongue body and their elements should also be understood A case may exist where there is the mental organ but not the element of the mental organ such as in the case of the last thoughtmoment of an arhat A case may exist where there is neither the mental organ nor the element of the mental organ as in the case of him who has attained Nirvana without a remainder  Does a person born in a certain realm see with the eye of that realm the forms of that realm itself With the eye of that realm one sees the forms of that realm itself and also the forms of other realms A person born in the realm of desire sees with the eye of that realm the forms of the realm of desire However with the eye of the realm of form which is higher one sees also the forms pertaining to lower realms Just as one sees forms with the eye so one hears sounds with the ear Just as a person born in the realm of desire smells odors tastes tastes experiences contacts pertaining to that realm with the nose tongue and body of that realm itself so a person born in the realm of form experiences contacts with the body of that realm In that realm of form there is naturally no odor nor taste because there is no desire for natural nutriment Hence in that realm there is no olfactory or gustatory consciousness A person born in the realm of desire can with the mental organ ol that realm also know undefiled things and those pertaining to each of the three realms  Just as it is for a person born in the realm of desire so it is for a person born in the realm of form A person born in the realm of the formless arupyd knows with the mental organ of that realm undefiled things and those of its own realm of the formless With an undefiled mental organ one can know pure things and those of each of the three realms  Why are the aggregates arranged in that order according to the seats of consciousness There are four seats of consciousness and four forms of consciousness in relation to matter there is feeling when one feels one perceives when one perceives one thinks  when one thinks consciousness is present in all those states according to certain particular activities of the world In this world one first sees having seen one speaks after which one takes a bath puts on perfumes and garlands then one takes different kinds of delicious nutriment then one makes use of various couches and seats maidservants and menservants Just as it is for the order of arrangement of the elements so it is for the order of arrangement of the spheres  What is the meaning of aggregate  Whatever matter is past future or present internal or external coarse or subtle inferior or superior distant or close  Tib ig rten gyi tha snad dan mthun pa iphyir ro  A bh idharmasamuccaya the understanding of all that is called the aggregate of form in the sense of mass as a mass of richness  And so on up to the aggregate of consciousness It is also called skandha trunk in consideration of the immensity of suffering  like for example a large tree trunk  It is said in a Sutra the appearance of the great mass of suffering It is also called skandha shoulder in consideration of the bearing of the burden of the defilements as one bears a burden on ones shoulder skandbena bbaram udvabati What is the meaning of element  What is the meaning of sphere  It signifies the door in which consciousness appears  As the Buddha said matter is like a mass of foam feeling like a bubble perception like a mirage the formations like a banana tree and consciousness like an illusion What is the meaning of the words from matter is like a mass of foam up to consciousness is like an illusion They mean the absence of a self impurity lack of satisfaction absence of solidity and substantiality Substance  knowables  matter  outflow  that

conditionally originated  How many are conditionally originated  with the aim of abandoning attachment to a self without a cause or having irregular causes   How should that which is conditionally originated be understood through its characteristics as arising through the effect of indifferent conditions  through the effect of impermanent conditions and through the effect of efficacious conditions  There are twelve factors  Which are the projective factors Ignorance the formations and consciousness Nameandform the six spheres contact and feeling Thirst clinging and becoming Birth and aginganddeath  What is the function of the six spheres The rest forms the group ol the defilement of birth   according to its real meaning   The real meaning of conditioned origination is the fact

functioning  It does not arise from itself  or from anything else  or from both  it does not arise from its own action  or from the action of others  or without cause  Hence it is also profound I Laksanasamnccaya   through its divisions  What is a condition   How many are conditions  With what aim is a condition investigated  A condition should be understood as its cause  its object  and its predominance   They are all a condition  with the aim of abandoning attachment to things which constitute the causes  the view of self  In brief they are of twenty kinds  Reason of arising  such as consciousness in accord with consciousness  Reason of duration  such as nutriment for beings that are born and those seeking birth bhutanam sattvanam sambbavaisinah ca  B Reason of support  such as the earth for beings  Reason of manifestation  such as a lamp for visible forms  Reason of transformation  such as fire for wood  Reason of transmutation  such as professional skill etc for things

something because of something else such as a desire for nutriment because of hunger  Reason of projection which is a distant condition  such as ignorance of aging and death   Linked reason which is an other condition such as a field water fertilizer etc for making cereals grow  Introductory reason which is a condition in a suitable manner  such as good service rendered to a king to the latters satisfaction  Reason of diverse regularity which is a variant of the conditions such as the five conditions of birth for the five destinies of birth  They are those things which attain the object in coexistence and not through some deficiency  such as the mind and mental activities  It is in the future the ever increasing continuity of favorable unfavorable and neutral actions accomplished in the past It is the consolidation of the increase of a certain series by means of a certain development of the defilements in such a way that one is kept away from the series leading to Nirvana The immediate condition should be understood as the constant immediate and as that which immediately gives rise to the mind and joint and nonjoint mental activities   What is the object  The condition of

the basis giving rise to feeling   Part of the aggregate of matter five material elements five material spheres and also part of the other four   What is a faculty   How many are faculties  With what aim are the faculties investigated  A faculty should be understood as predominant over the seizing of an object  predominant  Abhidbarmasamiiccaya over the continuity of generation  predominant over

storeconsciousness endowed with mutual associations   What is nutriment   How many are nutriment  With what aim is nutriment investigated  Nutriment should be understood as transformative by reason of transformation  as pertaining to sense objects by reason of the connection with objects  as pertaining to intention by reason of the connection with intention  and also as clinging by reason of the

 How many are inferior  With what aim is the inferior investigated  All except for part of the element and of the sphere of mental objects   What is division according to analytical characteristics It is the aggregates elements and spheres themselves It is the nonexistence of a self in those same aggregates elements and spheres It is division according to the owncharacteristics of each of the aggregates elements and spheres It is division of those same aggregates elements and spheres inasmuch as they exist as substance  as designation  as convention  in the absolute sense  as having form  as being formless  as visible and as invisible  etc as was demonstrated above It is the momentary continuation of the aggregates elements and spheres at each moment  He understands attachment to a self  He understands the idea of cluster  He understands the idea of undergoing idea of losing the results of an action that one has done  He understands the idea of stability  It is all the stages of concentration  It is what concerns an ordinary man  It is what concerns disciples in training  and also what concerns  Abhiclharmasamuccaya arhats except for their finalmoment aggregates elements and spheres It is the aggregates elements and spheres of the final moment of the arhats It is the aggregates elements and spheres manifested by the Buddhas and bodhisattvasthose great beings who have attained the highest perfection  GROUPING What is grouping What is grouping according to characteristics What is grouping according to elements What is grouping according to types It is each grouping of aggregates elements and spheres as such although they have different characteristics What is grouping according to states It is each grouping of aggregates elements and spheres in a pleasant situation according to their own characteristics also in an unpleasant or a neither pleasant nor unpleasant situation depending on their states What is grouping according to associations The aggregate of matter is grouped with the other aggregates by reason of their mutual association So also are the other aggregates elements and spheres What is grouping according to space  It is the grouping of the aggregates elements and spheres associated with the east according to their own characteristics So also  Abhidharmasamuccaya should it be understood with regard to the aggregates elements and spheres in the other directions What is grouping according to time  It is the grouping of the aggregates elements and spheres in the past according to their own characteristics So also should it be understood with regard to the aggregates elements and spheres in the future and in the present What is partial grouping Of all the things included in the aggregates elements and spheres only a certain grouping should be understood as partial grouping  What is complete grouping All the things included in the aggregates elements and spheres taken in totality should be understood as complete grouping What is mutual grouping How many elements and spheres are included in the aggregate of matter Part of ten  How many elements and spheres are included in the aggregate of feeling As the aggregate of feeling so also are the aggregates of perception and of formations How many elements and spheres are included in the aggregate of consciousness Seven elements and one sphere How many aggregates and

aggregate of matter and one sphere How many aggregates and spheres are included in the visual consciousness element Part of the aggregate of consciousness and of the mental sphere As the visual consciousness element so also are the elements of the auditory olfactory gustatory and tactile consciousnesses How many aggregates and elements are included in the sphere of the eye I Laksanasamuccaya  element As the sphere of the eye so also are the spheres of the ear nose tongue body form sound odor taste and the tangible How many aggregates and elements are included in the mental sphere One aggregate and seven elements How many aggregates and elements are included in the sphere of mental objects Three aggregates and part of one aggregate and of one element In this way other things are explained in relation to the aggregates elements and spheres Such categories as existing as substance as designation in the conventional sense in the ultimate sense the know ables the knowable through special knowledge the knowables through higher knowledge the material the immaterial the visible and the invisible etc which were explained earlier should be understood according to the mutual grouping of the aggregates elements and spheres Ill What is absolute grouping The development of good roots is in accord with the synthetic view of the mind concerning objects J What is unseparated conjunction It is the nonseparation of molecules rflpamsika particles of matter from the atoms paramanu of which they are composed throughout space  What is mixed conjunction What is simultaneous conjunction It is the simultaneous continuity the simultaneous arising enduring and cessation of the aggregates elements and spheres in a body It is the conjunction of actions with each other such as the cooperation of two monks in the activity of each of them What is coexistent conjunction It is the existence of the mind and mental activities together on the same object And that coexistent conjunction has several aspects such as for example conjunction through an alien nature and not through ownnature conjunction of unopposed things and not opposed things conjunction of things from the same time and not from different times domains of similar elements and not of dissimilar elements It is of feeling  perception  volition  contact  attention and consciousness  Again defiled universal conjunction is of the four defilements in the mental organ   Conjunction of situation is that of things linked to pleasant feeling  It is the same for an unpleasant feeling or a feeling that is neither pleasant nor unpleasant  Uninterrupted conjunction is encountered in a situation where the mind is active   Interrupted conjunction is encountered in a person who has entered the attainment where the mind is inactive   Extroverted conjunction  in the majority of cases is that of the mind and mental activities associated with the sense pleasures   Habitual conjunction is that of the mind and mental activities of ordinary people   These are present in every thought Hence the designation of universal association Cf  Nonhabitual conjunction is that of the transcendental mind and mental activities  and also of those acquired subsequent to transcendental immediately after the first moment He knows the conjunction and disjunction of things that defile and that purify  such as feelings  in the mind only icittamatre And he who knows that abandons attachment to the idea of self atman feels  perceives  wishes  remembers  defiles and purifies himself  What is accompaniment by seeds He who is born in the realm of desire is accompanied by the accompaniment of the seeds of the major and minor defilements pertaining to desire kamapratisamyuktaih klesopaklesaih and ol the defilements pertaining to the realms of form and of the formless ruparupyapratisamynktais ca klesopaklesaih as well as favorable things that incur rebirth  He who is born in the realm of form can be considered as accompanied as well as unaccompanied by the accompaniment of the seeds of the major and minor defilements pertaining to the realm of desire but is accompanied by the accompaniment of the seeds of the major and minor defilements pertaining to the realms of form and of the formless as well as favorable things that incur rebirth He who is born in the formless world can be considered as accompanied and also unaccompanied by the accompaniment ol the seeds ol the major and minor defilements pertaining to the realms of desire and of form but is accompanied by the accompaniment of the seeds of the major and minor defilements  In Pi adhan s edition part of the sentence heie is missing This is doubtless due to a punting eiror since Gokhale s edition contains this part  Abhidbarmasamuccaya of the formless realm as well as favorable things that incur rebirth As for him wh o possesses the counteractives pertaining to the three realms  if the counteractive occurs on encountering some kind  it is not accompanied by the accompaniment of the seeds of that kind  If the counteractive does not occur on encountering some kind  it is accompanied by the accompaniment of the seeds of that kind   What is accompaniment by mastery It is the case oil a person accompanied by the accompaniment of the mastery of favorable things acquired through effort prayogikanam kitsalanam dbarmanam and of the mastery of absorptive meditation deliverance concentration attainment etc whether worldly or transcendental Uankikanam lokottaranam va dbyanauimoksasamadbisamapattyadinam as well as certain other neutral things   a person accompanied by the accompaniment of the practice of some thing whether favorable  unfavorable or neutral  who confronts the aggregates elements and spheres  He whose good roots are completely severed can be considered as accompanied and unaccompanied by the accompaniment of the seeds of favorable things  He reaches understanding of the increase and decrease of things  He who thus understands the increase and decrease of things has no fixed idea concerning anything worldly success or defeat  but he aims only at abandoning attachment and repugnance  Wha t is determining the Truths  What is the Truth of suffering  It should be understood with reference to the life of beings and to the basis of life   What is the life of beings It is the life of beings in the hells  among animals and hungry ghosts preta phantoms etc among human beings manusyd in the Eastern region  in the Western region  in the continent of India  and in the Northern region  among the gods in the

remain evolved Just as it is in the Eastern direction so it is in all the ten directions Be it the world of beings or be it the receptacleworlcl which are produced by the power  of actions and defilements  and which are dominated by actions and defilements karmaklesadbipateyayall that is called the Truth of suffering  The realm of the completely pure world is not included in the Truth of suffering and is not  Cf sahassi culanika lokadhatu dvisahassi majjhimaka lokadhatu tisahassi mahasahassi lokadhatu A I p  Nd  b  According to the Chinese version or free from hatred full of delusion or free from delusion contracted or extended depressed or exalted aroused or not aroused calm or agitated concentrated or not and so forth such is continuity of the mind What is the characteristic of good and bad fortune Devolution and evolution are of three kinds caused by fire water and wind The upper limits of the three devolutions are the second third and fourth meditative absorptions  As for the fourth meditative absorption only the disappearance and appearance of the external abodes are considered as their devolution and evolution because those abodes only appear and disappear with those gods  At the end of three kinds of minor periods of the universe comes destruction by those weapons etc when the world remains devolved Hence for twenty minor periods the universe devolves for twenty minor periods it remains devolved for twenty minor periods it evolves and for twenty minor periods it remains evolved Those eighty periods of the universe taken together constitute a great period of the universe  The lifespan of the gods in the realms of form and of the formless is calculated by these periods of the universe  Moreover it is said that beings die and leave those abodes on the expiration of their lifespan  or their merit  or their action  It is death at the normal time  What is the expiration of merit It is premature death  death due to a lack of merit because beings are attached to a delicious attainment  What is the expiration of action  It is death on the expiration of actions whose results should be experienced immediately in the next life  or actions whose results should be experienced later in successive lives  or through the expiration of both What is the characteristic of suffering  The three forms of suffering the eight kinds or six kinds of suffering as they were defined above  are generally considered as suffering Why is it said in a Sutra All that is impermanent is suffering Because the characteristic of suffering is evident by reason of Impermanence in two cases suffering as suffering is evident by reason of Impermanence in the case of birth suffering arising from transformation is evident by reason of Impermanence in the case of destruction  suffering as a conditioned state is evident by reason of Impermanence in both cases All that is felt is felt in suffering And again the eight kinds of suffering beginning with birth appear in conditioned things that are subject to appearance and disappearance It is with that meaning that the Blessed One said All that is impermanent is suffering Furthermore suffering such as birth appears in conditioned things that are subject to Impermanence Hence suffering as Impermanence That is how the meaning should be understood here What is the characteristic of emptiness sunyata It is the nonexistence of a certain thing there To observe in this way is emptiness Again it is the existence of another thing there In this way there is real knowledge  This is called emptiness perceived by penetration  Real knowledge means informed meaning It is the nonexistence in the aggregates elements and spheres of a self or anything pertaining to a self of a permanent enduring eternal and immovable nature This is their emptiness It is the fact that there is nonself in them the emptiness of nonexistence  emptiness of suchandsuch an existence and natural emptiness  What is the characteristic of nonself  Derived upadaya means that it has its foundation in the same place  With regard to derived matter also if a certain derived matter is found in a mass it should be understood to exist there  And furthermore there is suffering which is immense and unrestricted  semirestricted  lighter and restricted  lightest and restricted   there is also a form of nonsuffering which has the appearance of suffering and which is close to great restriction  cittd The death of a person whose mind is favorable should be understood as that which occurs when mental activity is clear  because of the power of good roots  or because of anothers influence  The death of a person whose mind is unfavorable should be understood as that which also occurs when mental activity is clear because of the power of bad roots or because of anothers influence The death of a person whose mind is neutral should be understood as that which occurs when mental activity is clear or clouded when it is incapable of mental construction iabbisamskarasamartbd by reason of the lack of both  In a person who has done right  the lower part of the body first becomes cold However in a person who has done wrong  the upper part of the body becomes cold At that moment the intermediate existence develops before him who has done wrong for example in the guise of a black bull  or an extremely dark night  before a person who has done right in the guise of wT hite fabric or a moonlit night  There is an intermediate existence for a person who is to be reborn in the realm of desire or in the realm of form  and for a person who is leaving the formless realm  Wherever he is born he has that physical form  and his movements are unopposed  Like a being endowed with supernormal powers  moving rapidly  he comes up against the place of his rebirth  Just like the scales of a balance rising and falling he dies and is bound by conception in the place of his rebirth A being that is in the intermediate existence arouses craving for the place of his rebirth and other defilements also constitute his condition  After that begins the development of the faculties  as explained in conditioned origination in the four modes of birth  eggborn  placentaborn  exudationborn  apparitionborn  It consists of the defilements and actions predominated by the defilements   What is their enumeration  If a thing arises with the characteristic of perturbance   and the appearance of which troubles the body and mind that is the characteristic of the defilements What is their emergence  If the latent tendency of a defilement is not destroyed if an object minor defilements upaklesaV such as anger are not in conjunction with each other Lack of selfrespect and lack of modesty are in conjunction everywhere with unfavorable things Inertia  restlessness  lack of trust  idleness and indolence are in conjunction everywhere with what is defiled  I am superior to my inferior or I am equal to my equal What is higher pride I am superior to my superior What is the pride of I am It is an exaltation of mind which arises from the false belief in a self and things pertaining to a self in the five aggregates of attachment It is an exaltation of mind in him who thinks he has attained particular high spiritual states when he has not attained them It is an exaltation of mind in him who thinks he is only slightly inferior to a person who is very superior to him It is an exaltation of mind in him who thinks that he is virtuous when he is not Not understanding them he seizes the idea of self and what pertains to the self performs unfavorable actions and does not perform favorable actions Thus engendering future suffering he is fettered by suffering It is ignorance with respect to the three realms He who is fettered by ignorance does not understand suffering and its origin Not understanding them he performs unfavorable actions and does not perform favorable actions Thus engendering future suffering he is fettered by suffering There are three views view of individuality  view of seizing extremes and false view  He who is fettered by views seeks and clings to an imaginary false deliverance Clinging to a false deliverance he performs unfavorable actions and does not perform favorable actions Thus engendering future suffering he is fettered by suffering It is adherence to views and adherence to observances and rituals  He who is fettered by adherence imagines and clings to false means of deliverance Clinging to false means of deliverance  A bh idh a rm as a m u ccaya lie performs unfavorable actions and does not perform favorable actions Thus engendering future suffering he is fettered by suffering It is perplexity with respect to the Truths He who is fettered by scepticism has doubts with respect to the Jewels of the Buddha his Teaching and the Community  and does not behave correctly towards the Three Jewels  Not behaving correctly towards the Three Jewr els he performs unfavorable actions and does not perform favorable actions Thus engendering future suffering he is fettered by suffering It is an angry thought aroused by intolerance of anothers wellbeing in him who seeks gains and honors He who is fettered by envy seeks gains and honors and does not revere the Teaching  Respecting gains and honors he performs unfavorable actions and does not perform favorable actions Thus engendering future suffering he is fettered by suffering He who is fettered by avarice is attached to accumulation and does not respect the idea of relinquishing Being attached to accumulation he performs unfavorable actions and does not perform favorable actions Thus engendering future suffering he is fettered by suffering A bond is threefold bond of craving  bond of hatred and bond of delusion  By the bond of craving beings are bound to suffering incurred by transformation  by the bond of hatred beings are bound to ordinary suffering  by the bond of delusion beings are bound to suffering as a conditioned state  Furthermore because of craving hatred and delusion there is no freedom in the practice of favorable actions That is why they are called bonds There are seven

remains underlying In him wh o is not free from the search for the false holy life  the latent tendencies of pride ignorance false views and scepticism remain underlying Those beings possess weak counteractives and having selfsatisfaction imadd and pride as well as delusion with respect to the Truths they imagine false deliverance and the path leading to it and become confused and sceptical regarding the teaching and the discipline of the Buddha As for the minor defilements  those which are defilements are also minor defilements but minor  The same list in the Pali texts e g A IV p  Sangltisutta in D Vism p  Only then order is different ditthi avija  A bh idharmasa m uccaya defilements are not defilements the rest of what is defiledthey are all mental activities included in the aggregate of formations Except for six defilements beginning with craving  the other impure mental activities beginning with anger included in the aggregate of formations However craving  hatred and delusion as mental activities are also called minor defilements because the mind is defiled by them and because there is no detachment no deliverance no abandonment of the hindrances That is wTiy they are called minor defilements the Blessed One said For a long period craving hatred and delusion defiled distracted and polluted your mind restlessness  avarice  lack of modesty anapatrapya They are called envelopments because they cover the mind completely actively and ceaselessly Furthermore at the moment of acquisition of the image udgrabanimittay during the development of concentrated calm  and also on the occasion of the practice of the pure virtuous and holy life these envelopments cover the mind The first is a reflection on the search for are called tribulations because when the situation changes one is affected by sorrow lamentation suffering and sadness There are three contentions  the contentions of craving hatred and delusion They are called contentions because due to craving hatred and delusion one fights with weapons and sticks and one creates all kinds of contentions and conflicts There are three fevers  the fevers of craving hatred and delusion They are called fevers because due to craving hatred and delusion one is burnt by the great heat of unjust craving  excessive covetousness and false teachings  There are three dense forests  the dense forests of craving hatred and delusion They are called dense forests because due to craving hatred and delusion beings are engaged in activities which engender birth and death and are born in different groups consisting of the five destinies in the continuity of existence There are three obstructions  the obstructions of craving hatred and delusion Because of craving hatred and delusion there is a great longing concerning the body and wealth lack of comprehension desire for contention satisfaction even when having little favorable  They are called obstructions because due to them one does not develop favorable things Hence the synonyms of defilement are innumerable  What is their depravation  Two defilements  The correct term is vanasa See n  above p  only with equanimity False view is in conjunction with sorrow joy and equanimity in the realm of desire In the realms of form and of the formless it is in conjunction with feeling Scepticism is in conjunction with sorrow and equanimity in the realm of desire and it is conjoined in accordance with feeling in the realms of form and of the formless Since it is in conjunction with all the defilements ignorance in conjunction is conjoined in accordance with feeling Pure ignorance is in conjunction with sorrow and equanimity in the realm of desire In the higher realms it is conjoined in accordance with feeling Why are all the defilements in conjunction with equanimity Because all the defilements are in decline due to their apathy Furthermore craving in the realm of desire pertains to the six groups of consciousness As is craving so are repugnance and ignorance Craving in the realm of form pertains to four groups of consciousnessM and in the realm of form it pertains to the group of mental consciousness As is craving so is ignorance Pride false view and scepticism pertain everywhere linked to the group of mental consciousness Moreover craving repugnance and pride in the realm of desire are only active with certain objects As in the realm of desire so also in the realm of form and of the formless the other defilements are everywhere active with all the objects What are their groups  There are two groups of defilements the group which should be abandoned through internal vision and the group which should be abandoned through mental cultivation  See Kosa ch VII  A bh idharmasamu ccaya abandoned through internal vision is again fourfold the group which should be abandoned through the internal vision of suffering the group which should be abandoned through the internal vision of the origin  the group which should be abandoned through the internal vision of cessation and the group which should be abandoned through the internal vision of the Path In the realm of desire the ten defilements should be abandoned through the internal vision of suffering As with those which should be abandoned through the internal vision of suffering so are those which should be abandoned through the internal vision of the origin  cessation and the Path In the realm of form those which should be abandoned separately through the four internal visions of suffering etc are nine defilements with the exception of repugnance As it is in the realm of form so it is in the formless realm Which are favorable  object  intention  application  defilement  and accomplishment  The results of the fruition of the ten kinds of unfavorable actions are produced in the three bad destinies  the results of the weak middling and strong actions are produced in the realms of animals  ghosts and the hells  The results of the fruition of the ten kinds of favorable actions are produced in those who are born as gods or men in the realms of the gods or men Their secondary results nisyandapbala separately and appropriately are the growth of welfare of the person and things pertaining to him in those realms Their predominant results  separately and appropriately are the growth of external things in those realms The results of favorable and unfavorable actions are produced in the good and bad destinies  This also through the projecting action and the completing action   What is projecting action What is completing action What is strong action  An action which should produce results in the hells only produces results in the present life through obstruction by means of the power of the counteractive qualities pratipaksabalaviskambhana an action which should produce results in the present life does not produce any  This action is termed strong by reason of the power of the action of the counteractive qualities Every favorable volitional action is termed strong by reason of the power of the action of the counteractive qualities My noble disciples develop a favorable thought for unlimited and great apramanavaipulyd actions but with regard to compounded and limited actions they do not reject or retain them or fall into that category  Unfavorable volitional action by a person whose counteractive qualities are weak is also termed strong Furthermore a volitional action which is destined to produce results or which has not been destroyed or which is unknown is also termed strong All favorable and unfavorable actions which are destined to produce results and which are not destroyed by the Noble Path are termed strong actions An unfavorable action associated with the realm of desire an action habitually performed in the past an action performed opportunely an action which is irreversible  by reason of its incompatible nature with final Nirvana all vidual and not by others in common What is the meaning of that word in the Sutra Here the Buddha wishes to refute false words such as From a pleasant action only pleasant results arise from an unpleasant action only unpleasant results arise from a neither pleasant nor unpleasant action only neither pleasant nor unpleasant results arise The right idea can be expressed thus with regard to pleasant action which should produce a pleasant feeling the pleasant results are recognized which should produce an unpleasant feeling the unpleasant results are recognized which should produce a neither pleasant nor unpleasant feeling the neither pleasant nor unpleasant results are recognized With regard to an unpleasant action which should produce a pleasant feeling the pleasant results are recognized which should produce an unpleasant feeling the unpleasant results are recognized which should produce a neither pleasant nor unpleasant feeling the neither pleasant nor unpleasant results are recognized With regard to a neither pleasant nor unpleasant action which should produce a pleasant feeling the pleasant results are recognized which should produce an unpleasant feeling the unpleasant results are recognized which should produced a neither pleasant nor unpleasant feeling the neither pleasant nor unpleasant results are recognized Such is the meaning of that word in the Sutra Furthermore the division of action is threefold action of restraint  action of nonrestraint and action of neither restraint nor nonrestraint  What is the action of restraint  What is action karma included in the restraint according to the Code of Discipline pratimoksa They are the seven restraints of those who have entered the Community   restraint of the nuns   restraint of those who are in training  restraint of the male novices  restraint of the female novices  restraint of the male lay disciples  restraint of the female lay disciples  and restraint through fasting  To a person who follows neither a life of abstention from misconduct nor a life of abstention from sense pleasures J With regard to some lay disciples who dwell in a monastic establishment  it is called accompaniment  the restraint of a lay disciple is called nonaccompaniment  and the said accompaniment is also called clanger for morality  as in the case of hermaphrodites and eunuchs What is action that produces an unpleasant feeling It is unfavorable action  It is every action performed beyond the third absorption  Furthermore action is threefold Action that produces results in the present life  action that produces results in the next birth and action that produces results in successive births after that one  It is action whose results ripen in this very life It consists of hindering or helping a person who has emerged from the attainment of universal lovingkindness  Just as it is with a person who has emerged from the attainment of universal lovingkindness so it is for a person who has emerged from the attainment called noncontentious  or from the attainment of cessation  or from the fruit of the state of streamwinner or from the fruit of arhatship  Moreover a person who performs a favorable or unfavorable action with respect to the Community with the Buddha at its head will also experience their results in this very life Other persons who perform favorable or unfavorable actions may experience their results in the present life depending on the intensity of their intention It is action whose results will ripen in the next birth such as for example the five actions of action in the path of application and the immediate path  The explanation concerning actions of purification and silence which are impure due to the fault of deceit should be suitably understood as referring in general to obstructions which appear to contribute to pure actions   or neither other nor nonother  When there is cessation the cutting off of the six spheres then there is a stopping of speculations What is it from the point of view of convention  It is cessation acquired through the abolition of the seeds by means of worldly paths  The Blessed One calls it partial Nirvana  What is it in the absolute sense  It is cessation acquired through complete eradication of the seeds by means of noble wisdom  What is its incomplete state  It is cessation acquired by those who are in training such as the fruit of streamwinner  or the fruit of the oncereturner  or the fruit of nonreturner  What is its complete state  It is cessation acquired by those who are no longer in training  such as the fruit of arhatship  What is it as not having adornments  It is cessation acquired by arhats who are free from wisdom  What is it as having adornments  It is cessation with a substratum ul What is it as not having any remainder  It is cessation without a substratum  Because it is far removed from all the dangers of great suffering  Why is that cessation also called refuge  Why is that cessation also called supreme  Because it is a state in which one obtains all supreme nobility  Why is that cessation also called imperishable  Because it is free from birth  Why is that cessation also called unimpeded  Because it is free from the heat of all the defilements and also the great heat of suffering caused by the nonsatisfaction of all desires Why is that cessation also called nonburning  Because it is free from all grief lamentation suffering sorrow and uneasiness Why is that cessation also called safety  Because it is a state free from fear of violence Why is that cessation also called bliss  Why is that cessation also called that whose aim is happiness   Because its aim is ultimate happiness  Why is that cessation also called propitious  Why is that cessation also called health  Because it is free from all impeding illness  Why is that cessation also called immovable  Why is that cessation also called extinction  Because it is a state of signless peaceful happiness  Why is that cessation also called unborn  Because it is free from successive births  This in brief is called the characteristic of the Truth of the Path Furthermore the path is fivefold path of preparation  path of application  path of cultivation  and path of conclusion  What is the path of preparation  It is the morality of ordinary people  die control of their senses indriyesu guptadvarata  their moderation in nutriment  their state of watchfulness during the first and last parts of the night   their vigor  their tranquillity and insight  and their state of awareness  It is also the merit acquired through other practices wisdom acquired through listening  wisdom acquired through reflection and wisdom acquired through due to the path of preparation  What is the state of heat  This is the division of the path of vision into sixteen through knowledge and through acquiescence m What is suffering  It is the Truth of suffering  What is the teaching with regard to suffering  It is religious instruction on the Truth of suffering What is knowledge of the teaching  It is knowledge investigating ivicayd the teaching on the Truth of suffering in the path of application  What is acquiescence in knowledge  It is pure wisdom which has direct experience in itself of the Truth of suffering  by reason of the dominant powers of the preceding investigation Through this wisdom one abandons all the defilements which should be abandoned by the vision of suffering  That is why it is called acquiescence in the knowledge of the teaching on suffering  What is the knowledge of the teaching on suffering  It is knowledge by means of which one obtains emancipation from the abovementioned  See also Kosa ch VI p  ft  Abhidharmasamuccaya defilements immediately after aquiescence  That is why it is called knowledge of the teaching on suffering What is acquiesence in the subsequent knowledge of suffering  It is pure wisdom which appears in itself having a direct experience with acquiescence in the knowledge of the teaching on suffering and with the knowledge of the teaching on suffering  After which it is subsequent to the noble qualities  That is why it is called acquiesence in the subsequent knowledge of suffering What is the subsequent knowledge of suffering duhkhe anvayajndna It is pure wisdom which appears immediately after that and which retains acquiesence in the subsequent knowledge of suffering That is called subsequent knowledge of suffering It is the same with regard to the other Truths in the appropriate order The acquiesences and knowledges are knowables  In that case there is understanding of the grasped by means of acquiesence and the knowledge of the teaching and understanding of the grasper by means of the subsequent acquiesence and knowledge Moreover in all these forms of acquiescence and knowledge one would like to speak of a dwelling in the investigation of the signless  These sixteen thoughtmoments are called the path of vision  The arising and accomplishment of knowledge concerning the knowables are called a single thoughtmoment  Those such as the disciples sravaka who have reached realization of their knowledge  define the Truth of the path the object of their knowledge by means of groups of names phrases and letters  through the knowledge which they acquired after that  Those who are engaged in the comprehension practice the as it has been defined discriminating in accordance with their worldly knowledge  What is experience  What is perfecting  Above that they reach the perfection of knowledge having completed the basic revolution  And again those who have reached the perfection of knowledge define the Truth of the path by means of groups of names phrases and letters through the knowledge which they acquired after that The Sutra says The eye of the Truth arises dustless and unstained  This is said with regard to the path of vision  It is dustless by reason of acquiescence in the Truth  unstained by reason of the knowledge of the Truth  also by reason of abandonment and complete knowledge  one obtains the purity of the path  Seen the Truth through acquiescence in the Truth idharmaksanti Acquired the Truth prapt adharma through knowledge of the Truth  Profoundly penetrated the Truth paiyavagadbadhamia through subsequent knowledge  Transcended doubt by reason of the absence of doubt concerning his achievement through acquiescence and knowledge  Crossed beyond scepticism by reason of the absence of doubt concerning others achievement of that position Not depending on others by reason of independence from others and by reason of reflection on ones own favorable qualities for the cultivation of the path  Not being led by others in the instruction by the Master by reason of the fact that he cannot be led by other heretics with regard to the Buddhas instruction buddbasasana Having confidence in himself in the teachings dbarmesu vaisaradyaprdptd by reason of intrepidity of mind with regard to questions of teaching concerning realization   What is the path of cultivation   What is the worldly path Qaukikamarga It consists ofl the first second third and fourth worldly absorptions  the sphere of infinite space  the sphere of infinite consciousness  the sphere of nothingness and the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception  Those absorptions and formless states should be understood according to their defilements  their purification  their definition and their purity   Which are their defilements  They are the four undefined roots avyakrtamulanim thirst  view  pride and ignorance  One is defiled by thirst by reason of the defilement caused by enjoyment  one is defiled by view by reason of absorption dominated by views  one is defiled by pride by reason of absorption dominated by pride  one is defiled by sukbavedana and onepointedness of mind  By reason of counteracting factors pratipaksafigd and beneficial factors as well as factors whose nature is the basis of both  there is no definition of factors in the formless realms  What is definition by their attainment  The first absorption is acquired by means of seven attentions  Hence up to the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception  What are those seven attentions How much more so with regard to the Perfection of Absorption   What is their purity in the absorptions and formless realms From the final extremity of the first absorption up to the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception that is called purity  What is the transcendental path   What is the immediate path  tit is the path immediately after which the continuous defilements are destroyed  What is the path of liberation  It is the path by means of which when the defilements are destroyed  one experiences liberation  For a variety of defilements other than those which precede  the path of application the immediate path and the path of liberation are called the special path  It can also be the path of a person who forsaking the application of the destruction of the defilements  is engaged in reflection on the teaching  or in conduct in accordance with the teaching  or in the special attainment of an absorption  Or again it can also be the path of a person who cultivates special qualities  What is cultivation of the path  It consists ofl cultivation with a view to acquisition middling and strongstrong It is interesting to observe that by means of the weakweak path ie practice which is not strong or intense but preliminary one at the start destroys the strong or intense defilements ie It is by means of the strongstrong path ie the most intensified and developed practice that one finally destroys the weakweak mrdumrdii defilements ie These are explained in the following pages is contemplation with regard to the body  It is contemplation of the identity of the natural image of the body with the speculative counterimage of the body  What is internal feeling adbyatmam vedana It is feeling produced by reason of ones own body What is external feeling  It is feeling produced by reason of the external body It is feeling produced by reason of the internalexternal body with feeling so also with the mind and mental qualities and objects dharma As with contemplation with regard to the body so should one understand contemplation with regard to feeling etc respectively  And furthermore cultivation concerns will  vigor  effort  perseverance  energetic action  nonstalling  mindfulness  awareness and diligence  The cultivation of will is accomplished by counteracting the minor defilement of lack of attention  The cultivation of vigor by counteracting the minor defilement of idleness  The cultivation of effort by counteracting the minor defilements of torpor and restlessness   The cultivation of perseverance is accomplished by counteracting the minor defilement of mental apathy  The cultivation of energetic action by counteracting persons which are the external material spheres for oneself  makes a vigorous effort  uses ones mind energetically and exerts it There in such terms cultivation based on vigor is explained The base is will  vigor is zeal  It is the complete abandonment of opposing qualities and the acquisition and increase of counteractive qualities  What is the object of the four bases of supernormal power  It is the work to be done by means of thorough concentration  What is their aid  It is will  vigor  the mind  investigation  and the mind and mental activities associated with them  What is concentration through will  It is onepointedness of mind attained by the right application of the latter  What is concentration through vigor  It is onepointedness of mind attained by the continuous application of the latter  What is concentration through the mind  It is nisritd and aiming for renunciation  As it is for mindfulness as a factor of awakening so it is for them all up to equanimity as a factor of awakening   By these four terms respectively is explained the cultivation of the factors of awakening having as their object the Four Noble Truths What is the result of the cultivation of the factors of awakening It is the abandonment of the defilements which should be abandoned by internal vision  What is the object of the eight factors of the Noble Path Casta aryamargaftga It is the real nature of the Four Noble Truths It is right view  right thought  right speech  right action  right livelihood  right effort  right mindfulness and right concentration r Right view is the factor of discernment pariccbeddfiga right discrimination right thought is the factor producing harmonious contact with others  right speech right action and right livelihood are factors producing knowledge slowly and the pleasant practice which engenders superknowledge rapidly  The first comprises the basic absorptions  not obtained by those whose faculties are obtuse  the second comprises the basic absorptions not obtained by those whose faculties are sharp  the third comprises the basic absorptions obtained by those whose faculties are obtuse the fourth comprises the basic absorptions obtained by those whose faculties are sharp Exactly the same four practices are found in D III p the cultivation of tranquillity is for such an insight They are the faculty which I do not know  the faculty of perfect knowledge and the faculty of the conviction  have known   What is the faculty I shall know that the Truth which I do not know It is the faculty in the path of application prayogamargaYq and in the fifteen thoughtmoments of the path of vision ni knowledge of the destruction  the knowledge of the nonarising and the ten qualities of the disciple beyond training AG What are those ten from the right view of the disciple beyond training up to the right concentration of the disciple beyond training  the right deliverance of the disciple beyond training and the right knowledge of the disciple beyond training asaiksasya samyagjnanalAl Such things are called the path of completion  What is unruliness  unruliness caused by expression which is everywhere   unruliness caused by the impediment of the defilements  unruliness caused by the impediment of actions  unruliness caused by the impediment of the results of actions  unruliness caused by the hindrances  unruliness caused by reasoning  unruliness caused by nutriments  unruliness caused by sexual union  unruliness caused by dreams  unruliness caused by diseases  unruliness caused by firmness drdba All these termsvajropamasamadki dausthulya samyoga visamyoga asrayapravrtti note should be asrayaparivnti ksayajnana anutpadajnana dasaasaiksadharmaare explained below What is a fetter  What is freedom from the fetter  When unruliness is driven away that is known as the acquisition of freedom from the fetter  What is the diamondlike concentration  It is the concentration comprising the path of application or the immediate path on the occasion of the abandonment of the fetters in a person after his entry into the path of cultivation  The inclusion of the path of application indicates that henceforth it cannot be obscured by impediments and that it can shatter all the impediments The inclusion of the immediate path indicates the immediate appearance of the knowledge of the destruction and the knowledge of the nonarising  It is like a large crag intact without clefts without chasms solid compact and which cannot be shaken by winds blowing in the ten directions What is the functioning of the continuous basic revolution  It consists of three kinds of function These three kinds are What is the knowledge of destruction  It is knowledge obtained through the destruction of the cause or that whose object is destruction What is the knowledge of nonarising  It is knowledge obtained through the abandonment of the effect or that whose object is the nonarising of the effect The ten qualities of the disciple beyond training should be understood as the body of morality silaskandba the body of mental discipline  the body of wisdom  the body of deliverance and the body of vision of the knowledge of deliverance of the disciple beyond training  Because of the absence of understanding of suchness  because of the defilements and their latent tendencies and because of mistaken details of verbal expressions  The transcendental aspects should be understood as the opposite of those  Whoever is found in the presence of the transcendental aspects sees the meaning of Impermanence and experiences it directly but not by means of mistaken details of verbal expressions As with the aspects of Impermanence so should one understand the other aspects appropriately The noble Dharma is the teaching in twelve constituent parts  Which are those twelve constituent parts discourse sutra verse narration  solemn utterance  exploits  birthstories  instruction  What is a discourse  The Tathagata seeing ten advantages expounds explaining the teaching in this way he sets out and expounds easily the listener also understands easily through respect for the teaching he rapidly acquires the equipment with a view to Awakening  obtains serene joy based on conviction with regard to the Buddha his Teaching  and experiences supreme happiness in this very life inavanga of the Dhamma What is a verse narration  It is that which is recited in stanzas in the middle or at the end of discourses  or an idea not indicated in the discourse and which is explained  What is an exposition  It is the exposition of various present existences of the noble disciples in relation to their distant past in different locations Or it is clarification of a point indicated in discourses since it is the open exposition of an abstruse meaning  What is a stanza  What is a solemn utterance  It is sometimes spoken in discourses by the Tathagata with a joyous heart  What is a circumstance  It is a declaration made when he is questioned It is an account with parables in the discourses What is Thus it was said  This narrates the former existences of the noble disciples What are birthstories   Abbidharmasamuccaya existences of the Bodhisattva contained in the Canon concerning the career of the Bodhisattva It consists of accounts contained in the Canon of the Bodhisattvas  Why is it called vaipulya Because it is the basis of the welfare and happiness of all beings and because it is the supreme and profound teaching Because it shatters all impediments  Why is it called vaitulya What is a marvel  It is a discourse concerning extremely marvellous and extraordinary things in the career of the disciples bodhisattvas and the Tathagata These twelve constituent parts atigd such as discourses sutra into which the noble teaching is divided are included in the Threefold Canon  Which are those three Canons They are again divided into two the Canon of the Disciples and the Canon of the Bodhisattvas  Discourse sutra verse narration  exposition  stanza and solemn utterance  these five constituent parts are included in the Canon of Discourses pertaining to the Canon of the Disciples these four constituent parts are included in the Canon of the Discipline with the Parivara pertaining to the two forms of the Canon Development and marvels  these two constituent parts are included in the Canon of Discourses pertaining to the Canon of the Bodhisattvas Instruction is included in the Canon of the Higher Teaching of the Disciples as well as of the Bodhisattvas Why did the Tathagata establish the Threefold Canon The Canon of Discourses was established by the wish to counteract the minor defilement of doubt  The Canon of the Discipline was established by the wish to counteract the minor defilement of attachment to the two extremes  The Canon of the Higher Teaching was established by the wish to counteract the minor defilement of adherence to ones own views  Furthermore the Canon of Discourses was established by the wish to reveal the three moral rules  The Canon of the Discipline was established by the wish to accomplish the disciplines of higher virtue and higher mental development  It consists of the aggregates  elements and spheres  It consists of the Four Noble Truths their sixteen aspects n suchness  the Impermanence of every conditioned thing  the suffering of every conditioned thing the absence of a self in every thing  calm Nirvana  emptiness  wishlessness and signlessness  What is the accomplishment of duty as object It is the revolution of the basis  This revolution of the basis is inconceivable  How many of the sixteen aspects of the Four Noble Truths are included in emptiness  How many of them are included in wishlessness  How many of them are included in signlessness animittd What is the reason of dependence It is the fact that things which have different characteristics have distinct causes and effects What is the reason of the accomplishment of attestation It is the fact that the instruction concerning a thing to be established such as the accomplishment of attestation is not contrary to the authority  It is the full development of the essential nature of things whose own and common characteristics have endured since infinite time  What is the search for names It is the judgement that the owncharacteristics of groups of the names  phrases and consonants of things dharma are not absolute  What is the search for substances It is the judgement that the characteristics of the aggregates  elements and spheres are not absolute What is the search for the designation of ownnature It is the judgement that with regard to the relationship between the name and the thing named  ownnature is only a designation in as much as it is a linguistic sign  It is the judgement that with regard to the relationship between the name and the thing named particularities are only designations in as much as they are linguistic signs There are four precise knowledges precise knowledge sought by means of names  precise knowledge sought by means of substances  precise knowledge sought by the designation of ownnature  and precise knowledge sought by means of the designation of particularities  What is precise knowledge sought by means of names It is precise knowledge that cannot be attained by means of names  What is precise knowledge sought by means of substances It is precise knowledge that cannot be attained by means of the characteristics of substances  What is precise knowledge sought by means of the designation of ownnature It is precise knowledge that cannot be attained by means of the ownnature of substances  What is precise knowledge sought by means of the designation of particularities It is precise knowledge that cannot be attained by means of the particularities of substances  What is aid It is erudition concerning things such as the state of heat and the Noble Truths in a person who has acquired the equipment with a view to Awakening  What is application It is profound attention which has it the erudition mentioned above as object What is the mirror It is knowledge which cannot be attained by means of what is appropriated and what appropriates  Referring to this the Blessed Lord Buddha rightly said The bodhisattva in a state of recollection sees that images are only thought citta mind Rejecting the notion of objects artbasamjna or visayasamjha perceiving only his own thought  and with his mind thus settled in itself he understands the absence of what is appropriated and also the absence of what appropriates  and he then experiences the knowledge that cannot be attained by means of grabya and grabaka  What is the base  By means of the knowledge of the well explained letter  The practice of concentration should be understood by means of constant and careful practice and unperverted practice  Dissatisfaction should be understood by means of practice aimed at an untasted higher tranquillity uttarasamatbcfiP  Why is the Vaipulya called the Canon of Perfections of the Bodhisattvas Because it describes the number of the perfections  their characteristics  order  explanations  cultivation  divisions  groupings  opposites  the eulogies of their virtues  and also their mutual determining  Because of its knowledge of all the aspects  its excellence and its profundity   Why do certain beings not esteem the excellence and profundity of the Vaipulya and are afraid of it Since they have no ownnature  they are unarisen  since they do not arise they are undestroyed  since they neither arise nor are destroyed they are calm from the beginning  since they are calm from the beginning they are completely

acquired the equipment is a person who depends on the teaching dominated by the Truth who is endowed with strong acquiescence in profound reflection on the teachings concerning the Truths who is endowed with strong qualities leading to penetration and whose duration of rebirths is limited to this one life The three categories of qualities leading to penetration with the exception of the supreme worldly qualities  are instantaneous and not continuous  by reason of the very nature of the supreme worldly qualities The person whose duration of rebirths is limited to this one life  by

of infinite space  It is deliverance through the sphere of infinite space in conformity with deliverance Thus should one understand the deliverances through the sphere of nothingness and through the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception  They are aimed at calm deliverance santa vimoksd and at delivering oneself from the impediments of attachment What is deliverance through the cessation of perception and feeling  It is a state similar to emancipation which in the remaining calm deliverance is obtained with the aid of deliverance through the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception and it is the cessation of the mind and mental activities in that state It is aimed at delivering oneself from the impediments to the cessation of perception and feeling There are eight of them The first four spheres of mastery are established by two deliverances  The last four spheres of mastery are established by one deliverance In the deliverances one is attentive to the object  but in the spheres of mastery one masters the object because it has submitted there  When referring to pleasant and unpleasant objects forms are called lovely and unlovely  When referring to human and divine objects forms are called inferior and superior  The rest is similar to what was said with regard to the deliverances  There are ten of themS They are called spheres of totalization because they

Advice is instruction desana aimed at the mental concentration of those whose minds are not concentrated and at the liberation of those whose minds are concentrated Secondly the assembly of the talk

be its own nature or the nature of the thing  The speciality may be its own speciality or the speciality of the thing  The thesis is the communication to others of the meaning preferred by oneself of

 The bodhisattva great being endowed with five qualities becomes chaste  possesses extremely pure chastity Created by Bodhisattva Vasubandhu Translated by the Tang Tripiṭaka Master Xuanzang In various scriptures the Bhagavat has taught the three kinds of actions bodily action verbal action and mental action The theory holds that a bodily action refers to what is done by the body Since language itself is an act it is called a verbal action In themselves these two can be either acts of communicating information or not A mental action refers to action concomitant with thinking and consists solely in mind A bodily act of communicating consists in physical shape and is engendered by mental states that take that as object If is the physical shape of the body then why do you say that a bodily action is an act done by the body It is said to be physical shape of the body because is constituted by the individual members of the entire body It is said to be done by the body because comes about in dependence on the primary elements of the body That which is predicated of the body as a whole also applies to its members In common parlance people say I live in the village or I live in the forest while in fact we live in houses in the village or in groves in the forest Why do you say that is engendered by mental states that take that as object In order to exclude the physical shape of the lips because is not engendered by mental actions that take that as their object Rather the shape of the lips is engendered by mental states that take as their object the enunciation of language We also want to exclude shapes elicited from the mental states of former aspirations because is not engendered by mental states that take those as its object Rather these are engendered by mental states that have a residual cause for maturation Why is said to be communicative Because a mind that informs and manifests an act which it itself has engendered communicates that to others In order to clarify this we present a stanza Since we manifest outwardly through the body and speech We communicate the volitions of our inner mind Just as a fish hidden in the deep Communicates its presence by beating the waves What then is physical shape This refers to long short square circular high low same different This refers to that by which the ideas designated as long etc It is included in the sphere of physical form Are the shapes of length etc specific atoms as are colors Or are they composites of specific atoms Or are they a discrete and unique reality pervading the composites of color If length etc were a specific atom then it would be analogous to color Then in each and every minute part of a physical composite length etc would be apprehensible If were a composite of specific atoms then would there be no difference between and a composite of the atoms of color And then the specificity of the composites of all the colors would themselves have to be long etc If were a discrete and unique reality pervading the composites of colors then because it is both unique and pervasive it would be found in each and every part since it would be concomitantly present in all parts It would not then be unique however for it would abide separately in all the parts Moreover this refutes your own tenet that the ten spheres are all composites of atoms and it confirms the thesis of Kaṇādas followers that substances exist in the parts because they pervade all the parts ie in all the composite physical matter so united If we were to allow this to be the case then in each and every section we would engender the notions of all the shapes This is not what happens however Therefore physical shapes have no distinct reality The colors seen in a squareshaped piece of linen do not simultaneously engender the notion of length such as might be by a row of trees or a column of ants If this is true  then how is it that from a distance and in a dark place we do not discern color but we do discern shape How is it that we do not discern the shape of trees and yet can discern the shape of a row of trees Now apart from the trees there is no separate row  Rather in distant or darkened composite matter neither color nor shape is discernible Even when we can perceive  it remains unclear and we wonder what it is that we are seeing The Communicative Act as Movement Another theory holds that a bodily act of communication consists in movement engendered by mental states that take as object Why does repeat is engendered by mental states that take that as object In order to exclude the physical movement of the lips because that is engendered by mental states that take as object the enunciation of language What does the term movement mean It means a change of position It is included in the sphere of physical form How does one know that is a change in position Let us use as an example the heating of objects  Although has come into direct contact with agents that transform it such as fire sunlight snow vinegar etc and the causes for all these heatings are indeed different one cannot ascertain these specifying characteristics in the finished product Nevertheless the later state differs from its former state Another example comparable bunches of grass to be burned as fuel each produce different flames Although they are different we cannot ascertain their specifying characteristics Nevertheless those comparable bunches of grass are certainly different So although we cannot ascertain the specifying characteristics of those acts we should not conclude that they are all identical except for the change in the position of that body Suppose that when a fired product came into direct contact with the cause its characteristics as a fired product did not immediately arise even afterward they would not arise because that cause would not have changed If the comparable bunches of grass to be burned as fuel did not each produce different flames then the flames would have no cause to differ yet they do differ in their dimensions luminescence and heat Therefore it does not follow that because specifying characteristics of a bodily act cannot be ascertained we must conclude that a bodily act of communication is a change of position we must carefully examine and understand these specifying characteristics We claim that is a change in the position because a cause for the extinction cannot be ascertained It is like mind mental states sound light flames etc all of which you include in the category of things that do perish from moment to moment without a cause What cause for extinction do these things have This applies also to the other things  Extinction does not depend on a cause Mind etc do have a cause for extinction howevereach and every item is itself characterized by impermanence Why then does this not apply to other things and not just your restricted list You recognize that the extinction of mind etc If that is true of mind etc why is it not true of other things too If in the case of things other than extinction did not depend on a cause then the material nature could not be ascertained even before the wood had come into contact with flame because its later state would be the same as its former state How then could it be perceived at all Let us take flame and sound which you admit perishes from moment to moment without any cause Before the wind has contacted the lamp and before the hand has grasped the bell the lamps flame and the bells sound are distinctly perceptible but this is not the case after they have been touched by the wind or grasped by the hand However the extinction of the flame and the sound do not depend on the wind or the hand  The same applies to the firewood This should present no logical difficulty All things perish from moment to moment and need no cause for their extinction Moreover even if the firewood is destroyed because of the fire and its material nature cannot be perceived then at the very moment it comes into contact one would not perceive it since when it has come into contact it is altered Moreover all heated products have degreesslightly medium and completely  although the external cause remains unchangedAlthough these differences in the characteristics of what is heated do occur their cause is  Now how could be both the cause for the later occurrence of the products fired and also the cause for their prior extinction It is impossible that that because of which a thing arises should also be that because of which it is destroyed Two contrary states do not have a single common cause Conditioned things do not depend on a cause for their extinction they perish spontaneously Whether or not they are perceived asthey were we must recognize that thisisthe specific characteristic of either the evolutions or the extinctions of their continuities because they have a subtle progression Moreover if things that are destroyed did indeed have a cause for their destruction and thus there is nothing that is destroyed without a cause then the mind and mental states etc which you assert need no cause for their extinction would need a cause for their extinction too just as they need a cause for their arising Yet it is not true that there is a separate impermanence different from mind etc Moreover since these causes would differ the extinctions would also be different since fire sunlight snow and vinegar differ and the products prepared differ Moreover a thing already destroyed would again be destroyed because it would be granted a cause just as physical form etc Therefore extinction definitely has no cause Because extinction has no cause as soon as something occurs it immediately perishes Thus we conclude that is not a change of place We claim that this state is indeed a change of position because no cause for the arising is perceptible It is just as a prior heating issues in a later heating just as milk issues in curdled cream just as grape juice issues in wine or as wine issues into vinegar Since there is no change of position what movement is there If they have such duration however then they would have no movementonly something that is unmoving would have stable duration Even if a thing has no duration it would still have no movement because something that perishes as soon as it arises precludes movement If this is true what is it that we observe as movement  That which is seen in another place is not the same thing as before A stationary form does not move but sunlight moves off and comes back and one can see the shade that is produced either long or short or changing Moreover when one covers the light only small streaks occur How can you be sure that what is seen in another place is not the same thing as before As we have explained if there is duration then there would be no movement and so forth Moreover even though an external cause of fire etc does not change afterward differences are perceived Thus we conclude that from moment to moment there is a different thing Moreover despite your argument that what is seen in another place is the selfsame thing as before because there is no cause for these differences you have given no reason to show that it is indeed the same thing as before The Communicative Act as Wind The Sauryodayika theory holds that all activity in fact does not change position since conditioned things of their nature are destroyed from moment to moment However there is a distinct reality that is the cause for a special thought This reality arising in dependence on the hand the foot and so forth activates that hand or foot and is the reason something arises in a different position This is what is termed movement and bodily communication In the sphere of physical form If this is true then why can not be seen with the eye as are all the colors  If it cannot be seen it does not communicate to others How does one even know this reality in fact exists How does this reality cause the body itself to move into another position and arise in a different manner We claim that the wind arisen from a special thought is this  The very essence of the wind element is movement It is the general cause whereby the foot changes its position Apart from the wind what element of movement can one identify Furthermore even grasses and leaves have no separate movement apart from the wind How could they move about Yet when the wind touches them they all naturally begin to move This is why we should conclude that this causes the hand to move its position Why dither about other theories either by their essence or by their activity cannot engender any reality capable of movement Since the wind has nothing whereby it communicates however how can you call it communicative Furthermore how can you claim that the sphere of the tangible which includes the wind is either morally good or bad If you incorrectly claim that a special thought causes the body itself to arise in different positions and that this bodily act is then bodily communication such a bodily communication is a verbal designation and not real because the body itself is essentially a composite of many elements Moreover how can that which is not communicative be termed communicative The nose and do not communicate with others Moreover if you hold that the sense of smell and the activities of the other parts of the body are either morally good or bad this is not a theory of a disciple of the Buddha If you incorrectly hold that physical color arising from a special thought would be bodily communication physical color does not arise from any special thought it arises from its own seeds and a special wind Moreover if you hold that physical color is either good or bad this is not a disciple of the Buddha Even if the essence of physical color is not a bodily communication its arising in other positions can still be a bodily communication Who could prove that this arising of physical color has a special reality  If the arising you propose is not homogeneous with physical form etc and what is seen is not homogeneous with the eye then how could the observer ever know of its existence And if it were invisible how could it be termed communicative It was explained above that cannot communicate to others Moreover if physical color is either morally good or bad one could claim that it engenders bodily acts of communication but physical color is neither morally good or bad as we have explained above Likewise its arising is  If this is true then acts of the body would be exclusively noncommunicative  What do you identify as noncommunicative I refer to the physical form of discipline included within the sphere of thought Then in the realm of desire can a good noncommunicative be elicited apart from a communicative act What problem is there if in the realm of desire there is such a noncommunicative  It would have to flow from thought as in the realm of form where noncommunicative acts are not engendered from communicative acts but from a strong thought Then when one has another thought or is unconscious there would be neither restraint nor its absence We avoid this error because we claim that endures for a time since it has been projected at the appointed time by the recitation  How then could one who when the Scripture on Discipline is recited keeps silent and says nothing during the appointed time incur the transgression of lying Moreover  then there could be no morally neutral act of the body because the noncommunicative is only of the two varieties of morally good and bad Also there could be no bodily acts that are both good and bad at the same moment since all noncommunicative have a definite continuity A weak thought does not engender a noncommunicative act while that engendered by a strong thought maintains a definite continuity Even though one follows his whims and imagines really existent physical acts of body and speech still he cannot demonstrate that they are good or bad Some say Why is this unreasonable Past acts essentially and really do exist and can produce their fruit in the future Critique of the Theory that Past Acts Really Exist Pimples popping out of a boil If you are correct then how could the Bhagavat himself have said Acts even after a hundred years pass by Still do not perish When they encounter the convergence of conditions and an occasion They necessarily bear their fruit What does this phrase they do not perish mean It clearly means that past acts do not lack their results just as is shown in the latter half of the stanza Who does not admit that good or bad acts produce their results long afterward Is it due to a special evolution in ones mental continuity just as rice seeds produce their fruit Or is it because their specific natures remain unchanged over a long time and thus produce their results It is admissible to hold that they produce their results because of a special evolution of mental continuity If they produce their results because their specific natures remain unchanged over a long time however then you are saying that these acts essentially do not come to an end even after a long time Because they no longer can project a future result Why are they unable to project a future result Because having already projected that result they are without ability in its regard and cannot project it again This is just as how things that have already arisen do not arise again Since there is no limitation to the flow of similar results  why do they not project other similar results The essence of the act does not perish but remains eternally in the present Why then does it not eternally project the result it has brought about Have I not just explained that it is unable to project again its already projected result just as a thing that has already arisen does not arise again Why do you keep raising this objection Even though you have treated this above you have not resolved the difficulty Being eternal it should eternally project its results in the present It should constantly be able to arise anew as at its inception We hold that although a past act essentially exists it is not present inasmuch as it lacks activity This is not admissible Indeed existing forever by its essence it should always have activity in the present Besides in your theory all past things have the activity to give forth their results Why not then in the present We hold that the present refers only to the activity of grasping a result in dependence on a multitude of factors This reasoning doesnt hold Since the meaning of activity is univocal there would be things simultaneously present and past How can anything be said to be able to project a result We hold that it disposes other factors that lead to its later arising When at the last moment has exhausted all impure outflows he clearly does not project future results because they no longer arise If at first they have no activity in the present then how can you claim that later they fail and perish We hold that although they lack activity they can still be destroyed again  This is how a past act must again be annihilated If has already been annihilated and then is annihilated again it follows that something that has arisen again will once more arise This contradicts what you have asserted above We hold that even though the thoughts of an arhat who has exhausted outflows do have the activity to engender subsequent results because conditions are lacking the subsequent results do not arise This is not reasonable If a result is never engendered how can you know that they have the activity to engender it You are forced to state that these thoughts both counter and harmonize with two conditions because they would both exist and not exist even though they arise from a cause they lack any activity to engender a subsequent result Therefore this theory that in sundry modes can project a result is logically invalid Rather we should conclude that because a seed can nourish a result we can speak about the projection of results Your theory holds that the past and the future both really exist Then how would the future not be able to project a result just as the present does If everything always exists would anything essentially ever not exist Yet the scriptural passage says that produce their results when they encounter a convergence of conditions and occasion You should explain just what how and in which state an act can be described as disposing other that lead to the future arising  called the projection of results because everything always exists  Therefore we deem invalid this theory that holds that past acts essentially and really exist and can realize the future results they give forth Special RealitiesThe Increase and the Imperishable Then one must admit that the two acts of body and speech whether morally good or bad engender a special reality in the continuity of the aggregates which essentially and really exist and which is included among the aggregate of formations not associated with mind Some call this reality the increase while others call it the imperishable Otherwise when an alternate mind arises and the disappears how could that realize a future result if such a special reality were not elicited within the mental continuity Therefore one must certainly admit that there is such a reality Critique of the Theory of the Special Realities of Increase and Imperishability If this is true then when one first studies a text and recalls it to memory after a long period of time has elapsed  or when one at firstsees or hearsthings and recalls a memory of those things after a long period of time has elapsed at what instant is this reality engendered Moreover when one first enters the concentration of cessation what reality is elicited by the mind whereby one might later return from that concentration and elicit a mind leaving concentration Moreover if one were to dye the flowers of a citron tree with the juice of purple lac after both perish what reality is engendered whereby the later result is that the pith of the fruit has a red color Therefore we distance ourselves from this imagined special reality engendered by the two acts of body and speech The Evolutions of Mental Continuity However we conclude that a special kind of volition does exercise its permeations on the mental continuity causing it to engender its activity It is due to the special evolution of such activity that the varieties of future results occur This is similar to dyeing the flowers of a citron tree with the juice of purple lacwhen the evolution of its continuity reaches its term the pith of the fruit is colored red We should recognize that the permeations of inner states of consciousness is analogous When then do you not allow that the two acts of body and speech also permeate the mental continuity Acts of body and speech become morally good or bad because they are engendered from thought Since they become morally good or bad because of thought it does not follow that they themselves can give forth future results in a different mental continuity either agreeable or disagreeable The theory of some holds that in this life a mind previously permeated necessarily returns to its continuity and thus realizes its results either agreeable or disagreeable If has already been severed for some time however what can cause it to reconnect  The mind entering into concentration is the immediately antecedent and similar condition whereby it can bring about that reconnection We have already refuted the notion that past acts can realize results By the same token this too is logically refuted Therefore the mind that emerges from those concentrations is unconnected with  Some others hold that the mind after emergence from those unconscious states returns because of the force of seeds that adhere in the sense organs These seeds that engender mind and mental states rely as needed on two continuities mental continuity and sense organ continuity Do the scriptures not teach that Thinking and things are the causes that engender thinking consciousness Apart from thought how can thinking consciousness arise  You should recognize that the seeds of thought are sometimes referred to as thought  as they speak about the result in place of the cause just as one might refer to hunger or thirst in place of the tangible Yet how can each thought and mental state arise from these continuities of seeds It is never observed that sprouts engender things from two sets of seeds or anything like this It is possible that engender a single fruit in reliance on many conditions but the arising of a single fruit never comes from two seeds This is to say when the mental continuity of one abiding in a concentration bereft of mind or among the unconscious gods is severed how can an act prior realize a future result either agreeable or disagreeable ie the reemergence of conscious life in any of the destinies What opinion The opinion that these states are devoid of mind Some hold that these states do possess mind In the Inquiry Blessed Vasumitra says Those who hold that the concentration of cessation is entirely devoid of mind encounter this error However I teach that even the concentration of cessation has a subtle mind and thus I avoid this fault He also quotes the scriptures to demonstrate his interpretation such as a passage that states In those who abide in the concentration of cessation the formations of the body are eliminated  but the sense organs remain unchanged undestroyed and consciousness does not leave the body Well then what is the consciousness present in that state Some hold that it is the sixth thinking consciousness Yet a scripture states Thinking and things are the causes that engender thinking consciousness The convergence of these three issues is contact and with contact sensation conceptualization and volition arise How then could the states actually have a thinking consciousness without the convergence of these three ie thinking things  and thinking consciousness Even if this was possible how could these three come together yet there is no contact Even if that was possible how could contact be present without sensation and conceptualization We are speaking however about a concentration that has extinguished sensation and conceptualization There is yet another interpretation of the Bhagavats teaching that sensation causes craving Not every sensation invariably causes craving This same can apply to contact Not every contact invariably causes sensation In other scriptures the Bhagavat himself has examined this issue He explained that all sensation engendered by contact that is qualified by primal ignorance is the cause engendering craving Nowhere has he identified the contact that engenders sensation however Yet anotherinterpretation holdsthat the assertion that the phrase the convergence of the three issues in contact means that contact arises when these three factors have the force to come together In these states however the three factors lack the force to engender contact or to engender sensation or conceptualization since the mind that enters into concentration is extinguished If indeed these states of concentration lack contact then obviously sensation and conceptualization will be absent Therefore in these states all that remains is the mental consciousness without any mental states What error is entailed in these  If their nature is morally good how then can that good nature not be associated with the roots of goodness such as detachment and so forth And if they are associated with the roots of goodness such as detachment and so forth then how could there be no contact What we assert is that this consciousness is good because it is projected by an immediately antecedent and similar condition that is good This reasoning does not follow since three kinds of mind morally good bad or neutral may arise immediately after a good mind A good mind projected by the force of good roots however would be incapable of eliminating detachment and so forth and thus could not emerge as either bad or neutral And if it lacks good roots it follows that it could not become good Yet this concentration of cessation is good just as cessation is good if it is of a defiled nature how then can that defiled nature not be associated with the passions such as covetousness and so forth If it is associated with the passions such as covetousness and so forth then how could there be no contact As the Buddha himself has taught in the Scripture of Ten Questions All the aggregates of sensation conceptualization and formation have contact as their cause Moreover if a concentration without conceptualization is not deemed to be defiled this applies even more to the concentration of cessation If you affirm that is unobstructed and undefined then does it arise from maturation from deportment from craftsmanship or from magical illusions These are the only morally undefined states taught in the Great Book of Options that you follow What error is entailed here If arises from maturation then how immediately after the concentrated mind the summit of mundane being can it still engender a mind born from maturation that pertains to the realm of desire because in the lower eight stages of meditation has been severed Again how could it be that immediately after one emerges from this mind  one attains and elicits a mind of utter nonagitation In the Mahākauṣṭhilasūtra a question is asked After one emerges from the concentration of cessation how many contacts does one experience answered Dear student one experiences three contacts If the mind of concentration at the summit of being focused on cessation were to reach its termination and then come to manifest as a mind maturing karmic results projected by the permeations of former acts in the realm of desire then why has it not done this during the previous states of meditation leading up to that concentration of cessation Material forms arisen from elicited maturation that have been engendered by that have already been severed and do not continue Moreover you admit that the nine progressive concentrations and the eight liberations all of which are cultivated are all by nature good Thus it does not follow that in these states there would arise either a defiled or a morally undefined mind Moreover employing the summit of being focused on cessation as objective and supported by a concentration that reflects on quietude one realizes entry into the concentration that eliminates sensation and conceptualization In the Mahākauṣṭhilasūtra a question about the concentration of cessation is posed How many are the causes and conditions on which one relies for entry into the concentration on the imageless realm answered Dear monk there are two causes and conditions dependent on which one enters the concentration of the imageless realm the absence of reflection of any image and correct reflection on the imageless realm If as you admit there is a mental consciousness in this concentration of cessation what would its object be What would be its mode of operation What if its object is cessation and its mode of operation is quietude Then how could it not be good If you grant that it is good then why not admit that it is associated with the roots of goodness such as detachment and so forth If you grant that it is so associated why then not admit that contact is its cause for arising How then could one engender a distracted mind immediately after the mind of entry into the concentration of cessation If you imagine that there exists another undefined state apart from the four discussed above you are not correct because of the two causes  Therefore you have incorrectly understood the meaning of the scripture and rashly imagined that a sixth mental consciousness is always present in the concentration of cessation and thus claim that these states have mind Vasubandhus Theory The Subtle Mind Well then do you hold that the concentration of cessation is a state entirely devoid of mind A consciousness that matures results endowed with all the seeds of those results from the first moment of taking birth until final death evolves in continuity without interruption Throughout the various lifetimes because it is the cause of their maturation the various different continuities flow forth until it is finally eliminated at cessation Indeed because this consciousness is uninterrupted one can say that there is mind during these mindless states One can also say that there is no mind however because the complex of the other six consciousnesses do not function at all in these states It is because of the dominant force of the mind preparatory to the concentration of cessation that the seeds of the six consciousnesses are temporarily suppressed and remain unmanifested Thisis why those states are said to be devoid of mind but they are not entirely so devoid Mind has two varieties The first is a mind that accumulates innumerable seeds The second is a polymorphous mind that functions with differences in object and modality Since this second mind is lacking in these states of the concentration of cessation we say that it is without mind It is just as if a chair has one leg but is missing the other  we say that it doesnt have its legs In states in which the seeds of the consciousnesses are subdued the consciousness that matures results evolves in a special way from moment to moment as the force of that suppression gradually diminishes until it is entirely eliminated just as the heat of boiling water or the velocity of a released arrow gradually diminishes until it are is exhausted the seeds of the consciousnesses again engender their results At first the mental consciousness is again engendered from the seeds and later the other consciousnesses are gradually engendered as conditions warrant As explained above the consciousness that matures results harbors the various seeds of all things When it becomes manifest through the good or bad permeations of the various other consciousnesses and their concomitant states then the force of the seeds inevitably increase There is a stanza that supports this interpretation Mind together with unlimited seeds Continues in a constant stream Encountering conditions for specific permeations These seeds increase in the mind The force of the seeds gradually matures and Gives forth its fruit when conditions converge Just as when one has dyed citron flowers The pith of the ripening fruit will be stained red In support of this the Bhagavat declared the following stanza in the Great Vehicle Scripture on the Explication of the Underlying Meaning The depth and subtlety of the appropriating consciousness With all its seeds is like a violent torrent I have not revealed this to worldlings Fearing they would imagine it to be a self Consciousness Since it continues onward and has the ability to appropriate a body upon rebirth into another life it is called the appropriating consciousness It is also called the storehouse consciousness as it encompasses and stores the seeds of all states It is also called the consciousness that matures results because the projected actions of previous lives mature If one does not admit the existence of this maturing consciousness then what consciousness can appropriate a body There is no other consciousness that is adequate for taking up an entire body and remaining without abandoning it until the end of a lifetime Moreover what sphere or aggregate is able to sever the passions and their residues when their antidote arises We think that aggregate is found in the very mind that counters  This is incorrect How could that which conforms to those residues and passions be able to counter  Moreover when a mind defiled good or without outflows is generated among beings born into the formless realm where would these maturing states that support those destinies lodge Alternately you would have to admit that in these destinies the pervasive presence of states that are not maturation or that are unconnected  but this contradicts reason Moreover the result of a nonreturner  when born into the summit of being is the eradication of the remaining outflows and the cultivation of the path that counters  Now when the absence of outflows occurs in the sphere of nonbeing what is the specific reality at the summit of being what is the substance that continues to exist whereby is deemed not to be dead It is not true that a homogeneous existence or a vital force exist separately as realities apart from the mind and material form These two are only metaphors for the successive progression of the maturing aggregates This successive progression is not a distinct substance it is just like the successive progression of weeds in a field which does not entail any reality apart from the weeds themselves Therefore we must indeed conclude that apart from the complex of the six consciousnesses there does exist the essence of this seminal consciousness as described above In support of this consciousness in the canon of the Tāmraparṇīya the Buddha established what is called the branching consciousness between two lifetimes The canon of the Mahāsāṃgika calls it the foundational consciousness What is the object and the mode of operation of this consciousness Its object and mode of operation cannot be identified Then why call it a consciousness In your theory there is another consciousness in states of the concentration of cessation object and mode of operation which are difficult to perceive The same applies here Within which of the appropriating aggregates is this consciousness included It is only reasonable to answer that it is included within the appropriating aggregate of consciousness If that is the case then how do you interpret the scriptural passage What is called the appropriating aggregate of consciousness This refers to the complex of the six consciousnesses Or again Conditioned by consciousness is name and form Consciousness refers to the six consciousnesses We must recognize that these scriptural have a special underlying intent It is just as a scripture says What is the aggregate of karmic formation This refers to the complex of the six volitions This does not mean that in the aggregate of karmic formation there are no other states however What is this underlying intent when speaks about the six and not about any other  It is asthe Bhagavat explained in the Explication of the Underlying Meaning Why would the foolish imagine it to be a self This has no beginning and lasts until the end of transmigration Having a subtle mode of operation it does not change However the supports objects modes of operation and varieties of the six consciousnesses are gross and easily understood since they are associated with the passions and the practices of countering  and since they establish the categories of defilement and purification In essence they are consciousness as result Therefore we infer that this seminal consciousness does exist Because teach only what is appropriate did not teach about this causal consciousness in the scriptures as it would have been just the opposite of he had just explained This was his underlying intent when he spoke about the six and not about the  As we have already explained in other canons he only spoke of the complex of the six consciousnesses as the branching consciousness Since the scriptures teach only as appropriate they are not opposed  Furthermore in each of the various canons untold scriptures are no longer extant as we know from the discussions in the Rules for Interpretation Therefore we cannot assert that the store consciousness has never been discussed in the scriptures clearly it is reasonable that it was If this is true then one person would have two consciousnesses active simultaneously the maturing consciousness and the other active consciousnesses What error is there in this If two consciousnesses are simultaneously active in the same one person it follows that they would simultaneously establish two sentient beings for those two consciousnesses would be active in different bodies There is no such defect  since these two consciousnesses evolve in mutual support as cause and result and are not disassociated from each other and because the maturing consciousness is permeated by the other active consciousnesses It is not the case then that these two consciousnesses are simultaneously active in different persons Therefore we avoid this fault in reasoning Can you not see that the seed and the result of that seed are different continuities In the world we do observe that in the case of blue lotus flowers the roots and stems have different continuities which lead to the production of fruit from seed This also applies to  Furthermore whether or not it can be observed by worldly seeing if you do not grant that the store consciousness exists you commit the logical errors outlined above Thus one must certainly admit that the store consciousness essentially exists apart from the six consciousnesses Why then not admit that an essential self exists as the support for the complex of the six consciousnesses What would be the characteristics of this self you propose which you describe as the support of the six consciousnesses If you admit that like the store consciousness this self continuously arises and perishes evolving according to conditions then how is it preferable to this consciousness We claim that the essence of the self is one and eternal forever unchanging How then can you say that is supported by the permeations of the consciousnesses that from sensation Now these permeations are the causes of the mental continuity thus permeated so that it evolves with its distinct abilities just as citron flowers permeated and dyed by purple lac engender enabling changes in their continuities If there were no permeation there would be no such evolution of different abilities How then would the many different permeations of former experience knowledge and attachment arise much later as differences in memory knowledge and attachment Moreover since the essence of the self is not altered either within or after emerging from unconscious states there would be no consciousness So how could a subsequent thinking consciousness and the other arise Moreover what power does the self have over the consciousnesses that would lead you to think that it is the support of those consciousnesses We say that the consciousnesses arise because of the self Yet if the essence of a self is forever unaltered how could the consciousnesses arise one after the other at all Why wouldnt they arise simultaneously and instantaneously We suggest that they must wait upon other conditions as aids for their arising How can you be sure then that the existent self functions apart from these other conditions in engendering  We say that the consciousnesses become active in reliance on the self As soon as things arise they immediately perish Indeed this is what their instability means How could they last and remain active Therefore we do not allow the theory that the essence of the self is the support of the complex of the six consciousnesses Moreover the theory that there is a self contradicts the scriptural authority that says that all things are without self Your opinion of a unique and eternal self is entirely without true reasoning Therefore we have demonstrated that special volitions simultaneously permeate the store consciousness and cause its continuity to differ in all its evolutions projecting future results either agreeable or disagreeable Vasubandhus Sautrāntika Theory on the Nature of Action If you do not grant that the two acts of body and speech exist do you not then contradict and slander the scripture on these two kinds of acts We neither contradict nor slander it We are able intelligently to interpret the scripture so that we commit no error in its regard How do you interpret this scripture without error We avoid the poison of your opinion We will explain in detail why the scripture speaks about three acts what is meant by an act of the body what the terms body and act mean and what the terms bodily action and mental action signify These are our questions in the Scripture Why then does the scripture only speak of the three acts of body speech and mind and not about sight and so forth The scripture talks about the three acts to show that these three actions comprehend the ten paths of action because its intent is to encourage those who fear there are too many things to be implemented In a similar fashion summarized the three trainings for Vṛjiputra Some thought that all acts are exclusively acts performed by the body not by either speech or mind So the scripture speaks about the three acts to show that these latter two are also to be performed The body denotes a special combination composed of all the basic great elements sensation Term Body A body is that which is brought about by accumulation since it is brought about by the accumulation of atoms composed of the great material elements Some think that the body denotes the accumulation of the various kinds of filth because it is supported on various impure things If this were true however then there would be no bodies among the gods Term Action An act signifies a deed performed with intention by an agent Bodily Action Bodily action denotes the volition that moves a body to perform a physical act There are three types of such volitions the volition to deliberate the volition to decide  and the volition to put into effect The volition that moves the body is itself called a bodily action because that volition can engender the wind element that projects the bodily continuity into a different place To be exact one would say the act that moves the body but here the term move has been omitted and the text only says the act of the body just as one might speak simply of an oil of strengthening in place of an oil that increases strength or simply of a dust wind instead of a wind that moves dust You should admit that in the path of the ten acts the first three acts are included in the acts of the body ie taking life taking what has not been given and illicit sexual activity How does the act of volition deserve the same name Because it is an act of volition that moves the body to commit murder theft or illicit activity That which is done through the power of volition to move the body is identified as an act of volition We commonly say that violent rebels burned down a village or that the fuel cooks the rice  Why then is volition called a path of action It is called an action because volition has activity It is called a path of action because it brings about the paths leading to good and bad destinies and then engenders those  Alternately the body that has been moved is the path of the action of volition because the three kinds of acts of volition function in reliance on the  Moreover killing stealing and debauchery are supported on the body because they arise from an act of volition Thus they are called bodily actions in accord with convention Yet in fact such actions are themselves neither good or bad it is by convention that one provisionally establishes their so that people in the world might cultivate positive volitions and avoid negative volitions through the teachings They are labeled as good or bad only through provisional designation If only acts of volition are good or bad then why does the Scripture on the Path of Action say It is because of the threefold of the body ie killing stealing and committing debauchery that a volition initiates action and then performs and increases it Because it is bad it engenders the result of suffering and the maturation of that suffering The meaning of this scriptural passage is that the act of volition which moves the body which employs the body as its means which is supported on the body and which takes killing stealing or debauchery as its object is the cause that influences the resultant maturation of suffering While they are called three kinds of bodily acts they are brought about by volition The other volitions are distinct from the volition that effects bodily communication and thus are called acts of mind because they are associated with mind and neither move the body nor emit speech If this is true why then does the scripture speak of two actions the act of volition and the act that has been willed Among the three types of acts explained above the first two kinds of volition are called acts of volition only the third volition is called an act that has been willed There is no error of contradicting the scripture here Verbal Action Speech denotesthe enunciation of words It is called speech because it manifests the meaning of what one wishes to express The volition that enunciates speech is named a verbal action Alternately speech is the support of syllables etc and it is called speech because it elucidates meaning by maintaining the syllables etc To be exact we would call it an act that enunciates speech but here the term enunciates has been omitted and simply calls it an act of speech The examples are as given above Mental Action Mind signifies consciousness It is called mind because it can deliberate and move toward the engendering of other and toward objects The volition that activates the will is called an act of willing because it brings about the willfulness to create various affairs either good or bad To be exact we should call it an act that effects will but omits the term effects and simply talks about an act of willing The examples are as explained above If the three kinds of acts denote only volition then in a distracted mind or in an unconscious state in which no mind occurs how could there be discipline or laxity Because the seeds permeated by virtue of that special volition are not lost we speak about discipline or laxity  We understand the special volition to communicate either the discipline or laxity that such a superior thought elicits since this volition permeates these two kinds of superior seeds As long as these two kinds of seeds have not been lost we provisionally establish the noncommunicative of good and bad discipline What do you mean when you say that one loses the seeds implanted by this special volition We mean that these are no longer active causes for engendering a volition either for renunciation or its opposite as they previously have been What can destroy these seeds We hold that a volition that engenders a communicative act causes the abandonment of either good or bad discipline as well as other causes that also lead to their loss Classification of Actions The reason does not talk about acts of sight etc is because it only treats the acts of effort of sentient beings not the acts carried out by all the sense spheres What are these acts of effort of sentient beings The separate abilities of the eye ear  The Buddha explained the three actions whose meaning is deep and subtle Relying on reason and doctrine I have finished this wondrous discourse I vow to transfer this merit to save the host of beings Influencing them to quickly realize pure enlightenment A Mahayana Demonstration on the Theme of Action One Fascicle This leisure and endowment which are so difficult to obtain have been acquired and they bring about the welfare of the world If one fails to take this favorable opportunity into consideration how could this occasion occur again Just as lightning illuminates the darkness of a cloudy night for an instant in the same way by the power of the Buddha occasionally peoples minds are momentarily inclined toward merit The Lords of Sages who have been contemplating for many eons have seen this alone as a blessing by which joy is easily increased and immeasurable multitudes of beings are rescued Those who long to overcome the abundant miseries of mundane existence those who wish to dispel the adversities of sentient beings and those who yearn to experience a myriad of joys should never forsake the spirit of awakening When the spirit of awakening has arisen in an instant a wretch who is bound in the prison of the cycle of existence is called a child of the Sugatas and becomes worthy of reverence in the worlds of gods and humans So firmly hold to the quicksilver elixir called the spirit of awakening which must be utterly transmuted Like the conflagration at the time of the destruction of the universe it consumes great ices in an instant The wise lord Maitreya taught its incalculable benefits to Sudhana the spirit of awakening and the spirit of aspiring for awakening and the spirit of venturing towards awakening Just as one perceives the difference between a person who yearns to travel and a traveler so do the learned recognize the corresponding difference between those two Although the result of the spirit of aspiring for awakening is great within the cycle of existence it is still not like the continual state of merit of the spirit of venturing From the time that one adopts that spirit with an irreversible attitude for the sake of liberating limitless sentient beings  From that moment on an uninterrupted stream of merit equal to the sky constantly arises even when one is asleep or distracted When then of a person who desires to remove the incomparable pain of every single being and endow them with immeasurable good qualities Who has even a mother or father with such altruism Would the gods sages or Brahmas have it If those beings have never before had that wish for their own sake even in their dreams how could they possibly have it for the sake of others How does this unprecedented and distinguished jewel whose desire for the benefit of others does not arise in others even for their own selfinterest come into existence How can one measure the merit of the jewel of the mind which is the seed of the worlds joy and is the remedy for the worlds suffering If reverence for the Buddhas is exceeded merely by an altruistic intention how much more so by striving for the complete happiness of all sentient beings With the very desire for happiness out of delusion they destroy their own happiness as if it were an enemy Where else is there such a friend Where else is there such merit Even one who repays a kind deed is praised somewhat so what should be said of a bodhisattva whose good deed is unsolicited The world honors as virtuous one who makes a gift to a few people even if it is merely a momentary and contemptuous donation of plain food and support for half a day What then of one who forever bestows to countless sentient beings the fulfillment of all yearnings which is inexhaustible until the end of beings as limitless as space The Lord declared One who brings forth an impure thought in his heart against a benefactor a child of the Jina will dwell in hells for as many eons as there were impure thoughts In order to adopt that jewel of the mind I make offerings to the Tathgatas to the stainless jewel of the sublime Dharma and to the children of the Buddhas who are oceans of excellent qualities As many flowers fruits and medicinal herbs as there are and as many jewels as there are in the world and clear and pleasant waters  Jeweled mountains forested regions and other delightful and solitary places vines shining with the ornaments of lovely flowers and trees with branches bowed with delicious fruit  Fragrances and incenses wish fulfilling trees jeweled trees lakes adorned with lotuses enchanting calls of wild geese in the worlds of gods and other celestials  Uncultivated crops planted crops and other things that ornament the venerable ones all these that are unowned and that extend throughout space  I bring to mind and offer to the foremost of sages together with their children May those worthy of precious gifts the greatly merciful ones compassionate towards me accept these from me Devoid of merit and destitute I have nothing else to offer Therefore may the Protectors whose concerns are for the welfare of others accept this by their own power for my sake Being free from fear of mundane existence due to your protection I shall serve sentient beings I shall completely transcend my earlier vices and henceforth I shall sin no more In sweetly fragrant bathing chambers whose beautiful pillars are radiant with jewels glowing canopies made with pearls and crystal floors transparent and sparkling  I bathe the Tathgatas and their children with many vases studded with superb jewels and filled with pleasing fragrant flowers and water to the accompaniment of songs and instrumental music I dry their bodies with scented immaculate exquisite clothes then I offer them beautifully colored and sweetly fragrant garments I adorn Samantabhadra Ajita Manjughosa Lokesvara and others with those divine soft delicate and colorful raiments and with the most precious of jewels Let my entrails ooze out and my head fall off but by no means shall I bow down to my enemies the mental afflictions But if the elephant of the mind is completely restrained by the rope of mindfulness then all perils vanish and complete wellbeing is obtained Tigers lions elephants bears snakes all enemies all guardians of hells  For the Propounder of the Truth said that all fears and immeasurable sufferings arise from the mind only Who diligently constructed the weapons in hell The sage declared that all of that has arisen from the evil mind so there is nothing else on the three worlds more formidable than the mind If the perfections of generosity makes the world free from poverty how is it possible that the Protectors of the past acquired it when the world is still impoverished today When the mind of renunciation is obtained that is considered the perfection of ethical discipline When the mind state of anger is slain all enemies are slain Where would there be leather enough to cover the entire world There earth is covered over merely with the leather of my sanders The omniscient One stated that all recitations and austerities even through performed for a long time are actually useless if the mind is on something else or dull Therefore I should well control and well guard my mind Just as those standing in the midst of boisterous people carefully guard their wounds so those standing in the midst of evil people should always guard their minds Fearing slight pain from a wound I guard it with great care Why dont I fearing the crushing of the mountains of the Samghata hell guard the wound of my mind Let my possessions freely vanish let my honor my body livelihood and everything else pass away Just as a person smitten by disease is unfit for any work so the mind lacking those two is not fit for any work What has been heard pondered and cultivated like water in a cracked jar does not remain in the memory of the mind that lacks introspection Even many people who have faith and extraordinary perseverance become defiled by vices on account of the fault of lacking introspection Even upon accumulating virtues those who have been robbed by the thief of nonintrospection who come after the loss of mindfulness enter miserable states of existence If it is gone it should be reinstated while recalling the anguish of hell Mindfulness easily arises for those of good fortune because of their association with a spiritual mentor and for those who are reverent on account of the instruction of a preceptor and because of their fear Meditating thus one should remain filled with a sense of propriety respect and fear and one should repeatedly think of the Buddhas in this way When mindfulness stands guard at the gate of the mind introspection arrives and once it has come it does not depart again First I should establish this mind in such a manner and I should always remain still as if without sense faculties like a piece of wood In this way the mad elephant of the mind should be watched diligently so that it is not loosed while tied to the great pillar of the thought of Dharma One should examine the mind in this waywhere is mine engagedso that it does not even for a moment leave the pole of concentration If useless crushing of the earth ripping of grass or drawing in the dirt takes place then fearfully recalling the teaching of the Tathgata one should instantly stop it When one intends to move or when one intends to speak one should first examine ones own mind and then act appropriately with composure When one sees ones own mind to be attached or repulsed then one should neither act nor speak but remain still like a piece of wood When my mind is haughty sarcastic full of conceit and arrogance ridiculing evasive and deceitful  When it is inclined to boast or when it is contemptuous of others abusive and irritable then I should remain still like a piece of wood When my mind seeks material gain honor and fame or when it seeks attendance and service then I will remain still like a piece of wood When my mind is averse to the interests of others and seeks my own self interest or when it wishes to speak out of a desire for an audience then I will remain still like a piece of wood Perceiving in this way that the mind is afflicted or engaged in fruitless activities the hero should always firmly control it by means of an antidote to that Resolute confidant steadfast respectful and courteous modest meek calm devoted to pleasing others  Always resorting to irreproachable things for the sake of myself and others I will maintain my mind free of pride like an apparition Remembering over and over again that after a long time the best of moments of leisure has been attained I will keep this mind unshakable like Sumeru One does not object when the body is dragged here and there by vultures coveting its flesh Mind why do you protect this body appropriating it as your own First with your own intellect peel off this sheath of skin and with the knife of wisdom loosen the flesh from the skeleton If you would not eat it as impure as it is and if you would not drink the blood not suck out the entrails then what will you do with the body Even though you protect it so merciless death will snatch the body away and give it to the vultures What will you do then Therefore mind upon giving the body its wages now serve your own needs because not everything earned by a laborer should be given to him One should not pound on the door and one should always delight in silence The crane the cat or the thief moving silently and covertly achieves its desired goal A sage should always move in such a way One should express ones appreciation for all good words Having seen someone engaging in virtue one should cheer him on with praises One should speak of others good qualities in their absence and relate them again with satisfaction and when ones own virtue is discussed one should consider it as appreciation for good qualities So I will enjoy the pleasure of satisfaction in good qualities diligently accomplished by others There will be no loss for me in this life and there will be great happiness in the hereafter But due to animosities there is the suffering of aversion and great misery in the hereafter In a soft and gentle voice one should speak sincere coherent words that have clear meaning and are agreeable pleasant to the ear and rooted in compassion Great blessing arises from continuous yearning for the fields of virtues and kindness and from an antidote with regard to those who are suffering Sharing with those who have fallen into miserable states of existence with those who have no protector and with mendicants one should eat moderately small proportions Except for the three robes one should give away everything For the sake of an insignificant benefit one should not harm the body that practices the sublime Dharma for only in this way can one quickly fulfill the hopes of sentient beings One should not teach the profound and vast Dharma to the disrespectful to a healthy person wearing a headdress to a person with an umbrella a stick or a weapon to one whose head is veiled  To those who are inadequate  nor to women in the absence of a man One should not expose a vessel of the vast Dharma to an inferior Dharma Flagrantly discarding a toothstick or spitting is undesirable and urinating or so forth in water or on land that is useable is contemptible One should not eat with a full mouth noisily or with the mouth wide open One should not sit with ones legs outstretched and one should not rub ones hands together One should not travel lie or sit alone with some one elses spouse One should not point out anything with ones finger but should respectfully show the way with ones whole right hand One should not call out to someone and wave ones arms when there is little urgency instead should snap ones fingers or the like The conduct of Bodhisattvas is described as immeasurable One should first surely engage in practices that purify the mind Three times by day and three times by night one should recite the Triskandha Never even at the cost of ones life should one forsake the spiritual friend who observes the vows of the Bodhisattva and who is well versed in the matters of the Mahayana One should learn from the Srisambhavavimoksa respectful behavior towards mentors This and other advice of the Buddha should be known through reciting the sutras Seeing what is forbidden and what is prescribed one should implement those teachings for the sake of protecting peoples minds What is the use of merely reading the words Will a sick person have any benefit merely by reading about medical treatments Anger destroys all the good conduct such as generosity and worshipping the Sugatas which has been acquired over thousands of eons The mind does not find peace nor does it enjoy pleasure and joy nor does it find sleep or fortitude when the thorn of hatred dwells in the heart Even dependents whom one rewards with wealth and honors wish to harm the master who is repugnant due to his anger In brief there is nothing that can make an angry person happy One who recognized hatred as the enemy knowing that it creates sufferings such as these and persistently overcomes it becomes happy in this world and in the other For loved ones and for oneself one does not desire suffering contempt verbal abuse or disgrace but for an enemy it is the opposite Happiness is obtained with great difficulty whereas suffering occurs easily Only through suffering is there release from the cycle of existence Do you not consider the pain of bugs gadflies and mosquitoes of thirst and hunger and the irritation of a serious rash and the like as insignificant Cold heat rain wind traveling illness captivity and beatings should not induce a sense of fragility Otherwise the distress becomes greater Courageous victors are dismissive of all suffering and they conquer such enemies as hatred The rest just kill corpses Suffering has another quality since arrogance diminishes because of despair and ones feels compassion for beings in the cycle of existence fear and sin and a yearning for the Jina Just as sharp pain arises although one does not desire it so anger forcibly arises although one does not desire it A person does not intentionally become angry thinking I shall get angry nor does anger originate thinking I shall arise  All offences and vices of various kinds arise under the influence of conditions and they do not arise independently An assemblage of conditions does not have the intention I shall produce nor does that which is produced have the intention I shall be produced  That which is regarded as the Primal Substance and that which is construed as the Self do not originate thinking I shall come into being  Since it has not arisen how could it wish to come into existence Thus everything is dependent on something else and even that on which something is dependent is not autonomous If all beings would find fulfillment according to their own wishes then no one would suffer for no one wishes to suffer If you do not even have compassion toward those who intoxicated by mental afflictions commit suicide then why does anger arise If inflicting harm on others is the nature of the foolish then my anger toward them is as inappropriate as it would be toward fire which has the nature of burning If this fault is advantageous and if sentient beings are good by nature then anger toward them is as inappropriate as it would be toward pungent smoke in the sky Disregarding the principle of cause such as a stick and the like if I become angry with the one who impels it then it is better if I hate hatred because that person is also impelled by hatred In the past I too have inflicted such pain on sentient beings therefore I who have caused harm to sentient beings deserve that in return When suffering emerges due to my own fault why should I be angry with anyone else Just as the forest of razor leaves and the birds of hell are brought into existence by my actions so is this Those who hurt me are impelled by my actions as a result of which they will go to the infernal realms On account of me they enter infernal realms with long lasting agonies If there is virtue in my intention I will not enter the infernal realms If I protect myself what will happen to them here If I were to retaliate they would not be protected and my conduct would be impaired It is better that I die today than have a long corrupt life For even after living a long time I shall have the suffering of death One person wakes up after enjoying a hundred years of pleasure in sleep and another person wakes up after being happy for a moment Even though I have acquired many possessions and have enjoyed pleasures for a long time I shall depart empty handed and naked as if I had been robbed If you think that your hatred toward one who disparages you is because he dries away sentient beings why does your anger not arise also when others are defamed in the same way You have patience toward those who are unkind because their ungracious behavior is directed toward someone else but you do not have patience toward one who disparages you when he is subject to the arising of mental afflictions My hatred toward those who revile and violate images stupas and the sublime Dharma is wrong because the Buddhas and the like are free of distress This distress is felt in a sentient being so endure that pain Why did I previously act in such a way that now I am harmed by others Realizing this I shall strive for virtues in such a way that all will have loving thoughts toward each other When fire spreads from one burning house to another one should bundle up the straw and the like take it out and discard it Likewise when the mind burns with the fire of hatred due to attachment one should immediately cast it aside because of the fear of burning the body of merit If one who is to be executed has his hand amputated and is released is this unfortunate If a person is freed from hell by human suffering is this unfortunate If one who is unable to endure even this slight suffering of the present then why does one not ward off anger which is the cause of pain in hell Thus solely due to anger I have brought myself into hells thousands of times and I have not brought about benefit for myself or others Only delight in suffering that eliminates the suffering of the world is appropriate here If others find pleasure and joy in praising the abundance of someones good qualities why O mind do you not praise it and delight in this way too This joy from your rejoicing is a blameless source of happiness If you do not like it thinking that it is a pleasure for that person only then if you were to stop giving wages and the like your seen and unseen reward would be destroyed Upon generating the Spirit of Awakening out of the desire for the happiness of all sentient beings why are you angry at sentient beings now that they have found happiness themselves If you desire sentient beings Buddhahood which is worshipped in the three worlds then why are you burned up when you see them slightly honored How can one who becomes angry at others prosperity have the Spirit of Awakening If someone does not receive that gift and if it remains in the house of the benefactor then you do not have it anyway Why would you have him ward off merits kind people and his own good qualities Let him not accept when he is being given something At the loss of praise and fame my own mind appears to me just like a child who wails in distress when its sandcastle is destroyed Why am I am unhappy when others are made happy through their favor for some one else They stir up jealousy toward gifted people and anger at their success How can I hate those who as if due to the Buddhas blessing block the gate as I seek to enter suffering It is wrong to feel anger toward someone thinking that person impedes my merit If on account of my own fault I do not practice patience here then I myself have created an obstacle when grounds for merit have been presented Beggars are easy to meet in the world but malefactors are difficult to find for no one will wrong me when I do no wrong Therefore since my adversary assists me in my Bodhisattva way of life I should long for him like a treasure discovered in the house and acquired without effort It should be given to him first for patience is caused by him Thus patience arises only in dependence on that evil intention so he alone is the cause of my patience The sage has declared that the field of sentient beings is the field of the Jinas because many have reached the highest fulfillment by honoring them As the attainment of the Buddhas qualities is equally due to sentient beings and the Jinas how is it that I do not respect sentient beings as I do the Jinas Their greatness is not in terms of their intention but in terms of the result itself The greatness of sentient beings is comparable to that so they are equal Therefore sentient beings are equal to the Jinas in their share in the acquisition of the qualities of the Buddha but none of them are equal to the Buddhas who are oceans of good qualities with endless portions If even a minute good quality of those who are a unique collection of the essence of good qualities is found in someone not even the three worlds would be enough to honor that one Because sentient beings have some portion of the superb qualities of the Buddha it is right to honor sentient beings for just that similarity Why do I generate pride and not act like a servant toward those masters for whose sake my Lords have no regard for their own selves The sages are delighted with their joy and they are not pleased if they are harmed by pleasing them all the sages are overjoyed and to injure them is to injure the sages Therefore whatever displeasure I have brought to all the great compassionate ones by harming sentient beings I confess that sin today In order to please the Tathgatas today with my entire being I place myself in the service of the world When some kings man tyrannized the populace the farsighted among them cannot retaliate Because that man is not alone and his power is the kings power So one should not disparage any weak person who has done wrong  Since his power is the guardians of hell and the Compassionate Ones Therefore one should please sentient beings just as a servant would a hottempered king What could an angry king do that would equal the anguish of hell experienced as a result of inflicting mental pain on sentient beings What could a gratified king give that would equal Buddhahood experienced as a result of delighting sentient beings Let alone future Buddhahood do you not see that in this life fortune fame and happiness ensue from pleasing sentient beings While transmigrating a patient person with beauty health charisma and so forth achieves longevity and the abundant joy of a Cakravati What is zeal It is spiritual sloth clinging to the reprehensible apathy and selfcontempt Spiritual sloth arises from indolence indulging in pleasures sleep and craving for lounging around due to ones apathy toward the miseries of the cycle of existence You even fall asleep like a buffalo among butchers When Yama watches you and your path is blocked on all sides how can you enjoy eating and how can you sleep and have sexual intercourse Seeing despondent relatives with their eyes swollen and red with tears on their faces from the impact of their grief and the faces of the messengers of Yama  Tormented by the recollection of your own vices hearing the sounds of hell and befouling your body with excrement out of fear what will you do when you are so terrified Realizing I am like a live fish your fear is appropriate now How much more when you have committed vices and face the intense suffering of hell So delicate one you burn even when touched by hot water Upon performing deeds leading to hell how will you remain at ease O fool there is no time for sleep for this boat is hard to catch again Forsaking the supreme joy of Dharma which is an endless stream of joy how can you delight in frivolity and jokes which are two causes of suffering The absence of apathy the array of abilities such as prudence selfcontrol equality between oneself and others and exchange of oneself for others  Even those who were gadflies mosquitoes bees and worms attain supreme Awakening which is difficult to attain through the power of their effort  Human by birth and capable of knowing what is beneficial and what is not why could I not attain Awakening as long as I do not forsake the guidance of the Omniscient One If I fear thinking I shall have to sacrifice my arms legs and the like I may confuse the important with the insignificant due to my lack of discrimination For countless millions of eons I shall be cut pierced burned and split open many times but awakening will not occur However this limited suffering of mine which yields perfect Awakening is like the suffering of extraction when removing the pain of an imbedded splinter All physicians cure with unpleasant treatments Therefore to destroy a multitude of pains a slight one must be endured One does it gradually so that later one can give away even ones own flesh When insight arises that ones own flesh is like the vegetable then what difficulty is there in giving away ones own flesh and bone On account of abandoning vices one does not suffer and on account of being wise one does not become troubled in mind for mental pain is due to false conceptions and bodily pain is due to sinful actions The body is well on account of merit and the mind is joyful on account of wisdom What can afflict a compassionate one who stays in the cycle of existence for the sake of others Extinguishing previous vices and accumulating oceans of merit owing to the power of the Spirit of Awakening alone one moves ahead of the Sravakas The powers of aspiration steadfastness delight and letting go are for the sake of accomplishing the benefit of sentient beings Uprooting its opposite in this way one should strive to increase ones zeal with the powers of aspiration selfconfidence delight letting go dedication and determination I must eliminate immeasurable faults for myself and for others While the eradication of every single fault may take myriads of eons  While it takes oceans of eons to eliminate each of those faults if I do not see even a fraction of a beginning of the elimination of faults why does my heart not burst as I am a locus of immeasurable suffering I have not found joy in great festivals and offerings to the Blessed One I have not granted fearlessness to the frightened nor have I comforted the distressed I became a spear in the womb just for my mother to suffer Due to my former lack of aspiration for Dharma such a disaster has befallen me now Miseries depressions various fears and impediments to their desires befall those who do evil By performing an intended virtue wherever one goes one will be honored with the resultant benefits of ones merit But wherever the desire for happiness of the evildoers goes their vices destroy it with weapons of sufferings On account of their virtues the Children of the Sugata who dwell in the hearts of spacious fragrant and cool lotuses whose splendor is enhanced with the nourishment of the sweet voice of the Jina and whose handsome bodies emerge from the Lotuses Blossomed by the rays of the Sage are born in the presence of the Sugata On account of non virtues one cries out in distress ones entire skin is ripped away by the agents of Yama ones body is immersed into copper melted by the heat of fire pieces of ones flesh are cut off by hundreds of strokes of blazing spears and swords and one repeatedly falls on intensely heated iron grounds Therefore one should nurture an aspiration for virtue cultivating it with reverence Once one has begun one should cultivate self confidence according to the method discussed in the Vajradhvaja Sutra After first examining ones means one should either begin or not begin This habit continues even in another life and due to that sin suffering increases Another opportunity for action is lost and the task is not accomplished This world overwhelmed by mental afflictions is incapable of accomplishing its own selfinterest Therefore I must do it for them I am not as incapable as the world is Why should someone else do inferior work while I stand by When one is made powerless by despondency adversities are easily caused but one who is uplifted and zealous is invincible even in the face of great adversities Abiding amidst a multitude of mental afflictions one should be vigorous in a thousand and unconquerable by the hosts of mental afflictions like a lion by a herd of deer An action is performed for the sake of happiness and yet happiness may or may not occur In the cycle of existence there is no satisfaction in sensual desires which are like honey on a razors edge One should ward off the blows of mental afflictions and severely attack them as if engaged in a swordcombat with a trained enemy Just like one would quickly fearfully pick up a dropped sword so one should pick up the dropped sword of mindfulness while bearing the hells in mind Just as a poison spreads throughout the body once it has reached the blood so does a fault spread throughout the mind once it has reached a vulnerable spot A practitioner should be like someone carrying a jar of oil while under the scrutiny of swordsmen careful of stumbling out of fear of death Therefore just as one quickly jumps up when a snake creeps into ones lap so should one swiftly counteract the advent of drowsiness and sloth Bringing to mind the teaching on conscientiousness one should arouse oneself so that one is always prepared before encountering a task Just as cotton is swayed in the direction of the winds coming and going so should one surrender oneself to ones enthusiasm and in this way ones supernormal powers will thrive For what impermanent person who will not see his loved ones again in thousands of births is it appropriate to be attached to impermanent things Failing to see them one does not find joy nor does one abide in meditative concentration Even upon seeing them one does not become satisfied but is tormented by strong desire just as before What is gained from association with fools One moment they are friends and the next moment they are enemies On an occasion for being pleased they become angry Ordinary people are difficult to gratify When given good advice they become angry and they turn me away from good advice Between one fool and another something nonvirtuous is inevitable such as glorification of ones own self speaking ill of others and conversation about the pleasures of the cycle of existence I shall happily live alone with a nonafflicted mind One should flee far from a fool One should gratify the encountered person with pleasantries not with the intention of intimacy but in the manner of a kind and impartial person Taking only what benefits Dharma like a bee taking nectar from a flower I shall live everywhere without acquaintance as if I had not existed before If others despise me why should I rejoice when praised If others praise me why should I be despondent when reviled How can those whose company is by nature suffering bring forth joy The Tathgatas have said that a fool is no ones friend because the affection of a fool does not arise without selfinterest Love due to selfinterest is love for ones own sake just as distress at the loss of possessions is occasioned by the loss of pleasures When shall I dwell with a paltry alms bowl and so on in clothing wanted by no one living fearlessly even without concealing my body Until one his hoisted by four men and mourned by the world one should retire to the forest Without intimacy and without conflict one dwells in physical solitude and when one is counted as if already dead no one grieves when one actually dies There is on one to inflict grief and harm nor is there any one to distract one from the recollection of the Buddha and so forth In this world and the next sensuous desires create troubles such as murder imprisonment and dismemberment in this life and hell and so forth in the next She for whom you have supplicated male and female messengers many times and for whose sake you have not considered the cost of either vice nor disgrace  Since you guarded her face from the gaze of others why do you O avaricious one not guard it as it is being eaten You fear a skeleton that has been seen like this even though it does not move Taking no delight in cotton pillows that are soft to the touch the lustful who are deluded with respect to filth say the body does not emit a foul odor The lustful degraded and deluded have distain for soft cotton saying It cant engage in intercourse  Casting aside a fresh lotus opening under the rays of the cloudless sun why do you with your filthcraving mind take delight in a container of muck If you do not have passion for what is impure why do you embrace someone else who is a seed or arisen from a field of filth and nourished by it You do not desire a dirty worm originating from filth because it is small but you desire a body that consists of much filth and also born from filth Even the ground is considered impure when savory foods such as camphor or boiled rice and condiments are spat out or vomited from the mouth If you do not trust that this is filth even though it is obvious look at other bodies too repugnant and discarded in the charnel ground Knowing that great fear arises when the skin is torn off how can you have attraction to that same thing again Although applied to the body this fragrance is from sandalwood and not from anything else Why are you attracted to someone by the fragrance that belongs to something else If the naked body containing the slime of filth is frightening in its natural condition with its long hair and nails and stained yellowish teeth  If you are repelled upon seeing just skeletons in a charnel ground are you attracted to a village which is a charnel ground crowded with animated skeletons A child cannot increase its wealth so with what is one happy when one is a youth Deluded by sensual desires they sell themselves for that which they never acquire In order to make a livelihood they enter war that endangers their lives and they become servants for the sake of their selfrespect They are seen being burned and slain with daggers Thus sensualists have much distress and little enjoyment like a beast that has hold of a bit of grass while pulling a wagon Sensual gratification is definitely transient and it casts one down to hell and so forth and for no great end one is constantly weary With even a billionth part of that diligence there can be Buddhahood Sensualists have suffering greater than the suffering of the Path but they have no Awakening If one considers the suffering of the hells and so on weapons poison fire precipices and enemies do not compare to sensual desires Becoming disillusioned with sensual desires in that way generate delight in solitude in the peaceful forest devoid of strive and annoyances The fortunate pondering on how to benefit others roam about caressed by silent gentle forest breezes and cooled by the sandalwood rays of the moon on the lovely mansions of vast boulders In an empty hut at the foot of a tree or in a cave one remains as long as one desires and casting off the suffering of guarding ones possessions one lives light heartedly without a care Living freely without attachment and not tied by anyone one savors the joy of contentment that is difficult even for a king to find After meditating on the advantages of solitude in this and other ways having ones discursive thoughts calmed one should cultivate the spirit of awakening One should first earnestly meditate on the equality of oneself and others in this way All equally experience suffering and happiness and I must protect them as I do myself  Likewise different beings with their joys and sorrows are all equal like my self in their yearning for happiness When happiness is equally dear to others and myself then what is so special about me that I strive after happiness for myself alone When fear and suffering are equally abhorrent to others and myself then what is so special about me that I protect myself but not others  If I do not protect them because I am not afflicted by their suffering why do I protect my body from the suffering of a future body which is not my pain The notion that I will experience that is mistaken for the one who has died is born elsewhere and is someone else If one thinks a persons suffering should be warded off by himself since pain of the foot is not of the hand why should the one take care of the other The continuum of consciousness like a series and the aggregation of constituents like an army and such are unreal much suffering arises from compassion so why should one force it to arise After seeing the suffering of the world how can this suffering from compassion be considered great If the suffering of many disappears because of the suffering of one then a compassionate person should induce that suffering for his own sake and for the sake of others Thus one whose mind stream is accustomed to meditation and who delights in calming the suffering of others enters into Avichi Hell like a swan into a pool of Lotuses When sentient beings are liberated they have oceans of joy Why do I not also consider anothers body as myself in the same way the otherness if my own body is not difficult to determine Acknowledging oneself as faultridden and others as oceans of virtues one should contemplate renouncing ones selfidentity and accepting others Just as the hands and the like are cherished because they are members of the body why are the embodied beings not cherished in the same way for they are the members of the world Just as the notion of a self with regard to ones own body which has no personal existence is due to habitation will the identity of ones self with others not arise in the same way Therefore just as you protect yourself from even minor disparagement cultivate a spirit of protection and a spirit of compassion toward the world One who kills ones parents and steals the property of The Three Jewels for the sake of profit and respect will become fuel in the Avichi Hell if I give it away what shall I enjoy This is a fiendish state Upon harming another for ones own sake one is burnt in hells and the like but upon afflicting oneself for the sake of others one has success in everything The desire for selfaggrandizement leads to a miserable state of existence low status and stupidity By ordering another around for ones own sake one experiences the position of a servant and the like but by ordering oneself around for the sake of others one experiences the position of a master and the like All those who are unhappy in the world are so as a result of their desire for their own happiness All those who are happy in the world are so as a result of their desire for the happiness of others One who does not exchange his own happiness for the suffering of others surely does not achieve Buddhahood Not to mention the next life even in this life a desired goal of a servant who does not do his work and of a master who does not pay out the wages cannot be accomplished Forsaking the generation of mutual happiness and the felicity of present and future happiness deluded people take on tremendous suffering because of harming one another If all the harm fear and suffering in the world occur due to grasping onto the self what use is that great demon to me Without forsaking ones own self one cannot avoid suffering just as without avoiding the fire one cannot avoid being burned Therefore in order to alleviate my own suffering and to alleviate the suffering of others I give myself up to others and I accept others as my own self Therefore becoming subservient to sentient beings and snatching away whatever you see on this body use it for the well being of others I do chores while he lives at ease It seems he is great in the world while I am debased lacking in good qualities The degeneration of my ethical discipline views and so on is due to the power of mental afflictions and not my own free will You must heal me as well as you can and I shall accept the pain He has no compassion for beings who dwell in the jaws of the beast of prey of miserable states of existence Were my good qualities to become apparent to everyone in the world then no one would ever even hear of his good qualities Also it seems this wretched one is competing with me does he have this much learning wisdom beauty noble ancestry and wealth Hearing my own good qualities being praised everywhere in this way thrilled with my hair standing on end I shall enjoy the delight of happiness We should deprive him of happiness and always yoke him to our anguish We all have been afflicted in the cycle of existence hundreds of times by him O mind countless eons have passed as you have yearned to accomplish your own selfinterest but with such great toil you have gained only suffering If you had carried out this task earlier this state deprived of the perfection and bliss of the Buddha would not have occurred Living as one who belongs to others and snatching away whatever you see on this body practice what is beneficial to others I am well while the other is miserable the other is lowly while I am exalted the other works while I do not Deprive yourself of happiness and expose yourself to the suffering of others Let your own reputation be outshone by exalting the reputation of others and like the least of servants commit yourself to everyones welfare This one of defective nature should not be praised for adventitious good qualities Act so that no one may know of this ones good qualities Where will you go I can see you and I shall annihilate all your vanities That was another earlier time when I was ruined by you Still I have my own self interest Unconcerned as you are with much distress I have sold you to others If you need protection it is inappropriate to protect yourself When it has degenerated in this way not even this earth can completely fulfill its desire Who then will satisfy its desire For one who desires the impossible mental affliction and disappointment arise but for one who is free of expectations there is unblemished prosperity Of what use is this contrivance to me whether it is dead or alive What difference is there between this and a clump of soil and the like Alas you are not eliminating the grasping onto the I  Whether it is nurtured by me or eaten by vultures it feels neither affection nor aversion so why am I so fond of it If the body which has no anger due to abuse or satisfaction due to praise is unconscious then for whom am I exerting myself Therefore with indifference I have given up my body for the benefit of the world Hence although it has many faults I keep it as an instrument for that task Therefore withdrawing the mind from evil ways I shall always concentrate it on its own meditative object to eliminate obscurations The Sage taught this entire system for the sake of wisdom Even the objects of direct perception such as form and the like are established by consensus and not by verifying cognition If a sentient being is like an illusion why is he reborn again after he dies Even an illusion lasts for as long as the collection of its conditions If consciousness does not exist then there is no sin in killing an illusionary person Diverse illusions originate on account of diverse conditions Nowhere does a single condition have the ability to produce everything When its conditions are not destroyed an illusion does not cease either Due to a discontinuity of its conditions it does not originate even conventionally Even if it is an aspect of the mind itself in reality it exists as something different Yogacarin If the mind itself is an illusion then what is perceived by what Madhyamika The Protector of the World stated that the mind does not perceive the mind Just as a sword cannot cut itself so it is with the mind Yogacarin Madhyamika A lamp does not illuminate itself for it is not concealed by darkness A blue object does not require something else for its blueness as does a crystal It is said that a lamp illuminates once this is cognized with awareness If no one perceives whether the mind is luminous or not then there is no point in discussing it like the beauty of a barren womans daughter Recollection comes from its relation to something else that was experienced like a rats poison A Jar seen due to the application of a magical ointment is not the ointment itself The cycle of existence has its basis in reality or else it would be like space If the mind were free from any apprehended object then all beings would be Tathgatas Thus what good is gained by speculating that only the mind exists Even when the similarity to illusion is recognized how does a mental affliction cease since lust for an illusory woman arises even in the mind of the one who created her Because her creators imprints of mental afflictions toward objects of knowledge have not been eliminated when seeing her his imprint of emptiness is weak Just as a wish fulfilling gem or a wish granting tree satisfies desires so the image of the Jina is seen because of his vow and his disciples When a charmer against poison dies after completing a pillar that pillar neutralizes poisons and the like even for a long time after his death Likewise the pillar of the Jina completed with accordance with the Bodhisattva way of life accomplishes all tasks even when the bodhisattva has passed into Nirvana According to the scriptures effects of worship do exist whether conventionally or ultimately in the same way that worship offered to the true Buddha is said to be fruitful If your objection is that liberation is due to the elimination of mental afflictions then it should occur immediately afterward If you think that as long as there is no craving there is no grasping onto rebirth why could their craving even though free of mental afflictions not exist as delusion Craving has its cause in feeling and they have feeling The mind that has mental objects has to dwell on one thing or another Without emptiness the mind is constrained and arises again as in noncognitive meditative equipoise If you acknowledge the utterances that correspond to the sutras as the words of the Buddha why do you not respect the Mahayana which for the most part is similar to your sutras Remaining in the cycle of existence for the sake of those suffering due to delusion is achieved through freedom from attachment and fear Thus no refutation is possible with regard to emptiness so one should meditate on emptiness without hesitation Since emptiness is the antidote to the darkness of afflictive and cognitive obstructions how is it that one desiring omniscience does not promptly meditate on it Let fear arise towards something that produces suffering Emptiness pacifies suffering So why does fear of it arise If there were something called I fear could come from anywhere If there is no I whose fear would there be Teeth hair and nails are not I nor am I bone blood mucus phlegm puss or lymph Bodily oil is not I nor are sweat fat or entrails the cavity of the entrails is not I nor is excrement or urine Flesh is not I nor are sinews heat or wind Bodily apertures are not I nor in any way are the six consciousnesses If the awareness of sound were I then sound would always be apprehended But without an object of awareness what does it cognize on account of which is called awareness If that which is not cognizant were awareness a piece of wood would be awareness Therefore it is certain there is no awareness in the absence of its object Why does that which cognizes form not hear it as well How can something that is of the nature of the apprehension of sound be the apprehension of form One person may be considered as a father and a son but not in terms of ultimate reality  The past or future mind is not I since it does not exist If the mind were I then when it had vanished the I would not exist anymore Just as the trunk of a plantain tree is nothing when cut into pieces in the same way the I is nonexistence when sought analytically If no sentient being exists for whom is there compassion For one who is imagined through delusion which is accepted for the sake of the task However grasping onto the I which is a cause of suffering increases because of the delusion with regard to the self If the body were located in its entirety in the hands and other limbs there would be just as many bodies as there are hands and so forth The body is neither inside nor outside How can the body be in the hands and other limbs It is not separate from the hands and the like As long as a collection of conditions lasts the body appears like a person In the same way since it is an assemblage of toes which one would be a foot What discerning person would be attached to form which is just like a dream Since the body does not exist then who is a woman and who is a man If suffering truly exists why does it not oppress the joyful If delicacies and the like are a pleasure why do they not please someone struck by grief and so forth If it is not experienced because it is overpowered by something more intense how can that which is not of the nature of experience be a feeling Surely there is suffering in its subtle state while its gross state is removed If suffering does not arise when the conditions for its opposite have arisen does it not follow that a feeling is a false notion created by conceptual fabrication In that case what would be in contact with what One Atom cannot penetrate another because it is without empty space and is of the same size as the other It is impossible for consciousness which has no form to have contact nor is it possible for a composite because it is not a truly existent thing as investigated earlier Thus when there is no contact how can feeling arise If there is no one to experience feeling and if feeling does not exist then after understanding this situation why oh craving are you not shattered The mind that has a dreamlike and illusionlike nature sees and touches What happen earlier is remembered but not experienced by what arises later It does not experience itself nor is it experienced by something else The mind is not located in the sense facilities or in form and other senseobjects or in between them The mind is also not found inside or outside or anywhere else If cognition is prior to the object of cognition in dependence on what does it arise If cognition is simultaneous with the object of cognition in dependence on what does it arise In this way it is ascertained that no phenomenon comes into existence Objection If conventional truth does not exist how can there be the two truths The two conception and the conceived are mutually dependent just as every analysis is expressed by referring to what is commonly known A person for whom these two are truly existent is in an extremely shaky position If an object exists because of the power of cognition how does one arrive at the true existence of cognition Objection If there is no father without a son how can there be a son Madhyamika Just as in the absence of a son there is no father in the same way these two do not exist Objection A sprout arises from a seed Why does cognition that arises from the object of cognition not ascertain the true existence of that object of cognition It is ascertained that a seed exists owing to a cognition that is not the same as a sprout How is the existence of a cognition cognized since the object of cognition is ascertained by that cognition People observe every cause through direct perception since the components of a lotus such as the stalk and so forth are produced by a variety of causes Because of the power of the preceding causes If he is the elements so be it but then why tussle over a mere name Happiness and suffering are the result of action Say then what did he create If the cause has no beginning how can its effect have a beginning So on what would he depend If Isvara depends on a collection of conditions then again he is not the cause It is implausible that a single thing has three natures so it does not exist Likewise he universal constituents do not exist since they would each be comprised of three constituents Happiness and other feelings may be due to things such as a cloth but in their absence there would be no happiness and so on If the manifestation of happiness truly exists why is the feeling not apprehended If its gross state is not different from happiness then the impermanence of happiness is obvious Even ordinary people know that Why do they not see it In reality the emptiness of phenomena is not ascertained through that verifying cognition Therefore if a thing is false its nonexistence is clearly false Thus when in a dream a son has died the thought he does not exist prevents the arising of the thought of his existence and that too is false Therefore with this analysis nothing exists without a cause nor is it contained in its individual or combined causal conditions As for that which is created by illusion and that which is created by causes where do they come from and where do they go How can there be true existence in something artificial like a reflection which is perceived only in conjunction with something else and not in its absence If something does not exist what is the need for a cause Something that does not exist will not be subject to change even with millions of causes How can something in that state be existent What else can come into existence For that nonexistent thing will not disappear as long as the existent thing is not produced When a nonexistent thing has not disappeared there is no opportunity for the existent thing An existent thing does not does not become nonexistent since it would follow that it would be of two natures Thus there is neither cessation nor coming into existence at any time Therefore this entire world does not arise or cease States of existence are like dreams upon analysis they are similar to plantain trees In reality there is no difference between those who have attained Nirvana and those who have not When all phenomena are empty in this way what can be gained and what can be lost What is pleasant and what is unpleasant When investigated in its own nature what is craving and for what is craving Who will come into existence and who has come into existence who is a relative and who is a friend of whom Seeking their own happiness with evil deeds they live miserably with grief troubles despair and cutting and stabbing each other After repeatedly entering the fortunate states of existence and becoming accustomed to pleasure again and again they die and fall into the miserable states of existence in which there is long and intense anguish There are incomparable violent boundless oceans of suffering Strength is scanty there and the life span is short there as well There too in practices for long life and health in hunger fatigue and weariness in sleep and calamities and in unprofitable associations with fools  There too Mara tries to throw them into very wretched states There because of the abundance of wrong paths doubt is difficult to overcome Ah there should be a great pity for those adrift in the flood of suffering who although miserable in this way do not recognize their wretched situation Just like one who repeatedly immerses himself in water but must enter fire again and again so they consider themselves fortunate although they are extremely miserable As they live like this pretending that they are not subject to aging and death terrible calamities come with death the foremost of them Thus when might I bring relief to those tormented by the fire of suffering with the requisites of happiness springing forth from the clouds of my merit May all sentient beings be graced with the bodhisattva way of life by the virtue I have obtained while reflecting on the A Guide To The Bodhisattva Way of Life  Through my merit may all those in all directions who are afflicted by bodily and mental sufferings obtain oceans of joy and contentment As many hells as there are in the world may beings in them delight in the joys of contentment in Sukhavati May those afflicted with cold find warmth May those oppressed by heat be cooled by oceans of water springing from the great clouds of the Bodhisattvas May the forest of sword leaves become for them the splendor of a pleasure grove and may the swordlike Salmali trees grow as wishfulfilling trees May the regions of hell become vast ponds of delight fragrant with lotuses beautiful and pleasing with the cries of white geese wild ducks ruddy geese and swans May the burning ground become a crystal marble floor and may the mountains of The Crushing Hell become temples of worship filled with Sugatas May the rain of burning coal lava and daggers from now on become a rain of flowers and may mutual battling with weapons now become a playful flower fight By the power of my virtue may those whose flesh has completely fallen off whose skeletons are of the color of a white jasmine flower and who are immersed in the river Vaitarani whose water is like fire attain celestial bodies and dwell with goddesses by the river Manakini May the horrifying agents of Yama crows and vultures suddenly watch here in fear A rain of Lotuses falls mixed with fragrant waters It is seen to extinguish the unceasing fires of the hells By his power every adversity is removed streams of delight flow the Spirit of Awakening is born as is compassion the mother of protection of all beings Behold him whose LotusFeet are worshipped with tiaras of hundreds of gods whose eyes are moist with compassion on whose head a stream of diverse flowers rains down with his delightful summer palaces celebrated by thousands of goddesses singing hymns of praise Upon seeing Manjughosa before them may the beings of the hells immediately cheer May the Pretas always be satiated bathed and refreshed by streams of milk pouring from the hand of noble Avalokiteshvara May the blind always see forms and may the deaf hear May pregnant women give birth without pains as did Mayadevi May the fearful become fearless and those struck with grief find joy May the despondent become resolute and free of trepidation May the ill have good health May they be freed from every bondage May the weak become strong and have affectionate hearts for one another May those who journey by boat succeed as they desire May they safely reach the shore and rejoice with their relatives May those who find themselves on wrong paths in dreary forests come upon the company of fellow travelers and without fatigue may they journey without fear of bandits tigers and the like May deities protect the dull the insane the deranged the helpless the young and the elderly and those in danger from sickness the wilderness and so on May they be free from all lack of leisure may they be endowed with faith wisdom and compassion may they be possessed of stature and good conduct and may they always remember their former lives Through this merit of mine may all beings without exception abstain from every vice and always engage in virtue Not lacking the Spirit of Awakening devoted to the Bodhisattva way of life embraced by the Buddhas and free of the deeds of Maras  May all quarters of the world be delightful with gardens of wish fulfilling trees filled with the Buddhas and the Children of the Buddhas and be enchanting with the sound of Dharma May the ground everywhere be free from stones and rocks smooth like the palm of the hand soft and made of Lapis Lazuli May the great assemblages of Bodhisattvas sit on all sides May they beautify the earth with their own resplendence May all beings unceasingly hear the sound of Dharma from the birds from every tree from the rays of light and from the sky May they always encounter the Buddhas and the Children of the Buddhas May they worship the Spiritual Mentor of the world with endless clouds of offerings May a god send rain in time and may there be an abundance of crops May the populace be prosperous and may the king be righteous May no sentient being be unhappy sinful ill neglected or despised and may no one be despondent May there always be harmony among the Sangha and may the purpose of the Sangha be accomplished May monks who wish to practice find solitude May they meditate with their minds agile and free of all distractions May those who are of poor ethical discipline be disgusted and become constantly intent on the extinction of their vices May all sentient beings worship all the Buddhas in many ways May they be exceedingly joyful with the inconceivable bliss of the Buddhas May the Bodhisattvas wishes for the welfare of the world be fulfilled and whatever the protectors intend for sentient beings may that be accomplished May the Pratyekabuddhas and Sravakas be happy always worshipped by the lofty gods asuras and humans When I wish to see or ask something may I see the Protector Manjunatha himself without any impediment May my way of life be life be like that of Manjusri who lives to accomplish the benefit of all sentient beings throughout the ten directions For as long as space endures and for as long as the world lasts may I live dispelling the miseries of the world Whatever suffering there is for the world may it all ripen upon me May the world find happiness through all the virtues of the Bodhisattvas The Awakening Of Faith In Mahayana By Ashvaghosha Invocation I take refuge in the Buddha the greatly Compassionate One the Savior of the world omnipotent omnipresent omniscient of most excellent deeds in all the ten directions And in the Dharma the manifestation of his Essence the Reality the sea of Suchness the boundless storehouse of excellencies And in the Sangha whose members truly devote themselves to the practice May all sentient beings be made to discard their doubts to cast aside their evil attachments and to give rise to the correct faith in the Mahayana that the lineage of the Buddhas may not be broken off The Contents of the Discourse There is a teaching  which can awaken in us the root of faith in the Mahayana and it should therefore be explained The explanation is divided into five parts I reply there are eight reasons The first and the main reason is to cause men to free themselves from all sufferings and to gain the final bliss it is not that I desire worldly fame material profit or respect and honor The second reason is that I wish to interpret the fundamental meaning of the teachings of the Tathgata so that men may understand them correctly and not be mistaken about them The third reason is to enable those whose capacity for goodness has attained maturity to keep firm hold upon an unretrogressive faith in the teachings of Mahayana The fourth reason is to encourage those whose capacity for goodness is still slight to cultivate the faithful mind The fifth reason is to show them expedient means by which they may wipe away the hindrance of evil karma guard their minds well free themselves from stupidity and arrogance and escape from the net of heresy The sixth reason is to reveal to them the practice of two methods of meditation cessation of illusions and clear observation  so that ordinary men and the followers of Hinayana may cure their minds of error The seventh reason is to explain to them the expedient means of singleminded meditation so that they may be born in the presence of the Buddha and keep their minds fixed in an unretrogressive faith The eighth reason is to point out to them the advantages of studying this treatise and to encourage them to make an effort to attain enlightenment Answer That is to say in the days when the Tathgata was in the world people were of high aptitude and the Preacher preached with his perfect voice different types of people all equally understood hence there was no need for this kind of discourse But after the passing away of the Tathgata there were some who were able by their own power to listen extensively to others and to reach understanding there were some who by their own power could listen to very little and yet understand much there were some who without any mental power of their own depended upon the extensive discourses of others to obtain understanding and naturally there were some who looked upon the wordiness of extensive discourses as troublesome and who sought after what was comprehensive terse and yet contained much meaning and then were able to understand it Thus this discourse is designed to embrace in a general way the limitless meaning of the vast and profound teaching of the Tathgata This discourse therefore should be presented PART  Outline The reasons for writing have been explained Next the outline will be given Generally speaking Mahayana is to be expounded from two points of view One is the principle and the other is the significance The principle is the Mind of the sentient being This Mind includes in itself all states of being of the phenomenal world and the transcendental world On the basis of this Mind the meanings of Mahayana may be unfolded Because the absolute aspect of this Mind represents the essence of Mahayana and the phenomenal aspect of this Mind indicates the essence attributes  and influences of Mahayana itself The term yana is introduced because all Enlightened Ones have ridden on this vehicle and all Enlightened Onestobe  being led by this principle will reach the stage of Tathgata It consists of three chapters One Mind and Its Two Aspects The revelation of the true meaning of the principle of Mahayana can be achieved by unfolding the doctrine that the principle of One Mind has two aspects One is the aspect of Mind in terms of the Absolute  and the other is the aspect of Mind in terms of phenomena  Each of these two aspects embraces all states of existence Mind in Terms of the Absolute The Mind in terms of the Absolute is the one World of Reality and the essence of all phases of existence in their totality If one is freed from illusions then to him there will be no appearances of objects regarded as absolutely independent existences therefore all things from the beginning transcend all forms of verbalization description and conceptualization and are in the final analysis undifferentiated free from alteration and indestructible They are only of the One Mind hence the name Suchness All explanations by words are provisional and without validity for they are merely used in accordance with illusions and are incapable of denoting Suchness The term Suchness likewise has no attributes which can be verbally specified The term Suchness is so to speak the limit of verbalization wherein a word is used to put an end to words But the essence of Suchness itself cannot be put an end to for all things in their Absolute aspect are real nor is there anything which needs to be pointed out as real for all things are equally in the state of Suchness It should be understood that all things are incapable of being verbally explained or thought of hence the name Suchness Question If such is the meaning of the principle of Mahayana how is it possible for men to conform themselves to and enter into it Answer If they understand that concerning all things though they are spoken of there is neither that which speaks nor that which can be spoken of and though they are thought of there is neither that which thinks nor that which can be thought of then they are said to have conformed to it And when they are freed from their thoughts they are said to have entered into it Next Suchness has two aspects if predicated in words One is that it is truly empty  for this aspect can in the final sense reveal what is real The other is that it is truly nonempty  for its essence itself is endowed with undefiled and excellent qualities Truly Empty Suchness is empty because from the beginning it has never been related to any defiled states of existence it is free from all marks of individual distinction of things and it has nothing to do with thoughts conceived by a deluded mind It should be understood that the essential nature of Suchness is neither with marks nor without marks neither not with marks nor not without marks nor is it both with and without marks simultaneously it is neither with a single mark nor with different marks neither not with a single mark nor not with different marks nor is it both with a single and with different marks simultaneously In short since all unenlightened men discriminate with their deluded minds from moment to moment they are alienated from Suchness hence the definition empty but once they are free from their deluded minds they will find that there is nothing to be negated Truly Nonempty Since it has been made clear that the essence of all things is empty ie devoid of illusions the true Mind is eternal permanent immutable pure and selfsufficient therefore it is called nonempty And also there is no trace of particular marks to be noted in it as it is the sphere that transcends thoughts and is in harmony with enlightenment alone The Storehouse Consciousness The Mind as phenomena is grounded on the Tathagatagarbha What is called the Storehouse Consciousness is that in which neither birth nor death  diffuses harmoniously with birth and death  and yet in which both are neither identical nor different This Consciousness has two aspects which embrace all states of existence and create all states of existence The Aspect of Enlightenment Original Enlightenment The essence of Mind is free from thoughts the absolute aspect of the World of Reality is none other than the undifferentiated Dharmakaya the Essencebody of the Tathgata Since the essence of Mind is grounded on the Dharmakaya it is to be called the original enlightenment Because original enlightenment indicates the essence of Mind in contradistinction to the essence of Mind in the process of actualization of enlightenment the process of actualization of enlightenment is none other than the process of integrating the identity with the original enlightenment The Process of Actualization of Enlightenment Grounded on the original enlightenment is nonenlightenment And because of nonenlightenment the process of actualization of enlightenment can be spoken of Now to be fully enlightened to the fountainhead of Mind is called the final enlightenment and not to be enlightened to the fountainhead of Mind nonfinal enlightenment What is the meaning of this An ordinary man becomes aware that his former thoughts were wrong then he is able to stop such thoughts from arising again The followers of Hinayana who have some insight and those Bodhisattvas who have just been initiated become aware of the changing state of thoughts and are free from thoughts which are subject to change  Those Bodhisattvas who have completed the stages of a Bodhisattva and who have fulfilled the expedient means needed to bring forth the original enlightenment to the fullest extent will experience the oneness with Suchness in an instant they will become aware of how the inceptions of the deluded thoughts of the mind arise  and will be free from the rise of any deluded thought Since they are far away even from subtle deluded thoughts they are able to have an insight into the original nature of Mind The realization that Mind is eternal is called the final enlightenment It is therefore said in a sutra that if there is a man who is able to perceive that which is beyond thoughts he is advancing toward the Buddha wisdom And yet to say that the inception of the rising of deluded thoughts is known means that it is known as existing on the ground of that which is beyond thoughts  Accordingly all ordinary people are said not to be enlightened because they have had a continuous stream of deluded thoughts and have never been freed from their thoughts therefore they are said to be in a beginningless ignorance If a man gains insight into that which is free from thoughts then he knows how those thoughts which characterize the mind arise abide change and cease to be for he is identical with that which is free from thoughts But in reality no difference exists in the process of the actualization of enlightenment because the four states exist simultaneously and each of them is not selfexistent they are originally of one and the same enlightenment  And again original enlightenment when analyzed in relation to the defiled state  presents itself as having two attributes One is the Purity of Wisdom and the other is the Suprarational Functions Purity of Wisdom By virtue of the permeation of the influence of dharma  a man comes to truly discipline himself and fulfills all expedient means of unfolding enlightenment as a result he breaks through the compound consciousness  puts an end to the manifestation of the stream of deluded mind and manifests the Dharmakaya  for his wisdom becomes genuine and pure What is the meaning of this All modes of mind and consciousness under the state of nonenlightenment are the products of ignorance Ignorance does not exist apart from enlightenment therefore it cannot be destroyed  and yet it cannot not be destroyed  This is like the relationship that exists between the water of the ocean and its waves stirred by the wind  Water and wind are inseparable but water is not mobile by nature and if the wind stops the movement ceases But the wet nature remains undestroyed Likewise mans Mind pure in its own nature is stirred by the wind of ignorance Both Mind and ignorance have no particular forms of their own and they are inseparable Yet Mind is not mobile by nature and if ignorance ceases then the continuity of deluded activities ceases But the essential nature of wisdom remains undestroyed The manifestation of his numberless excellent qualities is incessant accommodating himself to the capacity of other men he responds spontaneously reveals himself in manifold ways and benefits them The Characteristics of the Essence of Enlightenment The characteristics of the essence of enlightenment have four great significances that are identical with those of empty space or that are analogous to those of a bright mirror First the essence of enlightenment is like a mirror which is really empty of images It is free from all marks of objects of the mind and it has nothing to reveal in itself for it does not reflect any images Second it is like a mirror influencing all men to advance toward enlightenment That is to say it is truly nonempty appearing in it are all the objects of the world which neither go out nor come in which are neither lost nor destroyed It is eternally abiding One Mind All things appear in it because all things are real And none of the defiled things are able to defile it for the essence of wisdom is unaffected by defilements being furnished with an unsoiled quality and influencing all men to advance toward enlightenment Third it is like a mirror which is free from defiled objects reflected in it This can be said because the nonempty state is genuine pure and bright being free from hindrances both affectional and intellectual and transcending characteristics of that which is compounded  Fourth it is like a mirror influencing a man to cultivate his capacity for goodness serving as a coordinating cause to encourage him in his endeavors Because the essence of enlightenment is free from defiled objects it universally illumines the mind of man and induces him to cultivate his capacity for goodness presenting itself in accordance with his desires  The Aspect of Nonenlightenment Because of not truly realizing oneness with Suchness there emerges an unenlightened mind and consequently its thoughts These thoughts do not have any validity to be substantiated therefore they are not independent of the original enlightenment It is like the case of a man who has lost his way But if they are freed from the fixed notion of enlightenment then there will be no such thing as nonenlightenment Because of its nonenlightened state the deluded mind produces three aspects which are bound to nonenlightenment and are inseparable from it First is the activity of ignorance The agitation of mind because of its nonenlightened state is called activity When it is agitated anxiety follows for the result is not independent of the cause  Second is the perceiving subject When unagitated the mind is free from perceiving Third is the world of objects Because of the perceiving subject the world of objects erroneously appears Apart from the perceiving there will be no world of objects Conditioned by the incorrectly conceived world of objects the deluded mind produces six aspects First is the aspect of the discriminating intellect Depending on the erroneously conceived world of objects the mind develops the discrimination between liking and disliking Second is the aspect of continuity By virtue of the discriminating function of the intellect the mind produces an awareness of pleasure and pain with regard to things in the world of objects The mind developing deluded thoughts and being bound to them will continue uninterrupted Third is the aspect of attachment Because of the continuity of deluded thoughts the mind superimposing its deluded thoughts on the world of objects and holding fast to the discriminations of liking and disliking develops attachments to what it likes Fourth is the aspect of the speculation on names and letters  On the basis of erroneous attachments the deluded mind analyzes words which are provisional and therefore devoid of reality Fifth is the aspect of giving rise to evil karma Relying on names and letters investigates names and words and becomes attached to them and creates manifold types of evil karma Sixth is the aspect of anxiety attached to the effects of evil karma Because of the law of karma the deluded mind suffers the effects and will not be free It should be understood that ignorance is able to produce all types of defiled states all defiled states are aspects of nonenlightenment The Relationships between Enlightenment and Nonenlightenment Two relationships exist between the enlightened and nonenlightened states They are identity and nonidentity Identity Just as pieces of various kinds of pottery are of the same nature in that they are made of clay so the various magiclike manifestations of both enlightenment and nonenlightenment are aspects of the same essence Suchness For this reason it is said in a sutra all sentient beings intrinsically abide in eternity and are entered into nirvana The state of enlightenment is not something that is to be acquired by practice or to be created In the end it is unobtainable  Also it has no corporeal aspect that can be perceived as such Any corporeal aspects that are visible are magiclike products of Suchness manifested in accordance with the mentality of men in defilement It is not however that these corporeal aspects which result from the suprarational functions of wisdom are of the nature of nonemptiness  for wisdom has no aspects that can be perceived Nonidentity Just as various pieces of pottery differ from each other so differences exist between the state of enlightenment and that of nonenlightenment and between the magiclike manifestations of Suchness manifested in accordance with the mentality of men in defilement and those of men of ignorance who are defiled as to the essential nature of Suchness The Cause and Conditions of Mans Being in Samsra That a man is in samsra results from the fact that his mind and consciousness develop on the ground of the Storehouse Consciousness  The mind has five different names The first is called the activating mind for without being aware of it it breaks the equilibrium of mind by the force of ignorance The second is called the evolving mind for it emerges contingent upon the agitated mind as the subject that perceives incorrectly The third is called the reproducing mind for it reproduces the entire world of objects as a bright mirror reproduces all material images When confronted with the objects of the five senses it reproduces them at once It arises spontaneously at all times and exists forever reproducing the world of objects in front of the subject The fourth is called the analytical mind for it differentiates what is defiled and what is undefiled The fifth is called the continuing mind for it is united with deluded thoughts and continues uninterrupted It retains the entire karma good and bad accumulated in the immeasurable lives of the past and does not permit any loss It is also capable of bringing the results of the pain pleasure etc of the present and the future to maturity in doing so it makes no mistakes It can cause one to recollect suddenly the things of the present and the past and to have sudden and unexpected fantasies of the things to come The triple world therefore is unreal and is of mind only Apart from it there are no objects of the five senses and of the mind What does this mean Since all things are without exception developed from the mind and produced under the condition of deluded thoughts all differentiations are no other than the differentiations of ones mind itself Yet the mind cannot perceive the mind itself the mind has no marks of its own that can be ascertained as a substantial entity as such It should be understood that the conception of the entire world of objects can be held only on the basis of mans deluded mind of ignorance All things therefore are just like the images in a mirror which are devoid of any objectivity that one can get hold of they are of the mind only and are unreal When the deluded mind comes into being then various conceptions come to be and when the deluded mind ceases to be then these various conceptions cease to be This is called Vijnana or the separating consciousness The propensity for discrimination of this consciousness will be intensified by both the intellectual defilement of holding fast to perverse views and the affectional defilement of indulgence in passion That the deluded mind and consciousness arise from the permeation of ignorance is something that ordinary men cannot understand the followers of the Hinayana with their wisdom likewise fail to realize this Those Bodhisattvas who having advanced from the first stage of correct faith by setting the mind upon enlightenment through practicing contemplation have come to realize the Dharmakaya can partially comprehend this Yet even those who have reached the final stage of Bodhisattvahood cannot fully comprehend this only the Enlightened Ones have thorough comprehension of it The Mind though pure in its selfnature from the beginning is accompanied by ignorance Being defiled by ignorance a defiled state of Mind comes into being But though defiled the Mind itself is eternal and immutable Only the Enlightened Ones are able to understand what this means What is called the essential nature of Mind is always beyond thoughts It is therefore defined as immutable When the one World of Reality is yet to be realized the Mind is mutable and is not in perfect unity with Suchness Suddenly a deluded thought arises and this state is called ignorance The second is the defilement united with the continuing mind from which those who are at the stage of establishment of faith and who are practicing expedient means to attain enlightenment can gradually free themselves and free themselves completely at the stage of pureheartedness The third is the defilement united with the discriminating analytical mind from which those at the stage of observing precepts begin to be liberated and finally are liberated completely when they arrive at the stage of expedient means without any trace The fourth is the subtle defilement disunited from the represented world of objects from which those at the stage of freedom from the world of objects can be freed The fifth is the subtler defilement disunited from the evolving mind that perceives  from which those at the stage of freedom from evolving mind are freed The sixth and subtlest is the defilement disunited from the basic activating mind from which those Bodhisattvas who have passed the final stage and have gone into the stage of Tathgatahood are freed On the expression defiled state of mind It is called the hindrance originating from defilements for it obstructs any fundamental insight into Suchness On ignorance Ignorance is called the hindrance originating from misconceptions of objects for it obstructs the wisdom that functions spontaneously in the world Because of the defiled state of mind there emerges the subject that perceives and that which reproduces and thus one erroneously predicates the world of objects and causes oneself to deviate from the undifferentiated state of Suchness Though all things are always in quiescence and devoid of any marks of rising because of the nonenlightenment due to ignorance one erroneously strays from the dharma  thus one fails to obtain the wisdom that functions spontaneously by adapting oneself to all circumstances in the world The Characteristics of Beings in Samsra In analyzing the characteristics of beings in samsra two categories may be distinguished The cruder of the crude belongs to the range of mental activity of ordinary men the subtler of the crude and the cruder of the subtle belong to that of Bodhisattvas and the subtler of the subtle belongs to that of Buddhas These two categories of beings in the phenomenal order come about because of the permeation of ignorance that is to say they come about because of the primary cause and the coordinating causes By the primary cause nonenlightenment is meant and by the coordinating causes the erroneously represented world of objects When the primary cause ceases to be then the coordinating causes will cease to be Question If the mind ceases to be what will become of its continuity If there is continuity of mind how can you explain its final cessation Answer What we speak of as cessation is the cessation of the marks of the deluded mind only and not the cessation of its essence It is like the case of the wind which following the surface of the water leaves the marks of its movement If the water should cease to be then the marks of the wind would be nullified and the wind would have no support on which to display its movement But since the water does not cease to be the marks of the wind may continue Because only the wind ceases the marks of its movement cease accordingly This is not the cessation of water So it is with ignorance on the ground of the essence of Mind there is movement If the essence of Mind were to cease then people would be nullified and they would have no support But since the essence does not cease to be the mind may continue Because only stupidity ceases to be the marks of the stupidity of the mind cease accordingly It is not that the wisdom of Mind ceases Because of the four kinds of permeation the defiled states and the pure state emerge and continue uninterrupted Clothes in the world certainly have no scent in themselves but if a man permeates them with perfumes then they come to have a scent It is just the same with the case we are speaking of The pure state of Suchness certainly has no defilement but if it is permeated by ignorance then the marks of defilement appear on it The defiled state of ignorance is indeed devoid of any purifying force but if it is permeated by Suchness then it will come to have a purifying influence Permeation of Ignorance How does the permeation of ignorance give rise to the defiled state and continue uninterrupted Because of this permeation a deluded mind results Because of the deluded mind deluded thoughts further permeate into ignorance While the principle of Suchness is yet to be realized the deluded mind developing thoughts fashioned in the state of nonenlightenment predicates erroneously conceived objects of the senses and the mind These erroneously conceived objects of the senses and the mind the coordinating causes in bringing about the defiled state permeate into the deluded mind and cause the deluded mind to attach itself to its thoughts to create various evil karma and to undergo all kinds of physical and mental suffering The permeation of the erroneously conceived objects of the senses and the mind is of two kinds One is the basic permeation by the activating mind which causes Arhats Pratyekabuddhas and all Bodhisattvas to undergo the suffering of samsra and the other is the permeation which accelerates the activities of the objectdiscriminating consciousness and which makes ordinary men suffer from the bondage of their karma The permeations of ignorance are of two kinds One is the basic permeation since it can put into operation the activating mind and the other is the permeation that develops perverse views and attachments since it can put into operation the objectdiscriminating consciousness b Permeation of Suchness How does the permeation of Suchness give rise to the pure state and continue uninterrupted It may be said that there is the principle of Suchness and it can permeate into ignorance Through the force of this permeation Suchness causes the deluded mind to loathe the suffering of samsra and to aspire for nirvana Because this mind though still deluded is now possessed with loathing and aspiration it permeates into Suchness in that it induces Suchness to manifest itself He knows what is really so that there is no world of objects in front of him and therefore with various devices he practices courses by which to conform himself to Suchness He will not attach himself to anything nor give rise to any deluded thoughts Through the force of this permeation of Suchness over a long period of time his ignorance ceases Because of the cessation of ignorance there will be no more rising of the deluded activities of mind Because of the nonrising of the deluded activities of mind the world of objects as previously conceived ceases to be because of the cessation of both the primary cause and the coordinating causes  the marks of the defiled mind will all be nullified This is called gaining nirvana and accomplishing spontaneous acts The permeation of Suchness into the deluded mind is of two kinds The first is the permeation into the objectdiscriminating consciousness Because of this permeation ordinary men and the Hinayanists come to loathe the suffering of samsra and thereupon each according to his capacity gradually advances toward the highest enlightenment The second is the permeation into mind Because of this permeation Bodhisattvas advance to nirvana rapidly and with aspiration and fortitude Two kinds of permeation of Suchness into ignorance can be identified The first is the permeation through manifestation of the essence of Suchness and the second is the permeation through external influences Permeation through Manifestation of the Essence of Suchness The essence of Suchness is from the beginningless beginning endowed with the perfect state of purity It is provided with suprarational functions and the nature of manifesting itself  Because of these two reasons it permeates perpetually into ignorance Through the force of this permeation it induces a man to loathe the suffering of samsra to seek bliss in nirvana and believing that he has the principle of Suchness within himself to make up his mind to exert himself Question If this is so then all sentient beings are endowed with Suchness and are equally permeated by it Why is it that there are infinite varieties of believers and nonbelievers and that there are some who believe sooner and some later All of them should knowing that they are endowed with the principle of Suchness at once make an effort utilizing expedient means and should all equally attain nirvana Answer Though Suchness is originally one yet there are immeasurable and infinite shades of ignorance From the very beginning ignorance is because of its nature characterized by diversity and its degree of intensity is not uniform Defilements more numerous than the sands of the Ganges come into being because of the differences in intensity of ignorance and exist in manifold ways defilements such as the belief in the existence of atman and the indulgence in passion develop because of ignorance and exist in different ways All these defilements are brought about by ignorance in an infinitely diversified manner in time The Tathgatas alone understand all about this In Buddhism there is a teaching concerning the primary cause and the coordinating causes When the primary cause and the coordinating causes are sufficiently provided there will be the perfection of a result It is like the case of wood though it possesses a latent fire nature which is the primary cause of its burning it cannot be made to burn by itself unless men understand the situation and resort to means of actualizing fire out of wood by kindling it In the same way a man though he is in possession of the correct primary cause Suchness with permeating force cannot put an end to his defilements by himself alone and enter nirvana unless he is provided with coordinating causes ie his encounters with the Buddhas Bodhisattvas or good spiritual friends Even though coordinating causes from without may be sufficiently provided if the pure principle within is lacking in the force of permeation then a man cannot ultimately loathe the suffering of samsra and seek bliss in nirvana However if both the primary and the coordinating causes are sufficiently provided then because of his possession of the force of permeation of Suchness from within and the compassionate protection of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas from without he is able to develop a loathing for suffering to believe that nirvana is real and to cultivate his capacity for goodness And when his cultivation of the capacity for goodness matures he will as a result meet the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and will be instructed taught benefited and given joy and then he will be able to advance on the path to nirvana Permeation through Influences This is the force from without affecting men by providing coordinating causes Such external coordinating causes have an infinite number of meanings The Specific Coordinating Causes A man from the time when he first aspires to seek enlightenment until he becomes an Enlightened One sees or meditates on the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as they manifest themselves to him sometimes they appear as his family members parents or relatives sometimes as servants sometimes as close friends or sometimes as enemies Through all kinds of deeds and incalculable performances such as the practice of the four acts of lovingkindness etc they exercise the force of permeation created by their great compassion and are thus able to cause sentient beings to strengthen their capacity for goodness and are able to benefit them as they see or hear about their needs This specific coordinating cause is of two kinds One is immediate and enables a man to obtain deliverance quickly and the other is remote and enables a man to obtain deliverance after a long time The immediate and remote causes are again of two kinds The General Coordinating Causes Every Buddha and Bodhisattva desires to liberate all men spontaneously permeating them with their spiritual influences and never forsaking them Through the power of the wisdom which is one with Suchness they manifest activities in response to the needs of men as they see and hear them Because of this indiscriminately permeating cause men are all equally able by means of concentration  to see the Buddhas Ordinary men the Hinayanists and those Bodhisattvas who have just been initiated devote themselves to religious practices on the strength of their faith being permeated by Suchness through their mind and consciousness Not having obtained the indiscriminate mind however they are yet to be united with the essence of Suchness and not having obtained the perfection of the discipline of free acts they are yet to be united with the influence of Suchness The other is the already united with Suchness Bodhisattvas who realize Dharmakaya have obtained undiscriminating mind and are united with the essence of the Buddhas they having obtained free acts are united with the influence of the wisdom of the Buddhas They singly devote themselves with spontaneity to their religious disciplines on the strength of Suchness within permeating into Suchness so that Suchness will reclaim itself they destroy ignorance Again the defiled principle  from the beginningless beginning continues perpetually to permeate until it perishes by the attainment of Buddhahood But the permeation of the pure principle has no interruption and no ending The reason is that the principle of Suchness is always permeating therefore when the deluded mind ceases to be the Dharmakaya will be manifest and will give rise to the permeation of the influence of Suchness and thus there will be no ending to it The Greatness of the Essence of Suchness The essence of Suchness knows no increase or decrease in ordinary men the Hinayanists the Bodhisattvas or the Buddhas It was not brought into existence in the beginning nor will it cease to be at the end of time it is eternal through and through The Greatness of the Attributes of Suchness From the beginning Suchness in its nature is fully provided with all excellent qualities namely it is endowed with the light of great wisdom the qualities of illuminating the entire universe of true cognition and mind pure in its selfnature of eternity bliss Self and purity of refreshing coolness immutability and freedom It is endowed with these excellent qualities which outnumber the sands of the Ganges which are not independent of disjointed from or different from the essence of Suchness and which are suprarational attributes of Buddhahood Since it is endowed completely with all these and is not lacking anything it is called the Tathagatagarbha when latent and also the Dharmakaya of the Tathgata Question It was explained before that the essence of Suchness is undifferentiated and devoid of all characteristics Why is it then that you have described its essence as having these various excellent qualities Answer Though it has in reality all these excellent qualities it does not have any characteristics of differentiation it retains its identity and is of one flavor Suchness is solely one Question What does this mean Since it is devoid of individuation it is free from the characteristics of individuation thus it is one without any second Then how can you speak of differentiation  Answer All things are originally of the mind only they in fact transcend thoughts Nevertheless the deluded mind in nonenlightenment gives rise to irrelevant thoughts and predicates the world of objects The essential nature of Mind is free from any partial perceiving hence Suchness is spoken of as having the characteristic of illuminating the entire universe When the mind is in motion  it is characterized by illusions and defilements outnumbering the sands of the Ganges such as lack of true cognition absence of selfnature impermanence blisslessness impurity fever anxiety deterioration mutation and lack of freedom By contrast to this the essential nature of Mind however is motionless  therefore it can be inferred that it must have various pure and excellent qualities outnumbering the sands of the Ganges But if the mind gives rise to irrelevant thoughts and further predicates the world of objects it will continue to lack these qualities All these numberless excellent qualities of the pure principle are none other than those of One Mind and there is nothing to be sought after anew by thought The Greatness of the Influences of Suchness The BuddhaTathgatas while in the stages of Bodhisattvahood exercised great compassion practiced paramitas and accepted and transformed sentient beings They took great vows desiring to liberate all sentient beings through countless aeons until the end of future time for they regarded all sentient beings as they regarded themselves Because they truly knew that all sentient beings and they themselves were identical in Suchness and that there could be no distinction between them The influences of Suchness are of two kinds The first is that which is conceived by the mind of ordinary men and the followers of Hinayana in the objectdiscriminating consciousness This is called the influence of Suchness in the form of the Transformationbody  Because they do not know that it is projected by the evolving mind they regard it as coming from without they assume that it has a corporeal limitation because their understanding is limited The second is that which is conceived by the mind of the Bodhisattvas from the first stage of aspiration to the highest stage in the mentality which regards external objects as unreal This is called the influence of Suchness in the form of the Blissbody  It has an infinite number of corporeal forms each form has an infinite number of major marks and each major mark has an infinite number of subtle marks The land where it has its abode has innumerable adornments It manifests itself without any bounds its manifestations are inexhaustible and free from any limitations It manifests itself in accordance with the needs of sentient beings and yet it always remains firm without destroying or losing itself These excellent qualities were perfected by the pure permeation acquired by the practice of paramitas and the suprarational permeation of Suchness Depending upon where one is in the six transmigratory states his vision of it will differ The visions of it conceived by the unenlightened beings are not in a form of Bliss this is the reason why it is called the Transformationbody  The Bodhisattvas in their first stage of aspiration and the others because of their deep faith in Suchness have a partial insight into the nature of the influence of Suchness They know that the things of the Blissbody such as its corporeal forms major marks adornments etc do not come from without or go away that they are free from limitations and that they are envisioned by mind alone and are not independent of Suchness These Bodhisattvas however are not free from dualistic thinking since they have yet to enter into the stage where they gain complete realization of the Dharmakaya If they advance to the stage of pureheartedness the forms they see will be subtler and the influences of Suchness will be more excellent than ever When they leave the last stage of Bodhisattvahood they will perfect their insight into Suchness Question If the Dharmakaya of the Buddhas is free from the manifestation of corporeal form how can it appear in corporeal form Answer Since the Dharmakaya is the essence of corporeal form it is capable of appearing in corporeal form The reason this is said is that from the beginning corporeal form and Mind have been nondual Since the essential nature of corporeal form is identical with wisdom the essence of corporeal form which has yet to be divided into tangible forms is called the wisdombody Since the essential nature of wisdom is identical with corporeal form the essence of corporeal form which has yet to be divided into tangible forms is called Dharmakaya pervading everywhere Its manifested corporeal forms have no limitations All of these are incomprehensible to the dualistic thinking of the deluded mind and consciousness for they result from the free influence of Suchness Examining the five components we find that they may be reduced to matter and mind  The objects of the five senses and of the mind are in the final analysis beyond what they are thought to be And the mind itself is devoid of any form or mark and is therefore unobtainable as such no matter where one may seek it Just as a man because he has lost his way mistakes the east for the west though the actual directions have not changed place so people because of their ignorance assume Mind to be what they think it to be though Mind in fact is unaffected even if it is falsely predicated If a man is able to observe and understand that Mind is beyond what it is thought to be then he will be able to conform to and enter the realm of Suchness CHAPTER TWO The Correction of Evil Attachments All evil attachments originate from biased views if a man is free from bias he will be free from evil attachments There are two kinds of biased view The Biased Views Held by Ordinary Men There are five kinds of biased views held by ordinary men which may be discussed Hearing that it is explained in the sutra that the Dharmakaya of the Tathgata is in the final analysis quiescent like empty space ordinary men think that the nature of the Tathgata is indeed the same as empty space for they do not know that the purpose of the sutra is to uproot their adherence How is this to be corrected The way to correct this error is to understand clearly that empty space is a delusive concept the substance of which is nonexistent and unreal In fact there are no external corporeal objects because all objects are originally of the mind All objects are of the mind alone but when illusions arise objects which are regarded as real appear When the mind is free from its deluded activities then all objects imagined as real vanish of themselves What is real the one and true Mind pervades everywhere This is the final meaning of the Tathgatas great and comprehensive wisdom The Dharmakaya is indeed unlike empty space Hearing that it is explained in the sutra that all things in the world in the final analysis are empty in their substance and that nirvana or the principle of Suchness is also absolutely empty from the beginning and devoid of any characteristics they not knowing that the purpose of the sutra is to uproot their adherence think that the essential nature of Suchness or nirvana is simply empty How is this to be corrected The way to correct this error is to make clear that Suchness or the Dharmakaya is not empty but is endowed with numberless excellent qualities How is this to be corrected Hearing that it is explained in the sutra that all defiled states of samsra in the world exist on the ground of the Tathagatagarbha and that they are therefore not independent of Suchness they not understanding this think that the Tathagatagarbha literally contains in itself all the defiled states of samsra in the world How is this to be corrected In order to correct this error it should be understood that the Tathgatagarbha from the beginning contains only pure excellent qualities which outnumbering the sands of the Ganges are not independent of severed from or different from Suchness that the soiled states of defilement which outnumbering the sands of the Ganges are not independent of severed from or different from Suchness that the soiled states of defilement which outnumbering the sands of the Ganges merely exist in illusion are from the beginning nonexistent and from the beginningless beginning have never been united with the Tathgatagarbha It has never happened that the Tathgatagarbha contained deluded states in its essence and that it induced itself to realize Suchness in order to extinguish forever its deluded states Hearing that it is explained in the sutra that on the ground of the Tathgatagarbha there is samsra as well as the attainment of nirvana they without understanding this think that there is a beginning for sentient beings Since they suppose a beginning they suppose also that the nirvana attained by the Tathgata has an end and that he will in turn become a sentient being Question How is this to be corrected The way to correct this error is to explain that the Tathagatagarbha has no beginning and that therefore ignorance has no beginning If anyone asserts that sentient beings came into existence outside this triple world he holds the view given in the scriptures of the heretics Again the Tathgatagarbha does not have an end and the nirvana attained by the Buddhas being one with it likewise has no end The Biased Views Held by the Hinayanists Because of their inferior capacity the Tathgata preached to the Hinayanists only the doctrine of the nonexistence of atman and did not preach his doctrines in their entirety as a result the Hinayanists have come to believe that the five components the constituents of samsaric existence are real being terrified at the thought of being subject to birth and death they erroneously attach themselves to nirvana How is this to be corrected The way to correct this error is to make clear that the five components are unborn in their essential nature and therefore are imperishable that what is made of the five components is from the beginning in nirvana Finally in order to be completely free from erroneous attachments one should know that both the defiled and the pure states are relative and have no particular marks of their ownbeing that can be discussed Thus all things from the beginning are neither matter nor mind neither wisdom nor consciousness neither being nor nonbeing they are ultimately inexplicable And yet they are still spoken of It should be understood that the Tathgatas applying their expedient means make use of conventional speech in a provisional manner in order to guide people so that they can be free from their deluded thoughts and can return to Suchness for if anyone thinks of anything as real and absolute in its own right he causes his mind to be trapped in samsra and consequently he cannot enter the state filled with true insight  CHAPTER THREE Analyses of the Types of Aspiration for Enlightenment or The Meanings of Yana All Bodhisattvas aspire to the enlightenment realized by all the Buddhas disciplining themselves to this end and advancing toward it Briefly three types of aspiration for enlightenment can be distinguished By whom and through what kind of discipline can faith be perfected so that the aspiration for enlightenment may be developed They loathe the suffering of samsra and wish to seek the supreme enlightenment Having been able to meet the Buddhas they serve them honor them and practice the faith Their faith will be perfected after ten thousand aeons Their aspiration for enlightenment will be developed either through the instruction of the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas or because of their great compassion toward their suffering fellow beings or from their desire to preserve the good teaching from extinction Those who are thus able to develop their aspiration through the perfection of faith will enter the group of the determined and will never retrogress There are however people among those who belong to the group of the undetermined whose capacity for goodness is slight and whose defilements having accumulated from the far distant past are deeprooted Though they may also meet the Buddhas and honor them they will develop the potentiality merely to be born as men as dwellers in heaven or as followers of the Hinayana Even if they should seek after the Mahayana they would sometimes progress and sometimes regress because of the inconsistent nature of their capacity And also there are some who honor the Buddhas and who before ten thousand aeons have passed will develop an aspiration because of some favorable circumstances But these types of aspiration are all inconsistent for if the men who hold them meet with unfavorable circumstances they will relapse and fall back into the stage of attainment of the followers of the Hinayana Briefly speaking three kinds can be discussed The first is the mind characterized by straightforwardness for it correctly meditates on the principle of Suchness The second is the mind of profoundness for there is no limit to its joyful accumulation of all kinds of goodness The third is the mind filled with great compassion for it wishes to uproot the sufferings of all sentient beings Question Earlier it has been explained that the World of Reality is one and that the essence of the Buddhas has no duality Why is it that people do not meditate of their own accord on Suchness alone but must learn to practice good deeds Answer Just as a precious gem is bright and pure in its essence but is marred by impurities so is a man Even if he meditates on his precious nature unless he polishes it in various ways by expedient means he will never be able to purify it The principle of Suchness in men is absolutely pure in its essential nature but is filled with immeasurable impurity of defilements Even if a man meditates on Suchness unless he makes an effort to be permeated by it in various ways by applying expedient means he certainly cannot become pure Since the state of impurity is limitless pervading throughout all states of being it is necessary to counteract and purify it by means of the practice of all kinds of good deeds If a man does so he will naturally return to the principle of Suchness As to the expedient means there are in short four kinds The first is the fundamental means to be practiced That is to say a man is to meditate on the fact that all things in their essential nature are unborn divorcing himself from deluded views so that he does not abide in samsra At the same time he is to meditate on the fact that all things are the products of the union of the primary and coordinating causes and that the effect of karma will never be lost Accordingly he is to cultivate great compassion practice meritorious deeds and accept and transform sentient beings equally without abiding in nirvana for he is to conform himself to the functions of the essential nature of Reality which knows no fixation The second is the means of stopping evils The practice of developing a sense of shame and repentance can stop all evils and prevent them from growing for one is to conform oneself to the faultlessness of the essential nature of Reality The third is the means of increasing the capacity for goodness that has already been developed That is to say a man should diligently honor and pay homage to the Three treasures and should praise rejoice in and beseech the Buddhas Because of the sincerity of his love and respect for the Three Treasures his faith will be strengthened and he will be able to seek the unsurpassed enlightenment Furthermore being protected by the Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha he will be able to wipe out the hindrances of evil karma His capacity for goodness will not retrogress because he will be conforming himself to the essential nature of Reality which is free from hindrances produced by stupidity The fourth is the means of the great vow of universal salvation This is to take a vow that one will liberate all sentient beings down to the last one no matter how long it may take to cause them to attain the perfect nirvana for one will be conforming oneself to the essential nature of Reality which is characterized by the absence of discontinuity The essential nature of Reality is all embracing and pervades all sentient beings it is everywhere the same and one without duality it does not distinguish this from that because it is in the final analysis in the state of quiescence When a Bodhisattva develops this aspiration for enlightenment through faith he will be able to a certain extent to realize the Dharmakaya Because of this realization of the Dharmakaya and because he is led by the force of the vow that he made to liberate all sentient beings he is able to present eight types of manifestation of himself for the benefit of all sentient beings These are the descent from the Tushita heaven the entrance into a human womb the stay in the womb the birth the renunciation the attainment of enlightenment the turning of the wheel of the Dharma  and the entrance into nirvana However such a Bodhisattva cannot be said to have perfectly realized the Dharmakaya for he has not yet completely destroyed the outflowing evil karma which has been accumulated from his numberless existences in the past He must suffer some slight misery deriving from the state of his birth However this is due not to his being fettered by karma but to his freely made decision to carry out the great vow of universal salvation in order to understand the suffering of others It says this merely in order to frighten and stir the heroism of the newly initiated Bodhisattvas who have not yet joined the group of the determined and who may be indolent Furthermore as soon as this aspiration has been aroused in the Bodhisattvas they leave cowardice far behind them and are not afraid even of falling into the stage of the followers of the Hinayana Even though they hear that they must suffer extreme hardship for innumerable aeons before they may attain nirvana they do not feel any fear for they believe and know that from the beginning all things are of themselves in nirvana The Aspiration for Enlightenment through Understanding and Deeds It should be understood that this type of aspiration is even more excellent than the former Because the Bodhisattvas who cherish this aspiration are those who are about to finish the first term of the incalculable aeons since the time when they first had the correct faith they have come to have a profound understanding of the principle of Suchness and to entertain no attachment to their attainments obtained through discipline Knowing that the essential nature of Reality is free from covetousness they in conformity to it devote themselves to the perfection of charity Knowing that the essential nature of Reality is free from the defilements which originate from the desires of the five senses they in conformity to it devote themselves to the perfection of precepts Knowing that the essential nature of Reality is without suffering and free from anger and anxiety they in conformity to it devote themselves to the perfection of forbearance Knowing that the essential nature of Reality does not have any distinction of body and mind and is free from indolence they in conformity to it devote themselves to the perfection of zeal Knowing that the essential nature of Reality is always calm and free from confusion in its essence they in conformity to it devote themselves to the perfection of meditation Knowing that the essential nature of Reality is always characterized by gnosis and is free from ignorance they in conformity to it devote themselves to the perfection of wisdom The Aspiration for Enlightenment through Insight As for the Bodhisattvas of this group who range from the stage of pureheartedness to the last stage of Bodhisattvahood what object do they realize They realize Suchness We speak of it as an object because of the evolving mind but in fact there is no object in this realization that can be stated in terms of a subjectobject relationship There is only the insight into Suchness transcending both the seer and the seen we call this the experience of the Dharmakaya The Bodhisattvas of this group can in an instant of thought go to all worlds of the universe honor the Buddhas and ask them to turn the wheel of the Dharma In order to guide and benefit all men they do not rely on words Sometimes for the sake of weakwilled men they show how to attain perfect enlightenment quickly by skipping over the stages of the Bodhisattva And sometimes for the sake of indolent men they say that men may attain enlightenment at the end of numberless aeons Thus they can demonstrate innumerable expedient means and suprarational feats But in reality all these Bodhisattvas are the same in that they are alike in their lineage their capacity their aspiration and their realization of Suchness therefore there is no such thing as skipping over the stages for all Bodhisattvas must pass through the three terms of innumerable aeons before they can fully attain enlightenment However because of the differences in the various beings there are also different ways of teaching them what to practice The characteristics of the aspiration for enlightenment entertained by a Bodhisattva belonging to this group can be identified in terms of the three subtle modes of mind The first is the true mind for it is free from false intellectual discrimination The second is the mind capable of applying expedient means for it pervades everywhere spontaneously and benefits sentient beings The third is the mind subject to the influence of karma operating in subconsciousness for it appears and disappears in the subtlest ways Again a Bodhisattva of this group when he brings his excellent qualities to perfection manifests himself in the heaven of Akanishta as the highest physical being in the world Question Since space is infinite worlds are infinite Since worlds are infinite beings are infinite Since beings are infinite the variety of their mentalities must also be infinite The objects of the senses and the mind must therefore be limitless and it is difficult to know and understand them all If ignorance is destroyed there will be no thoughts in the mind How then can a comprehension that has no content be called allembracing knowledge Answer All objects are originally of One Mind and are beyond thought determination Because unenlightened people perceive objects in their illusion they impose limitations in their mind Since they erroneously develop these thought determinations which do not correspond to Reality  they are unable to reach any inclusive comprehension The BuddhaTathgatas are free from all perverse views and thoughts that block correct vision therefore there are no corners into which their comprehension does not penetrate Their Mind is true and real therefore it is no other than the essential nature of all things They are endowed with an influence of great wisdom that functions as the application of innumerable expedient means Accommodating themselves to the capacity of understanding of various sentient beings they can reveal to them the manifold meanings of the doctrine This is the reason they may be called those who have allembracing knowledge Question If the Buddhas are able to perform spontaneous acts to manifest themselves everywhere and to benefit all sentient beings then the sentient beings should all be able by seeing their physical forms by witnessing their miracles or by hearing their preaching to gain benefit Why is it then that most people in this world have not been able to see the Buddhas Answer The Dharmakaya of all the Buddhas being one and the same everywhere is omnipresent The mind of the sentient being is like a mirror Just as a mirror cannot reflect images if it is coated with dirt so the Dharmakaya cannot appear in the mind of the sentient being if it is coated with the dirt of defilements PART  On Faith and Practice Having already discussed interpretation we will now present a discussion of faith and practice This discussion is intended for those who have not yet joined the group of beings who are determined to attain enlightenment What kind of faith should a man have and how should he practice it Briefly there are four kinds of faith The first is the faith in the Ultimate Source Because of this faith a man comes to meditate with joy on the principle of Suchness The second is the faith in the numberless excellent qualities of the Buddhas Because of this faith a man comes to meditate on them always to draw near to them in fellowship to honor them and to respect them developing his capacity for goodness and seeking after the allembracing knowledge The third is the faith in the great benefits of the Dharma  Because of this faith a man comes constantly to remember and practice various disciplines leading to enlightenment The fourth is the faith in the Sangha whose members are able to devote themselves to the practice of benefiting both themselves and others Because of this faith a man comes to approach constantly and with joy the assembly of Bodhisattvas and to seek instruction from them in the correct practice On Five Practices There are five ways of practice which will enable a man to perfect his faith How should a man practice charity If he sees anyone coming to him begging he should give him the wealth and other things in his possession in so far as he is able thus while freeing himself from greed and avarice he causes the beggar to be joyful Or if he sees one who is in hardship in fear or in grave danger he should according to his ability and understanding explain it by the use of expedient means In doing so however he should not expect any fame material gain or respect but he should think only of benefiting himself and others alike and of extending the merit that he gains from the practice of charity toward the attainment of enlightenment How should he practice the observance of precepts Answer He is not to kill to steal to commit adultery to be doubletongued to slander to lie or to utter exaggerated speech He is to free himself from greed jealousy cheating deceit flattery crookedness anger hatred and perverse views If he happens to be a monk or nun who has renounced family life he should also in order to cut off and suppress defilements keep himself away from the hustle and bustle of the world and always residing in solitude should learn to be content with the least desire and should practice vigorous ascetic disciplines He should be frightened and filled with awe by any slight fault and should feel shame and repent He should not take lightly any of the Tathgatas precepts He should guard himself from slander and from showing dislike so as not to rouse people in their delusion to commit any offense or sin How should he practice patience He should be patient with the vexatious acts of others and should not harbor thoughts of vengeance and he should also be patient in matters of gain or loss honor or dishonor praise or blame suffering or joy etc How should he practice zeal He should not be sluggish in doing good he should be firm in his resolution and he should purge himself of cowardice He should remember that from the far distant past he has been tormented in vain by all of the great sufferings of body and mind Because of this he should diligently practice various meritorious acts benefiting himself and others and liberate himself quickly from suffering Even if a man practices faith because he is greatly hindered by the evil karma derived from the grave sins of previous lives he may be troubled by the evil Tempter and his demons or entangled in all sorts of worldly affairs or afflicted by the suffering of disease There are a great many hindrances of this kind He should therefore be courageous and zealous and at the six fourhour intervals of the day and night should pay homage to the Buddhas repent with sincere heart beseech the Buddhas for their guidance rejoice in the happiness of others and direct all the merits thus acquired to the attainment of enlightenment If he never abandons these practices he will be able to avoid the various hindrances as his capacity for goodness increases Question How should he practice cessation and clear observation What is called cessation means to put a stop to all characteristics of the world of sense objects and of the mind because it means to follow the samatha method of meditation What is called clear observation means to perceive distinctly the characteristics of the causally conditioned phenomena  because it means to follow the vipassana method of meditation Question How should he follow these He should step by step practice these two aspects and not separate one from the other for only then will both be perfected The Practice of Cessation Should there be a man who desires to practice cessation he should stay in a quiet place and sit erect in an even temper His attention should be focused neither on breathing nor on any form or color nor on empty space earth water fire wind nor even on what has been seen heard remembered or conceived All thoughts as soon as they are conjured up are to be discarded and even the thought of discarding them is to be put away for all things are essentially in the state of transcending thoughts and are not to be created from moment to moment nor to be extinguished from moment to moment thus one is to conform to the essential nature of Reality through this practice of cessation And it is not that he should first meditate on the objects of the senses in the external world and then negate them with his mind the mind that has meditated on them If the mind wanders away it should be brought back and fixed in correct thought It should be understood that this correct thought is the thought that whatever is is mind only and that there is no external world of objects as conceived even this mind is devoid of any marks of its own which would indicate its substantiality and therefore is not substantially conceivable as such at any moment Even if he arises from his sitting position and engages in other activities such as going coming advancing or standing still he should at all times be mindful of the application of expedient means of perfecting cessation conform to the immobile principle of the essential nature of Reality and observe and examine the resulting experiences When this discipline is well mastered after a long period of practice the ideations of his mind will be arrested Because of this his power of executing cessation will gradually be intensified and become highly effective so that he will conform himself to and be able to be absorbed into the concentration of Suchness Then his defilements deep though they may be will be suppressed and his faith strengthened he will quickly attain the state in which there will be no retrogression But those who are skeptical who lack faith who speak ill of the teaching of the Buddha who have committed grave sins who are hindered by their evil karma or who are arrogant or indolent are to be excluded these people are incapable of being absorbed into the samdhi of Suchness Next as a result of this samdhi a man realizes the oneness of the World of Reality  ie the sameness everywhere and nonduality of the Dharmakaya of all the Buddhas and the bodies of sentient beings This is called the samdhi of one movement It should be understood that the samdhi of Suchness is the foundation of all other samdhi if a man keeps practicing it then he will gradually be able to develop countless other kinds of samdhi If there is a man who lacks the capacity for goodness he will be confused by the evil Tempter by heretics and by demons Sometimes these beings will appear in dreadful forms while he is sitting in meditation and at other times they will manifest themselves in the shapes of handsome men and women In such a case he should meditate on the principle of Mind only and then these objects will vanish and will not trouble him any longer Sometimes they may appear as the images of heavenly beings or Bodhisattvas and assume also the figure of the Tathgata furnished with all the major and minor marks or they may expound the spells or preach charity the precepts patience zeal meditation and wisdom or they may discourse on how the true nirvana is the state of universal emptiness of the nonexistence of characteristics vows hatreds affections causes and effects and of absolute nothingness They may also teach him the knowledge of his own past and future states of existence the method of reading other mens minds and perfect mastery of speech causing him to be covetous and attached to worldly fame and profit or they may cause him to be frequently moved to joy and anger and thus to have unsteadiness of character being at times very kindhearted very drowsy very ill or lazyminded or at other times becoming suddenly zealous and then afterward lapsing into negligence or developing a lack of faith a great deal of doubt and a great deal of anxiety or abandoning his fundamental excellent practices toward religious perfection and devoting himself to miscellaneous religious acts or being attached to worldly affairs which involve him in many ways or sometimes they may cause him to experience a certain semblance of various kinds of samdhi which are all the attainments of heretics and are not the true samdhi or sometimes they may cause him to remain in samdhi for one two three or up to seven days feeling comfort in his body and joy in his mind being neither hungry nor thirsty partaking of natural fragrant and delicious drinks and foods which induce him to increase his attachment to them or at other times they may cause him to eat without any restraint now a great deal now only a little so that the color of his face changes accordingly For these reasons he who practices cessation should be discreet and observant lest his mind fall into the net of evil doctrine He should be diligent in abiding in correct thought neither grasping nor attaching himself to anything if he does so he will be able to keep himself far away from the hindrance of these evil influences He should know that the samdhi of the heretics is not free from perverse views craving and arrogance for the heretics are covetously attached to fame profit and the respect of the world The samdhi of Suchness is the samdhi in which one is not arrested by the activity of viewing a subject nor by the experiencing of objects in the midst of meditation even after concentration one will be neither indolent nor arrogant and ones defilements will gradually decrease There has never been a case in which an ordinary man without having practiced this samdhi was still able to join the group that is entitled to become Tathgatas Those who practice the various types of Dhyana and samdhi which are popular in the world will develop much attachment to their flavors and will be bound to the triple world because of their perverse view that atman is real They are therefore the same as heretics for as they depart from the protection of their good spiritual friends they turn to heretical views Next he who practices this samdhi diligently and wholeheartedly will gain ten kinds of advantages in this life First the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas of the ten directions will always protect him Second the Tempter and his evil demons will not frighten him Third he will not be deluded or confused by the ninetyfive kinds of heretics and wicked spirits Fourth he will keep himself far away from slanderers of the profound teaching of the Buddha and will gradually diminish the hindrances derived from grave sins Fifth he will destroy all doubts and wrong views on enlightenment Sixth his faith in the Realm of the Tathgata will grow Seventh he will be free from sorrow and remorse and in the midst of samsra will be full of vigor and undaunted Eighth having a gentle heart and forsaking arrogance he will not be vexed by others Ninth even if he has not yet experienced samdhi he will be able to decrease his defilements in all places and at all times and he will not take pleasure in the world Tenth if he experiences samdhi he will not be startled by any sound from without Now if he practices cessation only then his mind will be sunk in selfcomplacency and he will be slothful he will not delight in performing good acts but will keep himself far away from the exercise of great compassion The Practice of Clear Observation He who practices clear observation should observe that all conditioned phenomena in the world are unstationary and are subject to instantaneous transformation and destruction that all activities of the mind arise and are extinguished from moment to moment and that therefore all of these induce suffering He should observe that all that had been conceived in the past was as hazy as a dream that all that is being conceived in the present is like a flash of lightning and that all that will be conceived in the future will be like clouds that rise up suddenly He should also observe that the physical existences of all living beings in the world are impure and that among these various filthy things there is not a single one that can be sought after with joy He should reflect in the following way all living beings from the beginningless beginning because they are permeated by ignorance have allowed their mind to remain in samsra they have already suffered all the great miseries of the body and mind they are at present under incalculable pressure and constraint and their sufferings in the future will likewise be limitless After reflecting in this way he should pluck up his courage and make a great vow to this effect may my mind be free from discriminations so that I may practice all of the various meritorious acts everywhere in the ten directions may I to the end of the future by applying limitless expedient means help all suffering sentient beings so that they may obtain the bliss of nirvana the ultimate goal Having made such a vow he must in accordance with his capacity and without faltering practice every kind of good at all times and all places and not be slothful in his mind Except when he sits in concentration in the practice of cessation he should at all times reflect upon what should be done and what should not be done Whether walking standing sitting lying or rising he should practice both cessation and clear observation side by side That is to say he is to meditate upon the fact that things are unborn in their essential nature but at the same time he is to meditate upon the fact that good and evil karma produced by the combination of the primary cause and the coordinating causes and the retributions of karma in terms of pleasure pain etc are neither lost nor destroyed Though he is to meditate on the retribution of good and evil karma produced by the primary and coordinating causes  he is also to meditate on the fact that the essential nature of things is unobtainable by intellectual analysis The practice of cessation will enable ordinary men to cure themselves of their attachments to the world and will enable the followers of the Hinayana to forsake their views which derive from cowardice The practice of clear observation will cure the followers of the Hinayana of the fault of having narrow and inferior minds which bring forth no great compassion and will free ordinary men from their failure to cultivate the capacity for goodness For these reasons both cessation and clear observation are complementary and inseparable If the two are not practiced together then one cannot enter the path to enlightenment Next suppose there is a man who learns this teaching for the first time and wishes to seek the correct faith but lacks courage and strength Because he lives in this world of suffering he fears that he will not always be able to meet the Buddhas and honor them personally and that faith being difficult to perfect he will be inclined to fall back He should know that the Tathgatas have an excellent expedient means by which they can protect his faith that is through the strength of wholehearted meditation on the Buddha he will in fulfillment of his wishes be able to be born in the Buddhaland beyond to see the Buddha always and to be forever separated from the evil states of existence It is as the sutra says If a man meditates wholly on Amitabha Buddha in the world of the Western Paradise and wishes to be born in that world directing all the goodness he has cultivated toward that goal then he will be born there Because he will see the Buddha at all times he will never fall back If he meditates on the Dharmakaya the Suchness of the Buddha and with diligence keeps practicing the meditation he will be able to be born there in the end because he abides in the correct samdhi PART  Encouragement of Practice and the Benefits Thereof As has already been explained in the preceding sections the Mahayana is the secret treasury of the Buddhas Should there be a man who wishes to obtain correct faith in the profound Realm of the Tathgata and to enter the path of Mahayana putting far away from himself any slandering of the teaching of Buddha he should lay hold of this treatise deliberate on it and practice it in the end he will be able to reach the unsurpassed enlightenment If a man after having heard this teaching does not feel any fear or weakness it should be known that such a man is certain to carry on the lineage of the Buddha and to receive the prediction of the Buddha that he will obtain enlightenment Even if a man were able to reform all living beings throughout all the systems in the universe and to induce them to practice the ten precepts he still would not be superior to a man who reflects correctly upon this teaching even for the time spent on a single meal for the excellent qualities which the latter is able to obtain are unspeakably superior to those which the former may obtain If a man takes hold of this treatise and reflects on and practices the teachings given in it only for one day and one night the excellent qualities he will gain will be boundless and indescribable Even if all the Buddhas of the ten directions were to praise these excellent qualities for incalculably long periods of time they could never reach the end of their praise for the excellent qualities of the Reality are infinite and the excellent qualities gained by this man will accordingly be boundless If however there is a man who slanders and does not believe in this treatise for an incalculable number of aeons he will undergo immense suffering for his fault Therefore all people should reverently believe in it and not slander it for slander and lack of faith will gravely injure one as well as others and will lead to the destruction of the lineage of the Three Treasures Through this teaching all Tathgatas have gained nirvana and through the practice of it all Bodhisattvas have obtained Buddhawisdom It should be known that it was by means of this teaching that the Bodhisattvas in the past were able to perfect their pure faith that it is by means of this teaching that the Bodhisattvas of the present are perfecting their pure faith and that it is by means of this teaching that the Bodhisattvas of the future will perfect their pure faith Therefore men should diligently study and practice it Profound and comprehensive are the great principles of the Buddha which I have now summarized as faithfully as possible The Emperor Wu Questions Bodhidharma Introduction As soon as you see smoke on the other side of a mountain you know theres a fire the moment you see horns on the other side of a fence you know theres an ox Story The Emperor Wu of Liang asked the great teacher Bodhidharma What is the ultimate meaning of the holy truths Bodhidharma said Empty nothing holy One might have thought hed say something extraordinary Its quite clear The emperor said Who is answer ing m e Filled with embarrassment he tries to force himself to be astute Bodhidharma subsequently crossed the Yangtse River into the kingdom of Wei Foxy devil He cant avoid embarrassment He goes from west to east east to west Later the emperor brought this up to Master Zhi and asked him about it A poor man remembers an old debt The bystander has eyes Master Zhi said Did you recognize the man He should drive Master Zhi out of the country too Bodhidharma is here The emperor said he didnt know him So after all the Emperor Wu has understood Bodhidharmas case Master Zhi said  He is Mahasattva Avalokitesvara transmitting the seal of the Buddha mind An arbitrary explanation The elbow doesnt bend outwards The emperor regretful sent an emissary to invite Bodhidharma back After all Wu cant hold Bodhidharma back I told you he was a dunce Master Zhi said  Dont tell me youre going to send an emissary to get him When someone in the house to the east dies someone from the house to the west helps in the mourning Better they should all be driven out of the country at once Even if everyone in the country went he wouldnt return Master Zhi again deserves a beating He doesnt know the great illumination shines forth right where one is Commentary b Bodhidharma observed from afar that China had people receptive to the universal religion so he came by sea to transmit purely the mind seal to enlighten the deluded Not establishing verbal for mulations he pointed directly to peoples minds so that they would see the essence and realize Buddhahood If you can see in this way you have a share of freedom and will not be spun around pursuing words Everything will become manifest to you and there after you will be able to converse with the Emperor Wu and will naturally see how the second patriarchs mind was pacified What need is there to go on distinguishing right and wrong discriminating gain and loss Even so how many people are capable of this The Emperor Wu once put on religious vestments and person ally lectured on the Light Emitting Wisdom Scripture inducing a shower of celestial flowers and a transformation of earth to gold He studied the Path and served the Buddha issuing orders throughout his realm to build temples and ordain monks practicing in accord with the teaching People called him the Buddha Heart emperor When Bodhidharma first saw the Emperor Wu the emperor asked I have built temples and ordained monks what merit is there in this Bodhidharma said There is no merit immedi ately dousing the emperor with foul water If you can penetrate this statement there is no merit you can see Bodhidharma in person Now tell me why is there no merit at all in building temples and ordaining monks Where does the meaning of this lie The Emperor Wu held discussions with Dharma Master Louyue Mahasattva Fu and Prince Zhaoming about the two truths real and conventional According to the teaching the real truth is used to explain that things are not existent and the conventional truth is used to explain that things are not nonexistent The nonduality of the real and the conventional is the ultimate mean ing of the holy truths This is the most subtle and abstruse point of the doctrinal schools hence the emperor picked this ultimate paradigm to ask Bodhidharma What is the ultimate meaning of the holy truths Bodhidharma answered Empty nothing holy No one in the world can get out of this Bodhidharma cut through for him with a single stroke of the sword How many people these days misunderstandgiving play to their spirits putting a glare in their eyes they say Empty nothing holy  Fortunately there is no connection My teacher Wuzu once said If only you can penetrate this Empty nothing holy you can return home and sit in peace Bodhidharma is outstanding in this Hence it is said that if you can penetrate one statement you pen etrate a thousand myriad statements all at the same time Then you are naturally in command An ancient said Even to crush your bones and shatter your body would not be sufficient recom pense when one statement is clear you transcend billions Responding directly to the emperor Bodhidharma had already leaked quite a bit When you get to this point as to whether there is something or nothing pick and you fail Master Duan composed a verse on this story Ordinarily a single arrow fells a single eagle Another arrow is already too many Bodhidharma went right back to sit in the mountains Lord of Liang speak no more of going to summon him  Since the emperor didnt understand him Bodhidharma se cretly left the country He crossed the Yangtse River into Wei at that time under the control of the northern Toba tribe When Bodhidharma arrived there he did not appear for any more audiences but went directly to Shaolin monastery where he sat facing a wall for nine years and taught the second patriarch People thereabouts called him the WallGazing Brahmin The Emperor Wu of Liang later asked Master Zhi about what had transpired at his meeting with Bodhidharma Zhi said Did you recognize the m an The emperor said he didnt know him It seems to be similar but it really isnt the same People often misunder stand and say that Bodhidharma was giving the emperor an answer about Chan while the emperor was replying to Master Zhi in terms of the knowledge of recognition This has nothing to do with it So tell me how could Wu have answered when Master Zhi questioned him Why didnt he strike him dead with a single blow and avoid looking foolish Instead the Emperor Wu answered him frankly and said he didnt know Master Zhi saw his chance and acted he said He is Mahasattva Avalokitesvara transmitting the seal of the Buddha mind  The emperor felt regret and was going to send an emissary to bring Bodhidharma back When Zhi said He is Mahasattva Avaloktesvara transmitting the seal of the Buddha mind if Wu had driven him out of the country that would have amounted to something This must be a mistake in the tradition But I will not discuss the matter of what is recorded in tradition now all that is important is to understand the gist of the matter Is Master Zhi Avalokitesvara If they are Avalokitesvara why are there two But why only two They are legion Later in Wei the precept master Guangtong and the canon master Bodhiruci debated with Bodhidharma Bodhidharma elimi nated formalism and pointed to the mind because of their biased and limited judgments Guangtong and Bodhiruci could not bear this and developed feelings of malice He was interred at Dinglin Temple on Bear Ear Mountain Later the ambassador Song Yun of Wei met Bodhi dharma in the Congling Range in Chinese Turkistan walking along with one shoe in his hand I saw him without seeing him met him without meeting him encountered him without en countering him I will always regret this deeply Youve stumbled past him without even realizing it Verse The holy truths are empty How to discern the point Heavens He sure isnt a great man How could he avoid the growth of brambles Though everyone in the land pursues him he wont return A double case Why pursue him Where is he Where is the spirit of a great person Forever and aye vain remembrance What limit is there to the pure wind circling the earth Then Master Xuedou looked around to the right and left and said Is there any patriarch here So you want to retract your statement Acting like this still hes gotten somewhere Commentary Xuedous verse on this story is like skillfully performing a sword dance sure and relaxed in midair naturally not running afoul of the point Without such ability as soon as one picked it up one would run afoul of the point and injure the hand Usually verses on ancient stories just explain Chan in a round about way the general rule for presenting old stories is just to settle the case on the basis of the facts Xuedou confronts him saying right off  The holy truths are empty  How to discern the point To that first phrase Xuedou adds this latter one undeni ably extraordinary So tell me after all how do you discern the point Even if you have iron eyes or bronze eyes you will still grope without finding When you get to this point can you figure it out by means of ordinary intellect Xuedou says how will all you Chan practitioners discern the point Someone who understands will understand without anything being said someone who does not yet under stand will surely divide them into two Everyone usually says that Xuedou was just repeating the story not realizing that he has thoroughly versified the story in four lines After that out of compassion Xuedou versifies what happened Henceforth he secretly crossed the river  How could he avoid the growth of brambles Bodhidharma originally came to this coun try to loosen sticking points and remove bonds for people to pull out the nails and extract the pegs to cut away the brambles why does it say he produced brambles This does not refer only to that tim ethe brambles are already several yards deep right where you are now Though everyone in the land pursues him he wont return  Forever and aye vain remembrance But where is Bodhidharma If you see Bodhidharma you will see where Xuedou helps people in the end Xuedou fearing people would pursue intellectual views turned the mainspring and set forth his own view Stop remembering  What limit is there to the pure wind circling the earth Once you stop remembering how are things right where you are Xuedou says right here and now there is a pure wind circling the earth in the heavens and on the earth what limitation is there Xuedou picks up the affairs of all ages and throws them down right in front of you What limit is there does not just apply to Xuedou at that tim efor you right now what limit is there At this point can you call it a donkey Can you call it a horse Can you call it a patriarch How will you describe it People often say Xuedou is employing the patriarch but fortunately this has no connection Then tell me whats it all about after all Even the Buddhas of past present and future can only know it for themselves the leading teachers of successive generations have not been able to bring it out fully At this point how will you ask for aid Even to say Buddha is trailing mud and dripping water even to say Chan is to be filled with shame Adepts who have studied for a long time need not wait for it to be said latecoming beginners must look into it Story Zhaozhou said to the assembly What is this old guy doing Dont make such complications The ultimate Way is without difficulty just avoid discrimination What is in front of your eyes The third patriarch is still alive As soon as there are words this is discrimination this is clarity Two heads three faces Dont brag so much When a fish swims through the water is turbulent when a bird flies by feathers fall I am not within clarity Wheres the old fellow going Do you preserve anything or not Hes lost Theres one or a half At that time a monk asked Since you are not within clarity what do you preserve He gives him a good rejoinder that ought to shut him up Zhaozhou said Even I dont know At this deadly rejoinder the old fellow has fallen back three thousand miles The monk said Since you dont know why then do you say you are not in clarity Watch and see where hell run the monks chased him up a tree Zhaozhou said You have managed to ask about the matter you can go now Commentary Zhaozhou often used to bring up this saying which is simply Just avoid discrimination This is from the Poem on Faith in Mind by the third patriarch which says The ultimate Way is without difficulty  Just avoid discrimination Just do not hate or love  And you  be open and clear  As soon as you understand in this way youve already stumbled past nailed down stuck in glue what can you do Why does he tell people to preserve Perceive the meaning on the hook dont stick to the zero point of the scale This monk coming forth was indeed extraordinary grabbing Zhaozhou s gap he proceeded to press him Chan followers these days also say when questioned I dont know either I dont under stand  nevertheless while they are on the same track they are not in the same groove This monk had something extraordinary about him that is why he was able to ask Since you dont know why do you say you L This is why it is said While were reviling each other you may lockjaws with me while were spitting at one another you may spew me with slobber While Zhaozhou ordinarily never dealt with people by beating or shouting and just used ordinary speech nevertheless no one in the world could handle him Because he never had so many conceptions or judgments he could present sideways and use up side down oppose or accord having great freedom Verse The ultimate Way is without difficulty A triple case He gulps a mouthful of frost What is he saying The words are true the speech is true When a fish swims through the water is turbulent Its fragmented He smeared it In one there are many kinds He should analyze it what end will there be in just one kind In two there is no duality Yet theres four five six seven Why create complications On the horizon the sun rises the moon sets Its presented right to your face above and below it extends boundlessly Dont lift or lower your head Beyond the balustrade the mountains deepen the waters grow chill Once dead one doesnt revive Do you feel your hair standing on end in a chill When consciousness ends in the skull how can joy remain He twinkles his eyes inside a coffin Worker Lu is a fellow student of his In a dead tree the dragons song is not yet ended The dead tree blooms again Bodhidharma travels east Difficult difficult A false teaching is hard to uphold What place is this to speak of difficulty or ease Discrimination See for yourself The ultimate Way is without difficulty Then he follows up with The words are true the speech is true  He raises one corner but doesnt come back with the other three when he says In one there are many kinds  In two theres no duality this is like three corners returning to one But tell me where is it that the words and speech are true In one why are there nevertheless many kinds yet in two there is no duality If you dont have eyes where will you seek Ultimately how to attain peace When the wind comes the trees move when the waves swell the boats ride high In spring it sprouts in summer it matures in fall it is har vested in winter it is stored with uniform equanimity everything ends of itself Thus this fourline verse abruptly cuts off but Xuedou has extra ability so he opens up the closed bag and gives a summary account The ultimate Way is without difficulty The words are true the speech is true In one there are many kinds In two there is no duality Though there arent so many things when the sun rises over the horizon the moon goes down and when the mountains beyond the balustrade deepen the waters grow cold Isnt this where mind and objects are both forgotten united in one whole If you can penetrate and see through naturally it will be sublime If you dont forget your intellectual understanding youll be fragmented and definitely wont understand this kind of talk When consciousness ends in the skull how can joy remain  In a dead tree the dragons song is not yet ended This is just a bit of combination These are from stories of ancient questions about the Way which Xuedou has drawn out pierced through and strung on the same thread to use in versifying The ultimate Way is without difficulty  Just avoid discrimination People these days dont understand the ancients meaning and only chew on the words and gnaw on the phrases when will they ever be done A monk asked Xiangyan What is the Way Xiangyan said A dragons song in a dead tree The monk asked What is the person on the Way Xiangyan said Eyeballs in a skull The dragons song in the dead tree is true vision of the Way When the skull has no consciousness then the eyes are clear When joy and consciousness end all news is ended How can one discriminate the pure in the midst of impurity Even so theres been no duality at all As Baizhang said All words mountains rivers and the whole earth each come back to oneself Whatever Xuedou offers and takes back must ultimately be referred to oneself Tell me how did Xuedou help people when he said Discrimi nation Clarity See for yourself The fine coloring he has you see for yourself The great function ap pears without abiding by fixed principles in order that you may realize that there is something transcendental that covers heaven and earth yet cannot be grasped Story Great Master Ma was unwell Hes dragging in other people The temple superintendent asked him  Teacher how are you these days Four hundred four diseases break out all at once Theyll be lucky if theyre not see ing off a dead monk in three days This is in the course of human duty The great master said Sun Face Buddha Moon Face Bud dha Commentary Great Master Ma was unwell so the temple superintendent asked him  Teacher how are you these days The great master re plied Sun Face Buddha Moon Face Buddha If the enlightened teachers had not dealt with others on the basis of the fundamen tal matter how could we have the shining light of this Path If you know the point of this story then you walk alone through the red sky if you dont know time and again youll lose the way be fore a crag of dead trees If you are someone in your own right when you get here you must have the ability to drive off the plowmans ox and to snatch away the hungry mans food before you will see how Master Ma helps people These days many people say that Master Ma was taking on the superintendent fortunately this has no connection Right now in this assembly there are many who misunderstand they put a glare in their eyes and say Its here the left eye is the Sun Face and the right eye is the Moon Face What relevance does this have Youll never see it even in a dream So when Master Ma spoke like this where was his meaning At this point how could you attain tranquillity This is why it is said The single road of transcendence has not been transmitted by the sages students bother with forms like monkeys grasping at reflections This Sun Face Buddha Moon Face Buddha is extremely difficult to see even Xuedou finds it difficult to put into verse But since he has seen all the way through he uses his lifes work to the full to make his comment Do you want to see Xuedou Look at the text below Verse Sun Face Buddha Moon Face Buddha When he opens his mouth you see his guts Like two facing mirrors with no image in between What kind of people were the ancient emperors Too lofty Dont belittle them They can be valued high or low For twenty years I have struggled This is your own fall into the weedsits none of my business Heres a mute eating a bitter melon How many times I have gone down into the blue dragons cave for you How was it worth this Dont misuse your mind Sad man dont speak to sad people Is worth recounting To whom would you speak of it If you speak of it to sad people it will sadden them to death Cleareyed Chan practitioners should not take it lightly Fall back three thousand miles Commentary When the Emperor Shenzong was on the throne  he thought that this verse ridiculed the state so he wouldnt let it be included in the Buddhist Canon Sun Face Buddha Moon Face Buddha Having brought this up then he says What kind of people were the ancient emperors What does he mean As it is said Letting down his hook in the four seas he only fishes for power ful dragons This one line has already completed the verse after wards Xuedou versifies how he concentrated on study all his life For twenty years I have struggled How many times I have gone down into the blue dragons cave for you What is he like Hes like a man going into the blue dragons cave to seize the pearl Afterwards he broke through obscurity Though one might have thought this extraordinary after all it just amounts to What kind of people were the ancient emperors What is Xuedou getting at People mostly do not see Xuedous meaning but only say that he is ridiculing the state To understand in this way is merely an emotional view This line comes from Chanyues poem The Be havior of Barons  which says Clothed in flowery brocades falcons on their wrists They go about at leisure their manner arrogant They know nothing about the difficulties of sowing and harvesting What kind of people were the ancient emperors Xuedou says This distress is worth recounting cleareyed Chan practitioners must not take it lightly How many people live within the blue dragon s cave Even if youre a cleareyed practitioner with an eye on your forehead and a talisman under your arm shining through the four continents when you get here you must not take it lightly you must be thoroughgoing Story When Deshan arrived at Guishan Hes being onesided the foxy devil he carried his bundle with him into the teaching hall Un avoidably he causes people to doubt
