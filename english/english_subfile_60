At that moment the Blessed One entered the absorption known as the stainless victory banner that completely subdues all disturbing emotionsWhatever is accomplished hereby accomplishes all In particular the supreme and the commonthere are faults tooBodhisattvas should be without laziness keeping the perfectly pure buddhafields in mindIndeed they all had the five extrasensory powers and captivating speechWhat are such actsThey joyfully circled the sublime city of Kapilavastu and then rested by the gates without harming anyoneProtect guard and conceal those dharmabhāṇakasA noble being will reject them like a bowl of excrement The edge of a sword or poison ivySimilarly they do not apprehend the notion that the applications of mindfulness are empty or the notion that they are not empty There is the meditative stability named Indestructible Maṇḍala  There is the meditative stability named Shoulder Ornament of the Victory Banners CrestI will explain this spiritual attainment of wisdom By which the state of a god is swiftly attainedParasols standards and flags were hoistedSomeone who is attached to words Will not know the meaning of the teaching As another analogy when a woman is carrying a child in her womb she does not know whether the child in her belly is a boy or a girlBodhisattva mahāsattvas who have the restraint of speech attain the eighty secondary signs of a great beingYou were born in Kapilāhvaya But then you renounced the residence of the ākyasThe sublime sage was overjoyed at the prospect of seeing this excellent beingBecause some religious practitioners and priests believe that one becomes purified by eating very little food I must also be diligent in fastingThey will never touch unpleasant tangible objectsBhagavān that teaching and instruction that the bhagavāns have taught well The clairvoyance that reveals many realms The miraculous powers that reveal infinite buddhasThey understand the significance of causes and conditions coming togetherThose who wish to perfectly master different kinds of meditative concentration should pay homage to the bodhisattva kāśagarbha during the watch of dawn and make as many offerings as possibleVenerable Lord so is it the case that when great bodhisattva beings train accordingly they train in the transcendent perfection of wisdom and in doing so that they train without apprehending anythingSimilarly they perceive minds endowed with grasping correctly as minds that are endowed with grasping and they perceive minds free from grasping correctly as minds that are free from grasping Indeed they correctly perceive minds that are composed minds that are distracted minds that are narrow minds that are spacious minds that are equipoised minds that are not equipoised minds that are liberated minds that are unliberated and minds that are surpassed as minds that are surpassed and so forthAt that time you rescued a man frightened and terrified out of an avalancheEqual toward all things he does not discriminate between thema stride that points out the path to liberation a stride that renders powerless the strength of demonsFurthermore the temple was surrounded on all sides by more such uraga sandalwoodencircled by a hundred nāgasHe is the color of gold and his body Illuminates the entire world and then satiate the wisdom consortAnd so their six sense faculties become deludedWe pay homage we pay homage to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara who brings freedom from fearThey have no attachment to the three realms They have transcended the three realmsThey cannot cultivate the noble eightfold pathI myself will never ravish order someone to ravish or rejoice in someone ravishing harassing or raping anyones spousenor is he a nonconceptionWithout resorting to punishment or acts of violence the king will rule with the Dharma bringing peace and order to the entire vast kingdom that extends all the way to the oceansBlessed One if the merit of even one being with a quantity of merit on par with a wheelbearing monarch is immeasurable and fathomlessIndeed anything nonexistent could not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThey remain in the peace perfect peace of samādhi And in that way they are trained in the restraint of the body When the Worlds Guide is in nirvāṇa In that future time there will beHe was compatible with ordinary people because he appreciated the excellence of ordinary meritson four golden chariots Fit for all tasks With wheels with a thousand spokesand if a tempest blew them to the island of the rākṣasīs and if among them one being would call on AvalokiteśvaraYour Majesty in your lands we have been reduced to a state where we are not fit to be merchantsI should entrust these ornaments and the horse Kaṇṭhaka to Chanda and then send him backWe should all search together This is not something of little importanceThey thus understand also that all phenomena are of the essential nature of the limit of realitystrike the effigies of the two targetsNoble one the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara attained that kind of faith in the teaching of Tathāgata MeghadundubhisvararājaWhen they have learned it they should teach it widely to othersLikewise they will establish them in the four meditative concentrations the four immeasurable aspirations and the four formless absorptionsBhagavān this is how it appears to usSome are frightened by the four errors and hence relish the taste of the four perceptionsHe taught to his followers the Dharma That phenomena are empty with no self and no soulThe Bhagavān was dwelling at the place of the nāga king Sāgara together with a great assembly of  bhikṣus as well as a multitude of bodhisattvas and mahāsattvasCreated by an expert artist And like a blossoming king of the sal trees This is the secret ambrosia Which vanquishes grey hair wrinkles and deaththoughts of agitation thoughts of indolence thoughts of distraction or thoughts of stupidity thenYou do no wrong and are the sole friend of beings Supreme Puṣpacandra why did I slay youWith mindfulness as the foundation And knowledge as my training I act carefullywho have been favored by the transcendent perfection of wisdom and who are not without skill in meansthere will not be the word angerWhen he arrived he told akra lord of the godsFor the last billion eonsA red hot metal ball will be inserted into their mouthsWith the light emitted from the precious jewel the entirety of the female quarters are bathed in lightAs soon as the monk Vīradatta learned that the merchants son had dieddraped with hundreds of thousands of brocade tasselsVenerable Lord The transcendent perfection of wisdom dispels the blindness of afflicted mental states and all false viewsSimilarly they themselves should cultivate the four applications of mindfulnessdistinguishing the aspects of kleśas and purification and not objectifying themYou accomplish that which is difficult to do The difficult deeds that are in this mortal worldThat have been taught by the unsurpassable Jina You should quickly become instructed in this samādhi And then the attainment of supreme enlightenment will not be difficult What you may wonder does the bodhisattvas trust in teachings on the principle of a single vehicle consist init is because the transcendent perfection of wisdom is nonconceptualAt that very instant the four great kings approached King uddhodana and spoke to himbut discern that they should investigate itSubhūti all things have the basis of the variety of false views great bodhisattva beings too do not transgress this modalityThus they will think Brahmins royalty townspeople and country dwellers will see me as a mendicant a monk a field of generosity and so they will offer me almsThey defeat all who are adversaries They extensively propagate the enlightenment of buddhahood Then akra mighty lord of the gods thoughtHe is the one whose voice resounds like the voice of BrahmāThey were trustworthy holders of the treasure of the jinas They were terrified of the entire three realms If you ask what world it reveals to be calm empty and so forthBlessed One what causes and conditions make bodhisattvas display all these events right from their display of death within the fine palace of the Heaven of Joy through to passing into the

just as you have saidit is wonderful that the bodhisattva Maitreya is so supremely eloquent that the bodhisattva Maitreya teaches the Dharma with such words of certainty and all of what you said up to his teaching the Dharma with such memorable wordsSimilarly they should be attentive to the notion that physical forms are imbued with suffering without a self prone to ill health prone to pustules

completely filled with priceless precious jewelsI killed my fatherHe gives that man work to do And by degrees makes the man confidentIt is because they intensify the production of their respective elements to the point of consummation that they are called sense fields of total consummationKnowing all phenomena to be insubstantial and knowing them to be like space they direct sentient beings to the nature of phenomenaDivine being moreover whenever a bodhisattva realizes what was not realized before and wholeheartedly refrains from dispute he is an irreversible bodhisattvathey do not apprehend virtuous phenomena nor do they apprehend nonvirtuous determinate indeterminate mundane supramundane conditioned unconditioned contaminated or uncontaminated phenomenaThe Blessed One replied

deign to explain O lordshould know that they abide on the irreversible levelAnd obtain the peace of this stainless samādhi and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas have the defining characteristic of unsurpassibility but the tathāgatas attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to the absence of their defining characteristicsThey who have heard or retained even one verse

with stūpas made of precious materialsI shall guide sentient beings with the magnificence of buddhahoodnot with negative conduct nor through austerities attached conduct or timid conduct eitherIt is impossible and there is no chance Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections who investigate the emptiness of internal phenomena and who possess such attributes of pristine cognition would perceive formative predispositions as imbued with happiness describe formative predispositions as being imbued with happiness or enter into association with the three world systems That is an impossibilityBut Blessed One replied youthful Mañjuśrī all phenomena are the nature of the realm of phenomena Hence Blessed One the nature of the realm of phenomena

inhalation in virtuous ways for the benefit of sentient beingsYou found peace immortality and the happiness of that supreme enlightenmentA king who was pursuing a deer Heard their voices and entered that groveBecause of those causes after they died they fell to the lower realms and were reborn in the hellsoffered many quintillions of huge vast censers made of various divine precious materialsPāpīyān moreover when a bodhisattva is motivated by the superior intent of the mind of awakening and thereby gives away all possessions without concern for any inner or outer entities such a bodhisattva will have set out with superior intentOf the elders jñātakauṇḍinya like the eldest of a kings sons foremost among those practicing pure conduct for a long time has passed since his ordinationand those sentient beings who are present in the world systems of the great trichiliocosm will indeed listenAjita those beings who have just once developed aspiration developed motivation or gained faith when this Dharma teaching that teaches the extent of the lifespan of the Tathāgata was taught how much merit have such noble men or noble women createdThe passions do indeed constitute the family of the tathāgatasfine woolen cloth of red and various other colorsThey follow the Dharma but not based on feeling perception formation or consciousnessIt destroys anger the first of the adornmentsThey discern that physical forms are calm and do not focus on themIt allows people to engage in activitiesand similarly they will teach in an apprehending manner that the ten powers of the tathāgatas are impermanentAnd had unequaled patience within all worlds Supuṣpacandra has been slain in the capital You should know that so long will renunciate modes of conduct be maintained in the presence of the tathāgatasyet relatively they have accomplished all the facultiesWe do not give rise to any doubts whatsoever We who hear these words directly from the Lord of the WorldWhen skillfully gathering all roots of virtue they are irreproachableThe signs and symptoms Of how they possess children should also be describedIt is born of the path of the ten virtuesgossipI too will be foreordained to attain thatand the inconceivably numerous kinds of comprehension of names concerning purification Those are the fourOn this seat one must paint the Blessed Lady with all her beautiful features and then consecrate her imageIt is only because of the different practices of beings that there are said to be three yānasand those very swords sever their limbs and kill themAll bhūtas will be turned backAs the newly ordained monk committed to these things his father the householder arrived and askedtouch tangible objects without there being in gnosis any contactSuch is the bodhisattvas aspiration of praise to all buddhasThey are attended by sixty thousand women attired in silk dresses andproceed as before and stick this mantra into the effigys heart and nail its feetThey will always regard you as their teacher And love you in the same way as they loved meHe embraces a buddhafield to the same extent that through entrance into that buddhafield living beings increase their noble spiritual facultiesThe tathāgatas have attained nonstupidity with respect to all thingsWhat is certainty in the truth It is the cessation of consciousness and the nonarising of namesandformThat is to say they will not be reborn among the outcastes among the scavengers or garbage collectors among the reed flutemakers or among other inferior classes and so on up to and including in the eight unfavorable conditions for practicing the sacred doctrineOf beings to the highest enlightenmentwho reveals the path to all beingsIf you ask why Subhūti it is because in emptiness signlessness and

rose And adorned with all of the ornamentsOnce they have resided upon the seat of awakening bodhisattvas achieve the divine eye that is free of any hindrance impediment or obscuration  Ah You who are wealthy in discipline patience and austerity Ah You who possess the qualities of a handsome form and kindnessThe same refrain should be extensively applied here just as has been indicated in the context of the previous chapterIf you grant ordination without asking this a serious breach occursAt that time this buddha realm of mine Is filled with maruts and humansHe knows the phases and the degreesWhen seven days had passed a group of ākya boys five hundred strong assembledThe finality of existence is nonapprehensible owing to its utter purityIt is far removed from the applications of mindfulness and the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path and from the ten powers of the tathāgatas and the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasI will employ all means to make various fetters arise so the monks abandon this Dharma discourseYour Highness I beseech you quick say yes todayIt is transcending focusing upon the material Does the Jina teach this samādhi Reverend āriputra see how these flowers do not stick to the bodies of these great spiritual heroes the bodhisattvas This is because they

who are without anger and always honest Who have compassion for all beings And are respectful in the presence of the SugataThey should not accept any such things whether enjoyments wealth material objects or precious items whatever they may beSubhūti whether those great bodhisattva beings are going out returning standing sitting or lying down they go and come stand up sit and lie down in

perfection of wisdom what need one say when they have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood the genuinely perfect enlightenmentIt is the seat of truth because it does not deceive anyoneInstead they present all their offerings respectfully always expressing an attitude of respect reverence and worshipI will practice the six transcendent perfections until such demonic actions of sentient beings do not arise and even this buddhafield is fashioned of the seven precious things level like the palms of the hands in meditation and replete with diverse young trees diverse flowers diverse fruits diverse birds sweetly chirping and with an abundance of diverse rivers wells waterfalls pools ponds and reservoirsSince they do not associate with the afflictions they dispel the darkness of the afflictions of all living beingsThen those ministers will be made to develop shame about their previous unwholesome negative actionsI will definitely practice generosity by giving away my flesh and

diligent natureDont offer him food or drink for refreshment nor a place to rest his legsBlessed One those bodhisattva great beings who seek to gather an accumulation of merit correctly will listen to this absorption that encapsulates all meritI also find slander unpleasant I do not want to hear it do not like it and do not enjoy it Thereforeto dwell in isolated placesHence when asked they reveal

chapter The PastSome realms that were made of jewels And some that were the color of berylSimilarly they do not consider whether the truth of suffering is connected with the truth of the origin of sufferingThe supreme human knew his aspiration And taught him this supreme samādhi and similarly if he were to exhibit himself reborn in the Brahmā worldscome to the great city of Rājagṛha as the time has come to eat the midday meal in my gardenThe other absorptions are on the other hand known through their own wisdom as attained by means of maturationi The Bhagavān placed upon Candraprabhas head

abandoned evil actionsThe one possessing the syllable raFrom those two lotus flowers two beings miraculously appeared one bore the name Precious Mind and the other was called Perfect WealthLikewise virtuous action is formlessand they should think Thus I too will develop the determination to give up all such associationsKing uddhodana with a smile on his face asked the Bodhisattva in returnmay the stūpa that contains my body come into the presence of those tathāgatas in order to listen to this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaAs a way to venerate the Bodhisattva they had adorned the seat of awakeningThose who delight in this sūtra They will have no doubt or uncertainty Concerning the entire Dharma And they are near to nirvāṇa They might have gone in any directionAnd apply yourself to realizing the pathHaving taken up this sūtra Will become endowed with wisdom one billion realms of the Heaven of Increased Merit That dharmabhāṇaka with excellent qualities Supuṣpacandra came here to this cityand delights in divisive speech He wants to create obstacles to your lifeThe same refrain should be extensively applied to these states just as has been indicated in the context of namesand in the same way their cultivations of all other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities will not be interruptedThey all are dedicated to solitude And reject the level of worldly gatheringsheaded toward Vārāṇasī where they set up camp at the Deer Park by the Hill of the Fallen SagesTeacher your following is vast You have attracted these followersWhen the bodhisattvas who have practiced For ten million eonsSamantacandraAlthough all of these functions occur due to the conditional cause of the air element the air element possesses no formWhat we call tattva is tathatā itselfAgain Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings are endowed with two attributes they will not be subdued by any of those demonic forcesabandoned and let go of my headAt that time the king in this Jambudvīpa Was the lord of men whose name was Dṛdhadattaand who similarly offer instruction in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent perfection of generosityThose who passed by the Bodhisattva such as village boys or girls ox herders cow herders grass collectors wood collectors and those looking for dung all thought he was a demon made of dust They made fun of him and sprinkled him with dustSubhūti if you ask how this transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of unappraisable deedsTherefore once their bodies disintegrate wont they indeed have to be born in the great Hell of Incessant PainThey are at the door to deathlessness And they are close to enlightenmentNoble son under the rule of that king Attainment of Victory vehicles other than the Great Vehicle were unheard ofOne should live with a virtuous spiritual friend a virtuous companion a virtuous supportIt extinguishes all disturbing emotionsTheir voices are boundlessThose bodhisattva great beings who possess such an accumulation of generosity as this manifest inexhaustible and oceanlike meritYou may wonder noble son how bodhisattvas remain in the application of mindfulness with respect to feelingsand what does not burn is not extinguished such lack of extinction is the meaning of peaceYou have been my lowly servantthe emptiness of nondispersal the emptiness of inherent existenceThe one who possesses this sūtra And teaches it in the era of declineIt entails the completion of the five eyesAnd displaying abundant attractionsHaving pleased all the kings ministers brahmins householders monks nuns and male and female lay vow holdersThen a second man came and presented himself before uddhodanaand utterly unrealAt that time the joyful maidens who bring pleasure Beautiful as they are play melodious tunesJust as my sickness is unreal and nonexistent so the sicknesses of all living beings are unreal and nonexistentthe one who has perfected patience the most sublime through diligenceIn order to make offerings to the dharmabhāṇaka they brought divine parasolsSo very excellent The secret of which you have spoken will be of great benefit for the people of the futureAs the mendicants will be Attracted to the wives of others The wife with whom he sported made love and indulged all desires gave birth to a son with an extraordinarily long torsoFrom the right side Ekāgramati saidThe Bhagavān said to those bodhisattva mahāsattvasIf you ask in what way nonentities are empty of nonentities the term nonentities denotes unconditioned phenomenaWhen great bodhisattva beings through their attention endowed with omniscience abide in the meditative concentrations the immeasurable aspirations and the formless absorptions without confusing themHis wish was to become ordained and his mind was filled with the thought of leaving homeMoreover the tathāgatas definitively know the paths that lead everywhereBhaiṣajyarāja the noble men or noble women who after I have passed into nirvāṇa have faith in this Dharma teaching read it write it honor it and make others hear itāradvatīputra just as the light of the tathāgatas and the light of the moon and the sun are without foundationit was amidst those sentient beings who have base desires and raging attachment anger and delusionForms of yakṣas kumbhāṇḍas and mahoragas As well as rākṣasas hungry spirits and flesh eaters In any form that the world finds ugly and fierce All have been magically manifested there by these roguesThe exquisite and perfect mansion where the Bodhisattva lived was a source of supreme pleasures and joy In his palace his body was always pure and stainless he was adorned with flower garlands and jewelry and his limbs were scented with the finest and most sweetsmelling oilsthey have been honoring many hundred thousands of quintillions of buddhasthe samādhi named DayMakers Sublime IlluminationNoble son such is the bodhisattvas discipline purified of the three spheresSummon Master Māṭharasaliva nasal mucous pusnanda if the tathāgata explained everything about obscuration and nonobscuration the world and its gods would become confusedknowing the emptiness of the unique buddha qualitiesO the general of the great fierce army commands Svāhāthey taught the Dharma by using a variety of teachings on accomplishment and various teachings on causes reasons parables supports and skillful methodsThese are omens that foretell the departure of the best of charioteerswho were renowned for their great power who were mighty and illustriousI teach this enlightenment of buddhahood Through billions of various kinds of practices for all śrāvakas like the robesKaṇṭhaka then neighed with his fierce energy And although the sound could be heard for a mileAt this Bhikṣunī Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī and her following of six thousand bhikṣunīs and Bhikṣunī Yaśodharā and her following of four thousand bhikṣunīs were astonished and amazed by obtaining from the Bhagavān the prophecy of their highest complete enlightenmentHe does not praise himself with any other irrelevant motive and his praise is therefore never hypocritical pretentious or incorrectAmartyā replied the Blessed OneOne hundred samāptalambhas is called a gaṇanāgatiThey should offer to the LordHere I extinguished with the cool water of liberation The great fire of lust With its billowing smoke of thought Raging through the timber of objectsWe dedicate all the roots of virtue for the sake of awakeningFrom becoming arises birthknelt on their right knees

has realized awakening ungraspable and without abodeAnd that which is completely destroyed is not something one should cause to be destroyedand are perfect bannersMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings abide in the transcendent perfection of tolerance they will establish sentient beings many hundreds of billion trillions in number in tolerancethe unsurpassable guide who tamed beings the teacher of gods and humans the buddha the bhagavān named Candrasūryapradīpa It is the comprehension of all sounds and the attainment of joy It is the enjoyment of praising the sugatasSon of noble family any bodhisattva who arouses such an attitude is truly a bodhisattvaWhen the physician knows that his sons have been cured he then reveals himself to themThey are spiteful savage and maliciousIn this tantra I explain in detailNo perception of anything can be foundnot even an atom is transferred in such a case from this world to the world beyondThe Blessed One then addressed those gods inhabiting the world system of desire and those inhabiting the world system of form as followsFrom poison blood black mustard and salt Create the form accomplish it and burn itand it would cause bhikṣus who have great pride to fall into a great abyssWhile the child was playing with a group of children he showed them his sex organs at which point they asked himand then appropriates yet another set of five aggregatesThe entire realm of the Heaven of Joy is gloomyUpon the Victorious Guide of MenThese wishfulfilling trees around the walkways are like manystoried mansionsare internally without support and also they are externally without support and nor do they have any support in between those twoGirls you must go now to the seat of awakening and examine the Bodhisattva Does he have desires or notand a shower of flowers rained downBeing in this way inclined to utter solitude they perceive the wilderness to be a place of excellent qualities and a place of peaceEnlightenment free of abstention and undertaking is energylesshe never had a moments regret One who is established in this supreme restraint Dwells in compassion and also in equanimityafter they had exchanged courtesies upon meeting each other they both sat down on a flat rockin the same vein this sacred doctrine is compatible with the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasShe then arose from her bed and made her way down from the upper floors of the palace surrounded by her female attendantsThen why does the sun rise over the worldBhikṣus the lifespan of the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū was fiftyfour hundred thousand quintillion eonsThe light then went farther and illuminated the seat upon which his mother was seatedThe wise rich man sees this and thinks This unwise fool has inferior aspirationat this time I teach this single Buddhayāna O wise ones Through the best of parablesIn an isolated place one should draw a maṇḍala andSince he understands that all phenomena are like an illusion a mirage a dream a reflection of the moon in water an echo and a hallucination he is known as the one who realizes the teaching that is free of disturbing emotionsAs an analogy the small seed of a banyan tree produces the tall and enormous king of trees with an expanse of thousands of branches and twigsāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena constitute a bodhisattvaUninjured and unharmed you should know that they will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThis family must have many men and womenwho seek an occasion and look for an opportunity to harm the person named suchandsuchWhat are those ten Such bodhisattvas possess an extremely high degree of accomplishment in the training of hearers an extremely high degree of accomplishment in the training of solitary buddhas and an extremely high degree of accomplishment in the training of bodhisattvasEven the names of the contemplations of impurity do not exist internally nor do they exist externally and nor do they abide between these twoI will seek out the Buddha the Dharma and the Saṅgha with undivided faithOne should drink the juice of moonseed with honeythey are consequently reborn in those world systems where they dwell and are presentIf it releases heat an enthrallment will take placePure Beacon of LightNoble son go and survey the wide earthnanda he is attended by sixty thousand merchants holding an abundance of wealth and goldOne will succeed at that very momentThe bodhisattva will then by any means teach that person a Dharma instruction that renders their karma as light as the wings of a beeSon of noble family through these eight instructions will one attain the absorption that encapsulates all meritand the scent of a flower arises on account of the wind feelings arise because of consciousness and volition arises on account of feelingsas being a great yogin a sublime yoginSubhūti you have said that this vehicle apprehends neither the limit of past time nor does it apprehend the limit of future time or the intervening present andIf you ask what these five areThe five colors indicate the five familiesOne should take the triple refugeTranscending the scope of eye ear nose tongue body and mind he is not

to guide Are they easy to purify Are they not a cause of sadness for the Bhagavānthe Sugata the Teacher added the following versesall the sounds that arise outside and inside within a world realm of a thousand million worldsUpon hearing those sounds the sentient beings born there are moved to contemplate the BuddhaThey take up discipline and abide by itmany young Licchavi gentlemen came to the place where I was and said to meYou were not disturbed and only felt pity for himAnd remaining in the forests Walking upon the walkwaysseen as a Dharma king and seen as a savior of beingswhen even physical forms are themselves nonapprehensible in the real natureSurrounded by learned menOne will know the past the future and the present And also the thoughts of othersWhen they are manifest they make them expand until they become the tree of omniscienceGuide quick direct your mind toward renunciation without delayand if you can make a gift to all living beings and an offering to all the noble ones and buddhas out of even a single measure of almsKilling and also stealingSimilarly they neither associate the sensory element of the tongue the sensory element of tastes and the sensory element of gustatory consciousness with omniscience nor do they disassociate them therefromIt is not understood by the extremists Nor by the demonsnor not liberationThey then describe and reveal the path of perfect enlightenment to those who are earnestly intent upon unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentShould be kept in the shade And consumed to remove excess bileThose who in future times Listen to this unsurpassable sūtraLove does not seem to lead to the genuine view of the noble onesHe took ordination with four million buddhas and presented five and a half million buddhas with offeringsWithin six months one will be able to remember whatever one has learnedNoble son you may then wonder about the character of the bodhisattvas excellent patience that liberates based on a commitmentHe is not nameTo those who serve for many millions of eons Heroic buddhas as numerous as the Ganges sands  Like the mantra of the ḍākinīThe bodhisattva Vidyuddeva declaredOrdinary people do not apprehend the sameness of the three timesIf he isnt happy he can always give up the life of a sageHe is then told Or further if you were to obtain silk or a large piece of cotton wool muslin raw silk a large piece of woolThis means that within his straight throat he has a gullet that is straight and not crooked enabling him to swallow without hesitationThe brahmin answeredAnd be as loving to the servants and maids as she is to herself they continue to turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine which cannot be turned by virtuous ascetics brāhmin priests gods demonic forces Brahmā deities or anyone elseOne does not perceive the two views the view of the self and the view of the otherWhen the assembled crowd saw this they exclaimedVajrapāṇi I shall now teach a wheel that strikes the obstructors within the ground below So listen onepointedly and I will teachFor as long as your youth has not passed and you are in your primeReverend nanda what are you doing on the threshold of this house with your bowl in your hand so early in the morningwill accrue these qualities and advantages in this life and in the next lifeBy eating it one will live for five hundred yearsthe meditative stability endowed with ideation and scrutiny the meditative stability free from ideation and merely endowed with scrutiny the meditative stability free from both ideation and scrutinyAfter seeing this he thought to himselfA goddess or demigoddessthe nosebaseWe did not reject the teaching nor as we left did we say anything unpleasantPlay music sing songs and stay awake and alert through the nightBeyond the paths of the māras this is the path of no pathAnd may I be safe From all perils and misfortunesThey should also praise and rejoice in others who turn or will turn the wheel of the sacred doctrineabout whom it may rightly be saidSimilarly the cessation of fundamental ignorance is empty of the cessation of fundamental ignorance and the cessation of the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death is empty of the cessation of aging and death and the restSon of noble family the accumulation of learning is undefiled devoid of grasping and does not ripen in the aggregatesnot reasoning not nonreasoningThe five classes of living beings would not even be differentiatedassemblies of bhūtas in the westSimilarly Subhūti the self is uncreated undestroyed and unconditionedOr I will end up with an inferior ordinary manThe Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva MahāpratibhānaHe will belong to the lineage of kings a great universal monarchHe does not think about this nor reflect upon it he is under the influence of the bodyI thought that for their benefit I should create this nirvāṇa as a restAs soon as you saw Buddha DīpaṃkaraThis greatly illuminating light From the ūrṇā hair between his eyebrows You remain unobscuredNow however many beings one may think there are in what one thinks of as the realm of beings the ThusGone One has said that there are many more than thatEvery tree in that perfect grove had leaves flowers and fruits even though it was out of seasonembody both Individual liberation and bodhisattva vowsThey were expert in the way of the Dharma which is straight peaceful subtle gentle hard to see and difficult to realizeThe noncoming tathatā is the tathatā that does not goNoble son it is a similar case when bodhisattvas send forth emanations without the use of thoughts or concepts without having to apply themselves and without having to create anythingThen Mañjuśrī all those men women girls and boys who could see the abode of the ThirtyThree along with akra lord of the gods and his Palace of Victory reflected in the wide earth of berylThey perceive divine objects but are free from attachmentHe is like the moon the one that beings never tire of beholdingAs thousands of joyous gods and humans see the qualities of the newbornThey are not two but indivisibleWith these ripened miraculous powers They go to millions of realmsTheir patience is boundlessDuring breaks practitioners Of mediocre and inferior facultiesHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the five powersknowledge of the distinctive level of the pratyekabuddha and knowledge of the distinctive level of the bodhisattvaThinking The Tathāgata remains they would perceive him as easy to meet and would not perceive him as difficult to meet They would think The Tathāgata is with us and would not be diligently dedicated to escaping from the three realms They would not view a tathāgata as being rareFrom contact arises craving which is the desire for happinessUnsurpassed for your vast wisdomLord when Vimalakīrti had discoursed thus two hundred of the deities in that assembly attained the tolerance of the birthlessness of thingsInconceivable great heroHe departed from it wishing to benefit beings And came to my city which is a mass of sin ivWhat does flaw here refer toHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of mental imagesYet when we saw the body of the kings wifeThey had profound understanding fearlessness Great powers and great miracles Subhūti that is right It is just as you have saidwho had turned to nirvāṇa and away from saṃsāraBut a being without equal Inexhaustible like the oceanOṃ vaiśravaṇa puṣpe hūṃ svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇa dhupe hūṃ svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇa dīpaṃ hūṃ svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇa gandhe hūṃ svāhā Oṃ vaiśravaṇa naivedye hūṃ svāhāIn the center of the village one should prepare a fire pit for the rite of pacifying with five types of sacrificial wood and five types of grain smeared with ghee and perform a homa offeringIn that realm hearers and solitary buddhas will be unheard ofnot relying on others with respect to buddha qualitieswill not be discouraged from benefitting themselves and from benefitting othersusing divine fabrics garlands perfumes flowers music and other divine delightsLikewise they discern that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are impermanentMoreover Subhūti this Great Vehicle of great bodhisattva beings comprisesTheir behavior is perfectThose delightful jewel trees Are uniquely beautiful Some were made of the vaśirāja gem and others of wishfulfilling jewelsIt is controlling the mindBeing focused on worshiping and venerating is transcendent concentrationcannot be expressedPlease wait here until I bring the jeweled structure that delighted the BodhisattvaThe consciousnesses have already been describedWhen the guides of the world pass into nirvāṇaNeither do they conceive of attributes Because they have eliminated all error What are the four waysThe other brahmin remained silent as Tiṣya pointed out the texts faultsand the concept of sense fieldsabandoning the real and unrealThis is how all compounded phenomena appear Based on causes and conditionsdo not hesitate in any respect whatsoever wondering whether they are irreversible or reversibleSon of noble family in the same way mindwhich is pervaded by emptiness the ultimate reality of the tathāgatais by nature utterly pristine and pureTherefore let us bring forth a magical display that delivers the highest bliss to all these sentient beingsI remember a time in the past Inconceivable innumerable eons agothe gandharva Pañcaśikha in order to honor and serve him descended from the sky accompanied by the sound of five hundred musical instrumentsand to be skilled in discerning the mind while not focusing on the mind as being a mindDivine being declared Mañjuśrī according to your contention neither benefit nor harm can be observed with respect to the unconditionedThere are many awnings there In a variety of different formsSeeking neither good nor evil the understanding of the nonduality of the significant and the meaningless is the entrance into nondualityThat you will thus become a bhagavān ārisuta you should be delightedwhich discerning persons would be fixated on the fruit of entering the stream the fruit of being tied to one more rebirth the fruit of no longer being subject to rebirth arhatship individual enlightenment or unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentYou are to desist Fail to desist and I shall close the bordersWhen they teach the Dharma they will teach the Dharma without omission or additionJust so reverend āriputra all things do not really existSimilarly they practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom whenever they do not engage with the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are perfected or that they are not perfectedSimilarly they should not dwell on the notion that I should perfect the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration or the transcendent perfection of wisdomand similarly as one who engages with the first bodhisattva level andproper understanding that cyclic existence is a raging fire of dullnessThe teaching of the Sugata is marvelous It clears away the doubts and misery of beingsIn fact his hands and feet are prominently webbed unlike those of other human beingsMany are the skillful means of the tathāgatasFor example Subhūti space is neither empty nor is it not emptyWith such understanding of the meaning they realize the meaning genuinely and correctlythus incorporating into ones own life the holy Dharmathat is DharmaworshipNoble son those are the words I heard Tathāgata Vipaśyin sayYou have never heard the DharmaHermaphrodite we are brahminshe consulted other brahmins who interpreted themWhen buddha bhagavāns in other realms are giving this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaHe teaches the Dharma in the form of Vaiśravaṇa to beings who are to be taught by VaiśravaṇaHowever Subhūti because the world system of form and the world system of formlessness are imagined fabricated and verbally constructedBodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asked the BhagavatHe had given rise to a fervent diligence that was set on helping all other beingsand from among all yogas the sixsyllable queen of mahāvidyās is like the riceAs a comparison the lower half of the supreme mountain Sumeru extends downward for  yojanasWhile playing billions of divine instruments they called outWill you commit yourself to subsisting on such resources The newly ordained monk responds I will so commit myselfAnd the region of ignorance is always avoided He teaches that Dharma of supreme perfect enlightenment with a protruding bellyvenerable Nandikaof whom the Blessed One prophesied that his progress to unsurpassed and perfect awakening had now been rendered irreversible and that he would become a thusgone one a worthy one a perfect buddha named Repeller of All Disturbing EmotionsSo it is that the understanding of all phenomenathey react with great dejection thinkingwill be victorious in all quarrels and disputesbut its chattels are perishable by nature so the nature of the element of consciousness is diamondlike in essence but whatever body it possesses is without essencethe sensory element of olfactory consciousnessOne becomes afflicted with extreme thirst And looks about with bewildermentsimilarly it has precedence over all those other attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasAt the same time in holding that some selves do not endure attachment will disappear and attachment will not ariseThe bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed OneEven enjoying pleasurable things for thousands of eons Will not satisfy them just as saltwater will not slake ones thirstAs due to the coming together of six elementsthey are indeed untainted by the feelings that they possesssixtytwo paths sixtytwo intermediate eonsThe Blessed One was dwelling in the Bamboo Grove in the Kalandakanivāpa near Rājagṛhain the bodynot in the faculties of the eye or the ear or the noseOf pearls crystals gold conches ammonite stones beryls Perfectly pure jewels and a mass of coral A great muni named Abhijñājñānābhibhū A supreme jina who appeared in the worldI too obtained skillfulness in methods through the sixsyllable mahāvidyāSāgara the nāga cakravartin king Accompanied by an entourage of thirty million nāgasLikewise Mañjuśrī not all sentient beings are like the Buddha bodhicitta is rareand inserts this verse of dependent arising which is the dharmadhātu he or she will generate the merit of Brahmāand censed from incense burners of various fragrances On this road the Bodhisattva will set forthSome time later in Rājagṛha the feast day of the nāga kings Giri and Valguka approachedMale and female devas will wish to come to them so as to see them pay homage to them honor them and listen to the DharmaJust as you have trained in the Dharma In that way you teach the DharmaOwing to the fact that sentient beings are not endowed with the powers of the tathāgatasThey intend to abandon it and they also induce others to do soto lack insight and methodThe tathāgatas who will emerge in the future alsoFor those who have attachment to views ones own body is attachmentIn emptiness past feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are nonapprehensibleIf the Bhagavān will give me an opportunity to seek answers to themCannot essentially be foundThey do not apprehend the emptiness of external phenomena as the emptiness of external phenomenaThrough doing those actions that are sinful and defiled They will have bad karma and will go to the lower realms And the entire world worships youWe are foremost in this world There is no being to be found and no soul or person These phenomena are like dreams or a plantain treeAh Ah Buddha powerful What sūtra teaches the path to enlightenment What is the Dharma that you have taughteach of which has seventy bathing poolsnowishIf you ask why it is because those understandings up to and including omniscience are absolutely nonapprehensibleKāśyapa it is the Tathāgata who has direct knowledge of them direct perception of them and sees them as they areOne must not feel any disgust not even a little Otherwise one will lose ones accomplishmentThey have done what had to be done They have accomplished what had to be accomplishedjust as an illusionist standing at a crossroadsI request the prophecy of my unsurpassable true enlightenmentMarking the three syllables on her secret placeSister what should I do with the golden bowlI will protect the bhikṣus who are upholding such a sūtra as thisof the stage of the practice of yoga consummated by the yoga of liberating all living beings from their afflictionsThey will describe the true excellent qualities of the tathāgatasEven the names of the aspects of emptiness do not exist internally nor do they exist externally and nor do they abide between these twoWhat is its naturetIn accordance with aspirations worthy of the thusgone ones through this offering of provisions may I cause all beings to complete the provisions for awakeningthe love that is effort because it takes responsibility for all living beingsFlee to the mountaintops and even there you shall find no escapeHaving made an offering  times one should go to sleep without speakingMany hundreds of thousands of tīrthika mendicant renunciants had also gathered thereThey should encourage them fill them with enthusiasm and instruct themVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is without a knowerSarvamalāpagataThey act in accord with what they teach free of weariness and without letting go of the mind of awakeningwhich is praised by all the buddhas and is the mother of the tathāgatasMay they also perfect omniscienceYoung man when bodhisattva mahāsattvasThen living in the wild and having turned toward complete solitude they will become uninvolved in ordinary social activities like deerThe practitioner perceives consciousness as empty and illusoryThey will circle in saṃsāra for many eons for a hundred or a thousand eonsSince he defeated Māra along with his hordes he is indeed a lion among menWhatever Your Majestys plight may be that too shall be oursEvil one today you will be felled by the Bodhisattva Like a great sāl tree whose roots have been cutSubhūti it is because all virtuous attributes are gathered in these three gateways to liberationshould venerate the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas with flowers garlands perfume unguents parasols victory banners and cotton robes thousands of billions in numberHaving interrupted all moving proceeding and transferring they do not transmigrate they do not transmigrate at allto win the mentally troubled by means of concentrationFor billions of lives you generously made many lavish giftsSimilarly the formative predispositions of speech and the formative predispositions of mind are nonarisingHence the wise must persist in eliminating ignoranceHearing that they will be overjoyed And delighted they will make offeringsit then takes up the element of dharmas Its attention becomes linked to the element of dharmasyet are never satisfied by indulging in their desiresSaying this the father grabbed out for his sons hand but his son jumped back fell down and began to cryand remained before the BhagavānThose carts are spread with the best cotton And likewise with the softest silksAnd we will protect the teachers of this Dharma for a radius of one league so that no one who plots injury or disruption against these teachers will have any opportunity to do them harm Thus established they have no fear they have no terror Their minds are undisturbed and they feel no envybodhisattvas gods virtuous ascetics brāhmin priestsIn the center between the lalanā and the rasanāThe highest form is taught through words Its nature is profoundsee sentient beings who are indolent or who are clouded by the five obscurations lacking the four meditative concentrations and lacking the four formless absorptionsthe love that is pure purified in its intrinsic natureThey will also wonder about the way that brahmins royalty townspeople and country dwellers may see them as they offer them their almsWhen he attains enlightenment living beings who are held together by all the liberations will be born in his buddhafieldI should become equipoised in the other meditative concentrations up to and including the fourth meditative concentrationnor does it not cause one to know the three times but it does so without apprehending anythingThe distance from the chakra of great bliss To the confluence of Brahma Is fortyeight fingerwidthsSo that a pure light goes in all directions In that way the Jina illuminated the entire world Moreover āradvatīputra whenever a great bodhisattva being holds the view that these are virtuous phenomena these are nonvirtuous phenomenaBodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to them It is too far for you to come so you should go backTo discern the unending nature of the past the unending nature of the future and the unending nature of what is occurring in the presentIt is having no grasping toward all phenomena it is having no clinging to the aggregate of correct conductSo Mañjuśrī Kumārabhuta along with ten thousand bodhisattvas bowed at the feet of the Thusgone Ratnaketujust as Subhūti islands consist of land that is confined by water on all sideswhether by rivers lakes seas or oceansWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas excellent power of mastery consist inThere is the meditative stability named IlluminatorThere was a buddha named Narendraghoṣa To whom humans and devas made offerings All of these beings are my sons Children attached to pleasures in the three realmsAt that time the devas humans nāgas and asuras All rejoiced and were overjoyedDivine being the expression the buddhas appear is a reference to all phenomena being unbornand do not expose those who admire the roar of a lion to the howl of a jackalTeaching the truth would tire me out and be wrongly contested and it would be futileThey do not dedicate these roots

excrement Yet he succeeds and remains free from stainsAbiding in these six transcendent perfectionsJust as indicated here in the context of the eastern direction the same goes also for all the other buddha fields throughout the ten directions numerous as the sand of the River Gangesstanding before the Bhagavān has honored revered and pleased the BhagavānWho is there among the wise who hearing about this inconceivable liberation does not conceive the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenmentHaving extinguished all ones negativitySomeone who practices in contradiction to it Will not become free of attachment combining the six perfections accomplish the great retention of the bodhisattva piṭakathey may indeed experience the fruit of this generosityhe climbs instead a poisonous tree

excellently practiced itProstrations to the category of marvelous teachingsIf ones chest becomes hollow one will die within a fortnightI will remain truthful not slander others and abandon harsh words I will never use idle or nonvirtuous wordsWhen King ūradatta saw that the body of the slain dharmabhāṇaka Supuṣpacandra that lay on the ground had not altered in colorNoble son replied the Blessed One

practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomOne should secretly start out with herWhen they saw the Lord with the ten strengths They were overjoyed and felt the highest delight To that end you should listen carefully keep my words in mind andneither a possible object of imputation nor not a possible object of imputationThe Bhagavān knowing the request made by the bodhisattva mahāsattva Nakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijñayou think Subhūti that this illusionist or this apprentice of an illusionist would have dispensed any gift to any sentient beingI will reveal and explain the tantra called The Vajra that Subjugates the Evil Forces Below the Vajra Earth Receive itMoreover Subhūti this transcendent perfection of wisdom reveals to the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas that the

elaborately on the virtues of the listeners the solitary buddhas and all who teach the DharmaThey spend their time enjoying frivolous entertainmentsDivine princes if for example one were to see in a dream a tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha teaching the sacred doctrineand in the same vein their views of the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathThey did not approach even a thousandth part of it They did not approach one hundred thousandth part nor one thousand billionth part of itFuture consciousness is empty of future consciousnessSimilarly you should be absorbed in the meditative concentrationsSir Go and tell King uddhodana that a sage has come to see himthey were skilled in miraculously going to all buddha realmsGreat King the bhagavān the

light from the center of his forehead which illuminated the entire trichiliocosm with its brillianceequalmindedness as they engage with all beings equallyFrom now on you should devote yourselves to finding joy in the pleasures of the Dharma and should take no pleasure in desiresnanda replied Yes please Blessed One right awayWill without doubt be hisBhagavān I too will recite the words of a dhāraṇīmantra for the guarding protection and concealment of that kind of dharmabhāṇaka who upholds a sūtra such as thisFather we tried every female trick on himFor the good of the yoginīsIt is free from speculationsIt is insight into phenomena It is the meditation of the path It is meeting the tathāgatasMay it too especially protect you With health and wellbeingbut he should not realize the cessation of sensationall other fruits up to and including unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment they have soft and youthful arms and legs  they stand on feet with level soles andNoble son bodhisattvas possessing ten qualities revel in superknowledgeThe real nature of the Tathāgata is also the real nature of all thingsThe domain of voidness yet where one cultivates all types of virtues such is the domain of the bodhisattvaThey have the qualities of sons of the buddhas and excellent training And are all present with their palms together respectfully in homage This is what is meant by ignorance causes formationsthe clever ones deplore themVenerable Lord This purity of phenomena is not subject to rebirth in the world system of formthey have not been conditioned by the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentitiesThe merit generated by those who continuously honor And worship the buddhas and the bodhisattvasOne should not put it on the groundWhoever was named to inquire into confidential matters respondsThese beings all have faith in BrahmāI shall focus on an old text And with that he recited five hundred stanzasMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings perceive sentient beings they think Alas For a long period of time these sentient beings have fallen under the sway of evil associatesIts head should be very red and exceedingly handsomeand the inconceivably numerous kinds of words concerning behavior in regard to purification Those are the fourAll characteristics of the realm of phenomena are also the characteristics of the realms of sentient beingsThe bodhisattva great beings from the buddha realm of the Blessed Thusgone Ratnaketu who had arrived here in the Sahā world together with noble MañjuśrīWhoever brings to mind the image of the Tathāgatas body Their senses will be at peace and their mind at peaceThe progress of the numerous millions of beings Who hear them becomes irreversible Bodhisattvas similarly do not tremble at any outer or inner pain inflicted by sentient beings It is the absence of aggression  It is not harming othersHowever monks sometime later while the Bodhisattva was setting out for the parks through the southern city gate again accompanied by a large paradethan to be a hearer or solitary buddha who relies on reference pointsNever does he look at others with attachment or a frownprostrated at his feet and made the following requestIt is nonarisenOh You who are alive and well you suggest it would be better to dieWithout these conditions the seed of consciousness does not developThey should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that I as a great bodhisattva being abiding in these five extrasensory powers of a bodhisattvaOnce I have been liberated from cyclic existence should I liberate those sentient beings who have not yet been liberatedLikewise a buddhas body Is just the same as space Blessed One they differ as much as the hollow inside a mustard seed and the expanse of spaceThe Blessed One said There are five benefits to being well versed in the teachings What are theyHow do akra Brahmā and the guardians of the world welcome themand has truly attained the unattainablebut it does not know how to remove itself from this massive heap of pure anguish marked foremost by old age sickness and deathThe village was then taken from the brahmin Māṭhara and given to the brahmin TiṣyaThey defeated the armies of the māras And attained the supreme highest enlightenment Saṅgharakṣita then led the one thousand sons of noble families to the Blessed OneAlways delight in the liberations and emptiness Do not make prayers for rebirth in the realms of beingsThen the Blessed One further addressed Senior Subhūti as followsStill I did not develop the wisdom that sees their twelve aspects Monks therefore I did not make any claims of having awakened to unsurpassable perfect and complete buddhahood and I still lacked the insight of wisdomnanda among the classes of sentient beings there are indeed someBlessed One who caused this great shower of blossoms so pleasant to behold to fallWhat wise person could become fond of phenomena that are so impermanent unstable unreliable and fickleBut how Mañjuśrīthe venerable nanda looked at him and said to the Blessed OneAnd their three positions on the view Informed noble disciplesLord if this child becomes literate he shall become a protector of your doctrineBring hundreds of thousands of delightful instruments Hand drums flutes lutes clay drums and cymbalsand also not an existent thing He is inconceivableand these are the retributions for physical misdeedsthis is the time for resting in equanimityWhose power is causing this illumination of our homesNoble āriputra please give us your attentionWhen it was time for the Bodhisattva to leave homeSimilarly they themselves should be equipoised in the meditative stabilities of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessnessone billion realms of Limited LightThat on account of which the consciousness reincarnates amongst beings of the formless realms is emptyMoreover āradvatīputra the maturity of a great bodhisattva being who practices the transcendent perfection of wisdom also entails the four correct exertionsWith kisses embrace and the likeThey had entered the unequaled vehicleThey will also honor and respect the individuals who uphold the sacred DharmaEquanimity is a gateway to the light of the Dharmalike the existence of desire hatred and folly in an arhatHow can such as we the disciples conceive the spirit of enlightenment or become fully enlightened in regard to the qualities of the BuddhaIn a future time he will become a Lord of the World A jina by the name of Vimalaprabha Since flocks of swans and cranes playfully take to the sky And joyfully circle clockwise above the Sage today you will become a worthy oneIt is a recitation continuously yearned for by the devasHis merit will be much larger And know no boundsThey do not respect the teachings merely because of any desires associated with family views or retinueand the one surrounded by the stars of those who learn and those who no longer learnWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas abundant cultivation of love consist inSubhūti do you think that the buddhas attain enlightenmentNoble son a buddhafield of bodhisattvas springs from the aims of living beingsIndeed Kauśika all the attributes of great bodhisattva beings should be correctly discerned in that manner just as they areIn that case Subhūti with regard to which things is the cultivation of the transcendent perfection of wisdom a noncultivationThey are worthy of honor veneration respect and offering in the worlds of gods humans and antigodsThere is the meditative stability named Immaculate LightThen one day he fell ill and though he was ministered to with medicinal roots stalks leaves flowersyou will become the Lord Buddha ākyamuni a tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha endowed with knowledge and virtuous conduct a sugata who knows the world a conductor of living creatures who are to be trained and an unsurpassed teacher of gods and humansThe WellInstructed One thus came to school for the sake of instruction In order to mature many children for the Highest Vehicle And to bring a myriad other beings to immortalityto attract the gods and to correct nihilists and eternalists who disregard karmic actionAt all times I taught in this way This is the end of saṃsāras suffering through calling out the name of the bodhisattva mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraFrom name and form arise six cognitive fieldsThe Buddha said to āriputraOwing to the fact that sentient beings are voidThe bodhisattvas completely pure faculties lend them their smiling countenance and their being free of afflictions prevents angry frownsYou may wonder noble son what these qualities may imply from the bodhisattvas venerability through to their skill in reaching the city of omniscienceThe householder meanwhile was feeling regretEven if all of them rested simultaneously in millions of absorptions resting in all those absorptions for millions of eonsWe prostrate to you Blissful OneThese gods therefore took position in the eastern directiononce the body is born the element of consciousness is present in the body as if in darknessThough they do so with little understanding those sons of noble family give birth to the aspiration to unsurpassable perfectly complete enlightenmentThus monks when the Bodhisattva was bornIt is teaching through describing accurately the understanding of and the examples for good and bad qualitiesOne should visualize the moon Together with the sun in ones heart Through the force of stability in that aloneMonks if after having submitted to his station the follower of another tīrthika order has a sense of reverenceso that the physicians gave up trying to heal himGuide The best in the world Wonderful to see your face like the full moonyou should ask Are you not a patricideHaving heard the pitiful wailing of the devas All the bhikṣus experienced great sufferingand who relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is attainedAll beings gained happiness And were fulfilled with divine pleasureNoble son bodhisattvas endowed with ten qualities wear the three Dharma robescannot be bound and cannot be liberatedEven the names of the gateways to liberation do not exist internally nor do they exist externally and nor do they abide between these twoWhat you may ask is the twofold emptiness in which they have become established when they are teachingNoble son no one knows the sixsyllable mahāvidyāThey will constantly accomplish unequaled benefit They will remove the darkness from the eyes of beings  While he stayed in front of the one with the ten strengths Filled with joy he placed his ten fingers together in homage It is a wheel of emptiness a wheel of signlessnessand scolds rebukes and speaks crudely and harshly to the bhikṣus bhikṣunīs upāsakas and upāsikās who possess such a sūtra as thisthey do not truly see any phenomenonhard to comprehend inconceivableThe wise the sagacious the realized Also eat food that is pure and pleasingHe then settled into the first meditative concentrationAs they go beyond the sense source of nothing whatsoever they perfect the sense source of neither presence nor absence of perception and remain within itNoble son by relying on a great leader those who suffer and are destitute will escape the wildernessHow is it resolvedBhagavān I am going to the Sahā world realm in order to see pay homage to and honor the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha ākyamuniThey do not consider whether sights are void or not and the same goes for the other sense objects up to and including mental phenomenaMañjuśrī how should bodhisattva great beings exert themselves with respect to the truths of the noble oneswhat kind of display of precious qualities the Blessed One the thusgone worthy completely perfect Buddha manifested in the buddha realm of those two holy beings in order to aid many beings show love for the world and bring happiness and health to all including gods and menFor nine hundred and fifty billion years I was blind throughout that timeKing uddhodana also provided an excellent mansion It far surpassed those built by other humans although it could not match the divine palaceshow might we regard the abiding of the thusgone onesIn order to defeat all the hordes of extremistsAt this the Bhagavān knowing in his own mind the thoughts that were in the minds of those great śrāvakas those sthavirasIntelligent One the time for renunciation has comeMoreover when melted butter or oil or water is poured onto a mound of sand it cannot be said whether the mound is open or closedThey cried King you have created so much bad karma That when you die you will go to the miseries of the Avīci hell The Lord of humans prophesied That they would not returnHe replied This is owing to the abandonment of the two extremesAfter perfecting the six transcendent perfections they will not achieve the cessation of contaminants but they will absolutely investigate omniscienceThis kingdom is yours It is extremely vast and prosperousIf you ask what are the faculties endowed with the knowledge of all thingsIf you ask what are the eighteen aspects of emptinessāriputra it is because evil men thinking so much about objects of desire as they do are full of thoughtsThey dedicate it to the purification of the community of bodhisattvasThe King of Aṅga captured King Mahāpadmas entire elephant corpsa wheel of solitude a wheel without desireUpatiṣya and Kolita then went to Kakuda Kātyāyana and askeda fine mist of rain showered down ever so gently mixed with divinely colored flowers cloths ornaments and powdered incensewould the Blessed One grant me an opportunitySeeing that vast assembly the bodhisattva great beings longed for a Dharma discourseWhat is making ones higher cognitions manifest to others It is attaining the four bases of miraculous powers and manifesting miraclesIn the sky above gods sang these versestogether with a large monastic assembly of  monksthe rays of light proclaimed these two versesThey have attained power over their minds And their bodies are bright And many beings make offerings to them And in particular they attain the unique wisdom free of darkness so for him I shall make a speech relating to the Hearers VehicleWhen he saw how dissimilar was their conduct The king did not show them respect They have none of the sufferings of saṃsāraretain the vinaya and retain the mātṛkā impose in accord with the Dharma a sentence on the offenderwith respect to all phenomenaThey resort to an attitude of exclusive generosity and to an attitude of renunciation because they understand the nature of their own deeds whereby fruits are attained according to their past actionsfor it leads to the thorough transcendence of the power of MāraIt gives complete sexual satisfactionthe inconceivably numerous recitations concerning the kleśas and the inconceivably numerous recitations concerning purification Those are the fourWhen a child is seized by Mātṛnandā A variety of physical symptoms occur One who has a pure body like that of the jinas Who has the knowledge of liberation the vision of liberationFor his part your preceptor will nurse you unto death for so long as you liveNoble son there are beings who are to be trained by means of the complete transcendence of sufferingThe maturation of the aggregates after birth is agingHave you heard some newsAnd therefore cannot be swayed by dispassionOne should absorb the entire maṇḍalado not try to put Mount Sumeru into a grain of mustardtoo salty too sweetThey felt like birds caught in a cage with a fire burning belowto gain special attainmentsThis position of yours is devoid of logicthe eightyfour hundred thousand quintillion bodhisattvas who had come with the bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara into this Sahā world realmIn the same vein  there is the meditative stability named Precious Sealand perceiving enlightenment is an obscurationbeyond visible range The divine scions cannot see it or behold itUpon hearing the Dharma from him they provide visiting monks and wanderer monks with all the supplies they needBoys would you visit every place of which you hearOne cognizes all dharmas as the same as space One engages conventionally in the purification of afflictions yet does not abandon the dharmatā of spaceThey who construe impermanent things as permanent and the impure as pure will not venerate the Buddha the Dharma and the SaṅghaHaving actualized love in their mindstreams they acquire unfathomable patienceVenerable Lord Those great bodhisattva beings who seek to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment for the sake of sentient beings who resemble space don the great armor and they don armor which is inconceivable and unequaledThis very deity in the form of the mantraAnd the whole operation is visible without any injury or disturbance to any of those living beingsWho are their spiritual teachersWhoever retains even just one verse from this Dharma teaching or reads it or teaches it or recites it or writes it or having written it remembers it or from time to time looks at itAt that time he came across an old woman from the city gathering grass in the countryside She was decrepit and had reached the end of her lifespan being one hundred and twenty years oldthe Bodhisattva produced the intent to actualize the knowledge that brings suffering and its origin to an end and realizes the insight that exhausts defilements and so he directed his mind to that purposeLet us suppose king of gods that this billionworld galactic universe were as full of tathāgatas as it is covered with groves of sugarcane with rosebushes with bamboo thickets with sesame gardens and with flowers and that a noble son or daughter were to honor them revere them respect and adore them offering them all sorts of comforts and offerings for an eon or more than an eonThe emptiness of external phenomena is empty of the emptiness of external phenomenaMañjuśrī that which is understood as destruction is simply the destruction of extremesSuch was the manner monks in which my mind brought punishment and torment on my bodyThey are clinging to desirewhile the other dies of thirst There is no one who scoops up and gives the water to the first manSimilarly the combined positive and negative ripening of combined positive and negative past actionsHe was fearless and indomitable like a dauntless lionHe was filled with distaste and had made up his mind So without any delay he gracefully rose from his seat in the music hall and turned toward the east With his right hand he parted the bejeweled lattice and went onto the palace roofYet once that is over such people Will soon discover feaststhat from each of the pores of his skina stride free from anger a stride free from delusionSome display flowers and palaces in the expanse of spaceHe faints and falls to the ground unconscioushe now spoke with soft and pleasant words in a tone that exceeded even the voice of BrahmāThere are venomous insects fireflies and ants And dogs and jackals are howlingwhat need is there to mention engaging in an act of sexual intercourse in which a couples two organs meetGods these defining characteristics are neither human nor nonhumanIt is the knowledge of accomplishment and definite accomplishmentThe latter include the meditative stability named Heroic Valor and the other hundred and ten meditative stabilities up to and including the meditative stability named Unattached Liberated and Uncovered like SpaceThe palace has lost its beauty and the city has become like a desertFor the unwise desire ruins their concentration magical ability and austerities The wise say that chasing women brings no satisfactionAs the tīrthikas purification takes place on the fourteenth day of the monthShe seated herself to his right side on the fine precious throne draped with jeweled latticeworkYet Mañjuśrī those gods do not think This Brahmā is an emanationthe gandharva Pañcaśikha attained the patience that was in accord with that soundBy making timely offerings one will gain wealth and prosper in a timely waythe one who has beautiful eyes like parasolsSome offer a million necklaces They arrive in the sky loud like thunderTolerate the bad things the foolish will say And keep and recite this samādhi These childish beings are killed like the condemned at the scaffoldMañjuśrī replied Divine being the fear and regression of beginner bodhisattvas abide within irreversibility itselfThe gods who know the time of passing Came joyfully before Queen Māyā They held flowers as well as ointments With folded hands they paid homageThe Tathāgata has compassion for the beings in saṃsāra andOh today I have been made perfectly happyThat is the eighth strange and wonderful thinghis total dedication is tantamount to his liberative artThe hairs on his body did not bristle with the fear of creation and destruction nor did his valor ever diminishYou will not attain awakening by sitting on a seat of fine grassMajesty who would you have defend a position firstHence they persevere with unswerving diligenceBecause one might think Ultimately this is to be understoodwho liberates beings from illnessYou read aloud the sūtras and commission them to be writtenI will see numerous millions of buddhas Having taught a hundred thousand sūtras They know that the Dharma is devoid of words Subhūti it is because the transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely void thatThe movement of her limbs is gentleMāra repliedFurthermore the particulars of the ḍākinīs Should be understood with respect to the central chakraRather they put their feet on the ground entirely mindfully and they raise their feet above the ground entirely mindfullyand in the same vein they train in all other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasto give up the negative and unwholesome qualities that have already come aboutThey teach the stainless precious Dharma The ultimate truth of emptiness the subtle mode of meaning Similarly knowing that the four meditative concentrations the four immeasurable aspirations and the four formless absorptions are empty of inherent existenceand acting as a condition by which heat or cold is appropriatedWhen those endowed with skill in means

seclusion Sitting straight and erect he settled his mind and saidThus by such causes conditions and bases one will come to take birth in the lower realmsYet the eye consciousness is born from the

onto his lap and spoke these joyful words to King uddhodanaWhen they sing the sounds of the powers strengths and branches of enlightenment emergeSimilarly one should know the ten powers of the tathāgatas to be emptiness and likewise the four assurances to be emptiness the four unhindered discernments to be emptiness great loving kindness to be emptiness great compassion to be emptiness and

TathāgataThe sons of the victors manifest such great powers As an act of worshipSister the earth element does not come from anywhereThis teaching is inconceivableThey attain the dhyānas and the liberations And become worthy of offerings The east sank and the west rose the west sank and the east roseAs they see reality they will unite with realitySubhūti when great bodhisattva beings discern emptiness in all its finest aspectsBecause the qualities are immeasurable There is no measure that can be conceived for themYet your resolve equals the task so grant them the nectar of immortalityThe

thousand treasures became visible as they broke forth from the earthThe experience of discomfort associated with the collection of the five consciousnesses is sufferingThe characteristics of a buddha Are the same as those of enlightenmentGrahas born from kumbhāṇḍasThey will never give rise to attachment to any existent And will reach the samādhi of the absence of attributes Their sight too is purified They have insurpassable divine sightWithout discipline or austerities without hardship fasting or vowsto comprehend the sameness of the three timesDwelling in empty solitary places Delighting in reciting the teachings May I realize the teaching of emptinessThe seventh aspect of liberation ensues whenSimilarly it reveals the world comprising the eighteen sensory elements to be emptyWhen the completely pure tathāgatas come are seen and speak through the power of their previous prayers they teach the great skillful method of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma to completely pure beingsHow so Because they are free of afflictionsInwardly concerning the characteristics of the maṇḍalaYou should not misconstrue this unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration or the transcendent perfection of wisdomThe sense pleasures are like a corpse filled to the brim with excrementI also do not consider those attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience that the transcendent perfection of wisdom could appropriate or become fixated uponLike Mahābrahmā he was the whole worlds superiorMonk then you must share one of his teachingsthe eyes the ears the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty being empty of inherent existenceHe sits on a lion throne on the central mountainwhile engaging in the conduct of a bodhisattva to realize the intrinsic characteristics of all phenomena just as they are and therefore be indefatigable in saṃsāraAnything that could not be sustained as existent or nonexistent could not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentand then go on to attain omniscienceand similarly those who wish to train in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent perfection of generosity should rely upon and venerate spiritual mentors who can confer instruction in the transcendent perfection of wisdom and similarly those who can confer instruction in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent perfection of generosityas an analogy a fire arises based on a stick to rub with a stick to rub on and and also a persons effort to generate itA man crushes all the earth of the worlds in this realm of a billion worlds into powderand would fall from monkhoodThen those bodhisattvas who had attained the superknowledges transformed their bodies to a height of fortytwo hundred thousand leagues and sat upon the thronesHis peer asked Friend you havent arranged a rendezvous at this house have youHe said I have come a long waySimilarly the sense fields are empty of notions of I and mineThrough this may I also become a buddha like you the god of godsThe unmādas that return every third day Fevers that recur every fourth dayThen he openly pronounces in the presence of the king the ministers the townspeople and the citizens of the landWhat is the root of good and evilThey should regard their preceptors and instructors as consultantsEight hundred dharmabhāṇakas Who were present stood up and saidBrother Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra having heard directly from the Bhagavān about this wisdom insight into skillful methods about the teachings with implied meaning and having heard the prophecies made to the great śrāvakas and having heard of the connections with the past and having heard of the preeminence of the BhagavānI answer him by saying There is and is not an afterlifeIf there is no torment they will understand that their births have come to an endMoreover son of noble family bodhisattva great beings should practice generosity in order to attain two thingsthe real nature of the understanding of all phenomena are all one and the same real natureBy satisfying the sense faculties of all sentient beings one will have the voice of a BuddhaThe Virile One stands in the center of the navelThe trees and the turrets of his buildings tore and fell overAnd look me up and downhe Blessed One replied That monk preacher was a shapeshifter and yet this was soBlissGone One that is how it isAlways with beautiful banners of victory And the constant sound of bells and little bellsHowever even when they threw mountains as big as the central mountain at the Bodhisattva the mountains all turned into flower canopies and celestial palacesand similarly when they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the sensory elements from the eyes to mental phenomena are purifiedMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomIts those who issue from people like you who become my ascetic attendantsThose who have heard have written out possess and read such a sūtra as this will have no craving for anything elseWhen we reached the shore I circumambulated Bālāha the king of horses three times bowed to him and departedBodhisattvas embrace the meritorious nature in the practice of generosity They disengage from the pursuit of wealth and honorAnd what is its kingThe king then ordered his ministers Gentlemen execute all of these men todayNārāyaṇa in this way the quantity of merit of bodhisattva great beings who first give rise to the mind of awakening is unfathomableOn what day On such and such a day long agoThe Blessed Buddha was resident at the Kalandakanivāpa in the Bamboo Grove near RājagṛhaMonks at that point I had the thoughtFurthermore Mañjuśrī a bodhisattva who sees the realm of desire as the sphere of nirvāṇaand again in his mind circumambulated him three timesYou should speak in this way Brother wise scholar How can I say anything In front of such a great being The father is the skill in liberative techniqueAnd the conduct of all beingsVenerable where have you come fromVenerable nandas hairs stood on end as he exclaimed I pay homage to the BuddhaDraw him holding a smoking stick of incense in his right hand and a basket filled with various adornments in his left handHe then approached a monk and saidThe zenith and the nadir are not discernible and the intermediate directions are not discernibleVenerable Lord How are great bodhisattva beings starting from those who possess all positive attributes and continuing as far as those who possess sublime pristine cognition born in the inferior realmsBodhisattvas should have humbled their pride like dogsThey will not mention or disclose such forms to be the creations of demonic forceswill perceive in his sleep what is beneficial and what is notwill make assumptions on that basisso that it was as soft and pleasant to the touch as down and made a pleasant soundFor these reasons Subhūtion a lion throne made of precious gemstones upon which hundreds of thousands of precious fabrics had been spreadTell us so that doubts will be overcome Teach the meaning of this exactly as it isYou should absorb yourself in contemplation so that the mind neither settles within nor moves without toward external formsAnd begin the practice with a consortThey perceive minds afflicted with hatred correctly as minds that are afflicted with hatred and they perceive minds free from hatred correctly as minds that are free from hatredFor the sake of sentient beings they hold and accept the excellent resources of gods and humansThe inconceivable buddha body Of a buddha is also inconceivablered wool lambswool a red shawl fine Kāśī cotton cloth of a fitting colorIf Your Majesty ignores the princes actionsAh Arise quickly you who are the most precious being And having arisen bring relief to this saṅgha of bhikṣus xiiThey who possess this supreme samādhi Are handsome good looking and attractive Hero for many millions of eons constantly You practiced generosity selfrestraint and selfcontrolSimilarly the sensory element of the eyes is also free from contaminants and not included within the three world systemsYes Mañjuśrī they areAnd so on up to passing into nirvāṇa for beings who are to be guided by his passing into nirvāṇaConsider the way that due to the pillars that support the Palace of Victory the gods of the Heaven of the Thirtythree have a gathering placeThe mind on the other hand can be compared to an illusionHe then left the assembly and went to Gṛdhrakūṭa the king of mountains which has been the residence of countless buddhasstandards bannersA long time ago while seeking to benefit beings I made the wish to liberate the world Once I attained the state of awakening beyond old age or death Now that time has comeand these are the retributions for verbal misdeedsYou are not subject to any wish for anything at allcarry out and accrue deeds that are destitute of the sacred doctrineāradvatīputra whenever great bodhisattva beings with an omniscient mind neither conceptualize these six transcendent perfections nor apprehend them these great bodhisattva beings are said to don the great armorutter pacification is called the sageSo sure enough in the morning the Blessed One donned his robes picked up his alms bowlAlways venerate your teacher Your parents and similarly all beingswithout any loss of meaning or words and for all their words to come forth as those of the Buddha then those bodhisattva mahāsattvasIf the ordinand responds A transgression occurred the inquirer tells him In that case I ask you to leavethe sons and daughters of noble family will arouse the mind of unsurpassed and completely perfect awakeningThe strength of ten halfNārāyaṇas is the same as the strength of one NārāyaṇaNoble one the one who made the offering to the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha MeghadundubhisvararājaWhat is acting within the scope of correct conduct It is meditation on the four mindfulnessesAll these conditioned things are impermanent by natureConclusion of the fourth chapter SamādhiNoble sons a bodhisattva who thus applies himself to the Dharma is a bodhisattva who does not destroy the compounded realmThat are attractive and extremely beautiful And this supreme samādhi will soon be attained The sense pleasures are objects of excitement for the childishAs soon as we die and pass from this life we will be reborn among the denizens of hell and will have to live there in such straitsI was about to make an excellent offering but I made an unfortunate offering that has resulted in this bondageWhatever Dharma definition they have contemplated they will teach and they will teach all of that correctlyOnce they have drunk it they become free from their illnesshe very quickly remounts his horseWhere no phenomena at all are born there is neither any cyclic existence nor any transcendence of sufferingFor the guide Bodhyaṅgapuṣpakaras mighty light Will everywhere be allilluminating emptiness of unconditioned phenomenaThey know well how to restore their commitments in the case of a downfall and they give up the bases for such downfallsThose who possess the mantra and meditate on the Blessed Lady Will gain various treasures gold silver earrings Garments and other such wealthThen at that time the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha ākyamuniThinking If they move to evict me I wont find a place among the nāgas eitherwere amazed and filled with wonderThus when a person approached a monk with the wish to go forthWith the healing salve of the threefold liberationI have abandoned many delights And thousands of women so beautiful to behold I now wish for the perfect peace of sacred awakening Since I find no joy in conditioned existence I have left itI realize that there is no aging no poverty no happiness no sickness nor is anyone ever ill wealthy or poor at allwho teaches the four noble truths who being fearless in four ways is never frightened who has abandoned the five branchesThis is ordinary ambrosiaOne should make an unguent from malachite and the root of white agastya treeJust so Mañjuśrī the bodhisattva loves all living beings as if each were his only childI will do anything so that no one comprehends holds and masters this Dharma discourseThey will not construe the notion that omniscience is aspirationless and that aspirationlessness is omniscienceIt would be good were you to come outthrough having given up my arm as an offering to the TathāgataIn a manner beyond reference points he circumambulated the Blessed thusgone worthy perfect Buddha

phenomena as phenomena attain the highest complete enlightenmentThey are known to be just freeIt cannot be taught Its description cannot be known Except by bodhisattvas Who maintain aspiration for it through the power of the Bodhisattva the gods from the pure realms emanated an old man on the road ahead The dense forest of Samantabhadra Filled with great trees and beautified by fruitThey see the past the future And also the presentJust like the nāga kings from the east nāga kings from the south west and north also came worried that the cold and wind might harm the ThusGone Ones bodyand will become bodhisattvas in their last lifethere is nothing apprehensible which would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood by which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attained and in which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attainedThe holders of the Dharma treasures of all teachersIndeed some of the beings came here for the great display In order to observe meditative concentration and a great display one must abide on the level of freedom from attachmentIf even those who in order to honor the Tathāgata laugh have fun joke like fools play games or make a stūpa from sandAniruddha go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illnessThe bodhisattva Sumati declaredThis will stop all deathcausing demons and accidentsIn that realm there shall be no hearersBlessed One what is it to

friend of the Dharma and knows the ultimatewear them on ones hipsFor the remainder of the meal the fire ragedSuch a bodhisattva can pick up with his right hand this billionworld galactic universe as if it were a potters wheel and spinning it round throw it beyond universes as numerous as the sands of the Gangesthey may be styled as the transcendent perfection of wisdom and the restthey were not nonentitiesMañjuśrī on what basis do you teachSimilarly they should not even dwell on the notion In this my buddhafield may the term applications of mindfulness existwho delights in the DharmaThis world has the nature of voidness so there is neither transcendence nor involvementO Lord my son was born handsome and good looking athletic and in possession of auspicious marksSimilarly the real nature of the ears nose tongue body and mental facultyHe should be seen as being equal to the tathāgatas seen as being the life of the worldThey all heard from me the highest Dharma And it was I who ripened them allUntainted by mundane concernsMustering diligence speed and power Lets quickly go and destroy that monkIf one recalls Lord Avalokiteśvara The weapons will shatter to pieces and fallWhen you sat upon the seat of awakening Desire anger and dullnessThis wheel is undisturbed because of its infinite steadinessBhagavān we do not make the effort to attain unsurpassable complete enlightenmentSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of generosity accordingly will swiftly perfect the transcendent perfection of generosityIt shows that gods nāgas rākṣasas and bhūtas All rank you as the highest among those worthy of worshipthey do not make assumptions about the aggregate of physical formsthen are there no changes and no conceptual notions regarding actual physical forms feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessThe nature of aging and death is also emptiness and emptiness indeed is aging and deathso that he too could reflect on the boundless DharmaThey said to the nāga disguised as the monk preacher What do you know retired devoteeMoreover by the causes and conditions of the bodhisattvas birth there their faith will develop grow and expand further stillNow the Blessed One spoke again to the bodhisattva SarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhinThey are all purecompletely pure like space whenever they do not engage with the notions that physical forms cease and that they are unceasingis the physical restraint through which bodhisattva mahāsattvas attain the four discernmentsHomage to all buddhas and bodhisattvasyou also should obtain this king of samādhis the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomenacharacterized by the nonappropriation of physical forms possessed by great bodhisattva beings and similarly the nonappropriation of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness and so onwill not teach the sacred doctrine according to the notions that physical forms are permanent or that they are impermanentSo it is that they correctly perceive the sense fieldsWhen asked they reply that they understand that the essential nature of giving is utter relinquishment utter absence of goals and utter emptinessIf its garments that you seek I will offer you garmentsThrough that root of merit he did not fall into the lower existences for a hundred million eonsGrant me the state of awakeningHe has written of the qualities of a wife Whoever has those qualities will be his brideI have utterly burned up The fourfold misconception tooLearning of the birth of He Who Has Crossed the Ocean of Qualities Maheśvara overjoyed spoke to the godsJust as the body disappears its reflection will disappearSeeing such beings the thusgone ones wish to completely pacify their pain and fully satisfy them with the blissful transcendence of sufferinghe was amazed and so delighted that he got goosebumpsSo it is Kauśika Great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should not dwell in that mannerThe lord then saidThey will become powerful through the strength of their diligence They will have great brilliance and they will reach the culmination of the Dharma will cure diseases of the abdomenand whoever has the same veneration for the text as one would have for the Tathāgata and honors venerates and makes offerings to it venerating it as if it were the Teacher The beauty of this bhikṣus arrival Is like powerful akra the lord of devas The lord with a thousand eyes the destroyer of strongholds And lord of the thirtythree devas on the summit of Sumeru The emptiness of internal phenomena and in the same vein the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities are pure owing to the purity of the transcendent perfection of generosityOne should eat powdered bark of the arjuna tree with milk and so onIf you take refuge and adopt the precepts in the presence of the Blessed OneNothing at all is attainedWhen he was then told that it was Sundarananda who had done so he answered It was good that Sundarananda carried it out but this animal has a huge bodyEndowed with the five offerings together with the five objects of desireEvil one today you will be destroyed by the Bodhisattva Like a hostile city by a great kingSitting and walking during the day In forests in groves and under treesperceiving them to be like berylcauses them to become discernible among the animal realms and among human beingsThe third retention is of what is known concerning the teaching of all infinite kleśasHave I not taught that all phenomena are like dreamsHe is not visibleHe believes in karmaand having draped his upper robe over one shoulder knelt down with his right knee on the peak of Mount MeruO when causing hate Vajra of Hatred sow hatred between suchandsuch and suchandsuch O Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa hū phaṭ Monks I then continued to think I should practice the allpervading absorptionLikewise in other realms you blaze in the form of fire and flamesOne hundred sextillions is called a nonillion akṣobhyaYoung man there are ten benefits for bodhisattva mahāsattvas who are dedicated to solitude What are the ten benefitsHe has much money gold and silver Property grain conch crystal and coral And many elephants horses and foot soldiers Cows cattle and also sheepVenerable Lord What are the attributes of the irreversible great bodhisattva beingsMonks then all the gods nāgas yakṣas and gandharvas set out to do what they had promisedAt that moment by the Buddhas miraculous powers Indra the chief of gods appeared before the BhagavānThe supreme noble one among men has said in the past I will liberate this world from birth and old ageperfect the transcendent perfection of wisdom and will indeed swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenmentHero you made the following promiseWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas freedom from incorrect mental engagements consist inFrom the left side Dīrghabāhugarvita saidA monk preacher lives there where he teaches the Dharma to brahmins and householdersWill encounter antipathy in this worldOnce king of gods long ago long before eons more numerous than the innumerable immense immeasurable inconceivable and even before thenI am the one who consoles and gives comfortWhen these bodhisattva great beings give something they dedicate the act entirely so that miserly beings may develop consummate generosityso that if someone is seeking an opportunity to harm those dharmabhāṇakas they will not find an opportunity to do soBut the Blessed One knew his intention and blessed the Lord of Secrets Vajrapāṇiit is owing to the nonexistence of that bodhisattva that meditative stability and that transcendent perfection of wisdom that they do not know and indeed that they have no cognitionDesires too are foulsmelling disagreeable and not worthy of being looked uponBuddhas do not belittleHe should avoid association With those beings who are keepers of womenPreserve them They will become honored as sacred objectsYoung man in that way bodhisattva mahāsattvas obtain the treasure of wisdomAttachment to sensation is cravingThe four enlightened activities are in commonWith compassion you traveled swiftly through the sky to the land of demonessesAnd when a nun a layman or a laywoman perfectly accomplishes itsyād yathedam khaṭe khaṭe khaṭe khaṭevikhaṭi vimale vilambe bale balavati candre caraṇe amṛtanirghoṣe svāhā But far more they fear the mindset of the hearers and solitary buddhas who rely on reference pointsAh Puṣpacandra who has perfect discipline Ah Arise and attain buddhahood at the foot of the Bodhi treeSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should determine that physical forms are emptya jewel mine since he was replete with all the gems of the DharmaWith that statement he dispelled all the vanity and selfassurance of the people of Rājagṛha who spoke like thatYou are comparable to the earth and without equal as a recipient of offeringsor agent or inciter of action or appropriator I cut into my own thighs And obtained the flesh and bloodThe preceptor then gives him a begging bowl and saffron robes which he accepts after bowing at the preceptors feetI will definitely practice generosity by giving away my skinTherefore Nārāyaṇa those who do not manifest the four abodes of Brahmā or the accomplishment of the concentrations of noble beings are a long way from abiding in the true practice of chastityor do they go to the realm of bliss by means of the enjoyment body having left behind their emanation bodyLikewise with the Blessed Ones permission the other bodhisattvas each took a seat on their own lotus flowerBy this method he benefited innumerable countless hundred thousand quintillions of beings Arise bhikṣu who dwelt in that forest You came to the kings capital To accomplish vast benefit for beingsSo it is that the purity of all these attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasand similarly just as the notion of the misperception of liberating pristine cognition with respect to their aggregate that perceives liberating pristine cognition is without foundationThey could not fathom the limitless scope of the victorious Dharma Kings nature Nor the entirety of the Victorious Ones domainand he emitted ten rivers from his ten fingersVenerable Lord The name of the transcendent perfection of generosity is not as well known as the name of the transcendent perfection of wisdomOne hundred utsañgas is called a bahulaIt also goes without saying thatThey will travel on the earth here and there And will establish many bodhisattvasPrince Bimbisāra gathered the five hundred ministers sons and saidThey doubt the Dharma Which is profound and difficult to seeMahitaThe Blessed One then produced a miraculous display so that the bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha could see the buddha realms in all ten directionsWhen a child is seized by Revatī The tongue is chewed with the teethAfter he explained everything that had happened they let him rest and once he recovered from the fatigue of the roadThat realm will be named AnavanāmitavaijayantīWhen he was done with his meal he threw the golden bowl into the water without any feelings of attachmentWhen he said the letter cha out came the statement Abandoning the passion of lust chandarāgaprahāṇasyād yathedaṃ acale macale sāramacale prakṛtivarṇe prakṛtinirghoṣe samantamukhe sthire

types of knowledgeThe bamboo and wood are burned by fire And they make a terrifying powerful soundWithout any wishes it nevertheless perfects all aspirations for the sake of omniscient wisdomHow can they free themselves of the subsidiary disturbing emotions and thus genuinely transcend all demonsto be obscured by the veil of karmaIn this context rules meansFaith my friends is a gateway to the light of Dharma for with it ones mind is unshakabletheir absorption is comparable to the central mountainFrom off in the distance the Blessed One saw Saṅgharakṣita approaching with his gifts The hair of their heads is bluish black soft and long  The hair of their heads is not dishevelledThey maintain their vows perfectly And have attained the level of selfdiscipline When seized by Muṣṭikā A child locks fists muṣṭi and fightsConsciousness does not run toward the futurehe is free from striving or giving anything uparrived before the Blessed One through his great miraculous power and the great power of the bodhisattvasAt this the Blessed One sounded a lions roar before the whole assemblyThey know all the languages spoken on the earth And with those words teach without attachment to them They have reached the perfection of the minds field of activity Lord it is for their sake that I ask this question The perfection of knowledge is a gateway to the light of the DharmaThe inconceivable recipients of offerings The ones to whom offerings should be made by all the world is one and the same real nature as the real nature of omniscienceThe same refrain should be applied to the transcendent perfection of generosity and also it should be applied to the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomwho wish to pursue the perceptual range of omniscienceEvil one you are completely powerless Like Uruṇḍa who lost his arms and legsThey replied What would you say if someone much more distinguished than you were to go forth and we put even him to worksurrounded with vedikās of the precious vidyutpradīpa gems Once filled he would give them as a gift with raised parasols standards and flags to as many buddhas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges each and every daynanda Those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage who hold maintain recite aloudThen Mahāmaudgalyāyana advised Thus novices knowing that disadvantages such as theseone who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attaining emancipation in the emptiness of feelings due to sensory contact that is visually compounded andThey were skilled in inquiring about the vaipulya sūtras of the Heap of Jewels andThere is no real birth of a buddhawill in no way whatsoever concoct secret spells medications and compounded medications which attract women nor will they engage in anything with a nature that is harmful to othersIs there any water that cannot be contained in the oceanand innumerable living beings took rebirth in the human and heavenly realmsthe samādhi named Continuous Sublime GiftSubhūti the lord buddhas who reside and are present teaching the sacred doctrine in the world systems of the eastern direction numerous as the sands of the River Ganges will while teaching the sacred doctrine and uttering aphorisms proclaim the names and clans of those great bodhisattva beings in this buddhafield who practice chastity commencing from this very transcendent perfection of wisdomDesires are like a pang of pain and as fragile as a birds egg Like a bone among dogs they are the prime cause of enmityhave been taught by four hundred and twenty million buddhasThen at that time the Bhagavat spoke the following two stanzasWhen he shook his body the island of Siṃhala shookRatnacūḍawhen he conjures the form of a horse or the form of a bull or when he conjures other forms of living creaturesThey do not apprehend those who possess wisdom and they do not apprehend those whose wisdom is confusedMonks at that point the Bodhisattva thought to himselfearth is characterized by heavinessThey maintain alertnessFor so long you increased the six perfectionsthey will go before that person and ask Hey you why are you unhappy and depressedWhen he goes into the realm of the lord of death he accumulates the stores of merit and wisdomThe light made Bhadrapāla fearlessNoble son why is your body coldI answered I went outside the town to defecate and urinateIt is the seat of meditation because it generates fitness of mindthen he should be granted ordinationIn order to grant accomplishment to the passionate onesAnd should press with ones arms against her knees This is called tortoise positionSome time later the meal was laid out and when the wooden beam was struck the monks filed in each carrying his own begging bowlInside each of those mansions the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahāsthāmprāpta then again emanated

profound principle of relativity andI set my mind as well on unsurpassed and perfectly complete awakening for the aid and welfare of all sentient beingsYour Majesty please apply this genuinely to everyoneThe fault lies with those blind from birth and not with the sun and moonBodhisattvas aspire to first lead all beings without any exception to the complete transcendence of suffering before they themselves attain a buddhas complete transcendence of sufferingThey have no longing for eyes and no longing for ears They have no longing for a nose and no longing for a tongueHowever emptiness does not exist elsewhere apart from the extrasensory powers Nor do the extrasensory powers exist elsewhere apart from emptinessWhat is the illumination of causes It is perceiving that the skandhas are like echoesand likewise they do not consider these as an entity or as a signtheir complexions are brightand the purity of his transcendental practice reflects the purity of his own mindTherefore

faith in this sūtra Bodhisattvas are not born into families that adhere to wrong views that eliminate the conditions for finding virtuous teachers and friendsWhen the ThusGone One Ratnavyūha teaches the Dharma to the bodhisattvas of that realm he will ascend into the sky to a height of eight hundred million palm treesBut other gods suggested In the form of akraSimilarly when even feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are themselves nonapprehensibleAwakening Mañjuśrī is bodiless and unproducedBecause he is a Dharma teacher who never stammers or falters thereforethose of the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm and those of the other realms up to and including the Pure Abodes said to the Blessed OneOne should put up with all of this Rather than abandon a womanIt was beautiful and appeared like the abode of a deity It was the residence of countless innumerable beingswith sixty thousand red cushions arranged to their left and rightand were no longer in dangerthen at that time young man bodhisattva mahāsattvas will quickly attain this samādhiWhile he is searching he sometimes Obtains something and sometimes nothingConsider noble son how a lion is never afraid of being watchedIt has been the same in the southern direction And similarly in the west below and in the north And the same above and in the intermediate directionsand that those who teach the sacred doctrine to them also resemble a magical displaySubhūti the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is the perfection of all virtuous attributesPlease do me this favor right nowand a human body will be difficult to obtainFor ten thousand million eons I practiced the bodhisattva conduct The schoolmaster Viśvāmitra was amazed and he smiledIn the same vein when they cultivate the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas and apprehend themHe became very wealthy had the power of treasure AndSarvāryaśrāvakapratyekabuddhaśrī Glory of All ryaśrāvakas and PratyekabuddhasI have a few questions for the BhagavānDo they genuinely and methodically aspire to this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomand take rebirth in a human body that is so difficult to obtain their body becomes weary from the physical tormentsWhy is it the delight of those who desire liberation Because it is good in the beginning the middle and the end That forest is like a devas park With trees that have beautiful shining formsThen the youth Candraprabha rose from his seat removed his robe from one shoulder and casting toward the Bhagavān a divine coral tree flowerFor example āradvatīputra suppose there were a wingless bird with a body one hundred fathoms or three hundred fathoms in size dwelling amidst the gods of the Trāyastriṃśa realmNow Māra the evil one felt unhappy and full of sufferingSubhūti they abide in the transcendent perfection of wisdom when they employ such skillful meansNoble son this is how bodhisattva great beings abandon killingIn what month In such and such a month long agoHomage to Tathāgata GandhapradīpaśrīI believe that you shall become just like him the most noble beinggo forth into the teachings of that very Blessed OneThey will also develop the roots of virtuous actions because they are of benefit to all sentient beingsSince they do not become fixated on these attributes they remain unattached to anything at allso that for the enjoyment of the Bhagavān there was the sound of divine songs performances and music pure parasols and banners were erectedMay you train gods and humans by training their mindsGreat being at Vārāṇasīthe features of an elephants physical formon Vulture Peak Mountain together with a large monastic saṅgha of  monksIf you ask how they perceive the cessation of physical formsThey should encourage others also to acquire the transcendent perfection of generosityIndra Brahmā and the world protectors now said to each

named SarvalokadhātūpadravodvegapratyuttīrṇaAnd life which is like a dream or a fleeting dewdropSo when all things are nonapprehensibleso too the armies of hundreds of zillions of evil demons residing in the great trichiliocosm spread themselves around the Bodhisattva in horizontal and upward directionsWith colorful clothes beautiful and soft And fragrant with enchanting perfumeHe has become a master of all phenomena and is in all his actions beyond intentionsthose in the entourage of Brahmā those in the entourage of Prajāpati and those of the Trayastriṃśa realm who were all present in that assembly three times uttered the following meaningful expressionConsider noble son the analogy of a great mass of fire that is seen by fierce wild animals or by the wild king of beastsnor attached to ones lifeand who relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is attained are not separated from the transcendent perfection of wisdomthey gathered the finest and best flowers incense lamps perfumes garlands ointments powders and cloths Then blessed as they were with supernatural powers from the ripening of merit and with divine bodies that are mentally created they instantaneously disappeared from that celestial palacein all those directions they saw everything as the physical marks colors shapes and bodies of the tathāgatasTejā She Who is BrillianceHe replied This is owing to their uncrushability by all thingsBeing despondent and free from desire is not what bodhisattvas minds are likeWhy is that Because it is the nature of the ocean not to do soNoble son that kings primary wife Ratnaśrī who was a beloved bodhisattva followed the Buddha the Dharma and the SaṅghaThat is why nanda I am seated upon this seatBhagavān take this world into your careThe essential nature of physical forms is neither profound nor subtleThis concludes Herbs the fifth chapter of the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharmakiṃnaras mahoragasAlthough the gods and goddesses in their purity and splendor Have no blood or bonesThe wise will always have unimpeded speech Knowing the subtlety of the nature of phenomena Like a wishfulfilling gem this follower of Mantra Will always act for the benefit of beingsbecause all attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are unseen when there is no consciousness arising that apprehends omniscience and so forthI answered I sawWhen it has vanished he says to themSuch a charm should be worn correctlyYet ultimately no sense source of the mind is observed either and they cannot be attached to itIt is the supreme enlightenment taught by the Jina Is the Jina teaching this samādhi And cook it slowly on a low firealso sundry gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas mahoragas antigods garuḍas and kiṃnarasLet alone

equalityThe great wise ones display Inconceivable miracles Some played clay drumsLike the sky at night filled with stars The Sages body is filled with signs Guide release the stream of nectar The cooling waters of peace from the cloud of compassionone without angerSoiled by stool and urineThe perfection of generosity is a gateway to the light of the DharmaBy merely remembering this mantra one will be able to stop lightning wind thunderbolt strikes hail snow and so forthI have developed this samādhi Through a multitude of good qualitiesThen nanda the Tathāgata the Arhat the completely and perfectly enlightened Buddha JyotivikrīḍitābhijñaThey have the same qualities as the ThusGone Onecultivate toleranceThe conjunction of the three factors is contactWere a person of this world to set eyes on a being born in hell as soon as he saw him he would be doomed to dieTherefore Nārāyaṇa the son or daughter of noble family who wishes to gain possession of everything meritorious should arouse the mind of unsurpassed and perfectly complete awakeningFire is the nature of PāṇḍaravāsinīKing Mahāpadma thoughtYou bowed down to Jñānameru and offered robes to Nāgadattarealize that conditioned and unconditioned phenomena have one defining characteristic namely that they are without defining characteristicsAnd eventually reached the trunk of a fig treeSince gentle fragrant breezes Perfumed with divine incense Pacify the illnesses of beingsāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of sights as imbued with happiness or suffering constitutes a bodhisattvaThe mere thought of this king of mantras will stop a hailstormThe devas will constantly follow them in order to protect themOne may be able to count out with the tip of the hundredth part of a hairThe māra Pāpīyān might go before such a bodhisattvalike the afflictions of one who is free of conceptualizationsit shook shook strongly and shook intenselythe fruit is not observable in the flowerit is because a dream is without any essential nature and an echo an optical aberration a mirage a magical display and a phantom are without any essential natureSimilarly it dominates the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance and the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationThe greatly profound Dharma appeared to them Therefore noble ones both Bhaiṣajyarāja and Bhaiṣajyasamudgata possess inconceivable qualitiesThis noble teacher too has strayed onto a spurious path He pursues fully a ruinous pathThe sūtra was translated and edited by the Indian paṇḍitas Jinamitra and Prajñāvarman and by the principal editortranslator the monk Yesh D along with othersVenerable Lord When the Blessed One just said O gods Unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is hard to manifestI sufferis the noncultivation of the understanding of all phenomena and the understanding of the aspects of the pathāradvatīputra it is because this transcendent perfection of wisdom is itself the TeacherSome mischievously moved back and forth in a flirtatious mannerAt the feet of all of those blessed buddhas were the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahāsthāmprāpta prostrating and inquiring about their health sayingAll meditate upon it but they dont realize it I always had faith and belief I always had great belief in the Buddhas teachingThen the Bodhisattva examined his retinue of women by means of this gateway to the light of the Dharma Next with words spoken out of great compassion he lamented sentient beingsThey are not ruined by avarice and envyFrom these light rays also came these verses of exhortationThey do not receive such ordination to escape royal punishments nor based on fears of thieves debt terrors or lack of a livelihoodIf one sees in the cold season and so on a distorted image with holes everywhere one will die within a fortnightSubhūti great bodhisattva beings teach the sacred doctrine that is without supportOne who engages in the great seal Adhering to a gnosis sealThen the divine princes addressed Senior Subhūti as followsA full eight thousand eons in this world of beings Has been devoid of buddhasBālāha the king of horses said to us None of you must look back at Siṃhala Islandthey will indeed generate many innumerable countless inconceivable and unappraisable meritsand horses elephants and bulls circumambulated the Bodhisattva Hundreds of thousands of parrots mynas cuckoos partridge swans sandpipers peacocks and cakrāvaka birds were drawn

ripening happens to meThe third aspect of liberation ensues when beings are inclined toward pleasant statesIt may indeed be that this boy is superior in knowledge of scripts but he should also be tested and distinguish himself in knowledge of mathematicsWherever you wish to go whatever your mind seeks and wherever it wishes to go with our support you should not have the slightest fear of falling down however far you go In the same wayVenerable Lord The transcendent perfection of wisdom is an agent that has no actionsDevas and humans made offerings to that great munihe took a ward allowed his going forth and ordained himSubdue all the great assemblies of unbelieversYoung men you should cultivate yourselves intensively to conceive the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenmentWhoever sees all phenomena as having no existence has cultivated the pathIt means that the Buddhas Dharma is inconceivableAnd having met with the superior teaching of Dharma You should pacify attachment and the other afflictionsHis home was tall and extensive It had been built a long time ago and had deterioratedWith the gait of a lionIn this Jambudvīpa there were kings Named Dṛḍhabala and MahābalaIt is also possible that the sun and moon will fall from the skyin the center of a moon diskThe respiration of those two nāga kings made the oceans unfit to drink and even made Mount Meru quakeof the absence of pride consummated in becoming the slave and the disciple of all living beingsThis is the section of Dharma spoken by the Blessed Onenoble son You are a bodhisattva a noble being with no one higher and you are my pupil noble sonConsider noble son the analogy of the sun that makes the lotus flowers unfoldConsider noble son how the force of the breath keeps beings aliveAt conception in the womb there is an early stage of feelingWhen he had heard this he had complete faith in itThey had two bullocks called Sujāta and Kīrticalculations astrologyYoung man at that time and in those days there was a king named ViveśacintinMañjuśrī when bodhisattvas become free from evil and beyond reproach in this way the blessed buddhas prophesy their unsurpassed and perfect awakeninga modality that is a self and a modality that is not a self a modality that is empty and a modality that is not emptyConsider noble son the analogy of fire that is worshiped by brahmins royalty townspeople and country dwellersThe Blessed One said to him Come join me thereby allowing his going forthIn the past you were a sages son known as yāmaThe sap of the umbrella tree sesame oil And cows milk from the root of the udderThen by merely eating itAs all these wanton women heard these words they learned them And directed their aspirations for awakening to the Perfect Beingthat element of consciousness sees its own merit and nonmeritHe teaches the Dharma in the form of a paṇḍita to beings who are to be taught by a paṇḍitathey had complete mastery of the dhāraṇīs and sūtrasAs a mother holds dear And protects her only childThey refine fields that are exclusively neither fettered nor liberatedshould not make assumptions even on account of the enlightened mind the mind that is equal to the unequaled the uncommon mind the mind of vast extentwho genuinely offer instruction in this transcendent perfection of wisdomPadmaśrī said the Bhagavān this bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara teaches this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma in many formsMoreover Venerable Lord great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should not abide in syllablesand should continuously seek kalyāṇamitras who teach this Dharma teaching of entering great compassionMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see among sentient beings the temporal divisions of month fortnight season and yearPlease listen and rejoice in your heart Concerning these wishes on which my mind is setwhich have many different colors and shapesWhen seized by Mukhamaṇḍiti A child is afflicted with fever and diarrheaThe nonundertaking of meritorious sinful and unmoving actions is not dualisticthey know the

are at an endWhether you be childish or wisewhose nature of inactivity is the same as the nature of inactivity of the mindBecause of that approach the man would not be a liar Then without eating his food the monk Stainless Light together with his monastic companions left for the abode of Youthful MañjuśrīIt is unborn in the prior limitwhatever any being needs they should let them take itMany thousands of them there Who will mindfully engage in diligence And be dedicated to the teaching of that sugataI am the Lord of the Dharma you are my son Train in this samādhi practice of mineSimilarly what are the feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness that are neither fettered nor liberatedI remained silent contemplating this predicamentTo those in the circle of bhūtas Who did not obey when it was utteredIs there anyone with any discernment Who having heard this teaching Would not wish for the supreme enlightenmentTheir body is immaculate and without unpleasant odorsThey do not apprehend the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end as the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor endThis completes the third chapterSo how could they enjoy the wisdom of buddhahoodFor this you too are at fault for you object when I strike himHe was renowned as Supuṣpacandra And was compassionate beneficial and kindalso bestowed great gifts and honorsSimilarly how are things established as contaminated or uncontaminated as mundane or supramundane and as conditioned or unconditionedthe wind element do not swerve from the tathatāpiercing the

higher aspirationIn the same way SubhūtiNoble ones he replied you lack honor and respect for the elders by putting them to workpain lamentation suffering distress and turmoil will all come to an endThe prophecy teaches the inconceivability of all phenomena it shows them to be beyond thoughtThey practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom whenever they do not engage with the notions that physical forms are imbued with happiness or that they are imbued with sufferingAll their aspirations will be completely fulfilledBlack color is for killing and hatred It is wisdoms treasure of unceasing eloquence Ten million sūtras are contained within itThen further think that each of those beings in all those worlds now comes to possess the heaps of merit that are the possession of akra and that thus they now all becomes akras without exceptionsome are on the eighth bhūmiThe wheel of Dharma has been turnedIn the emptiness of all things the emptiness of nonapprehension is not discernedIn that past time there was this cause this condition Because of which I am teaching the Dharma And because of which I am leading you to enlightenmentI shall come before those dharmabhāṇakas in the place where the dharmabhāṇakas are walkingO Karṇapiśācī whisper into my ear Hū phaṭWhen they all had gathered at the site where the Blessed One was residing Māra Pāpīyān addressed the Blessed OneWhen this splendor of the beauty of the virtues of the buddhafield shone forth eightyfour thousand beings conceived the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenmentthat great bodhisattva beings who would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentit is not like the realm of the earthOn a hearth of sufficient size Offer the burning substances and so forthIf you ask why Senior Subhūti it is because all things are equal to spaceWhich fourHe bound his turban on his younger brothers head and made him kingThere is no difference in their clay It is only because of the substances placed within them that they are said to be different kinds of bowlsHow do the sensory fields follow the bodyand in the same vein establish them in the other attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas but they have not actually established any sentient beings at allMaitreya if bodhisattvas possess these three qualitiesWho dispels darkness and shows the sublime way With peaceful conduct and knowledge infinite in scopeJust like awakening so are the dharmasand similarly when they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the

BhagavānThere are some who say that it is the Moon or the Sun Some say it is Rāhu Balī or VemacitriMoreover Mañjuśrī when the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa at the time when the Dharma is abandonedThen akra lord of the gods himself saidHe attained knowledge clairvoyance and discerning wisdomThey will be without anger ignorance envy miserliness hypocrisy pride arrogance and mistaken prideSimilarly many myriads of bodhisattva mahāsattvas servants of the bodhisattva mahāsattva kāśagarbha appearedHe the lion with the bearing of a swan and the gait of the supreme elephant proceeds to

rebirthImagine that a person travels through that wilderness on a journey from east to west while another person travels through it from west to eastMonks what do you think Which is more the dirt I take from the tip of my fingernail or the dirt that is upon this earthSome let out deep moansSo the king had massive door panels fitted into the Gate of AuspiciousnessThereupon the venerable āriputra thought to himselfHer hips are smooth wide round and firm Her body is as firm as a vajraThen in the northwestern direction the light encouraged the bodhisattva the great being Meghakūṭābhigarjitasvara who resided in the Meghavatī world of the ThusGone One Megharājas buddha realmDivine son ultimately all phenomena are utterly unconditionedAs he sat off to one side the physician requested the Blessed OneHe accepted the cotton cloth needle razor and thread and began to cut the cloth in front of herthat they do not cognize the transcendent perfection of generosity as the transcendent perfection of generosityall other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including enlightenment are absolutely voidAdorned with many jewels Sprouted forth from the earthLike lotuses on water that are unstained Today they have arrived when the earth split apartOnce the mind is in equipoise they experience the joy that arises from disengagementdie among hell realm beings only to be reborn among spiritsbut instead of using the tathāgatas wisdom strengths and fearlessnessesboth those who had attained the result and those who had not attained the resultmake an innumerable immeasurable inconceivable number of sentient beings ripe for enlightenmentAt this point the sattvavajrī mudrā should be displayed a flower should be offered to the circlewho will reach out his hand to those sinking in the mud of desireIndeed the sentient beings assembled there could not even see themselves or each otherThese and other special qualities will they attainI will definitely practice generosity by giving away my headwhere Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī took him onto her lapAnd all the wicked yakṣas and rākṣasas Harmful to the worldAfter Brahmānana there was a buddha A jina who was named GaṇeśvaraThen the Bhagavān said to the youth CandraprabhaThey will enjoy bad actions and be attached to alms bowls and robes And they will reject completely this samādhi Venerable Lord for these reasons we will ensure that the bodhisattvas will be guarded sheltered and concealed by the world with its gods humans and antigodsarhatshipOne should anoint a pregnant womans birth canal with sesame oil incanted seven times Then she will give birth with easeOne man swiftly related the joyful news to uddhodanaVenerable Lord How is the transcendent perfection of wisdom absolutely pure owing to the unsullied nature of spaceMañjuśrī the Tathāgata does not thinkthe step of a great bullSince they apprehend neither sentient beings nor illusion they may indeed bring sentient beings to maturation and refine the buddhafieldsMoreover they liberate others with an attitude that treats everyone the same rather than through an attitude of being fond or hostileNext Devadatta placed an iron drum four times shoutingdistance away as his targetthe teacherAre you wearyHe will be forever protected from obstacles by the queens among yoginīsSarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin saw someone whose conduct was poor whose behavior was poor and whose path was imperfectāriputra you have been my follower for a long timeOn the contrary Senior āradvatīputra once great bodhisattva beings have developed without apprehending anything the perception of sentient beings as their father the perception of sentient beings as their mother the perception of sentient beings as their child and the perception of sentient beings as themselvesI have never seen such a field of activity as that of this bodhisattvain the first assemblyBy mad and haughty women and by the entire world This practitioner will be honoredSuch beings will be reborn in the lower realms And there experience suffering To benefit such beingsIf it had been shot with miraculous power Maudgalyāyana it could have traveled infinitely to any of the countless universesIf even on hearing these words great bodhisattva beings are not discouraged not intimidated not alienated and not terrifiedWhy is it the completion of buddha wisdomI must go out and urinateMay the merchants who pursue wealth And travel throughout the ten directions Attain great profit And may that bring them happinessWhat are those ten They are as follows Whether it is winter summer monsoon or fall these bodhisattvas do not remain near walls trees or haystacksthe noble ones abhor themit is because those perfect doctrines associated with the attainment of manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment are extensively revealed in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom consequent on the doctrines in which followers through faith and so on up to and including those who have attained arhatship and those who have become pratyekabuddhas should train and the doctrines in which great bodhisattva beings have trainedYet there is far more merit in listening to retaining holding reading mastering and explaining widely to others this teaching of the DharmaSetting aside pride conceit and arrogance he replied with the following versesYour samaya vow would definitely degenerateSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who possess those attributes indications and signs are steadfastWith lasso tight and sturdyThree weeks or twentyone days after the birth relatives came and gatheredMañjuśrī inquiredAnd is produced by the beings karmaMost of the ākya boys went outsideIt is the refuge for those among enemies It is the subjugation of adversaries by those who have the Dharmanor is it included within the world system of formWhoever consumes it becomes pure in body mind and consciousnessAnd why monks did the Bodhisattva examine the family of his birthand they do not induce others to become fixated on anything at allYou can take from my leaves but not my branchesRudraka the son of Rāma is pure and kindheartedConclusion of the thirtyfirst chapter Benefitsthe blowflies the gadflies the gnats the wind the sunFriends tonight the Bodhisattva will leave his home So you should delight in making offerings to himWhat is not having contempt for those in suffering It is having impartiality toward all beingsA person who enjoys every type of food And who drinks water through his nosehe said Noble woman I have killed my father for your sakethe love that has no presumption because it has eliminated attachment and aversionThis is blameworthy and that is blamelessThen the dharmabhāṇaka Supuṣpacandra said to the great assembly of bodhisattvasWhen dark horrible times come It is possible to fall into bad statesall his fetters had been cutThey will remain at the summit of existence The inconceivable summit of existenceThe nonpurification and so on of what is without foundationOne will then be liberated from the various kinds of suffering and pass to pleasant rebirthsThis completes the eighteenth chapter from The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines entitled Puritywhen Subhūti they practice the six transcendent perfections over a long period of timeIt is not permanent because the final aggregates at death are one thing and those at birth are another that is the final aggregates at death are not the ones at birth And yet only when the final aggregates at death cease do the aggregates at birth ariseWhile I practiced this bodhisattva conduct I honored all those lords of menSarvatathāgatamātṛ Mother of All TathāgatasLikewise because the bodhisattvas aspiration for true and complete awakening has been fully perfected there is not even the most infinitesimal bit of an aspiration that has not been perfectedthe inconceivably numerous kinds of eloquence concerning the kleśasWithout compassion fickle and irritableThe eloquence of bodhisattvas is undistractedThe minds of six thousand beings were liberated from their defilements with no further graspingIf one were to ask why it is exactly as stated above in the context of the aggregate of physical formsIf you ask what these six are they comprise  the extrasensory power realizing knowledge of miraculous activitiesthe transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationrealizes it or teaches at least one of its stanzas Compared to the bodhisattvas first mentioned he would engender even more uncountable merit that would lead him to follow the awareness of a buddhaThey will also quickly attain the highest complete enlightenment which is complete buddhahoodnanda do you think that if any sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage were to establish all the sentient beings of Jambudvīpa as many as they are in the fruit of entering the streamand similarly just as the notion of mental distraction with respect to their meditative stability is without foundationWith this mantra one should draw the maṇḍala with gaur dungYou bodhisattvas who are gathered here Listen to my way to buddhahoodI have a question for you my son Where did you hear of this samādhi They will all of them attain enlightenment All of them will become compassionateAilavila the powerful king of the yakṣas With a delighted mind and encircled by a hundred yakṣasThere are no concepts or pride in the state of peace That is taught by the Jina the one with perfect compassion Causes and views are not the bodhisattva Therefore causes and views cannot receive any prophecy eitherLord the beautiful teachings of the Tathāgata are wonderful and truly excellentThe great armor is also empty of the great armor It is for that reasonEnlightenment is free from all discriminative constructionsCountless beings developed the aspiration for their own enlightenmentThere is the meditative stability named Boundless LightIt refers to suchness suchness free from error nothing but suchness explained the Blessed OneAnd of correct conduct learning giving and patience The Sugata has taught that it is a treasure that has been found and in warm weather it is cool Alas I am deceived and deprived alsoand they do not resort to wrong viewsāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of the eyes constitutes a bodhisattvaThis sword is dedicated to cutting him upGentlemen said the king that is what I shall doThe monks asked the Blessed One about it andOne should always visualize oneself in the form of the deity and empower the medicine by incanting it with the mantrathis is perceptionis able to repudiate the deviant views that have arisen in wards or apprentices or enlist others to do soakra and the world protectors felt strong faith And bathed the benefactor of the world with the finest scented waternanda I possessed the power of patience and so I quickly realized supreme perfect enlightenment and became a buddhaVenerable Lord Are great bodhisattva beings who properly realize the defining characteristics of phenomena in this way irreversibleTherefore on behalf of the person named suchandsuch I beseech and supplicate those five rākṣasīs along with the  yakṣasVenerable āradvatīputra is your mind free from appropriation and liberated from defilementsTo purify the buddhafield he does not rest in the uncompoundedMay you blow the conch shell of the genuine DharmaEight trees of precious gems appearedI gladden them through various methods That is the power of my own wisdom Guard the prince so that he cannot leave without anybody knowingto guard ones mindthey will all offer praise and chant their eulogies saying Such and such a great bodhisattva being in such and such a world system has ridden the Great VehicleSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent power of masteryThat is also how you should view the transfer it undergoesThey do not consider whether or not they engage in union with the transcendent perfection of generosity with the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline with the transcendent perfection of tolerance with the transcendent perfection of perseverance or with the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationThat even after nirvāṇa he would seek the DharmaSimilarly Subhūti it is impossible that great bodhisattva beings who from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment practice the transcendent perfection of generosityO divine princes It is soand when those huge nets of clouds cover the earth they let fall a heavy deluge of rainIn width and breadth each world system contains leagues measuring in the hundreds thousands ten millions billions hundred billions and so on all the way up to the measure of an agrasārāHow is it that a universal monarch comes to possess the precious wheelContinuously with a higher motivation they will pay reverential homage to the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who are in the worlds in the ten directionsBhagavān there are many hundreds of such beings many thousands of such beingsUltimately saṃsāra itself is also unarisenThus sights are themselves is omniscience and omniscience is sightsfor the weapon would pass straight through the unbroken spaces in those seven bodies leaving the life within them unharmedalighted from their palanquins took off their jewels and rings took off their shoes removed their robes from one shoulderHe has attained the confidence that results from his declaration of realizing all dharmas without exception a confidence that outshines the entire world including the realm of gods ThereforeThe tathāgata does not speak untrue words He does not tell lies like beings do Others had no legs at allThey were playing hundreds of thousands of different kinds of musical instrumentsAbsence of malice is a gateway to the light of the Dharma for it enables one to dispense with vengeful thoughtsSimilarly they neither associate sights with omniscience nor do they disassociate them therefromAll of you should convene and propose a mathematical problem for meNext in the practice of melting The equalizing wind and the fire of inner heat Transform the subtle body into the essence of the four wisdomswhen a householder living in rāvastī took a wife of equal caste and together they sportedLater however when they recover and awaken from their drunkenness and regain their senses they feel remorse about their conductthey praise and rejoice in others who abstain from wrong views and the other nonvirtuous actionsBecause a bodhisattva does not enter his mothers womb at the beginning of time when sentient beings are evolvingand they have made offerings to all the tathāgatasWhat kind of gift did I Bali make with my queens and retinueto the one who brings relief to many beingsThey have perfected conduct patience and samādhi And have heard the profound DharmaTejobala Tejavati Sutejas Tejeśvara and TejasamudrataSome scatter a lattice of precious stones from the sky Shining like the beautiful new moonand entered Rājagṛha to beg for almsSurely the conversations of the crown prince Mañjuśrī and that good man will result in a profound teaching of the DharmaBut you must not speak of this in front of anyone who has not seen the maṇḍalaSuch is the bodhisattvas perfect giving of reverence and worshipThe seventh meditative absorption ensues when the sense field of infinite consciousness has been completely transcended in all respects and one achieves and abides in the sense field of nothingatall thinking There is nothing at allThe gods also see me The nāgas yakṣas garuḍas gandharvas kinarasVictorious One while present in one realm You instantaneously go to limitless others for the sake of beingsHaving cultivated these virtuous attributesLeaving aside the meditative stabilities of the tathāgatasthe meditative stability that resembles lightning the authentic meditative stability and the adamantine meditative stabilitythey will also achieve and maintain whichever other meditative stabilities are appropriatethe meditative stability of the śrāvakas the meditative stability of the pratyekabuddhas or any other categories of meditative stability having suffused them all with their bodiesThe water element moistens the seedBy offering the Dharma ambrosia will be offeredNoble son you may wonder about the character of the bodhisattvas excellent wisdom that transcends the worldWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas commitment to the vows of the bodhisattva training consist inSimilarly they should not even dwell on the notion that I having travelled through innumerable countless world systemsNow follows the practice method of the wishfulfilling treeFor a hundred eons you have likewise kept your discipline intact and pure Always training in patience and with your diligence never waningRain down upon JambudvīpaBy perfecting what sacred doctrine do bodhisattvas perfect the transcendent perfection of wisdom andThe bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha was amazed and exclaimed to the Blessed OneMoreover Kauśika they should not dwell on the notion that those who have entered the stream are worthy of giftsWhen the monks measured the length of a shadow using long splints it also proved too difficultIn the same vein all causal and fruitional attributes up to and including omniscience constitute apprehension for bodhisattvasIn the time of his teaching there were no womenin this regard SubhūtiSimilarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are empty of consciousness and the other aggregatesThese qualities can also be characterized as their signs marks qualities or benefitsSimilarly they should not abide in sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomenano awareness of them no making to be aware of themAnd attained this enlightenment In stages through various methodsThey also toss hundreds of thousands of bouquets of flowers toward each tathāgataDemotions suspension of the purificationThat noble man or noble woman who has entered the Bodhisattvayāna will thus create a much greater amount of meritthey comprise the faculty of faith the faculty of perseverance the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of meditative stability and the faculty of wisdomVenerable since from now on you should not with thieving intent take from another so much as the husk of a sesame seedSenior Pūrṇa one should know that it is in this way that great bodhisattva beings possess the great armor which is neither fettered nor liberatedshut the door to miserable realms opened the door to higher realms and liberationwhenever they do not engage with any other attributes and attainments up to and including omnisciencesuch as divine flowersSimilarly being unskilled they will be without the applications of mindfulness the correct exertions the supports for miraculous ability the faculties the powers the branches of enlightenment and the noble eightfold pathand similarly that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are empty of notions of I and mineThat form is not seen is the lack of reference pointOn the right side of oneself as Vāgīśvara is Keśinī andThe thusgone ones feel great compassion for sentient beings since all phenomena are free of anger and yet sentient beings give rise to angerThe Blessed One thoughtThen go and benefit and liberate beings I rejoice in thatNoble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities practice excellent aspirations We also having realized the highest state Are teaching through a division into threedoes not unite them in oneAn adept should determine all of them As being inside or outside of the spinal columnand similarly when they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the aggregates from physical forms to consciousness are voidLooking to guide them the venerable āriputra went to their house andSome goddesses were holding vessels of powdered red sandalwoodI am endowed with five formsIt is devoid of sprout seed fruit and ripeningThese are the things that actualize cessationHis heels are broadāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving physical forms as entities and nonentitiesthey do not harbor any wish that it may bring them birth as a god in general or a specific god or as royalty or as some specific kingHe pursues fully a ruinous pathKnowing these signs one should contemplate deceiving death and think of the hereafterRecognizing those transgressions they make reparations by reining them in confessing them or having them formally excusedmorning noon evening the first watch of the nightIt is difficult to know through language And therefore it is called samādhi But through their skillful means they display their parinirvāṇa to beings as well as the disappearance of the noble DharmaThe latter act is much worse than committing all the five deeds with immediate consequencescausing him to engage in it encouraging him and delighting himAmong those who have adopted that practice for a long time There are none who have attained nirvāṇa Moreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings abide in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration they will encourage secure and establish sentient beings one hundred billion trillion in number in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationPraśāntavinīteśvara and many other gods of the pure realmsWe will ensure that people are free from all diseasesThis is the spacious immeasurable and indefinable method of great bodhisattva beings known as the maṇḍala of the meditative stability of nonappropriation which is not shared in common with all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhasall conditionedNow monks having reflected in this way the ThusGone One arose from the seat of awakening making the trichiliocosm trembleThe particular supportive maṇḍala Is said to be of three types Without courtyard without canopy and with canopy According to inclinationwhereupon her mother thoughtwho accustoms himself to the six dharmas that elicit perfect joyWhat would you do with unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment andWhat wrongdoing are you guilty ofBhagavān similarly it is not very long since you Tathāgata attained the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood These countless innumerable bodhisattva mahāsattvas have practiced celibacy for many hundreds of thousands of eons they have gained certainty in the wisdom of buddhahood during a long period of timeUpatiṣya it took a long time for my parents to give their consent How did you get the consent of yours so quicklyAs for greater anger this is when the expression of furious anger leads tohe looked upon the gathered assembly and addressed the saṇgha of bhikṣuswho having aspired toward it commit it to writing or have it committed to writingThe great virtuous medicinal butter even though it possesses no limbs or eyes makes the color of the medicines as well as their flavor and smell enter itOnly the best of charioteers and the great Brahmā who is master of a thousand powers were able to see that flowerThrough the sameness of their concentration they understand the sameness of awakeningit is not that they are first bound and then freedO svāhā to VaiśravaṇaHe does not ask for any of it not even something the value of a prastha of flourthey are not divided into two Practicing in this way a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattvaThen at that time NakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijñaO ravaṇapiśācī Muṇḍā svāhāSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent patience that is not concerned with a purposeLet us listen to him speak about the Dharma An ambrosia that brings great peaceSome are irreversibly fixed upon the highest enlightenment Some are established in the supreme retentionthey will be reborn equal in fortune to human beings but among blind householders or among outcaste householders or among householders who are refuse scavengersIn the same vein why do you say that the remaining designations made with respect to the sensory element of the eyes the sensory element of sights and the sensory element of visual consciousness up to and including their designation as entities or nonentities do not constitute a bodhisattvaYoung man in the past countless vast immeasurable inconceivable innumerable asaṃkhyeya eons agoThus I will most certainly continue to keep it to myselfHaving defeated and conquered itOnce the tree of omniscience has manifested they feed beings with its fruits of awakened qualitiesThis is the world of the lord of deathThe Bhagavān said a second time and a third time to those bodhisattvasMonk do not be afraidThis householder is hard to please and I cannot repay the principle and interest all at oncethe nature of the applications of mindfulness is emptinessAnd will live in the world without any protectorHe who lives a lie will meet his death There is no doubtThe yogin will be liberatedwent to the Bodhi tree and circumambulated it seven timesThese are called the four immeasurable aspirationsthrough diligence effort and exertion abandoned all disturbing emotions and actualized arhatshipSaṅgharakṣita in a time now passed during this fortunate eon when the lifespan of beings was twenty thousand yearsMay all adulterated foods From all the collections of seeds Enclosing the essential nutrients of the soil Be unadulterated for meāradvatīputra do you think that fundamental ignorance constitutes a bodhisattvaNoble son that is what the sixsyllable queen of mahāvidyās is likeYet they do not become conceited based on the roots of virtue that this createsHundreds of male and female slaves and many jewels And satisfied numerous beggars conducted themselves badly with their speech and conducted themselves badly in their mindsIn rāvastī a different debtor was repaying the principle and interest of a debt in timely fashion to a householderOne should not be concerned about ones bodyall the various kinds of noise and clamor within the trichiliocosm disappear and the entire trichiliocosm becomes peacefulhere are mantra syllables for this So please listen to me Lord of the WorldSubhūti when certain great bodhisattva beings lacking the transcendent perfection of wisdom make offerings to the three precious jewels namely to the Buddha the sacred doctrine and the monastic community over eons as numerous as the sands of the River Ganges and also when they make donations to other sentient beingsAnd many sentient beings in the world will reach complete nirvāṇaAt that time those bodhisattva mahāsattvas who had emerged from the groundThe bhikṣu placed his hands together upon his head And spoke these words of homage to the jinasWhen they knew that the Bhagavān had abandoned the capital andHow can they sustain themselves on the Dharma and not on material thingsThere is only one victorious teacherAll perceptions of impediment fade away and no perception of diversity occurs eitherMañjuśrī a bodhisattva who abides by this Dharma discourse outshines those who are skilled in language and compositionLike the moon in the waterhis own cupped hands filled with divine coral tree flowersand a stride free from attachmentThe same goes for the applications of mindfulness and so on and in the same vein are those great bodhisattva beings who undertake training in order to terminate the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas and become detached from them so that they cease and do not arise actually training in omniscienceNoble one the body you have gained is fortytwo thousand yojanas highI have lived the sublime life What was to be done has been doneAt a certain point the householder from rāvastīMāṭhara was thrilled delighted and overjoyedReverend these one thousand sons of noble families seek monkhood to go forth and be ordained in the wellproclaimed DharmaGreat Omniscient Sage you have perfected all good qualitiesHis relics were very extensive There were endless quintillions of stūpas abundant learning free of stupidityLike the wind they do not remainvisited the Blessed Onethere is one single method emptiness or awakeningmay accept charge of novices may serve as reliable instructors and may live independentlyThis engaging in and accruing of deeds that are destitute of the sacred doctrine would be the sixthYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of comprehension of the devas What are the four kinds of comprehension of the devasBut when they go to the leader of men who has the power of forbearanceIt does not move toward all the aspects of a view and does not project out to phenomenaThese worldly preoccupations are like dreamsso is called renunciationand if all the men women boys and girls who live in the four continents were to become scribesVenerable ones inquired Subhūti what makes you say thisThe swans cranes peacocks mynas and parrots do not make any sounds They sit on terraces by palace windows on gateways parapets and pedestals Depressed unhappy and miserable they hang their heads and remain silentthe tathāgatas have indeed brought are bringing and will bring all those sentient beings to attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where no residue of the psychophysical aggregates is left behindBhikṣus those Brahmās wonderedAlso has the wish to speak and to give The supreme teaching that I heard at that time And why Because the Blessed One the thusgone worthy completely perfect Buddha ākyamuni is about to deliver a Dharma teaching on how to accomplish the precious absorption known as the bodhisattvas applicationWho taught the Dharma there Many unwavering bodhisattvas endowed with mindfulness Who have comprehended the entirety of the three realms Who are seeking this supreme enlightenment Are like the continually growing treesVenerable Lord Since I do not consider anything extraneousFor an extensive explanation of this one should read the Sūtra on the Meditative Concentration of Brave Progression ūraṃgamasamādhisūtraThey will not falsely say that which is untrue about the tathāgatasāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of the ears nose tongue body and mental faculty as having aspirations or lacking aspirations constitute a bodhisattvaNoble son at a past time countless limitless immeasurably many eons ago there was a world called Flower OriginSimilarly they serve them with verbal acts of loving kindness and with mental acts of loving kindnessYou are to determine who among the boys here is superior in knowledge of numbersIts sweet and beautiful sound could be heard

was bornslight discomfort slight sickness if your distress is light if you are cared for strong at ease without selfreproach and if you are living in touch with the supreme happinessHe will also not have an understanding based on direct perceptionI answered We should definitely leave in three days timeHowever due to the grace of the blessed ones the buddhas in the ten directions the instruments suddenly began to encourage the Bodhisattva by resounding with these versesMañjuśrī in what way will they proceedWhen they play music deer birds and so on contemplate deeply They see the suffering and happiness of beings in saṃsāra and the way in which suffering is experienced in Jambudvīpaāradvatīputra the nonarising of physical forms is without foundationSuch a place should be revered by the world with its gods humans and asurasAll the realms became filled With flowers and sandalwood powderEmptiness is not other than the applications of mindfulness nor are the applications of mindfulness

unbearable feelings of suffering as if being burnedastrologyWhen they have talked about the six perfectionsThe greatness of that bodhisattva is such that he sends magical incarnations to all the buddhafields of the ten directions and all these incarnations accomplish the buddhawork for all the living beings in all those buddhafieldsYou have gone beyond the three timesThe monks of Kauśāmbī formal acts of saṅghahow do they investigate these phenomenaFollowing this homageIn the night the reflection of the moon Appears on clear undisturbed waterBecause if they hear it they will become frightened and when frightened they will regressBlessed One how many qualities do bodhisattvas need to possess in order to abandon all evil rebirths and not fall into the clutches of sinful associatesHaving taken their place to one side those gods then said to the Blessed OneKāśyapa there is a cloud That appears in the world And spreads over the land And covers over everythingSuppose that person also makes offerings to the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas by filling up this world with precious jewels and offering it to themThey will benefit all beings And become jinas who benefit

KapilavastuSubhūti beginner bodhisattvas should train accordingly in the transcendent perfection of wisdomduring which time they chose a name for the boySince my mouth nose and ears were blockedSubhūti such are the individual followers of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who lack skill in meansAnd similarly a multitude of pretas and pūtanasShowed their respect to the supreme being The four placements of mindfulness are a cause of purificationSubhūti if you ask what constitutes the refinement of the extrasensory power realizing knowledge of divine clairvoyance which great bodhisattva beings haveWith a completely undisturbed behavior He practiced the allpervasive concentrationMoreover vibrating and so forthIt is sincerity It is tolerance It is to be without deceptionThe roots of virtue generated in the former cases do not match even one percent of the merit generated by venerating this sutrahe never tired of study Thus his boundless wisdom had become vast and allencompassing His discipline was beyond measure as wellMonk do you not know that it is your mind that engaged in passionate conductMonks on no account should you tread on the brahmin boy Bhadraśuddha with your feetAfter that Saṅgharakṣita began to recite the Nagaropama SūtraHolding it up with both handsbut instead came from the western direction to this place and displayed meditative concentration and the supernatural knowledge of the bases of perception of śrāvakas pratyekabuddhas and of the extraordinary beings of the boundless infinity of spacewho are the specialists in the listsIn this way the lineage of the Buddha Dharma and Saṅgha will continue unbroken so that numerous beings will arouse the mind set on awakeningWishing for awareness They were sent to salute youDeity

saṅgha of one thousand two hundred and fifty bhikṣus and a vast number of bodhisattva mahāsattvasHe establishes those sentient beings in the higher realms and in the state of liberationSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent inner patienceVenerable Lord The transcendent perfection of wisdom is neither produced nor does it disintegrate because it is empty of intrinsic defining characteristicsThey

as the wind and of great powerRare is the appearance of the teaching of the Sugatain all such cases āradvatīputra this craving for the sacred doctrine in the case of great bodhisattva beings indicates their immaturityAll feelings have been interruptedand that as the head of the congregation he was wellknown popular venerated by the masses and recognized by all scholarsAnd yet because there is no deficiency of requisite causes and conditionsBhagavān for the sake of showing compassion to us accept these airborne palaces of the BrahmāsNor does the fire element think I ripen the seedbodhisattvas will project an emanation as a means for taming that personof the transcendence of meditation consummated in the solitude of body and mindJust as this thread passes unhindered through clothThus having been requestedHe must completely avoid alcohol He must acquire meats that are suitable and auspiciousMay I liberate sentient beings from the tight shackles and chains of cravingall without exception

the Blessed OneSubhūti just as nonarising neither comes to rest nor does it not come to restThen when the Bhagavān was about to pass into parinirvāṇaEven at the cost of their lives they will not

doctrine is compatible with the transcendent perfection of wisdomBut they all seek to sit At the doorstep of the learnedA hundred million gods preceded the Bodhisattva And the nāgas and gods offered him their veneration as he leftin the same way Nārāyaṇa the bodhisattvas love pervades the world systems in all ten directions as well as all buddha realms as many as there areand it is through their

Sāgara king of the nāgas then asked Prajñākūṭa and Sthavira āriputraThey will be a great ocean of the wealth of hearing the Dharma The merit of this is beyond any measure and when it has flowered the fruit is formed It is in the same way that the element of consciousness produces the bodyThe Bodhisattva had paid homage to countless awakened beings to billions upon billions of buddhasWhat is the essence The essence is the riceTheir minds were perfectly liberatedThat which is specified through dependence Is specified to not be specificWhat is the obsession with perceiving things as phenomena

she had finished she addressed himGive the teaching of this sūtra To those who teach the Dharma in the center of an assembly Without impediment their minds focused And who use quintillions of parablesThen the Bhagavān taught this Dharma discourse on gaining the three kinds of patience by chanting the following verses to the youth CandraprabhaAny practice of any being constitutes bodhisattva practiceAnd how does it come to assume a large bodyuntil we find out whether it is possible to arouse the Bodhisattva by polite persuasion Such a jewel of a being should not be killed

Gentlemen what has happened to the noble SaṅgharakṣitaThis is why you were diligent steadfast delighting in concentration and letting your insight blazeJust as a lion overpowers all jackals That is how the Buddha overpowers the tīrthikas Still others may have transgressed the subtle conduct of their trainingThey do not consider whether physical forms arise or ceaseso it is that they correctly

replied Subhūti that is not soDespite multiply radiating like a cluster of starsHe will not teach the sacred doctrine according to the notions that physical forms have aspirations or that they are without aspirations Their navel curls to the rightIf you ask why those attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are neither fettered nor liberated because they themselves are nonexistent because they themselves are void because they themselves are unfettered and because they themselves are unliberatedwhat need is there to mention those who have built relic stūpas or relic images andYou who are endowed with great compassion grant me whatever I wish and kindly do whatever I requestAll of them circumambulated the city and departed filled with delightEven

Bhagavān because of his compassionAll the painful feelings of beings in the lower realms came to a haltthis is the transcendent perfection of tolerance possessed by great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineThe bodhisattva lion will likewise never be perturbed but remain free of agitation or faintheartedness no matter what sort of attack may be staged by their opponentsSaying You do your work well here You are truly my son have no doubt about itI had not been freed from the world replete with gods māras Brahmā mendicants brahmins humans and gods I had not escaped from it severed ties with it or been delivered from itJust like awakening so also feeling notion coproducing factors and consciousness do not swerve from the tathatāfor it enables one to give rise to all states of equipoise and superknowledge and to ripen those sentient beings that are distractedThe latter should also be adorned with every ornament and filled with

speak wordsTurning the precious divine wheel with his right hand he will proclaim Precious wheel noble and divine please turn in harmony with the Dharma rather than that which is not the DharmaThe bhagavān also asked the bhagavān the perfectly enlightened buddha PrabhūtaratnaHe had a following of as many śrāvakas as there are grains of sand in seventytwo Ganges RiversHis lovely voice was not harsh but gentle And he had attained the power of knowledge of the sensory constituents Nor are you ever drunk with conceit about your knowledgeDue to the light the beings in those realms now

humbly as an outcastMonk as all phenomena are free of abiding they are nonabidingthis āradvatīputra is the transcendent perfection of perseverance possessed by great bodhisattva beingsSimilarly the emptiness of the sensory element of the nose the sensory element of odors and the sensory element of olfactory consciousness is not the sensory element of olfactory consciousness and the aforementioned sensory elementsFor this body also there is no deathOr those wishing to attain immortality without hearing about it from others which is an auspicious solitary awakeningThey discern that the concepts of I and mine are utterly nonexistentThus your son will be known here and in heaven as the Transcendent OneSimilarly the real nature of omniscience along with the real nature of the

animalcules which are present within the human body and consume itwhen the eastern side was ascendant the western side was lowTherein feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness and the real nature of consciousness and the aforementioned aggregates are nonapprehensibleThe tongue is the condition for taste but the gustatory consciousness has no formSo there is a wish for the

bodhisattva being In this regardthe one who fulfills all hopes and the one who sustains the entire world with assistance and happinessIf one were to ask whyThe venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana said to the twoThey must persist in demolishing ignorance uprooting it and bringing it to cessationWhen putting on leather shoes smeared with the fat of a vulture and an owl one will be able to travel long distancesconsidering the transcendences to be parentsIt does not dwell on feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessProstrations to noble Kāśyapa foremost in the good qualities of disciplineNo Padmaśrīgarbha there were not answered the Blessed OneAnd no action can bring it to an end So what name are you asking for Grasping the true Dharma is a gateway to the light of the Dharmathis āradvatīputra is the unblemished transcendent perfection of ethical discipline possessed by great bodhisattva beingsThe root of avasanikā Kākamācī and kanaka fruitsWe would travel the same course As those who have killed their mother Killed their father Killed an arhat Divided the saṅgha Or hatefully Drawn the blood of a perfected buddhaO Sage you are unrivaled by ordinary beingsIt is understanding the nature of the absence of aspirationWherever I place you there shall you staythey placed their hands together in homage and scattered in the direction of this Sahā world realm many flowers incenses perfumes garlands ointments powders monastic robes parasols banners divine flags and banners of victoryThey were like devas within the paradises They possessed the qualities of correct conduct and understanding nor ignoranceakra the lord of the devas with his retinue of twenty thousand devasCasting away a kingdom like a lump of phlegm Longing for solitude and living in the forestsThere was a human king a sovereign Named irībala who was very powerfulthey had thoroughly gathered the roots of virtue and perfected the accumulationsThen the Blessed One resolutely spoke his root mantra the statement of all activity Oṃ nīlāmbaradharavajrapāṇi hūṃ hūṃ phaṭThen the guard asked Brahmin where do you come fromWhen they die and depart from the human world They will remain in Avīci for an entire eonThere were no Sumerus the kings of mountainsThe young brahmins Upatiṣya and Kolita thoughtIn the future I will place in the hands of noble sons and noble daughters who are worthy vessels of the holy Dharma this profound teachingand I will meet the King of Aṅga in battleThis is the transcendent perfection of generosity of great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineYoung man those bodhisattva mahāsattvas should develop an aspiration focused upon all beings as they wish for this samādhiI was filled with joy on having heard The pleasant voices of the leaders of beingsWhen the Bodhisattva leaves we shall gather vast amounts of meritSo that they will come to know that the body and the sense pleasures are to be despisedMonk as the signs of all phenomena are insignificant they are signlessWhat you may ask is the supramundane transcendent perfection of generosityAll of these beings will be firmly rooted in compassionBlessed One the entire world filled with crops would have an infinitely greater pile of grainsLet him serve the one of unlimited renownAlways be pleasant disciplined and peaceful Be beneficial for yourself and beneficial to other beings They should be considered merely nominal merely conventional and so I should not become attached to themOne half he offered to Bhagavān ākyamuni and one half he offered to the precious stūpa of the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratnananda it is because even the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas of the world systems of the ten directions and four times numerous as the sands of the River Ganges have attained emancipation through this transcendent perfection of wisdomWhatever the phenomena they do not come from anywhere nor do they go anywhereIf he is invited to do so then no transgression ensuesand similarly if they perfect the meditative concentrations exclusively by way of signlessnessThroughout the entire city there arose The lovely aroma of the most fragrant incense You will have to spend the rest of your life living among wild animalsAlso when any great bodhisattva beings become absorbed in those meditative concentrations immeasurable aspirations and formless absorptions and then arise from those meditative states but are not captivated by those meditative concentrations immeasurable aspirations and formless absorptions and are not subject to rebirth on account of themWhile the Bodhisattva demonstrated austerities for six years one thousand two hundred billion gods and humans were matured in the Three Vehiclesfearing what lies beyond this world and giving up all factors of nonvirtueThe speech of the Tathāgata is heard so that beginner bodhisattvas and all immature ordinary people may generate roots of what is wholesome by taking the Tathāgata as their reference pointLater as he was dying he made this prayerAs they arrive they scatter and sprinkle perfume on the groundIt is not within the scope of the śrāvakas And is not in the course of the pratyekabuddhasYou are not in the realm of wordsIt will resound with the music played by divine maidensThe wisdom of bodhisattvas can be seen in a similar wayIf you ask what are the nine contemplations of impurityThey vanquish the māras with their armies and chariots And they are loudly beating the drum of the Dharma In that respect how is it without strivingwho is the father and mother of all beingshe made offerings and uttered praises Then his palms placed togetherBy throwing a lump of clay incanted with this mantra seven times into waterand put to flame the ways of brahminsHe always bowed to the buddhas the hearers The solitary buddhas and his mastersthe Blessed Buddha asked nandaWhile staying where they are they will hear The multitude of different sounds That those born as animals make When they communicate with each otherHence their benefactors feel uplifted and utterly delightedāradvatīputra if you ask how with regard to the inner body great bodhisattva beings continue to observe the physical body when great bodhisattva beings are engaged in conductworship it with flowers incense perfumes flower garlands ointments parasols victory banners and flagsnanda Bhadrapāla here is mine to trainSo does this tathāgata also seek parinirvāṇa right away With this thought they were depressed and fell silentand look toward the great Brahmā without blinkingThey rang their anklets and girdles and let their clothes slip offare everlasting and are still and solid like a pillarLord it is difficult to attend upon the Licchavi Vimalakīrti He is gifted with marvelous eloquence concerning the law of the profoundAnd they will also know through their aromasI will mount a white sixtusked king of elephants and accompanied by an entourage of bodhisattvasrīgarbhaIn that reverting back to karmic maturation cyclic existence and the lower vehicleTo the extent that a basis of objectperception is

my questionsSome wont take offerings where a dog lives Others reject places where they are told to stay or comeSimilarly I proclaim the name and the clan of the great bodhisattva being ikhin while

livesThose numerous bhikṣus who believed in reality And drove the kṣatriya king to actionHe was a proponent of DharmaShe will also be able to please King uddhodanaVenerable nanda the term prophecy is a synonym for the fact that no phenomena can be graspedEven in sleep one should always perceive oneself to be surrounded by the buddhasSimilarly they do not think Through this ethical discipline may I be reborn equal in fortune to the gods of the Caturmahārājakāyika realmThey should not dwell on the notion that physical forms are imbued with sufferingHe should salute and ask the pardon of the

gracious guhyakas Dwelling in the locale of the wicked Seize men women and others In these worlds of humansTherefore Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who wish to become unsurpassed among all sentient beingsThis is their skill in means If they possess skill in means they will become equipoised in the meditative concentrations the immeasurable aspirations the meditative stabilities and the formless absorptions but they will not take rebirth in the world systems of form and formlessness due to these influencesTherefore one should make every effort To cleanse the mirror of the mindMay we defeat the demon hordes and awaken to omniscienceso likewise without going into the ocean of passions it is impossible to obtain the mind of omniscienceIn this way they go astray on errant paths They seek refuge in that which cannot offer protectionNevertheless friends when it is brought into the presence of the Blessed One we should be able to see itAt sundown on an auspicious dayI am afflicted by doubts please explain furtherFaults which are by nature extrinsic Will gradually be utterly exhaustedattaining the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood will not be difficult for a bodhisattva mahāsattvaYoung man as soon as he was born he rose in the air up to the height of seven palm trees took seven steps and said these wordsNoble son it is like this As a comparison I can count the grains of sand in the ocean butWithin seven days it reached the world of Brahmā through the power of meritIn the same vein it does not absorb all those other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including buddhahood nor does it diffuse themIt illuminated in those buddha realms all the bhikṣus bhikṣunīs upāsakas upāsikās yogins and yogācārasand from both those tongues many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of light rays radiatedNo Blessed One he would not answered the bodhisattva SarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhinThroughout all their lifetimes They will always be without fear Thus they correctly recognize this Nominal designations of an imaginary nature are applied to temporary phenomenaattain what you have not yet attained realize what you have not yet realizedIf sounds have not been heard there will be no accomplishmentFeltwearers are known as such because they are not swayed by thoughts of desireAnd since I never abandon the great compassion I belong to the Great VehicleIndeed they will know that these bodhisattvas will not regress until manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment has been attainedyet do not disruptAnd will at all times be free of illness I then pondered what must be absent for contact not to occur and what must cease for contact to ceaseTo the Blessed One we have dedicated our countries cities and temples as well as our bodies and lives so that the Dharma will be taught copied recited worshipped and proclaimedrelying on the meaning and not on the literal expressionMay people who seek wisdom always expound On suffering to help the worldly ones May they seek the wisdom true and sublime Which is not the ground of common hearersPreoccupied by desire and being in her company he became fettered by desirewho wants who is unhappy who hurtsAlthough with their wisdom of recollection they surely recollect the very dawn of time ultimately they recollect nothing whatsoeverVictor you are impartial toward all beingsThe Bhagavān looks with eyes of wisdom upon the beings who are afflicted and wandering in the cycle of saṃsāra and do not know how to leave saṃsāraOr will it turn out to be a universal monarch Then they spoke the following verseThat is to say they give food to those who need food drink to those who need drink vehicles to those who need vehicles clothing to those who need clothing flowers to those who need flowers garlands to those who need garlands perfume to those who need perfume unguents to those who need unguents bedding to those who need bedding asylum to those who need asylum lamps to those who need lampsThey praise and rejoice in others who abstain from killing living creaturesSimilarly the emptiness of sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena is not mental phenomena and the aforementioned sense objectsWhen the Blessed One taught this section on the Dharma gateways to great compassionThey will neither hear the sacred doctrine which I have taught nor will they actualize itThe Bodhisattva replies in a gentle voice With love and concern for the kings welfareAnd they always easily and without fear Bring beings to the far shore Furthermore Maitreya if bodhisattvas possess seven qualities they will abandon all evil rebirths and not fall into the clutches of sinful associates but swiftly realize supreme perfect enlightenment and become a buddhaSenior āradvatīputra this is indicative of the nonattachment of great bodhisattva beings skilled in means who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomFrom hūṃ visualize a great vajraand

form Knows emptiness Similarly they do not consider whether fundamental ignorance is connected with formative predispositions and so on up to and including the link of aging and deathWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas excellent inalienable wisdom consist inThroughout them all they train intensively in a mind of love that is free of resentment rivalry and harm and is expansive immeasurable and nondualFor those who are stuck in their attachment to the hindrances the limbs of awakening are attachmentClothing gold chains strings of jewels And their necklaces and earrings Whose

exceedingly profoundThen the god akra the husband of acī And the principal of all gods opened the gatesdestroying his perception of it as being attractive and instead seeing it as repulsiveThe attainment of those who happen to hear of this precious absorption and practice it unerringly is a most excellent attainment indeedThe wise do not depend upon the foolish The wise and the foolish have different naturesIn the quarter aboveOn each chakra there are four chakras That externally clasp in the form of the lifeforceHere is a pure being who has acted well for many eonsOne should place a bee in a sparrows nest made from kuṇṭḥīrā and then release it into the airand in the same vein the assembled gods of all the other realms up to and including AkaniṣṭhaNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities stay clear of wearinessthe four applications of mindfulness and in the same vein all the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathSome arrive with lips as beautiful as the bimba fruit Their perfect mouths speak with voices like the kiṃnarasAs soon as the Bodhisattva arrived in schoolOn the basis of enlightenment such beings know the modalities of all things butAs the brahmin was attached to his studentsO Supreme Sage your songlike voice is melodious like Brahmāswho does not distinguish between the phenomena of immoral conduct and the phenomena of moral conductSo saying the lord entered the absorption called Victory over All MārasAnd they teach millions of sūtras O Bhagavān where does sickness come fromI killed my motherEven if in this way you finished all the mustard seeds you still would not reach the limit of the world systems in the eastern directionAmoghadarśin Maitreya and othersBut even those great bodhisattva beings who abiding in accordance with the exegeses imparted by the buddhas have practiced in that manner and engaged in union with themThen one will obtain the form of a sixteenyearold within twentyone daysWhy is it beyond words and difficult to know through speech Because of the inconceivability of all phenomenaThen the teacher should sayI shall sleep on the ground and wear my matted hair in a topknot Without bathing I shall practice disciplined conduct and austeritieswhenever they do not engage with the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are permanent or that they are impermanentSimilarly Subhūti the nature of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness does not come from anywhere does not go anywhere and does not even abide anywhereIf such an individual were to live as a householder he would become a universal monarch with a fourfold armyendowed with a supremely good complexion excellent figure and with the great wealth and power of a kinghe should carry on his fathers tradition or develop his insight even further Were he to accomplish only thatSimilarly as great caravan leaders bodhisattvas are venerated by buddhas and hearers of the buddhasThese are called the nine serial steps of meditative equipoiseBhikṣus each time the Bhagavān taught the Dharma as many beings as there are grains of sand in a hundred thousand quintillion Ganges Rivers became free of grasping and their minds were liberated from the defilementsFrom the east as well several more nāga kings arrived Worried that the cold and wind would harm the Blessed Ones bodythat they do not cognize past phenomena as past phenomenaWhen great bodhisattva beings practice accordingly it should be asked How do great bodhisattva beings who wish to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment investigate these fruitional attributes and become equipoised in the meditative stability of emptiness without actualizing the finality of existence through which the fruit of entering the streamIn the same way those who have entered homelessness in this teaching Who know of the strengths the dhyānas and the powersThe preliminary practice is completed with ten thousand recitations of the garland mantrasthat they fail to enter the divine hall called Sudharma to jointly chant the DharmaSister birth does not come from anywhereInfinite billionworld universes Entirely filled with jewels Blessed One in what sense are bodhisattvas great caravan leaders how are they experts concerning the path and in what way do they point out the unmistaken pathSubhūti it is because the natural expression of the emptiness of internal phenomena though without entity is still the emptiness of internal phenomenaBlessed One if someone writes this Dharma teaching down commissions it to be written memorizes itSome give their sons and similarly their wives And some give their own beloved fleshYou have a supreme beings wisdom Which is not the level of the Bhagavāns śrāvakasthey know the modalities of the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path and likewise of the ten powers of the tathāgatas

the one who has an omniscient buddha upon his headThey will be eliminated in those born from wisdom In the bodhisattvas fixed upon enlightenment This sacred doctrine is nonarisingnot turned away from the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities andThe result of ones actions cannot be transferred to others Nothing is experienced without a cause They abide in compassion when they think I must set all beings freeYou feel love and compassion for all beings andAt that time their adornments will be Being blind deaf and stupid Always poor

Chanda dont you have any compassion Why did you not wake us when the best of men was leavingThose who criticize bhikṣus who are holders of such a sūtra as this will become blindTherefore the flowers do not stick to the bodies of these bodhisattvas who have abandoned all instinctsa rākṣasa drawn with charcoal from the charnel groundThey remain in that kind of samādhi of peace They attain certainty

powerful deities Acting as their attendants But there is no pride in their minds This is the form realmWill never say that they forsake the Dharma Or forsake the Buddha or the Saṅgha They discern that physical forms are nonentities and do not focus on themFurthermore Maitreya if bodhisattvas possess eight qualities they will abandon all evil rebirths and not fall into the clutches of sinful associates but swiftly realize supreme perfect enlightenment and become a buddhaWhen the time comes that they are sick and unwell And experience the suffering of dyingThey are skilled in the knowledge

isolation They meditate without being bound without fixationSamantacāritramatiTherefore Mahāsthāmaprāpta when I the Tathāgata have passed into nirvāṇaThey may speak of a sentient being yet ultimately no sentient being is observed either and they cannot be attached to itWhat is meant by it being difficult for the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas to knowwhile sentient beings equal in number only to the particles of dirt on the tip of my fingernailWithout considering any of those meditative stabilities these bodhisattvas are absorbed in meditationRight then the god Dharmacārin and the gods of the

possible to reach the end Of such praise for one who teaches this Dharma Those who for the sake of sentient beings think they should don the armor of great compassion might as well think they should seek to do battle with spaceWhen these verses had been created through the sound of the lutesIn accordance with the aspirations expressed by the buddhas through this offering of ornaments may I witness the bodies of all beings become adorned with the excellent major and minor marksplease teach them the Dharma in such a way so that their merit of Brahmā will increase and the merit of the monks nuns laymen and laywomen will increase much more than that of all types of beings in the world of gods māras and Brahmā including renunciants and brahminsIn the same way Nārāyaṇa everything that

places for my daytime restyou should teach the Dharma in order that the continuity of the Three Jewels may never be interruptedand when he renounces his home and is practicing austeritiesConcerning the purities of the deitys domain I would like to hear about it O guidethey do not do so out of  or haughtinessEmptiness does not exist elsewhere apart from the real nature of phenomena Nor does the

regretBlessed One what is the name of this teaching of the Dharma and how shall we identify itNārāyaṇa imagine that as many beings as there are in as many universes as there are grains of sand in the Ganges were brought together and each of them had as much merit as Brahmāthey attain the sameness of all thingsMaliciously drawing blood and Suffering one of the four defeatsSubhūti this is because all things are absolutely purevictory banners Always associating with good persons And always avoiding bad personshe simultaneously manifested such innumerable displays of awakened playful activity

things cease These things have no awareness or feeling of each otherWhen those with bad conduct and wicked behavior Hear correct conduct being praisedI thought that the Bhagavān intended to teach the great extensive sūtra the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaSimilarly the ears the nose the tongue the body the mental faculty the nature of the mental faculty and so forth the real nature of the mental faculty and so forth the essential nature of the mental faculty and so forth and the defining characteristics of the mental faculty and so forthOne should write the first garland

and without fixationAs the king hears these reportsMahauṣadhi this is how that very consciousness belongs both to an insect and to themWith many bodies and one head With one body and four headsSimilarly do you think that anything other than the ears nose tongue body and mental faculty constitutes a bodhisattvain the same way the Elder Subhūti is the emulator of the TathāgataAre you not a patricide Are you not a matricideNever accumulating never amassing That is the nature of the Jinas teaching while that one is low with wrong aspirations Mañjuśrī the round sun of the Tathāgatas awareness does not thinkThus due to their attachment to conceptions of a self they are unable to comprehend the nature of realityHaving abandoned the sacred doctrine after they have passed awaySenior Subhūti if once great bodhisattva beings accept that all things resemble spaceSuch is the Dharma that he taught presented explained and elucidatedheard that he had attained the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodThen the king together with the great assembly of people weeping and shedding tears came before the bodhisattva mahāsattva KṣemadattaAfter that they both take the material for the upper robe in their hands and the ordinand says Preceptor heed meThe bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha and the  million bodhisattvas then all declared in a single voiceTheir wealth is the holy Dharma And their business is its teachingAll adornment is a weightso reverend Mahākāśyapa it is not possible without special allowance that an ordinary person can thus attack and deprive a bodhisattvaThey should not dwell on the notion that I having entered this world for the last time as one tied to one more rebirth will bring suffering to an endThe streets are adorned with precious fabricsHe may then salute all of those sacred personsYour Majesty please know that it is now proper for ornaments to be made for the princeI will refresh your memory he said and reminded himHe discovered the means to complete liberation and entered the city of omniscienceThe Bhagavān said to Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūtaand similarly they do not consider the transcendent perfection of generosity as an entity or as a signAs the result of the bad karma of rejecting this sūtraone does not elaborate about the presentthe designation cloud is established in the world In the very same wayWith bowls of water by clapping their hands And with sweet lovely wellsung songs nanda that is how I practiced for endless eons I saw countless buddhas endowed with gloryMañjuvajra gave for the sake of the world A mantra collection of the accomplished onesWhy is it higher knowledge for those who wish to perform miraclesfor as long as I live seek refuge in the Buddha supreme among menThis concludes the twentysixth chapter on turning the wheel of Dharmahe applied himself diligently and began to recite the scripturesthat they will not attain emancipation in omnisciencePracticing in this way Mañjuśrī that bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattvaThese childish beings wither like grasses and trees in the hot seasonHe drove away his opponents And thus triumphed over Māras armyVenerable Lord According to my inquiry into the meaning of the words spoken by the Blessed One physical forms Venerable Lord are neither fettered nor liberatednot perceiving smells the noseconsciousness has no ground to stand uponVenerable Lord it is because great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom have no conceptsMaudgalyāyana when a bodhisattva ventures to the seat of awakening the four elements of earth water fire and wind become one andRelatively for all beings they are the refuge and because of their awakening they constantly consider beingsSo will he undoubtedly fulfill his purpose And conquer the armies of Māra with easeIt is in this way Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings who seek to attain emancipation in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment should abide in these sacred doctrines and do so without apprehending anythingāradvatīputra do you think that the sensory element of the nose the sensory element of odors and the sensory element of olfactory consciousness constitute a bodhisattvaThe Blessed One is endowed with collarbones that are well coveredMay they ceaseThe second retention is of what is known concerning the teaching of all infinite soundsNoble sons their accumulation of merit is immeasurableIn each of the mansions appeared  rows of palm treesThey offered their divine Brahmā palaces to the BhagavānO hrī protector Baṭuka Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa Hū phaṭAnd praising indefatigably The buddhas with pure praisesSo then at that very time and on that occasion the Lord dispatched Vajrapāṇi and benevolently granted this mantra and this manual of instruction to the listeners and the bodhisattvas to monks and nuns and to male and female lay practitionersAlternatively if one does not proceed in this way or if the procedure is incompletedelighted satisfiednot acting not nonactingGentlemen we should ask our peer the noble Saṅgharakṣita for we grew up together playing in the dirt with himAnd āriputra transformed into the goddess repliedBecause bodhisattva great beings apply themselves assiduously to the ultimate truthThey will cast aside the Dharma And they will dwell in the Avīci hell  beings to the level of solitary buddhateacher of gods and menHouseholder how should we live in the abode of the mārasStruck by the fiery light of Avīci the monk matricide cried Oh The heat in this sweatchamber is too muchThe mind set on enlightenment is not discerned and is nonapprehensible in thoughts of dedicationWhen they had arrived there he said to the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Kamaladalavimalanakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijñathe transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineit is because those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage have rejoiced in the roots of virtuous action of beginners entering the vehicle who are innumerable and immeasurable in numberwhat those four are they should be taught in detailTerrified they thought If were recognized theyll put us in those vats this very dayLearn able to inspire others to learn The two sets of perfection the lists of threeNoble son compared to making offerings to all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas by filling up this great trichiliocosm with precious jewelsif they unskillfully engage with the applications of mindfulnessDisparaging any spiritual practice Ridiculing vajra siblings disciples with shared tantric commitments Breaking the root and branch samaya vows Cursing the lamaLike seeds planted in a fertile field This is called the most precious gem of the SaṅghaAnd likewise leprosy white leprosy and a rotten smellVenerable Lord Are the eyes also free from contaminants and not included within the three world systems owing to the emptiness of inherent existenceso the buddhaqualities do not grow in those determined for the absolute but do grow in those who conceive the spirit of enlightenment after having produced a Sumerulike mountain of egoistic viewsPadmaśrīgarbha that these many jewel mansions now fill up and adorn this Sahā world is not due to the power of the ThusGone Onefor it endows one with the wisdom of realizationVenerable Lord The sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritageOne should endeavor in correct discernment with behavior that is never frivolousThus nowhere else were the Bodhisattvas enjoyments as perfectly pure as in the womb of his motherIf you ask Subhūti how great bodhisattva beings act as a helmsman and guide of the worldsOne should eat sugar with clarified butterMonks King uddhodana accompanied by the great royal procession splendor and ceremony brought the prince to the templeHe does not emulate anything other than unconditioned phenomenaThen the Bodhisattva thought What must be absent for old age and death not to occurthey have attended excellentlyBhikṣus each mendicant bodhisattva taught as many hundred thousand quintillions of beings as there are grains of sand in sixty Ganges Riversonce death has taken place it has mental feelingsWhen a bodhisattva gathers sentient beings through the four means of attraction such a bodhisattva is endowed with skillful meansMañjuśrī that is the first field of activity of bodhisattva mahāsattvasThe world had now become smooth like the palm of a handThey should minimize pride with respect to all sentient beingsIn all world systems the wind produces the vajra circle and the golden circle that hold the surrounding mountains great mountain ranges and the four continentsIt was now that Bhadrapāla encouraged by the Blessed One understood that his opportunity to ask questions had comeYou wear the armor of the thirtytwo perfect signsThese eight supreme seed phrases lead to inexhaustible eloquenceThe Blessed One has spoken well through his allpervading knowledge this collection of teachings that contents everyoneWith respect to nonaffliction there is no counteragenta counteragent by which the destruction of the afflictions may occurand would never again fall back into such states of existenceIt is like a raging fire Or like a sword striking sesame butterI shall become liberated from sufferingentering homelessness he resides in solitudeor who seek to actualize the fruit of entering the stream cannot abide in it or actualize it without relying on this tolerance or receptivityWhat is protecting the Dharma It is subjugating in a way that is in accord with the Dharma those who malign the Buddhas DharmaBy eating it and drinking molassesKing uddhodana did not see the Bodhisattva Displeased with his absence he saidHis chariot on the way came to the place Where the bhikṣu lay in eight pieces You be happyFrom among them arhats will appear in the worldThe eight are the eight first vowels they maintain the power of patience without maintaining the conceptualization that there are beingsMahauṣadhi how do you think the poison would compare to the body of the elephant in sizeSon did you go to the physician Mother I went to the physicianVenerable Lord in which pure attributes do great bodhisattva beings abideWhen the gods saw it their eyes were dazzled and they were amazedThe camphor located in those channels Is the ambrosia emergent from unionSimilarly are these five transcendent perfections not designated as transcendent perfections when they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline when they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of tolerance when they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of perseverance or when they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationAbove itVenerable Lord if the notion of fundamental ignorance as afflicted is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of fundamental ignorance as purified become a bodhisattvaMount Meru the greatest and best of mountains would never bow down to a mustard seedSeeing these supreme gods enter his palaceto cognize the present abiding of the dharmadhātu is nondisturbanceThe four pure stations and so forthAs a way to venerate the Bodhisattva he sheltered the entire area with a single jewel canopyWhen the Guide of the World was born all suffering and afflictions ceasedThe flower garlands hung as adornments on the Bodhi treeto comprehend the three timesForm is what causes it to take hold of a bodyIn the same vein those other nonattributes up to and including the nonaffliction of physical forms and the nonpurification of physical forms are without foundationāradvatīputra the ten recollections are merely conceptualizedWithin the teaching of the highest sage I am supreme among the entiretybefore taking their placesWhen the tathāgatas speakIt will seem like an empty stage When you are gone all magnificence and splendor will disappearAs in the parable that I have previously narrated There appears a person who is a lord of generosity Who for eighty years continually Brings satisfaction to a quintillion beingsRāhula the lifespan of the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Saptaratnapadmavikrāntagāmin will be the same as that of the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha SāgaravaradharabuddhivikrīḍitābhijñaAfter twenty years have passedthey will become proud and haughty due to their giving Out of arrogance and pride they will cause division within the kṣatriyasThe Lord of the World has accomplished what is difficultthat is similar in color and shape to the jeweled structure that delighted the BodhisattvaWhy The Buddha has said It is a special attainment being always engaged in meditation It is the knowledge of downfalls and remaining in emancipationA mass made brilliant by a thousand colors Emerged from your mouthThe one who knows phenomena in that way Becomes strong with the strength of samādhi by their truth and their true words may the person named suchandsuch have wellbeingMoreover Subhūti even if great bodhisattva beings who are irreversible dwell as householdersit would not equal match number compare to or cause itThinking I have gained the attainments and achieved direct perception they pride themselves on those achievementsThose that dwell in parks and mansions In gardens and forests In shrines and towns And at tree trunksWhat is having a sense of modesty It is that which is not evident to othersSome had one hundred hands and shot one hundred arrowsHe should not frequent courtesans Or others who provide pleasuresThe ministers thus told them Quiet down Quiet down Why asked the boys The ministers respondedContentment is a gateway to the light of the Dharma for with it the mind becomes pureanalysis of the voidness and absence of a ruler analysis based on the empty and unreal and engagement with conditioned occurrenceFor all of them he was someone who had realized emptinessThat is how the first part of the ceremony should be performedI had seen that you were exhausted And this was to prevent your turning backAs a way to venerate the Bodhisattva he miraculously emanated within the sacred area a multistoried palace endowed with all perfect qualities The members of Guṇamatis retinue asked Who has created such a display The multistoried palace then resounded with this verseWherever that noble man or noble woman is they will be teaching the Dharma in the presence of the Tathāgataand come to an endand in the same vein this mind of the bodhisattvas is unattached to the other sense objects up to and including mental phenomenaif on the other hand there are other sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritageThen one will summon even a celestial girlWhen they listen to and hear this Dharma teaching and aspire to it engage in it understand it and possess itVenerable nanda now stood up from his seatIt is the elimination of kleśas It is ceasing engagement with propensitiesis called the purity of the three spheres of subject object and their interactionWhy is that Because bodhisattvas return to the realm of desire and they enter the concentrationsfull of praise for the Buddhas wordsThe nonaccomplishment of such actions is the entrance into nondualityHomage to Tathāgata Lakṣmyākarṣaṇaśrīthe vinaya of the bodhisattva great beings clarifies the mind streams of all beings causes the wisdom of omniscience to manifestHow should they train in great loving kindnessThe two brothers were elated and supremely pleased Together with their companionspay homageWhat do you think AjitaSubhūti all the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are subsumed within this transcendent perfection of wisdomand omniscience is the ten powers of the tathāgatas and so on in the same veinit is because in the same vein the essential nature of these causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path is empty of the essential nature of the noble eightfold path and so forthto produce flowers of white blue red or multicolored appearanceTherefore the Tathāgata realized all dharmas to be free from this shore or the other shoreThe yakṣas rejoice in it The kiṃnaras praise it in songWitnessing this the Bodhisattva thought to himselfOr gather the minds of all sentient beings as many as there are into one Or my father bind the sun the moon and the wind with a nooseshe thought If I do not gain the monk Vīradatta as my husband I will die Being unable to talk about this to anyone andThe crippled had their capacities restoredSimilarly it is owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena that the acceptance of great bodhisattva beings has been taughtWhy be sorrowful in JambudvīpaHe points a threatening gesture at VasudhāNow I cannot even enter my own property It is the healing of desire the pacifying of anger and the elimination of ignoranceHe is neither existence nor nonexistencetwelve thousand bodhisattvas that includedWhat are those ten They are turning away from unvirtuous qualities not transgressing the thusgone ones points for training freedom from stinginess service to the victorious ones in the past diligence in meritorious acts excellent insight skill in means excellent aspiration abundant weariness and the rousing of diligenceAjita I have described the qualities of the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who will maintain this Dharma teaching after I have passed into nirvāṇa and that is what they will be likeIt teaches the absence of concerns with respect to phenomena and is a gateway to certainty about all phenomenaYakṣas rākṣasas and kumbhāṇḍas have faith in you You have liberated nāgas mahoragas and garuḍasWhen they are cast out from that mass of flames they will be hurled into the Vaitarāṇi Riverthey will venerate the lord buddhasin the three periods of the day offer flowers and other things to it while reciting the mantraTo liberate beings from these hundreds of calamities Thus you made your aspirationThis pleases the Tathāgata the Arhat the perfectly awakened Buddhaakra lord of the gods as well as the four great kings the twentyeight great commanders of the yakṣas and the master of the guhyakas who are the type of yakṣa from which Vajrapāṇi cameOn that topic the four corners are the four immeasurable statesAlthough they do meditate on the truths without meditatingMoreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see the four modes of birth of which sentient beings partake namely oviparous birth viviparous birth birth from heat and moisture and miraculous birthAfter I attained this highest enlightenment At the foot of a tree by the city of Gayāand also two thousand bhikṣus who were in training and had transcended training and six thousand bhikṣunīs such as Mahāprajāpatī and bhikṣunī YaśodharāThey were brave with the confidence that overawes all assembliesShe is to be served as taught by the buddhasWhich quantity of merit is greaterthey comprise six that are inner and six that are outerAjita I declare to you I proclaim to youThe great king Kubera arrived from the north with several trillion yakṣas holding in their hands precious jewels of the type called starlight They also carried oil lamps and lighted lanterns They held in their hands various weapons such as bows and arrows swords spears lances with two and three points discuses onepointed pikes and javelins and they were armed with strong armor and helmetsThey have all gone forth and joined the renunciant order around the ascetic GautamaIn one instant you see The forms voices and postures Of all sentient beingsTo some he teaches in the form of a monastic with the appropriate attire and conduct and so forth including all forms previously mentioned and those beings will reach the higher realmsThey make offerings without any sense of miserliness greed discouragement or fear and their offerings are vast and extensiveand the inconceivably numerous words of nonmovement concerning purification Those are the fourOmniscience is the nature of wisdomWith the strength of two or even three elephantsTo see all phenomena genuinely to see them as they truly are is genuine visionwere all endowed with attributes that are unmistaken inalienable incontrovertible genuine true qualitative permanent stable eternal and unchanging and they were not nonentities thenSimilarly they should be attentive to the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are calm and voidNor Subhūti will the fruit be attained without cultivating the pathLord of the World who shines with light Are you dwelling in happinessAnswer simply by saying what is so is so and what is not is notSubhūti great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of perseverance thinksat down on one side and recited these versesWould you say that the nature of the realm of phenomena is relative or ultimateIn order to pacify the concepts of the world All buddhas teach this manual of practicewhen the west was up the east was downTheir conduct is excellent and they take hold of what is truly essentialMañjuśrī whoever sees all phenomena as devoid of existence because there is neither mindfulness nor attention has the branch of enlightenment of right mindfulnessThis is the army of Māra The evil friend who inflicts tormentāradvatīputra there are views which concern the psychophysical aggregates the sensory elements the sense fields the noble truths and dependent originationMillions upon millions of gods turned their eyes toward the palace and gazed at it in aweHis head will be split by a thunderboltIt does not involve transmigration because beings from different classes of existence bring about their rebirth in a common form of birthAll streams and rivers stopped their flowThe strength of ten Ever Ecstatic gods is the same as the strength of one god from the classes of the Four Great Kingsbranches of awakening for its anthers and mental stability for its stamen This lotus arose from an immaculate ocean of a vast accumulation of virtuesThe Dharma teaching of bodhisattvas similarly is inexhaustible even if it is given to all sentient beingsSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who abide in the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineThey were noble beings great elephants successful and accomplishedOne should push ones elbows upwardand similarly just as the notion of stupidity with respect to their aggregate of wisdom is without foundationthey will provisionally not actualize the finality of existence Rather Having no attachment for phenomena Always grasping the supreme DharmaFrom this day forward you must endeavor to fully safeguard your intentionsthen at that time at that instant that very moment among that gathered assembly sitting crosslegged upon the great Dharma seatOne brought water to wash his feet and saidSince all things are accordingly nonexistent and nonapprehensibleWhen this Dharma teaching was delivered and all these offerings presentedPerfect man no one in the three worlds can compare to youThose who wish for the state of buddhahood Those who long for selfarising wisdomThe many children of the Buddha were distressed And they experienced the greatest suffering As they remembered and recognized who he was they were full of veneration for the Bodhisattva and wrapped him up in divine silkWhat is the cause for this extreme beautyhe is without sorrowIn that way the man first promised three carts to those childrenHe thoughtEventually he reached the house of the ākya DaṇḍapāṇiThis light illuminated the inhabitants of the entire world who were steeped in evil and darknessJust as Subhūti space is neither long nor short nor square nor roundThe vinaya of the hearers is contemplated by individual mindsMonks at these words the ThusGone One repeated to Great TopKnotted BrahmāConclusion of the tenth chapter The Entry into the Cityāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of the sensory element of the eyes constitutes a bodhisattvaMañjuśrīIt is like a palmyra tree if you were to lop off its crown it would no longer be green nor would it flourish grow or expandThe sixsyllable queen of mahāvidyās is a recitation that is hard to findtAnd he is displaying supernatural powers and miracles of extraordinary transformations after having assembled a great retinueAnd how many hundreds of thousands of hardships have I had to endureat the hands of enemies and murderers or by thieves and royal henchmen having all my body parts sliced and chopped into many pieces with sharp knives and having been slashed bound beaten and menaced all for the sake of desire or greedThe wisdom circle remains in frontThey have no clinging they are attentive And they have no attachment to the world owing to the profundity of the inconceivable expanseMany dogs and jackals are also there Coming out and staring at themand all attainments up to and including omniscienceBecause they do not appropriate they will attain complete nirvāṇa without further appropriationThen indeed in order to conform to worldly conventions the Bodhisattva dwelt among  women and showed himself to partake of the amorous games with pleasureHis forehead is evenand even prepared the cavalryIf you ask why Senior āradvatīputra it is because all things are unborn in cyclic existence and unemancipated in nirvāṇaAnd become before long An illuminating buddha Noble son this is how it is As an analogy think of a merchant or householder who has six dearly cherished beloved and adored childrenEveryone thought that the young prince was still asleep in his bedand the inconceivably numerous accumulations of eloquence concerning purification Those are the fourThis is my responsibility and my responsibility alone thought King uddhodananor do they practice in order to increase themGiving away ones head represents the bodhisattvas attainment of omniscient wisdom the supreme state that is more exalted than the entirety of the three realms ThereforeMonks in this way the Bodhisattva arose from the seat where he had practiced discipline and hardship for the past six yearsYou who see the truths and teach the ultimateHe did not even see the hundred buddhas who live in each of those pores let alone any bodhisattvaswho is the one to whom all devas make offerings pay homage and show reverenceSome are teaching the Dharma of peace Through many trillions of parables and reasonsMañjuśrī what is called attaining acceptance is to attain their unending true natureThey follow the poṣadha vows And follow the path of correct conductāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the sensory element of the tongue the sensory element of tastes and the sensory element of gustatory consciousness as entitiesIt caused no harm but was true clear and genuineYou have the six great higher knowledges you are unsurpassable And you have perfected yourself for endless eonsOne should touch her lotus with ones handand I will look after each of them as if they were my only childIf you ask why they are neither fettered nor liberated because they themselves are nonexistent because they themselves are void because they themselves are nonarising because they themselves are nonceasing and so on even up to the attainment of buddhahoodHaving made these offerings they then dedicate these roots of virtue making common cause with all sentient beings saying Through these my roots of virtue may the fragrance of divine perfume always arise in this buddhafieldThen Vimalakīrti took the pearls and divided them into two halvesExcellent excellent noble sonHe said to me If you wish for the Dharma Promise to be my slave and I will teach you the DharmaWhen the king heard that he collapsed on the groundCinnamon vacā saffron And an unguent of asafetida mixed with leavesThey retain what they have heard for the sake of showing the path of the hearers to those who have truly entered the Hearers VehicleWill you ask me for a boon Tell me I will give you anythingHe was honored as the Lokapāla among Lokapālas because he fostered the development of all living beingsKauśika the transcendent perfection of wisdom does not attain even the transcendent perfection of wisdom whether in the sense of a designation in the sense of an intimation or in the sense of a formulationAdjustment to this is the entrance into nondualitySimilarly they do not think May I be reborn equal in fortune to the priestly class standing out like a tall sāl tree or among the householder class standing out like a great sāl treeMale and female nāgas will wish to come to them so as to see them pay homage to them honor them and listen to the Dharmananda you should understand this through the following teachinghow will one be born die live and gain happinessIn the same vein that which is empty of the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathI then inquiredIn the emptiness of nondispersal the emptiness of inherent existence is not discernedThen seized by the messengers of YamaThe nature of sights is emptiness Emptiness is sightsGreat hero you have appeared Tathāgata we supplicate youMoreover āriputra although that tathāgata will not appear during an eon of degenerationThey are led to attain nirvāṇa And they turn away from saṃsāra So it is nanda that because those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage have been captivated by the brilliance of the transcendent perfection of wisdom no one will have occasion to censure itdisturbing emotions are themselves unarisen on the ultimate levelWhen these disparaging remarks are repeated to others it causes disrespect in many ordinary beingsThe applications of mindfulness are empty of the applications of mindfulnessand repeatedly meditated on it with unadulterated meditation remaining dedicated to that practice of meditationAnd the eight branches of the supreme path of the noble ones Are not difficult to attain for one trained in restraint of the body I remember ten thousand million buddhas And more to the number of sand grains in the GangesSo one should not torment oneself with austeritiesBlessed One please grant your blessings that this Dharma discourse on the absorption that encapsulates all merit will be practiced and propagated by all means in times to comeOther than the Tathāgata there is no one who can explain consciousnessProstrations to the tathāgata in the World Where the MirrorDisk Has Been Proclaimed Buddha Whose Mind Is like the MoonHow are bodhisattvas free from stinginess and envyThey respectfully venerate preceptors and masters and speak respectfully to those who maintain pure conductMonk as all phenomena are constructed falsely they are nonabidingInstructor heed me Just as noble arhats renounced killing and swore to refrain from killing for as long as they livedWhen there was a jina a supreme being Whose name was Candrasūryapradīpa As numerous as are the knowledges of the Buddha There are that many designations for formssyād yathedam śānti śāravati

were in their last bodies It then occurred to him Aging and death happen when there is birthonepointedness of mind based on the aspects of signlessnessthe precise identity of existence the source of existence the cessation of existence and the path leading to its cessationnor will they suffer ailments of the tongue nor will their limbs be defective I was always engaged in the discipline of a

mahākālas and mātṛs fledHis palms and the soles of his feet are softThe result of your practice of concentration Is that beings are not harmed by afflictionsAt that time these verses rang out from the lion throne with its great jeweled lotus insideMoreover the bodhisattvas in all the various worlds in the ten directions now became visible at the seat of awakening adorning the place with their immeasurable accumulations of merit and wisdomnumerous beings who had not done so before now gave rise to the mind of awakeningfor humans like a pathbecomes fused with the semen and remains in her birth channelPratyekabuddhas live on these kings of mountainsBhagavān be at ease and be contentA lay vowholder also a yoginīto have trust in impermanencealong with those gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm those of the Yāma realm those of the Tuṣita realmAnd if they all today in unison Were to contemplate the Sugatas wisdomThe purity of his buddhafield reflects the purity of living beingsBhagavān we lacked understanding lacked skill and lacked knowledgeThe Bodhisattva for his part sat there in the perfect crosslegged posture Surrounded by gods he was so beautiful blazing with splendorFashioned a bier and placed The bhikṣu inside the casketIt is not being acquisitive of composite thingsThey have no longing for home and no longing for the forest They have no longing for a monastery and no longing for a villageāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena as having aspirations or lacking aspirations constitute a bodhisattvaNoble son similarly from the point at which bodhisattvas first give rise to the mind of awakeningThey know the skills of healing and bestow happiness And they are able to remove all the pain of suffering Bhagavān what cause will inspire this bodhisattva mahāsattva to come to the Sahā world realm I request that the Tathāgata create that causenot the domain of reasoning not the domain of nonreasoningStanding before other people that man may praise the fruits qualities explaining about its perfect color scent taste and so onNow venerable āradvatīputra together with Māra Pāpīyān please teach the Dharma just like the ThusGone One doesone has only to teach them the Dharma for them to realize the basis from which sicknesses ariseSaṅgharakṣita assented with the words I shall do just that tBodhisattvas should have the fortitude to give up every part of their bodiesThey were free of hypocrisy deceit lies slander harsh words killing harming bondage wrong views threatening quarreling strife fighting dispute dueling and all related afflictionsThe Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra The Absorption That Encapsulates All MeritThe people on board who wish to save their lives but who do not catch and hold on to a wooden plank log leather bag or human corpseand for a hundred and forty thousand million years I listened to the samādhi the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomenaThey think of things that are nonexistentIn the future there will be some monks who do not train their bodies and minds and do not acquaint themselves with discipline and knowledgeFrom the first of the vowels Arises a stainless full moonthinking The Blessed One the ThusGone One the Worthy One the completely perfect Buddha is a godthe sesame oil you get from infusing sesame seeds with campaka flowers before

disciples observe and dwell on its repeated arising and destructionAs soon as the sun rises all darkness is destroyedDo not act so as to accrue the fortune for that mass of suffering It would be well were you to explain our plight at lengthAt the top was a beautifully adorned upper floor scaled to fit a sixmonthold fetusFor all the tathāgata arhat perfectly complete buddhas of the three times this son of noble family is like a ministerIn the same vein as beforeConsider the analogy of a welltrained doctor who is very skilled in the eight branches of yurveda and expert in all conditions having extensively studied the use of medicinal substances and instruments and who knows the condition of the sick beings whose bodies are tormented by various ailmentsthen how do great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdomBathing his body with streams of scented waterOh my that stupid fool so ignorant that he doesnt see your beauty and good looksTasting ambrosia is AmitābhaHowever as soon as the demons released the weapons the weapons turned into garlands and canopies of flowersSearching in that way he finds the four herbsAwakening Mañjuśrī is not realized by the bodyOṃ Sāvitrī Daughter of SavitraConsider noble son the analogy of a lion that conquers alone and unaccompanied those who oppose it through its own diligence strength and powerIf you please I will divide it into five patches and those into sections of two and a halfāriputra knowing this body to be a fabrication apart from immature ordinary beings with no education no one would continue clinging to the sense pleasuresit would be impossibleTo the bodhisattva great being Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin the blessed thusgone Padmanetra repliedMay you have the good fortune of beholding your kinfolkStruck with the arrow of desire infatuated with smiles on their faces they saidFive hundred upāsakas attained the result of nonreturnersslanderThe Bodhisattva then asked Is that a practice specific to his family Or could that happen to anyone Quick tell me the truthThe three worlds are unstable like autumn cloudsYoung man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of wealth What are the four kinds of wealthDuring those fifty intermediate eons Bhagavān ākyamuni remained silentthey form the concept of a tathāgata thinking This is the Tathāgatas bodyamong which are the tathāgatas and also the followers of the tathāgatasWhat is having sharp knowledge It is knowing the nonorigination of phenomena to be like a dreamIn this way they know the lack of reality That phenomena are like illusions with an empty natureWhen he did not take it the bodhisattva mahāsattva Akṣayamati implored the bodhisattva mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraWhen I claim to have explained the path through which suffering will genuinely cease having ascertained that śrāvakas will find it conducive to the attainment of sublime emancipation if some virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon Brahmā or anyone else in the world should say in this respect that even if one practices this path it will not be conducive to emancipation that suffering will not cease and that that is impossible I would correctly disregard

transcendent perfection of wisdom to othersWas reborn into a kings family Appearing miraculously unstained by a womb After fiery sand thrice fell from the heavens upon a young nāgaSenior āradvatīputra in this context when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom they do not investigate the notion that physical forms are imbued with happinessand likewise with the natures of all thingsHis lifespan will be twelve intermediate eonsencounters a campaka treeHe considers vanity futility insubstantiality dependency and placelessness yetWhat is skill in examining phenomena It is distinguishing the skandhas dhātus and āyatanasSome are frightened by the path of action associated with the ten nonvirtues and instead relish the experience of the ten qualities of

the one of great compassionor According to this teaching there is no karmic maturation of either good or bad actionsIf the Blessed One was about to foretell actions of the future the rays of light would fade into the space before the Blessed OneWishing for the state of akra they would then offer gifts and make meritsNow imagine that the combined merit of all those beings who are thus universal

be dishonest and arrogant And will believe they have attainment when they do notYou will have to spend the rest of your life away from human pleasuresAs such when he took his first seven steps he had already attained the state of realityThey should not abide in the space element They should not abide in the consciousness element They should not abide in fundamental ignorance and they should not abide in the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and deathIn case of a dispute one will be able to paralyze the mouth of ones opponentit is the state of accomplishing the field of activity that is the performance of the conduct of mindfulness understanding comprehension conscience and stabilityDivine son ultimately the acts with immediate consequence do not truly exist

thousands of timesOnce the body has been formed consciousness is not located in the limbs or any other body partTo him I would have explained this Dharma for the first time and he would not have turned against mewho brings the city of the pretas to an endSuch phenomena are worthless void of no essenceSubhūti if you ask what constitutes the refinement of the extrasensory power realizing knowledge of the cessation of contaminants which great bodhisattva beings haveAlthough all things are indeed equal to spaceSimilarly are the immeasurable aspirations and the formless absorptions also nonconceptualResiding and flourishing in that realm he also teaches the DharmaHe who has done some wrong May curb it through virtue To bring light to this lifeWhy should the nāgas pay homage to it Because it destroys all habitual tendenciesIt is to be welcoming It is to be without lazinessWhat is the cessation of sufferingAllowing going forth begins with the postulant going for refugeEven when for example the roar of the king of elephants or the king of beasts is heard the earth remains unafraid utterly and completely unafraidAt that time Brother nanda thoughtAlas When I have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment in this buddhafieldlike a wishfulfilling jewel for those on the tenth groundWe have heard the innumerable verses on the benefits of the qualities from the BhagavānThese sentient beings will easily be freed from grasping at that which does not existit is because Senior āradvatīputra the transcendent perfection of wisdom

appetite produces the sprout of name and form within whichever mothers womb one will take rebirth throughAnd a great deal of money and slavesInstead many delightful sounds were heardThat is to say although bodies that are not meritorious result amongst hell beings or in the animal state or in the world of the Lord of Death or among the demigodsRather they lack the establishment of the fruit of entering the stream and so on up to and including unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentHey friend The vajra makes the lotus swell and bloomand similarly they do not entertain any other such thoughts up to and including the plethora of mistaken views they are never conceived within a mothers womb and they will invariably be born miraculouslyReverend what is it that Saṅgharakṣita has doneThe Bhagavān thought I shall perform a miracle so that the youth Candraprabha will attain skill in the realization of the inconceivable Dharma of the Buddhawithout these conditions it does not

this mind of the bodhisattvas is unattached to feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessSome had just one leg while others had up to one hundred thousand a completely pure motivation and  the wish to receive the DharmaHis father made him study all fields of knowledgeand similarly the fruit of entering the stream is still discerned as indeed are the fruits of being tied to one more rebirth of no longer being subject to rebirth of arhatship of individual enlightenment and of the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhasand he circumambulated the Blessed One three

bodhisattvas who aspire to the profound Dharma hurt themselvesthen standing astride with ones left knee and right foot on the groundMay he enjoy his inheritance and ensure that my line lasts longYoung man how do bodhisattva mahāsattvas obtain the treasure of the buddhasand the fourfold assembly also remained silent for those fifty intermediate eonshe rose in the air up to the height of seven palm trees took seven steps and said the word nonexistenceBe it her sight her touchThe past itself is emptiness andWhy you may wonder am I making this request It is so that other bodhisattvas may hear the ThusGone One describe the great aspirations of those two holy beingsWhat is the nature of consciousnessand the Blessed One would hear these great many cries from within the monasterys groundsAmong the particulars of the support and supportedthe nine serial steps of meditative absorption and similarly the ten powers of the tathāgatasPuṣkara removes poisonOne should dig out when the moon is in the asterism of Puṣya the root of butterfly pea and rub it onto a clothLikewise feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness too are inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaledIn this respect they can never be harmed by humans and nonhumansI am victorious in all battlesIt must be a family of universal monarchs It must be aided in great measure by the root virtues accumulated in the pastIndeed āradvatīputra phenomena do not consider phenomenaOne should respect those bhikṣus who hold such a sūtra as this just as one would respect the TathāgataMonk as all phenomena are unobserved on this side there is no other sideBeing thus utterly pure they venerate the practical instructions and thereby train abundantly in emptinessSimilarly the applications of mindfulness are not one thing and illusions anotherThey spend nights enjoying it And days halfmonths and monthsThe cool clean clear and pristine water is a reference to the intrinsic nature of ultimate realitySimilarly in the same vein it does not cause one to know that this is imbued with happiness this is imbued with suffering this is a self or this is not a self and it does so without apprehending anythingāriputra I could teach for a whole eon The many thousand million features of those Who are set upon the supreme highest enlightenmentwill be inspired to accumulate meritThat which has no existence cannot be foundI think it is better therefore to throw the ornaments into the pondThey do not cause me sadness while they are being purifiedThe Blessed One has explained that bodhisattvas would rather consume their own flesh than frivolously partake of others food drink or possessions if they havent been given to themupon hearing directly from the Bhagavān the prophecies for each of them became contented delighted elated and joyful and became glad and happyIt is natural for blessed buddhas to welcome those monks that come to visit them with the wordslimitlessGreat King Prince Sarvārthasiddha has the voice of BrahmāIn the world system called Sukhāvatī abides the Tathāgata the Arhat the truly perfect Buddha called AmitābhaThe power of forbearance and the power of diligence The power of concentration and the power of insight The power of merit the power of realization and the power of liberation Today I will accomplish thoseYou who know the way of death and passing away take rebirthAnd there are even more than that Others with endless followersThere will be people with swords in their handsThe physical forms of those who train in this manner and abide in this manner will be unobscuredThe hooks transform into the five ambrosiasWhich are equally interesting O lordThus that view of self too would be abandoned discarded and cease to beWith abundant training in emptiness they do not become involved in apprehending thingsThus the sameness of natures of spirits is the entrance into nondualityMay this son of the ākya kings Who has not fulfilled his aim in the forest hereMonks in this way the god Maheśvara together with the many gods of the pure realms made offerings to the Bodhisattva and showed him great respectThe one who reads this sūtra Or one who writes it out While filled with aspirationHer father taught her how to combine letters into words so she became proficient in readingIn the centerThen at dusk the Blessed One emerged from his meditative composure and said to the monksgiving happiness is to give material thingsWhen in this way they collect alms they will accept their alms in orderThat great water with a single taste that was released from one great cloudKnowing the minds and mental states of the fourfold assembly he said to King Attainment of VictoryWhat is the knowledge of attaining certainty in meaning It is cutting through the skandha of mental activitieshow did Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara enter itin the same way Subhūti all the other five transcendent perfections are subsumed in this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom Subhūti if there were no transcendent perfection of wisdom all these others would not be transcendent perfectionsSimilarly they perfect the eight aspects of liberation the nine serial steps of meditative equipoise the five extrasensory powers the five hundred gateways of mnemonic incantation the five hundred gateways of meditative stability the ten powers of the tathāgatas the four assurances the four unhindered discernments great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasReflecting in this way bodhisattvas remain in the application of mindfulness with respect to feelingsThe inconceivable ways that karmic actions ripenOnce the lamp had told me this I went to lie down next to the rākṣasī She awoke and asked meI the tīrthika tīrthikas name petition the saṅgha to allow me to live in robes provided by a preceptor for four monthsIn a single instant bodhisattvas are able to recollect comprehend and applyThis sūtra is profound subtle and difficult to see said PrajñākūṭaBecause all classes of existence all death and transference and all rebirths are like dreams which means that all phenomena are without originationMonks then the four gods of the Bodhi tree named Dharmaruci Dharmakāma Dharmamati and DharmacārinSubhūti it is by means of these six transcendent perfections that great bodhisattva beings attract sentient beings through their pleasant speechDismissing his preceptors words the monk departedOmniscience also cannot be appropriated on account of the emptiness of internal phenomena on account of the emptiness of external phenomena and similarly on account of the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenathere appeared in the world a tathāgata arhat perfectly enlightened buddha who was also named CandrasūryapradīpaGreat bodhisattva beings imbued with renunciation who dwell in solitude maintaining detachment and remaining in a state of cessation should cultivate the support for miraculous ability combining meditative stability of resolution with the formative force of exertionThis will induce sleepIn every direction there were flowered canopies overflowing with

who become absorbed in it are also emptyHow should they train in the ten powers of the tathāgataswent to the preeminent supreme Bodhimaṇḍa and attained the highest complete enlightenment of buddhahood by the city of Gayāso that I can prostrate beforeFor the two sons of noble nandas sister have gone forth and yet lazily pass their timetheir going forth should be allowedMañjuśrī are you not ashamed of such a gatheringBecause reality does not consist of duality or of diversitySome were so thirsty for blood that they would cut each others heads offThat is the nature of the Jinas teaching The bodhisattva mahāsattva kāśagarbha then paid homage to the Blessed One and askedHowever because of the power of the Bodhisattva the celestial girls did not find the smell of the human girls displeasingMy consciousness is liberated Completely from all thingsMonk as all phenomena appear mistakenly they are like illusionsIt is the joy of extending enlightenment of conquering the māras of destroying the afflictions and of purifying the buddhafieldSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom accordingly will swiftly perfect the transcendent perfection of wisdomBut it is not so easy to know the mind of someone Who has meditated on this stainless samādhi of peace Again the Bodhisattva consideredAs the music wound down and the people went off dancing and singingThat is so said the yakṣas and vanishedBlessed One will any beings ever come to understand correctly the statements that are spoken in discourses such as thisSuppose there are four hundred thousand innumerable world realms in which there are beings that have been born into the six kinds of existenceUntil old age disease and death show their angry facesI have fashioned a pen from my own bonesTheir display of realms is boundlessHomage to Tathāgata CandrasūryaśrīThey wish to establish beings in the noble unsurpassable bliss and joy of samādhiand similarly those who attend in an apprehending manner to the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are the emptiness of internal phenomenaBhagavān beginning with the Tathāgatas wisdom we have explained his whole immense Dharma teaching to the bodhisattva mahāsattvasToday I make this prophecy about these wise ones Understand in that way without having pride Have correct conduct but without attachmentWhen you saw Samantadarśin you declared your homage to himIt is having that which will bring benefit to others It is having a compassionate mind It is benefiting others through the Dharma It is giving away material thingsfor it leads to the liberation of mindAs he searched for the Dharma he was insatiableMañjuśrī I am sick only because the elements of living beings are disturbed by sicknessesThe bodies of deva maidens beautified by many flowers Wherever they go wherever they enjoy themselves Adorned and beautified by constantly worn garlandsyou should see that the transcendent perfection of wisdom is without essential natureIt is skill in gaining certainty concerning phenomena It is the knowledge of distinguishing between the words for phenomenaAnonymity celestial realms Foot unguent and eye ointmentIt fondly believes that the unclean is pureSimilarly they do not engage with the notion that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are with signs or that these are signlessVenerable āriputra whoever is endowed with such acceptance of the Dharma and thus perfectly understands dependent arisingAll such voices singing simultaneously Are not as delightful as the Tathāgatas perfect speech Similarly the five acquisitive psychophysical aggregates which are like an echo like an optical aberration like a mirage like a magical display and like a phantom are without defining characteristicsInform him of what he must do to fully understand his unspoken commitmentsI then pondered what was needed for birth to occur and what conditions contribute to the occurrence of birth they engage in vast great compassion for all beings and have no aspiration for the level of the śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhasWhat is the immaturity of a bodhisattva What is the maturity of a bodhisattvaThe priests mantras and the treatises of the Vedas mention the proper form for a bodhisattva to take when descending into the womb of his motherBut they cannot know whether someone who maintains The restraint of the body is or is not maintaining it In those buddha realms limitless and countless beings heard the name of the ThusGone

sacrificesWho among us has the courage to follow joyfully This being one with such perfect appearanceWhen comprehending the empty nature of all phenomena by means of insight and wisdom they are free from evilAfterwards they should be gathered and released in a great riverand the Tathāgata just like that householder has said to us You are my sonsThis King Ratnacchattra honored the Tathāgata

spiritual friend and listen to the most profound Mahāyāna owing to the tiny root of virtue they possessO svāhā to Kelimālinand similarly when they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the aggregates from physical forms to consciousness are without aspirationsSince they derive from imagination who in fact is scolding or striking meand thinks After I give birth to my child if everything goes well I will become celibate foreverAs an analogy Bhadrapāla even though the wind element is formless it manifests in the form of things that are both demonstrable and tangibleWhen they die and depart from the hells Then they will be reborn as animalsIt is the elimination of propensities through remaining in that emancipation Does the Jina teach this samādhi considering the giving away of all possessions to be the means of realizing buddhahoodSome of them attained the result of becoming a oncereturnerThey even have bonfires made for me they resolve struggle strive persevere

practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should not dwell on the first bodhisattva levelWhy is it the omen for the eighteen unique qualities of a buddha Because it brings the attainment of all good qualitiesIndra as Vajrapāṇihaving error and no error having greatness and no greatnessThe thusgone ones feel great compassion for sentient beings since all phenomena are nonexistent and yet sentient beings regard them as existentHaving used ones personal mantra to incant a sword or the like  timesI am the protector and the father of beingsAnd I have made happy many who were enduring suffering Signlessness as a gateway to liberation implies that they lack all signsHe turns beings away from the paths leading to the lower realmsIt will spread to the southern regionrelatively their teaching knows no exhaustionIn that respect there is no applicationThe parks were also adorned with canopies of cloth in various colors as well as parasols flags and bannersGreat hero we are overjoyed by The great rishis words with implied meaningTherefore young man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who think I shall understand the languages of all beings and knowing their higher or lesser capabilities I will teach them the DharmaI have come here to see you Omniscient OneVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection is not sentientHaving recited them they extensively teach these sūtras to othersgather the factors of awakeningAlthough their defilements are exhausted ultimately there is nothing to be exhaustedLikewise so long will the gods of the Caturmahārājakāyika realm emerge in the worldAt times the King of Aṅga and his armies were dominantMaheśvara accompanied by all the gods of the pure abodesDivine son in the same way the hearers are frightened of saṃsāra and flee in panicO Therein the psychophysical aggregates the sense fields and the sensory elements do not at all existThese people will not attain emancipation andLike the sun he was loftyThrough their adherence to the two extremes of eternalism and nihilismThat dharmas are not cognized is the lack of reference point       tThey were also home to various wild animals such as śarabha spotted deer monkeys cats brown bears rabbits black bears hyenas and a number of different birdsAfter the Blessed One had spokenIf these words are spoken and the listener acts accordingly and adopts a similar view then both actions incur a root transgressionSubhūti just as an arhat endowed with the cessation of contaminants never has confidence in anyone else because he directly perceives phenomena andand similarly why would they have a view concerning sights and in the same vein to what end would they have a view concerning the other sense objects up to and including mental phenomenaThe way that the Blessed One has expounded on the doctrine of discipline Blessed One is indeed marvelousAre you not a known bandit or thiefWe should see what this bodhisattva is likeand the great bodhisattva being Maitreyathe bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahāsthāmprāpta called out to the four hundred million bodhisattvas assembled in the retinue of the Blessed One the thusgone AmitābhaA person who has killed an arhat is one who will not flourish in the Dharma and VinayaDear boy please listenWhat two thingsMañjuśrī the cloud is nonarisen and nonceasingJust as space does not entertain the thought I must attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentBhikṣus this great rishi who is in nirvāṇa The Guide who entered this precious stūpasprinkled the ThusGone One with golden lotuses from the Jambū RiverThe numerous inconceivable Dharmas Are taught by using wordsIf I were to have a lifespan that continued For as many millions of eons as there are sands in the GangesHe delighted and was beloved by people Bhikṣus upāsakas and bhikṣuṇīsThe Blessed One said In a similar way consciousness that is feeble by nature splits large bodies into pieces and leaves them behindThen a stūpa made of the seven precious materials arose from the center of the assembly directly in front of the BhagavānSubhūti the refinement of these five eyes possessed by great bodhisattva beings should be known as donning the great armor they have no harm  they do not increase defilements  they do not create any cause for disputesSubhūti this omniscience has not been created by anyone nor has it been transformedso ask whatever you wishWhen one does not wander one does not become distractedNo Blessed One they would notWill have forsaken a good rebirth And those courageous ones will come hereThey also lack skill concerning words misinterpreting them and failing to understand their true meaning Thus the ThusGone One advised them to rely on the true meaning and not on the words That way by relying on the true meaning they will understand that the very nature of words is sameness and they will then transcend words altogetherVenerable Subhūti to speak of attainment is boastful and conceitedTherefore Nakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijña this Dharma teaching is blessed to be like medicine for those beings in Jambudvīpa who are sick who are afflicted by illnessIn that assembly two hundred thousand great śrāvakas such as jñātakauṇḍinya who were arhats whose defilements had ceased and who had attained powerIt is neither afflicted nor purifiedVajrapāṇi in turn offered the following words to those buddhas and bodhisattvasYou must practice intently without distraction And quickly attain the wisdom of buddhahood They are the inconceivably numerous kinds of comprehension of the devas concerning the composite the inconceivably numerous kinds of comprehension of the devas concerning teaching the compositeIn ten million eons they will not go to the lower realms And no bad smells will come from them the transcendent perfection of tolerance has the defining characteristic of imperturbability the transcendent perfection of perseverance has the defining characteristic of uncrushabilityand then stood to one side supplicating him with the following wordsIf you ask why Subhūti it is because in the transcendent perfection of generosity there are no such conceptsso too what causes appropriation of the body is the desire for sound touch flavor and form produced through the conditions of a man and womanāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving physical forms as nonentitiesalong with RatnākaraWhen that was illuminated he illuminated the middle chamber of the fragrant templeEach person should prepare provisions for the journeyWho sees otherwise sees falselyLike a pure brahmin does to fire Bow with respect to the one Whether he be young or old Who tells you of the DharmaVenerable Lord if the notion of the sensory element of the eyes as calm is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of the sensory element of the eyes as not calm become a bodhisattvaO Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa Banish such and such Hū phaṭThe three worlds are ablaze with the suffering of old age and sicknessYou instructed them in the straight path that destroys existenceThese childish beings are killed like someone bitten by a poisonous snakeMonks again it was not possible for Brahmā lord of the Sahā World to resist the Bodhisattvas commandMañjuśrī who will have faith in this Dharma teachingWhen it decays the entire city will fill with a horrible stenchAnd proceed to the next world where he shall never see his relatives againIn this way Mañjuśrī they come into existence and go out of existenceMonks since six years had passedThe ThusGone One replied The victorious ones should be known to be like me Who has exhausted all faultsThus without any doubts or reservations they trust in the secret of the body of the thusgone onesVenerable Lord If great bodhisattva beings are endowed with the cognition whereby they would never regress into the lower realms of existence and never be censured by the worlds of gods humans and antigods what is that cognitionWhoever hears this teaching and puts it into practice Shall not only be an unsurpassable guide of humansfor the sake of showing compassion to us enjoy these airborne palaces of the BrahmāsSubhūti it is difficult for those who do not persevere and so on and who practice without alertness to aspire toward this transcendent perfection of wisdomPadmottara was Supuṣpacandra And Vasunandi was āntirāja with the ten strengths Because ultimately all phenomena are unbornāriputra if I were to teach the meaning of this it would alarm this world with its devasand that they will know no lives after this one Thus they themselves will altogether transcend miseryIn particular do not be attached to itand emptiness does not become fixated on emptinessI asked them How affectionate are your wives toward youMoreover āradvatīputra great bodhisattva beings consider that this same body from the soles of the feet upwards and the crown of the head downwards is full of manifold impuritiesTo understand the eye correctly and not to have attachment aversion or confusion with regard to formthat is called peaceSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdomAll the unwholesome paths that lead to the lower realms will swiftly be purified by the power of aspirations and the activities of excellent conductwho knew space like the palm of their hands whose emotions had been cooled as if treated by a balm of sandalwoodMental cognition in its pure state is discriminating wisdom the saṃbhogakāyaOf chariots that are drawn by four horsesor having his head cut offIt is hollow void unreal and unproducedIt provides relief for those who follow the MahāyānaSubhūti the expanse of reality indeed comprises all thingsI will cause great rain clouds of the Dharma to shower down on all hell beings extinguishing the fires of hell andFor whom has this conception arisen Who has made this conception ariseThat which ought to be done has been doneand nothing elseThus the emptiness of the eyes and the emptiness of the other sense organs up to and including the mental faculty are indivisible with this emptiness of the bodhisattvas and they cannot be bisectedIs it livableHearing this profound teaching never before heard they are terrified and doubtful do not rejoice andso that whoever hears the name of that thusgone one will make irreversible progress toward unexcelled and complete awakeningThe wise one does not see Māra and Māras armyHas anyone seen my son go out Then someone saidThey see me at Vulture Peak encircled and honored by an assembly of bodhisattvas teaching the Dharma at the center of the saṅgha of śrāvakasA bodhisattvas body is not pervasive to the same extent the reason being that it is affected by residual stainsAll these enlightened attributes and advantages I have achieved when I was formerly a bodhisattvaMy kinfolk will be happy to see you againthey achieve something difficultthat is to say they do not at all actualize the goals either of the level of the śrāvakas or of the level of the pratyekabuddhasThe strength of all the gods in the Joyous Heaven is the same as the strength of one of the kings of the gods in the Wholly Joyous Heaventhere is no designation of dualityMaitreya they are for bodhisattva mahāsattvas to have excellent intentioneightyfour thousand sores open up on all of

should not go elsewhere I shall give you a greater wageMoreover Subhūti the transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely pure because physical forms are unsulliedwith the great miraculous power of a bodhisattva with the great majesty of a bodhisattvaI speak skillfully in order to guide beings I teach them the level of nirvāṇaNeither does it free one from attachment It also does not lead to cessation or peacethirtytwo thousand beings set their minds on unsurpassable and perfect awakeningSubhūti space is absolutely pure because it neither arises nor ceases and it is neither afflicted nor purifiedknowledge apprehension understanding and realization arose Monks as I focused my mind correctly on the things that I had not hitherto heard thinking With higher knowledge I have relinquished the origin of suffering that truth of noble beingsPerform the threefold unionthis is the supreme extraction of the pillThen the Bhagavān taught this in the following versesOne will cause the enemy to burn with feverMonks this teaching I had not heard previously I understood it by focusing intently on the cessation of sufferingNo sooner had I said these words than the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and said to meBlessed One what is meant by the term true natureāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of physical forms as permanent or impermanent constitutes a bodhisattvaHaving in the same way killed Red Acalalikewise all the aggregates up to and including consciousness are signlessLike a wasteland it will shine with beauty no moreThey were accomplished in the sūtras and skilled in definitions They were shining and moved upon the earth Sarvatathāgataśrī Glory of All TathāgatasI ruled over the Heaven of the ThirtyThree and the Heaven Free from Strife I left those realms and came hereThey do not apprehend the emptiness of nonapprehension as the emptiness of nonapprehensionTheir minds free of error will always be at rest What they have heard and what they know will be like an ocean he recited and mastered the Three Piṭaka and gained the confidence born of knowledge and freedomIn that buddha realm not even the word woman was heardA washerwoman a prostituteIn this way Subhūti do great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of generosity acquire the transcendent perfection of wisdomThese four devoted great kings are giving me four stone alms bowlsIt is the attainment of joy It is experiencing the joy of the Dharmaspeaking and thinkingtook from around my neck a necklace of pearls worth one hundred thousand pieces of gold and offered it to himTook birth in the Lumbinī GroveThat was not the fault of the physician or the medicine It was the fault of the sick person Conclusion of seventh chapter The Attainment of Patienceunborn

attain awakeningOh I will discard the negative view that I have toward my preceptor or instructorTherefore you should proceed to abandon all conditioned phenomena Great king you should give priority to compassion and long for the Dharma and liberationThe Intelligent One looked at the palace And spoke in the sweetest voiceSubhūti all things have the modality of a magical display the reflection of the moon in water a dream an optical aberration an echo and a phantomHe replied This is owing to the absence of imaginationNor on account of the emptiness of internal phenomena did he consider that understanding to be anything other than clear realizationPadmaśrīgarbha once these two beings had spoken these verses the king attained the five types of clairvoyanceIf you ask why it is because they do not consider the nature of these sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of olfactory consciousnessa great number of akras Brahmās Lokapālas and many hundreds of thousands of gods and goddesses all followed the crown prince Mañjuśrī to listen to the DharmaChanda began to weep and spoke again to the GuideThe ordinand responds They do notWhich bring delight and are pleasant to

on a leaf of umbrella treeone should surround this with a threefold circle of o syllables using a red cord andIt would not even count for one thousandth or onebillionth of itWith joined palms he then addressed this question to the BhagavatNoble son even if all the infinite and limitless world realms were filled with beings who all were to speak at the same instantActualizing the three gateways of liberation is not what bodhisattvas minds are likeHow so Because bodhisattvas are free from anxieties when in the midst of a gatheringwho draw his form or have made offerings to himOne should grind the seeds of dhak and apply the pasteKāśyapa teach the unsurpassable path To those set upon supreme enlightenment Through meditation on that path they will become buddhasVenerable Subhūti do you think that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom discern provisionally that all things are like a dream like a mirage like an echo like an illusion and like a phantomIf it has fallen on the utpala it is the development of insight that should be studiedthe faculties endowed with the knowledge of all thingsSince they do not progress through faith even in the tathāgatasacquire the transcendent perfection of meditative concentrationWith the exception of a thusgone one a bodhisattva who dwells at the sublime seat of awakeningSimilarly they apprehend the applications of mindfulness and develop a view of the applications of mindfulness in an apprehending mannerCome my friends Let us go before the Bodhisattva himself and ask him what sublime qualities a precious family must have in order for a bodhisattva to take his final birth there Excellent they repliedWe prostrate to you incomparable ocean of wisdom The buddhas do not make oneness or plurality out of any dharmashe applied the blood onto the black erysipelas and nourished the bhikṣu with the wellprepared mealTherefore nanda do not be ashamed and go and get the milkThey remain within and emerge from the vehicle of the thusgone onesAs another analogy where there is a little grain of barley sesame seed wheat grain soya bean or mung beanMañjuśrī should you wonder whether at that time the monk Vīradatta was someone else you will not find it soThat is the teaching of supreme wisdom From having true correct knowledge You offered a canopy to Padmagarbha and a rain cover to Siṃhathe imprints that are caused by affliction disappearWhen a bodhisattva relies on the meaning and not on words and letters such a bodhisattva will have departed by means of the perfection of insightnot true not realpromulgate it and make it widely known to othersand a holder of the VinayaIf you ask what is the transcendent perfection of wisdomBhikṣus this bodhisattva mahāsattva rīgarbhaSimilarly I

inconceivable miraclesBhīṣmabala Bhīṣmamati Subhīṣma Bhīṣmānana and BhīṣmasamudgataI declare this I know this Young man if you have faith in methat the things associated with the transcendent perfection of wisdom are nonexistent and nonapprehensibleOne who attaining equanimity forms no conception of impurity or immaculateness yet is not utterly without conceptionThe bodhisattvas who know That teaching on phenomenaThe Blessed One replied to the bodhisattva great being Delighted by VictoryThe strength of ten bodhisattvas who have been definitively emerged for one hundred trillion eons is the same as the strength of one bodhisattva who has achieved acceptance that phenomena are unbornHe seemed to eat and drink yet always took nourishment from the taste of meditationSimilarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are empty of their own essential naturebut noble son I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit through that alms givingwhen the north was up the south was downAnd because they fail to comprehend reality they continue to roam through cyclic existence like a swirling firebrandtWhile bodhisattvas engage in every type of conduct they should not be tainted by that conducttwelve thousand bodhisattvas accepted that phenomena are nonarisingWho has trained in this restraint of the body And your vast rejoicing in compassion and equanimitythe five hundred merchants were securing their wares when they saw Saṅgharakṣita and exclaimedall other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are neither fettered by nor

meditation upon its teachingMany such pleasing words accompanied by music Are sung by the victorious onesDedicate yourself to them in order to escape from the three realmsHis merit that merit is profound And pervades every directionAnd the majestic Varuṇa holding necklaces of jewels Came in order to make offerings to the Bhagavān Nor have their own bodies ever existedPeople will live within enjoyable kūṭāgārasThey also praise others who would successfully abstain from wrong viewsThey are born go forth into homelessness Practice the difficult conduct AndWhat is she like that maiden who

owing to its utter purityDevelop the aspiration to enlightenment Thinking We also shall become jinas worthy of offerings They may become equipoised in and arise from these eight aspects of liberation both sequentially and in the reverse orderwish to enter the great wilderness of cyclic existence Thus as they seek to lead everyone into the city of omniscienceThe perfection of giving becomes thus fulfilled There is no doubtNovice we have quite a bit of grain to grind in the mortarThe Buddhas words are unsurpassable There is nothing higher than the Buddhas wordsSon of a deva that is how pleasant that place isYou should know those who do not entertain genuine realization to be the evil associates of great bodhisattva beingsthe presence of conditioned elements in unconditioned elements is without foundationMay all illnessesthose born from wind Those born from bile those born from phlegm And those from their combinationbe destroyedIn the South they are cunningThen the bodhisattva mahāsattva Bhaiṣajyarāja said to the BhagavānBodhisattvas think as followsThey let their nails hair and beard grow longThe gatekeeper returned from the kings quarters and told the sage Asita to enter the palaceYoung man as the bodhisattva mahāsattva Kṣemadattas right hand burned brightlyMonks while the Bodhisattva remained in this way among his retinue of consorts he matured  women along with many hundreds of thousands of assembled gods for the attainment of unexcelled and perfect awakeningAnd I awoke them to the path to enlightenment For which they had endless devotion I see thousands of millions of stūpas As numerous as the sands of the GangesIn this way Subhūti great bodhisattva beings should gather the fortytwo syllables in a single syllableTheir desire will be like the flames of a fire They will give teachings to laypeopleMadhura and the gandharva Madhurasvaratogether with a retinue of many trillions of gandharvasYoung man those four the tathāgatas inconceivably numerous

exact numberBy offering a chaff homa one will pacify epidemics among bipeds and quadrupedsThey will encounter many obstacles in this very life and burn in hell in their future rebirthsIt is not cut offWherever those bodhisattvas are present They will create an immeasurable benefit for beings For a long time we have had no wish For the highest wisdom of buddhahoodThus they become patient and

was feeling regretand this in turn inspires them to the enlightenment of buddhahoodThey therefore possess a wisdom vision that unimpededly perceives all phenomenawhether past future or present What a wonder this isOne should know that they have cultivated the roots of virtuous actionAnd once that person is delighted inspired and appreciativeand simultaneously set in contact with fireNoble son after having first given rise to the mind set on awakening bodhisattva great beings should strive diligently on the path of the ten virtuous actionsOn your forehead there is the adornment of an ūrṇā hair that is like a conch the moon or a jasmine flowerSimilarly they neither associate anything with nor disassociate anything from feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessPlease ensure that even though the thusgone ones pass beyond suffering the bodhisattva great beings do not stray from unsurpassed and perfectly complete awakeningthat they do not stray at allNext the Bodhisattva went to the hermitage of a brahmin woman called Padmā who also invited the Bodhisattva to stay for a mealthey are free of murk because they are free of desire anger and dullnessThey have come before the Lord the Guide of the World And they have scattered flowers over the GuideAs they arrive they make all the abodes of Māra appear darkIf all those dust particles that had been created Were each to represent a hundred eonsWhat is it like How is it poorThose arrogant bhikṣus bhikṣunīs upāsakas and upāsikās to whom he had previously said I am not ridiculing you and who gave him the name SadāparibhūtaWhen I saw other bodhisattvas and heard the names of the buddhas that those bodhisattvas will become in the futureThose individuals who gain nonmaterial joy They will quickly attain buddhahood  Will lead to the six destiniesMahāmaudgalyāyana replied Elder do as you sayThen the Bhagavān instructed the entire host of bodhisattvas and the world with its devas and asuras sayingNot take what has not been given And not associate with anothers wifeit transformed into a kūṭāgāra in the air above the Bhagavān which was made of strings of pearls was quadrangular with four pillars well proportioned symmetrical and beautifulThose people who will retain the names of rī Mahādevī and who will put them into practice once they have heard them will have those aforementioned qualities and benefits Benefiting and having a sense of modesty Abhorring the wickedness of the mindExcellent sublime flowers fragrant with divine perfumes fell like rainThey were inexhaustible mines of limitless virtuesSimilarly owing to their utter purity they do consider the nonarising of the attributes of ordinary peopleThey are human white lotuses They are human tamers They are human moonsDesire is ephemeral like dew on the tip of grass or like autumn cloudsHer nose is well formed with a beautiful complexionsome he gives after piercing a point on the body with a needlewhy do you say that the imperishability of all other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience is not omniscience and the restI performed sixty trillion sacrifices thereOne hundred times one hundred billion is called one quadrillion kañkaraThey themselves should enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvasI will never drink wine The cause of intoxicationThey will attain the power of mental retention that is called a trillion convergencesSenior āradvatīputra those who have entered the stream are nonconceptual andThe Blessed One was dwelling in the Deer Park by the Hill of the Fallen Sages near Vārāṇasīif you ask what it is that they will not be emancipated fromThey have a wise ones mind They wish for all beings to be happyPraising you for an eon Will not even cover the pores of your bodyHe responds by saying I am happy to do soand others too accrue from laziness apply yourselves diligentlyAnd then set out for the grove of the caretaker of mango trees In the city called VārāṇasīSeducing anothers wife false speechThat is someone who on this day pleases me And this lord of jinas who has entered nirvāṇaSin is just the same as the mindThey were disfigured and caused terror with their awful faces of foxes jackals pigs donkeys oxen elephants horses camels wild asses buffaloes rabbits yaks rhinos and the eightlegged lion beastone will produce the brilliance of lightningAcknowledging the kindness of others is a gateway to the light of the Dharmathat I would attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment saying O my child of enlightened heritage in the future after countless eons in this world system during the Auspicious EonThey resolve struggle strive persevere with tenacity and rightly aspire that virtuous attributes which have previously arisen might remain be unforgotten flourish and be fully cultivatedIn the center of the circle one should write both the name of the target and that of the practitionerIn what way is their body solid like a vajraAt that time noble disciples experience only feelings of pleasureTherefore all māras and opponents are my servantsI am the light of the worldtheir verbal actions are without malicesignlessnessThe Bodhisattva left his home In possession of all good qualitiesWho has attained complete mastery of all types of powerthey have no cessation they have no characteristics of causeConcealed and with senses subdued he is very restrained like an elephant He is stainless pure and calm like a lakeIf anyone does so they will face capital punishment and I will provide recompense from my own stores and treasuryBodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra spent twelve years wandering in search of those pores but he never saw themSo it is Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should make a definitive analysis in accord with the reality of these phenomenaBodhisattvas endeavor in meritorious acts and they are steadfast through their meritsThere are sixty holy beings including the bodhisattva great beings Maitreya and Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta who have attained this illusory absorptionGod how is it that any practice related to any demon constitutes bodhisattva practiceThey will teach the Dharma to those who come to listen to them beneficially and without envyWhen they have perfected those paths brought sentient beings to maturityNoble ones this highest complete enlightenment that I accomplished after a hundred thousand quintillion asaṃkhyeya eons I place in your handsIn this way bodhisattvas teach the Dharma while residing within their mothers wombput it inside the effigyOthers were grinding their flutes with their teethSuch are the faces of the approaching armyWe can give you nourishment through the pores of your bodyCultivate them individually for seven days mix them and place them in a jackalHaving heard that doctrine they retain itOne should visualize him alone Assuming him to be the central figure among the five Acalaslet alone bodhisattva mahāsattvas with five hundred bodhisattva followersThere would still be no end to their qualities Just as it is with directions and spaceLike a physician who is skilled in methods Who because his sons have deluded perceptionHow so Because they have attained the intrinsic natureAll the devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinnaras mahoragas humans and nonhumans who were in those buddha realms while remaining there through the power of the buddhas saw this Sahā world realmand similarly when they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the aggregates from physical forms to consciousness are calmthey will gradually study this transcendent perfection of wisdom more extensively in the presence of the tathāgata Akṣobhya and those great bodhisattva beingsThe devas of the paradises of the four mahārājas in order to honor the Bhagavān seated at the sublime supreme BodhimaṇḍaAnd using words that will not be doubted That is the nature of the Jinas teaching iWith those treasures that do not belong to anyone he will cater to the material needs of the universal monarchNoble son replied the Blessed One they have indeed heard that thusgone ones nameShe is able to attain the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahoodAnd be free from the bonds of saṃsāraDevoted to solitude they reach perfection in concentrationGentlemen lay waste to those landsThat which has no intrinsic substance and no other sort of substance does not burnand the same goes for the other sensory elements up to and including the sensory element of mental consciousnessThose tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas who will emerge in the futurewho hold the view that one should be fearless concerning the next lifethe eight aspects of liberation the nine serial steps of meditative absorptionHis words will be renowned in the ten directionsAnd this entire set has been realized by the Tathāgata as consistentThey partake of offerings at the homes of allAfter a preliminary practice of six monthsWhatever miraculous powers you see in meBlessed One all of us would like to listenand that they will never squander any teachings of the sacred doctrine which they hear from those lord buddhas until they have attained perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentin the form of a baby elephant white in color with six tuskswith lightning for lamps and a surrounding railing made of gems and jewelsThen through the reversal of dependent origination they should be attentive to the cessation of the entire great mass of sufferingThe blessings should be transferred gradually While confidence should be produced immediatelyMonks indeed the very moment that the Bodhisattva attained omniscience all beings throughout all the worlds in the ten directions instantly became ecstaticthis knowledge holder should for the sake of the desired accomplishments enter meditation and recite the mantra one hundred thousand times for each of its syllablesThis is the time when the BlissGone One attains immortalityThese qualities can also be characterized as their signs marks qualities or benefitsSister first ask the master of the house She went to the brahmin the master of the house and saidUpasena he should be accorded with all of the above except prostrationsThe monk informant then informs the saṅgha in the following wayI have never taught it but kept it secret Today I will expound it so listen everyoneAnd having the infinite awareness of the sugatas wisdom Are distinctive qualities of the first patience Those who turn their minds to this king of the sūtras will have happiness in this worldThey are primarily living in forests but also Their bodies are shining with lightYet when these

the Ganges sands Became irreversible within the buddhas wisdom or who are physically disabled in any wayOne laments I have not striven for liberationThe supreme tree bowed down like a lotus leafNoble sons when a Dharma teacher explains presents and illumines this Dharma discourse he or she should do so without fear timidity faintheartedness or hostilityThe Blessed One the ThusGone One then uttered this dhāraṇī with the sound and intonation of a kalaviṅka birdDesire is threefold as there is greater middling and lesser desireNowhere is this sacred doctrine obstructedThat is to say they will inspire those who are stingy to be generous those with flawed discipline to be disciplined those with ill will to be patient the lazy to be diligent the disturbed to be concentrated and those with misguided intelligence to be insightfulElated with a sense of satisfaction and joy he was ecstaticgreat bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of generosityit is on account of the emptiness of internal phenomena the emptiness of external phenomena and similarly on account of the emptiness of both external and internal phenomena the emptiness of emptiness the emptiness of great extent the emptiness of ultimate reality the emptiness of conditioned phenomena the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena the emptiness of the unlimited the emptiness of that which has neither beginning nor end the emptiness of nondispersal the emptiness of inherent existence the emptiness of all things and the emptiness of intrinsic defining characteristicsIt is these doorways to liberation That the Buddha taught as doorways They are those who see correctly and do not say Anything to the contrary or any untrue wordsplaces that are not ruggedTheir crown protuberance is inconspicuousMy friend who is your teacher Who taught you so welland have great compassion for all beingsOn a soft and sweetly scented bed scattered with flowersnanda just as the buddhafields are diverse as to their specific qualities but have no difference as to the sky that covers themMañjuśrī giving awakening and sentient beings and on the other hand the Tathāgata these are nondualIt is born of the ten powers the four fearlessnesses and the eighteen special qualitiesand in the same vein no other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasMany people rejected them Many people were hostile to them Many people dismissed them It was a time of great terrorsNoble sir production and destruction are two but what is not produced and does not occur cannot be destroyedProstrations to the all the bodhisattvas mahāsattvas of the ten directions and three timesIf one were to ask why it is because the real nature of phenomena is empty of the real nature of phenomenaIt is knowledge of oneselfThey do not consider whether the eyes are permanent or impermanentThey spoke fearlessly like lionsThey assembled in front of the Bodhisattva and began displaying the thirtytwo ways of female trickeryOnce ignorance has disappeared there will no longer be any attachment to formation and without such attachment there will be no consciousnessSubhūti this transcendent perfection of wisdom is profoundentered equipoise in the absorption called vanquishing all grahas and bhūtas from below the earthadorned with divine jewelryBecause that is how bodhisattvas who strive to realize this absorption come to free themselves of all notionsThe sounds of quintillions of musical instruments Clear and beautiful voices like those of the devasdisturbance and perturbationThey should devote themselves to all merit that is subsumed in the realm of phenomenaTherefore it is called nonperceptionSimilarly emptiness is not something other than fundamental ignorance Nor is fundamental ignorance something other than emptinessTo those who revere Kāmeśvara he will display the form of KāmeśvaraThis palace was filled with parasols flags and streaming banners it was covered by canopies of tiny jeweled bells and strewn with māndārava and mahāmāndārava flowersWhat is the use of the sacrifice of material thingstNārāyaṇa what do you thinkThey will have a strong belief in a selfand similarly who practice in order that they might grasp or reject feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness cannot cultivate the transcendent perfection of wisdomThen hundreds of thousands of gods and humans let out hundreds of thousands of exclamations of surprise and cries of joyone billion realms of the Heaven of Great FruitionThrough the power of this diligence Before long they will attain enlightenment Vyūharāja declared the Blessed One on this very day the attainment of unsurpassed and perfect awakening will be prophesied for sixtyfour thousand beingsAt that time the bhikṣus who believed in objective reality And who were holding weapons became illshaped in bodyIn its eight directions starting from the eastanointed with white sandalwood paste and wearing a necklace of sweetsmelling flowersAs this is how things are and not otherwise the rounds of existence are thus to be countedOn this basis by means of the vehicle of the śrāvakas the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas or the vehicle of the genuinely perfect buddhas they will attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where there is no residue of the psychophysical aggregateslest you be unable to receive its giftcover it with another seven leavesGo ahead On reaching the roof she cried out A thief A thieffor that many eons We shall act as you have taught In order to help beingsHaving entered homelessness they learned this samādhi and having learned it they understood itTherefore he is the One Who Declares All disturbing emotions are obstacles for passing beyond suffering and Thus Discovers a Confidence That the Entire World including the Gods Cannot DestroyThe arrogant bhikṣus bhikṣunīs Upāsakas and upāsikāsThat entire gathering of bodhisattvas declared a second time and a third time in one voiceTherefore the attributes of the tathāgatas are inconceivableThey all bowed toward the Buddha Having listened to this stainless samādhi He quickly entered homelessness in the supreme Jinas teaching and there is no listener who would hear itWe have heard this supreme prophecy That is vast extensive and diverseIt is protected by supreme siddhas and vidyādharas It is frequented by devas and the lords of birds sing there iiiFurthermore Mañjuśrī a bodhisattva who is convinced that all afflictions are the Buddhadharma will attain purification of karmic obscurationsAnd offered to the teacher Ambrosialike medicinesIn this regard the expression seven prominent parts means that the two prominent backs of his legs are elegant fine beautiful to behold and filled out with flesh and blood Similarly the two prominent backs of his arms are elegant fine beautiful to behold and filled out with flesh and blood There are also two prominent parts at his shoulders and one prominent part at the nape of his neck which are elegant fine beautiful to behold and filled out with flesh and bloodThe man who is the owner of that house Is gazing upon it standing at the doorWere to fill all the ten directions Like reeds or a stand of bamboo that the nature of the qualities of the buddhas is emptiness and that emptiness is indeed the qualities of the buddhasWhat is a fetishist One who becomes erect if embraced by anotherHowever and wherever he manifests he will explain the Dharma to such kṣatriyasMañjuśrī a bodhisattva does not think of destruction arising nondestruction nonarising and the utter destruction of destructionas he is in the womblike a flash of lightningIf you ask why all things are neither fettered nor liberated because all things are nonexistentIgnorance is the causal condition of formationsAt that time and in those days King ūradatta had a capital city named Ratnāvatī which was vast and immense and had four gatewaysAll of them will carry out ones ordersand on his lefthand side by akra lord of the devas and by countless devas with great powerThese are called the eighteen sensory elementskumbhāṇḍas or rākṣasas Just like the poor person who has no wealth How might the bodhisattvas generosity become exhausted you askHe is lying in his own excrement in a revolting stateThey continually adorn millions of realms And are created because of the children of the jinas Seeing that an elephant had been killed at the city gate he asked Who killed itThe intrinsic condition of all objectsI remember that as I was practicing in the past In the teaching of Sugata SiṃhadhvajaWhen one realizes mind this is wisdom So one should cultivate the clear understanding of not seeking the Buddha elsewhereThey do not frequent the company of caṇḍālas swindlers pig sellers chicken sellers deer hunters fishermen singers and dancers musicians or wrestlersVenerable Lord if the notion of fundamental ignorance as having aspirations is invariably nonapprehensible how could the designation of fundamental ignorance as lacking aspirations become a bodhisattvaand the filigree net of chimes creating sweet enchanting and delightful soundsThen Princess Jñānāvatī became happy delighted thrilled joyful pleased and glad and made this resolutionThe Blessed One replied āradvatīputra it is soThose who hear the vast teaching of the wise Experience vast joy and their hairs stand on endHearing such Dharma one obtains a lion throne like thisThis āradvatīputra is the Great Vehicle of great bodhisattva beingsThere was a wise bhikṣu a dharmabhāṇaka Whose name was Brahmadatta his unprecedented presence in the world is like that of a wishfulfilling jewelTherefore you are still my śrāvakas And using methods I lead you all to this enlightenmentI shall teach the transcendent perfection of wisdomNonarising is faultlessThe bodhisattvas will know through their smells The many kinds of jewels that are enjoyed Those that have been deposited under the ground And those that are owned by womenThus it is said that the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma for the sake of cutting off the dharmasEven the gods in the Heaven of the Four Great Kings turn back when they approach human habitationsFrom the time the sun rises to the time it sets there shall be no challenger to equal youHow do they abide in equanimitywill ferry across trillions of beings swept away in the ocean of suffering In the ship of the sublime Dharmaand similarly the more they wish to teach and grant instruction in the causal attributes from the four applications of mindfulness up to and including the noble eightfold pathAt that time the Blessed One dwelt in the city of rāvastīLater after the monks of the saṅgha gathered and were seatedDivine being this is what it means to be a bodhisattva who has only one birth remainingAt this time I the guide who is a Lord of Jinas Have also appeared so that beings may attain happinessWill make offerings to him And the assembly will rejoiceare not separated from the transcendent perfection of wisdom and engage in the conduct of a bodhisattva without lacking skillful meansIt offers genuine pleasure and dispels sufferingTherefore noble ones this entire assembly of bodhisattvas should be attentive focused and stableNoble son once while Ratnaśrī was seated upon a splendid lion throne her son Ratnākara got down from her lap where he had been sitting in the crosslegged posture The bhikṣu Supuṣpacandra was here Armored in the thirtytwo characteristicsKauśika it is because these sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage totally cultivate the emptiness of internal phenomena but always without apprehending anythingSuch a monk should not be welcomedit is in the vanguard of all other attributes up to and including omniscienceOnce the king has conquered the north the wheel will move toward the northern seas andYet the mind that practices the path has no intrinsic existence is not real and does not occurMay you not incur evil May all deities protect youRain falls on the corpse and the wind tosses it aboutThey have not forsaken pride and are still conceited with the mundane view of the transitory collectionlike a mass of clouds in the skyThe light shines equally without any inequality on the good and the bad the high and the low the aromatic and the foulsmellingThen Ajita the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Candrasūryapradīpa that evening at midnightWhat is not clinging to dhyāna It is wishing to transcend the three existencesThe wisdom that evolves from ground to ground is a gateway to the light of the DharmaAnd whether I teach the Dharma or not this group that is sure to be correct will understand the DharmaOnce there I took up residence at Pāṇḍava the king of mountains where I stayed on its slope alone in solitude without any company At that time many trillions of gods protected meFor these reasons āradvatīputra bodhisattvas who are unskilled have a view concerning physical formsOne will obtain an unsurpassable gift of languageEven of the śrāvakas following the knower of the worldThey know what is Dharma and what is not They are gentle wise and remain within the DharmaBhagavān how much merit will a noble man or noble woman generate by carrying this Dharma teaching The White Lotus of the Good Dharma on their body or making a text of itWhen asked they reply that through the essential nature of their mind they understand the essential nature of all beingsWith the attainment of the fourth concentration they reverse the grasping at a selfUpananda thought No doubt this is one of our elder monksGreat bodhisattva beings who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom achieve that which is difficultAt that time he said to the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha JaladharagarjitaghoṣasusvaranakṣatrarājasaṃkusumitābhijñaGo before the Supreme BeingThus the venerable one achieved the allknowing state of an arhat whose mind had been utterly freedHe has many female slaves male slaves workers and hirelingsIn his buddha realm live the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahāsthāmprāpta both of whom have attained this absorptionand abandoned my limbsHaving impassioned the four goddessesthey met the god who was carrying the Bodhisattvas silken garments on his head Again they thoughtSo Sukuṇḍala entered his divine palace and looked inside his potsHe will certainly be a universal monarch the jewel of your family lineageVenerable Lord I am grateful and thankful that the tathāgatas arhats and genuinely perfect buddhas of the past along with their disciples delighted induced aroused and incited the Tathāgata Arhat and Genuinely Perfect Buddha establishing him in the six transcendent perfections when he was formerly a bodhisattvaThese rites as was the case with the rites belonging to the root mantra call for deityspecific mantrasVenerable Lord Are sights also free from contaminants and not included within the three world systems owing to the emptiness of inherent existenceAnd teach buddhahoods enlightenment at the appropriate timeWhat are those eight qualitiesand eliminating the darkness and obscuring film of ignoranceSimilarly the four applications of mindfulness emerge dependent on the transcendent perfection of wisdomThe preceptor thought Why have they set out this second seat and plate of offeringsShould the great virtuous medicinal butter make his or her complexion poor and pale that is explained as resembling nonvirtueThe awakening that the ThusGone One has gained over incalculable eons will long remain and expandwhose minds are distractedEmptiness is not other than physical forms nor are physical forms other than emptinessThe same goes for the ears nose tongue body and mental facultyFurthermore not knowing reality in the sense of not apprehending it and misapprehending it is ignoranceSimilarly the practice of the bodhisattvas starting with Avalokiteśvara Vajrapāṇi and MañjuśrīYou will become like akra himself and will come to possess wealth like his The lord of the gods akra has all divine enjoyments and so shall youIf no redness is seen in the fingernails one will die within six monthsMonks death is neither appealing nor is it singled out considered valuable pleasant or highly appreciated by anyoneThat would be impossibleThat carefulness is the very root Of all the qualities of the aspects of enlightenmentTireless One to you we bow downNor in those great leaders does ignorance ever arise They have eliminated all kleśas without remainder The youthful Mañjuśrī should now inquire of the Tathāgata the Arhat the Perfect and Complete Buddha about nonarising and noncessation We have not heard that Dharma teaching for a long timeVenerable Lord Great bodhisattva beings who have heard this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom and formed aspirations regarding it include those who fulfilled their higher deeds in the presence of former conquerorsTherein there are no eyes no ears no nose no tongue no body no mental faculty no sights no sounds no odors no tastes no tangibles and no mental phenomenabut the embarrassment that the monks examination caused to the naked and exposed postulants prompted the Blessed One to decreeThe legs of her bed were embellished with costly divine jewelsone billion realms of the Heaven of Limited Virtuespoke these verses to the great assembly of Brahmāsnanda it is because the bodhisattvas train in the six transcendent perfections and in the other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasThroughout the entire trichiliocosmphysical actions all being preceded by and agreeing with wisdom verbal actions all being preceded by and agreeing with wisdom and mental actions all being preceded by and agreeing with wisdomFrom within that assembly Bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin arose from his seat bared one shoulder and kneeling on his right knee andThis Maitreya is how the bodhisattva mahāsattvas have skill in their methodsAfter eight or nine monthsThey do not preoccupy themselves with the talk of robbersBenefactor this is excellent Blissful One your wordsteinote xmlidUT are excellentSuch is the bodhisattvas excellent power of unshakable blessingsWhat are those ten They are being a source of jewels being deep and hard to fathom being vast and boundless being in constant flow being free of the corpse of affliction being of a single taste receiving all rivers never being late being the abode of numerous spirits and being inexhaustibleThey should not make assumptions on account of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness contemplation of a blueblack corpselikewise establishing them in the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdom ButFurthermore Subhūti great bodhisattva beings should themselves bring sentient beings to maturationAs soon as the monk allowed his going forth he sat down moaningThe Blessed One repliedSubhūti so it is that when great bodhisattva beings know that the lack of inherent existence with respect to all phenomena is unconditionedAll phenomena are like space ever pure and clear Beyond sufferingIt is a bodhisattvas nature to examine all these entities and thus such a thoughtful bodhisattva contemplatesWhen his blood has dried out his flesh will witherand refreshes all the grass forests medicinal herbs and cropsyou will attain the attributes of omniscience andHe resides at the summit of existencegenerates faith in those who lack faith quells the torments caused by faminesSimilarly they neither associate the sensory element of sights and the sensory element of visual consciousnessHaving arisen from it he addressed Brother āriputraSkilled in the discernment of what is pronounced and what is not pronouncedteinote xmlidUT through insight they possess pure liberationBhikṣus I am youngSimilarly if they engage with the notion that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are calm or that these are not calm then they are merely engaging with mental imagesthey do not wish By this generosity may I become such and such a god or May I became such and such a rulerthe term unconditioned phenomena denotes anything that does not arise that does not abide that does not disintegrate and that does not change into something elseAfterward when twelve years had passed the fire went outthe noble man or noble woman who enters the BodhisattvayānaThen while maintaining the six transcendent perfectionsWill bring her ease in childbirthAnd he told them At all costs make sure in this way that these teachings of the Dharma which are the pledge of the Tathāgata will not quickly disappearWhile in the meal queue we fought and as the fruition of that karma have been born as denizens of an ephemeral hellmake from the wood of cobras saffron the king of nāgas AnantaIn this way the whole great Nairañjanā River flowed on full of divine perfumes and flowers that rained downWhen the brahmin Tiṣya heard that the master Māṭhara was to leaveElu velu śila pa ḍa i jahaṃ pelu āgāsapantharate ha attaṃdhari khili mo ḍi them bhi jakāre jā hi ṭhakāre hi ṭhaḥ ṭhaḥ ṭhaḥ svāhāI would not be able to complete recounting them Even in a quintillion eons If the ordinands Dharma robes have not already been cut and sewn the materials must be sanctioned in the following wayAs soon as they hear of these states they are struck by a sadness that makes them muster diligence in the pursuit of virtuous qualities so that those unvirtuous qualities can be overcomeThose heroes those mighty ones will soon Attain higher knowledge and enlightenmentMercury free from the mountain defect One should properly obtainIt should be square with a circumference of five cubitsIn the same vein as before it has not been produced by the applications of mindfulnessI gave away a maiden adorned in jewelry Who was perfectly beautiful and desirable For a long time with the net of the four means of attracting disciplesgenerosity kind talk meaningful actions and practicing what one preacheshe has skillfully trained the multitudes of beings so he is the One with Webbed Fingers and ToesThis is backbitingit is because they will have engaged in and accrued deeds that are destitute of the sacred doctrineCould it be the mighty Kṛṣṇa or perhaps the divine moon or the thousandrayed sunThey offered them to the ThusGone One but he declined thinking that these were all inappropriate for a monkand apprehend those applications of mindfulnessAsk whatever question you wish to the Tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened BuddhaFor this reason Venerable Lord great bodhisattva beings do not become discouraged with regard to this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomThey say nothing that is untrue About the unique qualities of the buddhasat that time through his miraculous power suspended the fourfold assembly up in the airThis concludes the chapter on the signs of death twentythird in the glorious Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa tantra called The Sole HeroThe miraculously manifested mansions were square structured around four pillarsThen there appeared a bodhisattva mahāsattva bhikṣu named SadāparibhūtaOne will be the greatest Of miracle workers The other will be The wisest of the wise If one enters the outer inner concealed And ultimate maṇḍalas and obtains initiation One must meditate recite and so forth Lest one might obstruct and denigrate the secret mantrathe four garuḍa lordsthe garuḍa lords Mahātejas MahākāyaHaving eaten a meal then in Ratnāvatī Establish many beings in the Dharma xinconceivable Offerings that there can be They should make to all the buddhas The unfired jar could not last long and would swiftly disintegrate into common clayand the inconceivably numerous kinds of knowledge of existents concerning purification Those are the fourSimilarly they discern that the ten powers of the tathāgatas are empty of the emptiness of the ten powers of the tathāgatasand throw it up to the height of one palm tree two palm trees three palm trees four palm trees five palm trees six palm trees seven palm treesāradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the sensory element of the ears the sensory element of sounds and the sensory element of auditory consciousness as nonentitiesFor him desirable objects have no attractionwill protect those dharmabhāṇakas for a hundred yojanasand are sublime and free from contaminantsthe Tathāgata Meru the Tathāgata MahāmeruTheir minds are unimpeded and infinite unequaled and extraordinaryMoreover all the preliminaries The subsidiary techniques and actual union Along with their intention are in stagesHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the eight aspects of liberationYou are the healer who brings sublime benefitDo śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have this skill in means which would enable them also to bring those creatures and themselves to maturity in the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and make those assassins cease from causing further harmGentlemen I the king had the bells rung and announcedWhen they saw him they conceived of him as like a father And they developed the aspiration to attain supreme enlightenmentSenior Subhūti replied to Senior āradvatīputra as followsThis is the path that leads to the cessation of sufferingA monk should not be forced to account for those items of which the allocation is evident but its receipt is obscureMañjuśrī as for obscuration attachment is an obscurationwere to practice for eight hundred thousand quintillion eons the five perfections which are the perfection of generosity the perfection of correct conduct the perfection of patience the perfection of diligence and the perfection of meditation without the perfection of wisdomand produces its divine scent and colorNoble son replied the Blessed One the buddhas and bodhisattvas teach the Dharma to those who have faithA noble son or daughter may establish all beings in the trichiliocosm upon the paths of the ten virtuous actsOne should spread darbha grass there and set it alightAnd developed the aspiration to enlightenment Became buddhas in numerous different realms Then the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahāsthāmprāpta went before the Blessed One the thusgone worthy completely perfect Buddha AmitābhaVirtuous One you will tame Māra the evil one and his army And dry up the entire three lower realmswhen they saw it prompted them to thinkAs they played these instruments Sang songs and dancedBhikṣus then all the Mahābrahmās who lived in those fifty hundred thousand quintillion worlds and who had gathered together each entered his own divine Brahmā palace andEnjoy these pleasures my Lord If you do not leave you will experience great delightsThey are also our friendsThen they adopted the practice of celibacy And they cast off their delightful jewelry avoid bad companions rely on kalyāṇamitras have an inquiring nature unrelentingly seek the Dharmathe transcendent perfection of generosityDo not honor me with material objects but honor me by honor to the DharmaThere are good colors and bad colorsVardhamānamatiWe only need a walking stick for when we are oldSubhūti those great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom will achieve and maintain the first meditative concentration and then they will achieve and maintain all the other meditative concentrations up to and including the fourth meditative concentrationJoining his palms he says Venerable saṅgha please listenSon of a noble family the dharmakāya of the Tathāgata consists in the fact that he has no nature just like the skyIt is the same for sensation identification mentation and young man for consciousnessesAn ordinary woman lacking qualities of proper conduct and honest speech Would not be suitable for me at allDo not measure the length of a shadow with a long stickIf you do speak of it thenLikewise the same goes for the six transcendent perfections and in the same vein all the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighty minor marksDemonstrating the power of kindness Always having compassion for beingsThe bodhisattvas love extends out as well to all the beings present in those world systemsYou may burn the entire Mount Meru And enter invisible into the earthit is that which does not apprehend any phenomena at all Nonapprehension is empty of nonapprehension because it does not endure and does not disintegrateI replied O Kauśika do not offer me who am religious and a son of the ākya things which are not appropriateso that they hear his voicefreedom from the pains of the afflictionsAll virtuous attributes are indeed attained therein and all things are subsumed thereināradvatīputra this union whereby great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom endures when all other engagements have been surpassedSeeing the sage crying shedding tears and sobbing the king became afraid and distressed and he very quickly inquired of the great sageThe sameness of the person is the same as the common meaningThat is how one should know wisdom to be The inconceivable wisdom of buddhahood in the sensations of warmth and cold that it createsThe great noise of the powerful army is heard everywhereThe harmful garland of thoughts Strung on the thread of conceptionsOverwhelmed by grief the ākya women cried out in misery in the twilight In the twilightBhagavān teach nirvāṇaIf one has a headache one should incant sesame oil and rub it onto ones headWithout having to be asked they were the natural spiritual benefactors of all living beingsWere I to teach it no one would understandYoung man bodhisattva mahāsattvas whose wish is to aspire to the body of the tathāgataor all the doctrines of the pratyekabuddhas or all the doctrines of the bodhisattvasThe Lord of men prophesied thatAnd who is never afflicted by the bondage of desire Practices this excellent samādhi Never does it abandon the lineage of the noble ones nor does it ever spoil the vow of the mind of awakeningThose two boys had miraculous power wisdom merit and knowledgeSimilarly Subhūti if the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdom were entities and not nonentitiesSimilarly the nonarising of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness is not consciousness and the other aggregatesAlong with these monks were  bodhisattvas all of whom had only a single birth remaining and were adept in all the perfections of the bodhisattvasSimilarly things are not apprehended because the fruit of having entered the stream is nonapprehensibleBlessed One young prince Mahauṣadhi is good at asking such profound questionsWithin six months one will accomplish VāgīśvaraYou may wonder noble son how bodhisattvas remain in the application of mindfulness with respect to mental phenomenaand then if the men women boys and girls were to load that mustard into carts bags and baskets onto camels donkeys and cattle andIf the Blessed One would grant me the opportunity I have a few questions I would like to put to the Blessed One the thusgone worthy and perfect Buddha Are you enjoying good health and wellbeingAs soon as their own spirits of enlightenment had become clear to them they bowed at the feet of that good man andSubhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom abide in the six transcendent perfections which arise through the maturation of past actionsNoble son what if the noble son or noble daughter is poor and cannot use precious sapphire jewel powder emerald powder or gold or silver powderdoes not cause one to know mundane phenomenaI should try to persevereThey should make to all the buddhas Her body was festooned in garlands necklaces and jewelry like a goddess at play in a pleasure gardenWill never be bereft of mindfulness and insightand the utterly unborn on the ultimate level is also ultimately the same as the dharmas of the completely perfect BuddhaYou have attained the skys own samenessOn this day my life has borne fruitIt is in this way Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings act as an ally of the worldsGuide release your gentle speech Divine son ultimately all phenomena are utterly beyond formationTheir followers number a thousand Or similarly a hundred or fifty One could not count them all Even in a thousand million eonsThe Blessed One also expressed his approval to youthful Mañjuśrī saying Well said Mañjuśrī well saidSarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin and the other bodhisattvas then said Excellent Blessed Oneyet also not undistinguished eitherWhy does this bhikṣu without our asking say that he does not intend to ridicule usthe samādhi named ShiningIn that way beings have great ignorance Like the bornblind man and continue in saṃsāraNandika will slay this bhikṣuWhat is having a pure livelihood It is being satisfied with anythingnor even is the absence of defining characteristics perceived by means of the absence of defining characteristicsAfter Sūryānana there was a buddha Another jina who was named Brahmānanathe emptiness of inherent existenceExcellent excellentAnd though a higher state exists beings who age and die know nothing of the perfect remedies that existBlessed One wherever this Dharma teaching spreads that place will be blessed by the ThusGone OneMaking common cause with all sentient beingsThis is called the meditative stability free from both ideation and scrutinyand then honor revere and respect it with flowers and those other offerings up to and including diverse ribbons as well as with musical soundsAnd the one called good in every respectThe Dharma is without acceptance or rejectionIf Subhūti when bodhisattvas practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom they were to perceiveThis is repeated a second and a third timeAwakening is proper applicationHe replied This is owing to the eradication of all assumptionsAfter the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya had praised the Blessed One in verse with such fitting words he stood to one sideThe two novices scaring a crowas are the other levels up to and including the tenth level due to their utter purityThat is why I have come here O King I have no other wishRudraka is not the only one who has faith diligence mindfulness concentration and wisdom I am also faithful diligent mindful concentrated and wiseYoung man practicing those qualities and not practicing their opposite is what is meant by samādhi Goes astray through conceit and pride And overpowered by pride experiences suffering The thusgone ones feel great compassion for sentient beings since all phenomena are devoid of a person and yet sentient beings believe they are personsOne should prepare this girl According to the previously explained division of familiesI shall impart instruction to this girland  being caught up in worldly concerns and thinking such things as I am not afraid of this life or of future onesand having done so then dedicate the merit of these gifts for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment making common cause with all sentient beingsGreat bodhisattva leaders will similarly provide sustenance for the sentient beings who are fond of cyclic existenceEmptiness is not the transcendent perfection of wisdom and so forththere is no arisingWith such an array as this the Bodhisattva was taken to schoolthey also cling to physical matterThey may cause this very earth to shakeAnd also insight is present thereSome were holding skulls and rode on elephants horses camels donkeys and buffaloesNoble son he left the Avīci hell and went to the city of the pretasProstrations to all pratyekabuddhasand similarly to abandon the four bonds the four torrents the four knots and the four misconceptions

the syllable hrīḥ at the vessel of frenzy Will cause women to dripThe realms of sentient beings are my responsibility I have roared like a lionHere bodhisattvas arouse diligence with a wish that their own body might become just like the body of the ThusGone OneHaving drawn to them all the riches of the lords of wealth without exception They give it away for the benefit of all beingsEach of those sons of the Sugata At that time taught beings as numerous As the sand grains of sixty thousand GangesOne should press at her heart with ones heart And unite ones secret part with her secret partIf you ask what is the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenaThey protect infinitely many beings from such miseries as the lower realmsImagine that the goddess in the east has three eyes and holds a khaṭvāṅga and bell in her left hands and a vajra and skull cup in her right handsIt neither has delusion nor is it without delusionThere are thousands of beings in this assembly Who have faith in delight in and venerate the Sugatawho are no longer subject to rebirth who have attained arhatshipO Calumny Vajrī hū phaṭāradvatīputra just as a magical display is without foundationSimilarly it has not been revealed so that the ears nose tongue body and mental faculty might be grasped or not grasped It has not been revealed so that sights might be grasped or not graspedWhy is that In the time of five degenerations There are beings who are cruel and evilRāhula who is my own son Has countless quintillions of qualitiesEven the names of the noble truths do not exist internally nor do they exist externally and nor do they abide between these twoGo do as you please and offer him all the provisions he needsAt all times they uninterruptedly actualized the meditative stability that recollects the buddhas of countless world systemsSon of noble family in short all phenomena are boundlessthey do not apprehend the notion that physical forms are empty or the notion that they are not emptyWhy have the airborne palaces become brilliant Their majesty color and brightness Have exceptionally increased for what reasonThey perform miracles of fire heat rain and lightningBirds of four colors change into one colorshould abide in these sacred doctrines and do so without apprehending anythingWhat is meant by the bodhisattvas possessing it It means that it is difficult to obtain and is a great medicineThey do not consider whether the eyes are afflicted or purifiedThis completes the Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra Teaching the Relative and Ultimate TruthsFinally since bodhisattvas do not engage with the teachings of the thusgone ones in order to deny them they do not deny the teachings of the thusgone onesThey dedicate it toward bringing all beings to maturityWithout concern for my life or body I will spread this sūtra widely That which provides cohesion in the body is called the water elementWith timely skillful method That very wealthy manWhen through the power of the Buddha this teaching comes into someones handsLord while I was giving those two monks some religious discourseThey demonstrate those amazing miracles In order to lead beings to the highest enlightenmentAbiding therein great bodhisattva beings will swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenmentThe tathāgatas have undergone sextillions of hardships for the sake of beingsWhen that night had passed he went into the capital city of Ratnāvatīthe one who has discovered undimmed awareness of everythingIn the language of TibetThe Teacher the Great Vajra Holder Carefully observed his own retinueThe first retention is of what is known concerning the teaching of all infinite compositesHow are they joyful and how do they rest in equanimityand I would be unable to complete my description of the display of qualities in that buddha realmproper understanding that the world is emptyThey do not consider anything at all that is not integrated within the expanse of reality but they do consider that all these phenomena are integrated with the transcendent perfection of wisdomYour mind has love for all beings within themThe bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed OneNovice where does your preceptor eat and return fromI fastened the legs and arms of those kṣatriyas such as the Khasas and Pāṇḍavas with iron chains and iron pegs to keep them in that caveThen the disciple will be fitWhat is skill in the accomplishment of the sūtrasand many streams of milk that circled the ten directions and then returned into the bhikṣus bodyDoes not match even a hundredthousandth portionHe sees beings tormented by many sufferings Oppressed by many hundreds of sufferingsWhoever desires to enjoy himself in a beautiful mansion In the Heaven of Delighting in Emanations And wants to enjoy all the mentally created illusionsI cut the flesh from my own thighs And having cooked it gave it to the dharmabhāṇaka The bodhisattva mahāsattvas hear with their divine hearing the Dharma that is taught by those buddha bhagavāns in the ten directionsand you disciples are like men blind from birth in regard to recognition of the degrees of the spiritual faculties of living beingsBhagavān we will cast aside body and life and teach this sūtra Therefore Bhagavān have no concernThose who have evil in their hearts but whose speech is sweet Are like a jar of poison topped off with nectarthey do not hear echoes and they are not hearers of echoesits divine fragrance would be experienced in perpetuitythey should prostrate to a shrine devoted to the thusgone ones and to the elder monksThus it is fitting for the Bodhisattva to be conceived in this family To this others responded This family is also not worthy of the BodhisattvaAbove that there are no further marks of the mind and as all mental movement ceases this freedom from all obscuration is what is known as cessationThis shook Māras hordes as if they were tufts of cottoncould not be performed by the disciples and solitary sages who have attained miraculous powers were they to devote all their powers of incarnation and transformation during one hundred thousand millions of eonsAnd so ārisuta knowing this At that time I walked to VārāṇasīWhen they manifest the diligence that brings forth all roots of virtue they are free from evilThey played music and sang Sit at the tree O Hero O Lion Who Conquers His EnemiesWhen I teach and guide you you will also relinquish all faults and be liberated within a stainless and insightful state of mindExcellent Excellent great hero We are overjoyed That the beings under your care have good character Are easy to guide easy to purifyAfterward I will manifest in their dreams and instruct themVenerable Lord Why is the limitlessness of physical forms feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness due to the limitlessness of selfaccepted the string of pearls from the bodhisattva mahāsattva AkṣayamatiThrough the practice of supreme benefit Noble one when your body and limbs were cut Milk flowed out and thousands of light rays shone forthāradvatīputra when great bodhisattva beings discern this without apprehending anythingPus and blood ooze from itit exudes filthYet if it has been created there is no way to avoid encountering it While that which is created by others will not be experienced Blessed One may all beings also attain this blessing in a manner beyond reference pointWhy is it like a boat for those in the middle of a river Because it brings the attainment of nirvāṇaYour misconduct will take you to the lower realms And all that great learning will not protect you Moreover Satatasamitābhiyukta the noble man or noble woman who possesses this Dharma teaching teaches it explains it and has it written out will attain twelve hundred qualities of the sensory faculty of the tongueMany bathing pools also appearedThe venerable Upasena had pledged to pass that same rainy season in some distant place After one year had passedit is summoned in an instantIt implies conviction ideation volition reliance attention appraisal and scrutinyall without any kind of sign or indicationPerfect man you have gone beyond all attachmentsThe king inquired of his daughter How did you cut the flesh from your body Daughter when you engaged in creating this remedy Did you not suffer from physical pain One should draw the row of vajras of the same size And also the eight pillarsnanda such a time and period will come aboutHis tongue is very long and slenderSister likewise all phenomena depend solely on conditionsKnowing sentient beings is a gateway to the light of the Dharma for it leads one to not belittle othersthere were eight hundred million who were arhatsThose of generosity great generosity Extreme generosity and complete generosityas well as having that indefatigable mind through the pristine awareness that does not rely on anything else they will quickly awaken to supreme perfect enlightenment and become a buddhaSome have a blue face and a yellow bodyThen the Blessed One again addressed the monksSarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asked himThere is the meditative stability named Bringer of JoyAnd each understands in his own language according to his own needsāradvatīputra do you think that the designations of the ears nose tongue body and mental faculty as arising or ceasing constitute a bodhisattvaThey who know the peace that is the nature of phenomena Are wise sagacious and know the way of wisdomWho sees thus truly seesHe gave to each of his children an oxdrawn cart that was as fast as the windCorrect application is a gateway to the light of the Dharma for it leads to the right conductThat is to say they will experience a decline in the prosperity of the precious jewel of the sacred doctrine of the unsurpassed genuinely perfect buddhasMañjuśrī how does the sameness of all phenomena in being utterly unarisen manifest as diversityIt felt extremely cold to the touch of the tip of his fingersProfound peaceful stainless lucid and unconditioned Such is the nectarlike truth I have realizedThrough the cessation of birth there is the cessation of old age death misery wailing suffering unhappiness and disturbanceTherefore young man bodhisattva mahāsattvas who wish for this samādhiand yet āradvatīputra these great bodhisattva beings have not been favored by the transcendent perfection of wisdom and they are without skill in meansGatherings of devas and humans also assembled in order to hear the DharmaThe second Dharma gate that he manifested is called the irreversible state It produces the power of aspiration toward inexhaustible omniscience and it ensures that the capacity of the Three Jewels is upheld and not wastedDuring this talk the venerable āriputra who had been ordained two weeks earlierand I shall delight you with my explanations in responseSubhūti it is because all things are empty of inherent existenceThey are like an empty fist that tricks childrenConclusion of the eleventh chapter Becoming a Keeper of the SūtraBefore the world with its devas Māra and Brahmā he is teaching extensively the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaRefuge of the world including godsrose from his seat removed his robe from one shoulder bowed his head to the Bhagavāns feetThey have longed to hear meanings unheard Like the feeble long to be nourishedAfter countless incalculable eons There will be the eon Many JewelsHer statement A man carrying a torch rent and entered my belly indicates a son will be bornand yet abandoned all disturbing emotions and actualized arhatshipIt is just as you have saidone young brahmin respondedBe the path for those who have lost the pathHe bowed to the feet of the Bodhisattva and spoke to him in verseAll opposition is utterly defeatedSo they said Here comes Chanda with Kaṇṭhaka Let us not act rashly but instead question him first richly ornamented elephantdrawn chariotsIn the western direction in the source of happiness There is the stainless realm of SukhāvatīYou may wonder noble son what these qualities may imply from steadfast adherence to their commitments through to gathering the godsHe conquered and defeated the entire army of MāraThe one with a voice like the avadavats song The Teacher who had taught this to himThus they think The awakening of the buddhas is infiniteWhen he saw that the Bhagavān had concluded his meal which was signaled by his setting down his alms bowlThen those bodhisattvas came through the sky to Vulture Peak and remained suspended in the sky above itWho are seeking for the highest wisdom And accomplish various activities throughout all times Similarly Subhūti all things have a modality that is imbued with happiness and a modality that is imbued with sufferingMy good man what will assuage this illness of yoursWhen the world is beset with the five degenerationsand the inconceivably numerous words of incomparability concerning purification Those are the fourSubhūti the tathāgatas are indeed grateful and thankful because this manifestly perfect buddhahood is attained dependent on the profound transcendent perfection of wisdomThe one who knows the genuine Dharma from the incorrect That is what we call a guideProstrations to the bodhisattva of the north JayadattaThey do not engage with the notion that physical forms are afflicted or that they are purified Ah The saṅgha of bhikṣus do not have their lord Ah They are blinded distressed and in sorrowthey neither know nor see the causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasgave the man the blood that drained from the wound to drinkDivine son it is like this analogyYou are not placed in any dharmabecause the tathāgatas endowed with great compassionate spirituality the treasure of the sacred doctrineIt is the seat of morality because it fulfills all commitmentsSo looking to guide them he went alone without any ascetic attendants in his wake to the boys houseSimilarly they do not make assumptions with regard to that ethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration and wisdomcontinuing in the same vein as far as the designation of the sensory element of mental consciousness as empty or not empty constitute a bodhisattvaI right now proclaim the name and the clan of the great bodhisattva being Ratnaketu while teaching the sacred doctrine and uttering aphorismsAnd in that way know the excellent palaces In which the devas are enjoying delightsThe past sound of that drum was empty the future sound will be empty and the sound that arises at present is emptyVenerable Lord when bodhisattvas practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom if owing to their lack of skill in means they engage with physical forms while their mental faculties resort to notions of I and mine andNoble son when noble children obtain this Dharma that in itself is the cause of their irreversibilityThey arrive with jewel diadems adorning their hairAnd the most eminent scholarshipThose with foolish minds who reject the way of the BuddhaAnd these many other lords of the world Arrived from many hundreds of realms are seen Young man in that way the bodhisattva mahāsattva who has evenness of mind toward all beingsThey join the palms of their hands and bow to him dailySuch is the bodhisattvas excellent wisdom of the sphere of absorptionMoreover Venerable Lord great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should not abide in the notion that physical forms are impermanenthe collected the relics weeping wailing and lamentingThen perform the ritual of peaceful activity If done in this manner there is no doubt that one obtains Spiritual accomplishments with the marks of successThose who have thus made offerings to all the tathāgatas will be free from birth old age sickness and death as well as from misery lamentation suffering unhappiness and afflictionsHowever by the power of the Bodhisattva resting in the absorption known as the great array Queen Māyā appeared in all of those residencesJust as this noble being is powerful and a great miracle workerWhy So that I may grasp the Lokāyata philosophybind them with nooses and drag them awayDivine son you yourself should make that request So the god saidBefore long you will witness the best among men attaining awakening You will see him honored and served by the immortalsYou are untainted like a lotus by the waters it grows inWhen the fruit is no more wherever the seeds are transferred to the flavor is transferred there tooIf he has mastered the knowledge of scripts How can I teach himNoble ones that which the Tathāgata states is a Dharma teaching he does not speak liesNoble sons even if I were to praise the qualities of the teachers of the Dharma for an eon or more it would not be of the slightest benefit to themAll the powerful gods in this billionfold universe such as akra Brahmā the world protectorsYoung man you should always like a rhinoceros dwell without a companion in the forestFreeing with inconceivable wisdom Supreme in the three worlds You establish in the Lesser Vehicle Beings who have strayed onto negative paths Those who are under the sway of desire and anger And then you teach the Great Vehicle Outside the monastery there appeared hundreds of trees which like the wishfulfilling trees were made from precious metals and were bedecked with precious braceletsIf he gives an order how can we not obeyWisdom not integrated with liberative art consists of concentration on voidness signlessness and wishlessness and yet it fails to concentrate on cultivation of the auspicious signs and marks on the adornment of the buddhafield and on the work of development of living beingsand it is bondageand the medicinal concoction of immortality was employedFor him there is no remedy and no positionThe characteristics of the Dharma Are just as vast as spaceHero Lord of Humans with a stainless face Your light rays beautify the ten directions in this worldnot examining the body not examining ones disciplineThey lack even the slightest essenceYou should beg your food in awareness of the ultimate nonexistence of foodGiving away ones possessions and not relying on wealth That is the nature of the Jinas teaching He will be a victorious and pious Dharma king with the necessary strength to governYou are like a lotus flower in full bloom Or the king of sal trees in blossomYou did not circumambulate a stūpa anywhereAnd why noble sons Because its intrinsic nature is awakeningIt neither bestows nor withholds the attributes of those who have attained the other fruits up to and including arhatshipthat they are empty that they are signless that they are without aspirations that they are calm that they are void that they are purified that they are nonarising that they are unceasing and that they are nonentitiesand unreal visionsWhoever upholds this true Dharma this sūtra Will be contemplating the Bodhimaṇḍabut have neither seen nor heard of the Middle Countryand relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment is attained but nonetheless lack the transcendent perfection of wisdomand  the faculty of wisdomBreathing equally through the left and right nostrils This is the maṇḍala of the earththey should burn aloe wood and Chinese or other incense join their palms and utter the name of the bodhisattva kāśagarbha at the break of dawnThat omen will today be fulfilledThrough the good karma that he had made He pleased two hundred million buddhasBodhisattvas carry out the practices toward awakening out of their longing for the Dharma their wish to eliminate all beings suffering their wish to eradicate the mistaken afflictions and their wish to experience a similar suffering themselvesteinote xmlidUT they do not carry out these practices out of a wish for gratitudeI lack the highest complete enlightenment so give me the seed for enlightenmentCome twilight reduced and wracked by hunger as they were they would cry outLeave the kings seat be and take your place in the royal priests seatno matter whether she is a girl of royal caste priestly caste merchant caste or servant castereport to us about that girlVery good Maitreya It is good that you have thought to ask the Tathāgata a question on this pointHis hand grew backAny delightful taste that has not been experienced before will be experiencedtheir bodies are adorned with divine jewelryThen Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara gave the sixsyllable queen of mahāvidyās to the Tathāgata the arhat the Samyaksaṃbuddha PadmottamaThey terrorize children These wicked thieves of seminal fluid Threatening childrenHence one is stainless and pure from the beginningThey practice the transcendent perfection of generosity but they do not abide thereinSimilarly they neither associate the truth of suffering with omniscience nor do they disassociate it therefromThere entered a handsome being with his hair in a topknot his body beautified by divine adornmentsI make this declaration To all those who are standing before meWith steadfast diligence solid armor and determined resolve their pledges are unyieldingThis is the vehicle of the solitary buddhasI too have eliminated conceptualization And will teach you in that way today Returning they bowed their heads to their father and told himFrom the mass of light that radiated from the ThusGone One the following verses of exhortation aroseThis is what these extremists rely on because of their fear of cyclic existenceThus have I heard One time the Bhagavat was staying with a great saṅgha of  bhikṣus and a multitude of bodhisattvas at Jetavana the monastery of Anāthapiṇḍada in rāvastīThe light that shone from the mansions pervaded this entire trichiliocosmthe teacher of the Dharma that transcends the world the spiritual preceptor of the worldMoreover with pure divine clairvoyance surpassing the sight of human beings the tathāgatas definitively perceive and definitively know all the circumstances of sentient beings from their death and rebirth to how they proceed to blissful realms how they proceed to inferior realms and how they proceed in accordance with their past actionsThe cause of awakening the ground of awakening and the objective of awakening are such that bodhisattvas turn toward the welfare of sentient beingsand the Atharvavedawhich is the entranceway into liberationDraped with millions of cloths And nets of jewels One should extend above ones left shin With ease ones right shinLike an elephant tearing apart a fresh grove of mango trees We proceed and reduce to ashes even the enormous diamond peak of Mount MeruSince even these two animals will not move there certainly must be some threat up aheadHe understands the infinite qualities the qualities of the Lord of sages xxxivThis concludes The Extent of the Merit the sixteenth chapter of the Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good DharmaOne hundred times one billion is called one hundred billion niyutaI shall therefore endeavor in exactly that way by means of a diligence that extends to and focuses on all sentient beingsThen he again spoke to the great retinue of godsThereafter they do so through the transcendent perfection of toleranceThen comes the number called iṅgāAlso at that time the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana thoughtHaving covered his face he also covered his headwhen they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the aggregates from physical forms to consciousness are not a selfFrightened they thoughtSimilarly is this mind of the bodhisattvas unattached to the sensory element of sightsBhagavān in this way how do bodhisattva mahāsattvas aspire to the inconceivable Dharma of the BuddhaThe thusgone ones feel great compassion for sentient beings since all phenomena are baseless and yet sentient beings take delight in basesVenerable please repeat it one more time Venerable say it againPlease sanction this my ordinands names Dharma robe as an upper robeBlessed One how do bodhisattvas have coherent eloquence how do they have fluent eloquence how do they have pure eloquence and how do they have eloquence that makes everyone happyLater Prince Bimbisāra ventured into the countryside astride an elephantThe light ray in the eastern direction Filled eighteen thousand realmsThey replied Yes we know You are but a novice who has gone forth for the perfectly awakened Buddha KāśyapaWhat is the elimination of egoism and possessivenessthat bodhisattva mahāsattva ripened them for the highest complete enlightenmentremember this Dharma teaching as The Protector of All Beingsthe rays of sunlight follow and go to that very same place So also wherever the element of consciousness is transferred to feelingSimilarly have the ten powers of the tathāgatas and the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas not been taughtFor that reason you should exclude from this Dharma and Vinaya those persons who have killed their fathersthe pristine cognition of omniscience andSkanda is in the form of a young boyThey contemplate sadness concerning the body thinkingThe tathāgatas of the past and presentYou possess the strength of the ten strengths With wisdom free of attachment you know all phenomenaSon of noble family when Amitābha passes into nirvāṇa lotus flowers and trees made of the seven gems will emit several hundred Gates of Dharma similar to the Dharma teachings that the thusgone one taughtThe young prince praised that blessed one in this manner then circumambulated him and sat before himHe conjures up in the middle of the jungle a miraculous city that is more than a hundred yojanas or two hundred yojanas in sizeIf you ask why it is because the minds of those persons who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas are without omniscienceaccompanied by the universal monarch and his four army divisionsThe expanse of reality does not exist apart from the sense field of the eyes and the other sense fields up to and including the sense field of mental phenomenaThis was the third chapter in the Great Sovereign Tantra of SiddhaikavīraBlessed One we will protect those who write it down and commission it to be writtenThere are beautiful ponds with blue pink and white lotus flowersFor many millions of eons it is so rare even to hear of thisAs the fruition of that act they have become beings cut at the waist their bodies held together by tendonsWhen you dream that billions of lights Leave the city and plunge it into darknessListen friends The demigod realms will be reducedGood man should you attain even the slightest store of qualities you must tell me He is a river for those afflicted with thirstFrom the entrance to the water well of the city Up to the king of mountains Gṛdhrakūṭa xviiit is because all things are without an essential nature concerning which one might be misled into thinking This is empty This is not emptyDevas and their sons gathered in order to listen to the DharmaThus due to such causes conditions and bases they will neither praise themselves nor blame othersFor example Subhūti space is neither permanent nor is it impermanentForm is not brought to an end by emptinessAfter eight hundred million eonsHe thought It is true I live amid a cemeteryWe do not teach Lokāyata philosophy to householdersThose heroes attain the ten powersSubhūti all things have the modality of the fruit of entering the stream The light from your burning hand Has shone into the ten directionsFor such a person the fire will ignite and light will shineNoble son they should not be known as ordinary beingsThus concludes the chapter on Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇas nature the eighth in the glorious Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa tantra called The Sole HeroAs they brush their teeth they think I shall dispel all the various stains of sentient beingsHe held a blazing vajra in his handbut I shall make a far greater and higher offering than that to the relics of the TathāgataHe should cause the disciples Only those previously examinedto enter thereto teach the Mahāyāna to those of narrowminded attitudesSubhūti one who wishes to attain emancipation in things without defining characteristics merely wishes to attain emancipation in that which is unceasing and in signlessness nonaffliction nonpurification and nonconditioningWhat is having a sense of selfrespect It is not being talkative When I received even one verse from them I practiced that teaching properlyYou Clever Bull give rise to ardor And rescue those who have fallen into steep ravinesImmortal lords please listen to these words That express what is on our mindsSo may she bear my witnessGreat King is that the Bodhisattvas body is beautifully ornamented with the major and minor marks of a great being and he outshines the world of gods humans and demigods with his color magnificence renown and gloryPlease show yourself in my dreams so that I may disclose my root transgressionsWith their insight bodhisattvas similarlyāriputra I cause entry into the path to the vision of the tathāgatas wisdomnanda you should keep this sūtra as having the name Entering Great CompassionThey know that this individual is developing the five faculties through aspirationlessnessthe gateway to liberationMonks I have actualized immortality and the path that leads to immortalityThey will hear it when in the handsāradvatīputra just as a dream has no basis in the same way āradvatīputra the meaning of the term bodhisattva is nonexistentSimilarly the transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely pure because space cannot be conventionally designatedin my fathers house when in order to celebrate a great sacrificeSome beings long to follow the way of listening to what is spokenThe Bhagavān having given him this opportunityNoble son there are beings who for long carry the aspiration Whenever a bodhisattva goes to the seat of awakening I shall be there to diligently worship himThese things are indeed nonarisingAwakening Mañjuśrī is not past not future not presentSuch a minister will be deprived of any happiness of the god and human realms and will descend to the hell realmsInstead Blessed One the beings there listen without listening to the pure instructions of the bodhisattva great beingsWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas openended discipline consist inAnd always devoted to Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇapracticed the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and thenTo visiting monks and wanderer monks he provided all the supplies they neededand to take rebirth intentionallyAnd they abide in equanimity when they have the conviction that all phenomena are beyond coming and goingWhatever the follower of Mantrayāna desires whether wholesome or unwholesome he will accomplish it all merely by reciting the mantraThose buddha realms too all shook in six ways when touched by that lightPhysical forms themselves are the expanse of realitybut into a family of moderate means with many renunciantsand make it attractive People then realize This person has undoubtedly taken medicineThen the Bhagavān taught the meaning of this extensively in versesThe aggregates do not come from anywhereAll were without ouflows their kleśas had come to an end They had dhyāna and were established in the eight liberations bring great compassion to its fulfilmentWhat are those five qualities That the monk knows what constitutes an offense knows what does not constitute an offensefor it enables one to satisfy all sentient beings by offering them clear explanationsHuman meat must be the flesh of a seventhbirththat the transcendent perfection of wisdom enhances or diminishes physical formsI honored many millions of trillions of tathāgatas but I did not obtain it and I did not hear it from those tathāgatasthey are incapable of dedicating the nature of all those other attributes and attainments up to and including omnisciencein the Blessed Ones presence I ask that the Blessed One have compassion and allow their going forthTo extend love to all beings while at the same time not having the idea of beingsThen if you ask what is the transcendent perfection of ethical disciplineThe fire will be utterly and completely terrifying to such creatures and so horrified they will flee far awayin order to strike with his poisoned arrow a big fully grown elephant in musth As soon as the poison reaches the blood it is transmitted through the limbs and the rest of the bodyThe vidyādharas the kinnaras and mahodaras The rākṣasas and piśācasThat which neither arises disintegrates nor remainsHer body is as beautiful as a celestial maiden With a shapely silhouette and perfectly formed limbsWhat are those ten They are as follows a bright and honest mind free of pretense deceit and crookednessShaking the ground of the entire trichiliocosm The Bodhisattva arose from his absorption with mindfulness and introspectionAt that time his lifespan will be immeasurableyet relatively all phenomena are free from darknessHaving again assumed the position of the arising of pleasureHaving oneself turned into Green AcalaFor actions done well bring no

establishes beings in the higher realms and in the state of liberationand in the abode of the gods of the Heaven of the ThirtyThreeHowever many beings there are in the ten directionsFrom the sky divine instruments were heard and as they played they produced these versesMoreover Subhūti great bodhisattva beings always analyze the profound topics which are as follows the emptiness of internal phenomena and the other aspects of emptiness up to and including the emptiness of essential nature with respect to nonentities and similarly the four applications of mindfulness and other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold pathThey have not been conditioned by internal emptiness They have not been conditioned by external emptinessI spoke in the middle of the offspring of the sugatas And inspired them toward enlightenment āriputra why should I teach thisSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom and those great bodhisattva beings to whom the lord buddhas direct their enlightened intention should be accepted so that they progress to buddhahoodThese bodhisattvas will achieve their own benefit and those will notHe

heard these words of mine Do not follow those otherswhite like the light of the autumn moonat the end of summertime during the first month of rainsThe saṅgha of that supreme manDivine son what do you thinkit is because these things and the transcendent perfection of wisdom are nondual and indivisibleIt is just as you have said This real nature of all things the unmistaken real nature the abiding nature of all things the maturity of all things is profoundWhat will it take for you to change your mindthoughts of indolence thoughts of distraction or thoughts of delusionWhen we were outside we agreed that not one of us would turn to look back at Siṃhala IslandAfter he reaches the battle his heart is driven wild with all the spears swords and arrowsDivine being this is how the blessed buddhas teach the DharmaThey should also praise the relinquishing of involuntary reincarnation through propensities and all afflicted mental statesYes noble sir that is indeed soThe Bhagavān said to the youth CandraprabhaHe is the king of all noble individuals He is the caravan leader for those beginning on their journeydevoid of foreign savages and guided by learned menso he sought out tīrthika communities and communities of ascetics and askedFree of pain they are free of mental discomforts and without mental discomforts they have no troubleThe venerable Aśvajit Bhadrika Vāṣpa Mahānāman Yaśas Pūrṇa Vimala GavāmpatiThey teach the enlightenment of buddhahoodI the lord of the asuras asked What is it that he requiresas do all other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasit is the understanding of the aspects of the pathBut nanda when the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya was formerly engaged in the conduct of a bodhisattvaNonseeing is a reference to nonorigination As the Bodhisattva spoke in this way his words were immediately heard throughout the entire great trichiliocosmHe has attained a fearlessness that the entire world including the gods cannot reverse which is expressed through a statement concerning knowledge of the way to abandon all defilements Thereforewho out of compassion for King ubhavyūha and those beingsthe other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path do not apprehend the limit of past timeThey do not consider whether physical forms are void or notnanda it is because those who enter the stream are distinguished through this transcendent perfection of wisdomConsider noble son the following analogywhere they have passed on from where they have been bornA wise one should never drink wineMahauṣadhi now bowed at the feet of the Blessed One and asked himThey can make their words perfectly heard throughout all the buddhafields and have complete purity in the accumulation of speechWhen you shoot your weapons they turn into flowersMy son who was so foolish Ran away fifty years agoIn the city all men women and children Became tired and fell asleep abandoning their choresBut these have all been taught without apprehending anythingfilled the space under the earth on the earth and above the earthWell immediately when my son was born all of my aims were fulfilledAkaniṣṭha the summit of existencecontinuing in the same vein as far as the designation of the sensory element of mental consciousness as arising or nonarising constitute a bodhisattvaAt that time there was a wise rishi Who taught the sūtra called The Good Dharma Thereupon the Bhagavān in order to make clear this Dharma teaching on entering great compassionThose without consent Without consultation invalids and the ākyasThousands of gods stand before you bowing their armsMany entranceways to dhāraṇīs and liberations were revealedMonks Māra the evil one was aroused by these verses and had a dream with thirtytwo omensThe Tathāgata gives to the śrāvakas that which causes all to attain omniscience which is like the great crest jewelSir what would you like from me asked the physicianbut you should not make assumptions on account of thatand through compassion for devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinnaras mahoragas humans and nonhumansThe Dharma must be taught according to realityPracticing for ten million eons Forsaking sleep and slothO when crushing Yama crush crush Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa hū phaṭOther bodhisattva mahāsattvas as numerous as the atoms in three fourcontinent world realms heard this Dharma teaching and developed the aspiration to the highest complete enlightenment after three lifetimesAs they consider them all they are inspired by their Dharma teachings and rejoice in themThen at that time in order to relate this Dharma teaching of entertaining no misgivings about all the teachings on the root of merits the training and the qualitiesIt is the absence of involvement with either the external or the internalThus contact of different types occurs prompting feelings of different types to arisethis denotes anything in which there is no dispersion Things are empty of nondispersal because they do not endure and do not disintegrateas well as those who are pleasant among the gods humans and antigods will also rejoice in themphysical forms and likewise all the aggregates up to and including consciousness are imbued with sufferingcarrying virtue and nonvirtue with it as it is transferredteach extensively this Dharma teaching of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma to these bodhisattva mahāsattvasSubhūti one should know that great bodhisattva beings who possess those attributes indications and signs are irreversibleNoble son from expertise in investigating origination up through expertise concerning reality this is how bodhisattvas areAlways with pure conduct and excellent behaviornanda even during earlier times when I was practicing the conduct of a bodhisattvaHaving thus bowed down to the feet of the Buddha Brahmā saidthey can recollect many former abodesVenerable Lord great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom should not abide in physical formsthe term external and internal phenomena comprises the six inner sense fields and the six outer sense fieldsFlowers incense and lamps Perfume food and the like Gestures garlands Theatrical shows songs and other such offeringsshowing the gateways to cyclic existence and the transcendence of sufferingCultivating the

the sky In order to honor and make offerings to that jinaYour Majesty the young prince wishes to visit the parksYour newborn son possesses a hundred marks of merit And blazes with the splendor of merittogether with an incalculably large assembly of monks and of great śrāvakasThey will be motivated to have a following They will delight in acquisitionneither is it obstructedVenerable Lord if phenomena do not consider phenomenaShe said to the monkThus bodhisattvas alleviate craving for pleasurewould it not follow Venerable Lord that all things have an essential nature of nonentityAnd open the gates to the nectar of the higher realmsThat scorches desire anger delusion And mental conceptsThen think that each of those Mahābrahmās possesses the combined merit of them all so that all of them become Mahābrahmās with that sort of meritand who have been reborn in this human world without having had an opportunity to pose questions and counterquestions and who when they now hear this profound transcendent perfection of wisdomwhere does it goright view as they do not depend on the favors of others are not steered by others and do not follow other teachersthis doctrine has not been revealed so that physical forms might be grasped or not graspedMay the Tathāgata grant me his supernatural blessing that I may be able to conquer Māra and all adversaries and to incorporate in all my lives the holy Dharma of the BuddhaMonks the ThusGone One now spent the first part of the night in silenceThe Buddha aware of venerable āriputras thoughts said to himfor those who have lost their way like the moonAt that time there were in this JambudvīpaVenerable nanda we cannot travel the realm with the Blessed Oneaversion will arise and aversion will not disappearWhen nothing is produced What are mantras what are tantrasThey will perceive all bodhisattvas as teachersHave gained a wealth a treasure of precious jewels That is a treasure difficult to acquire Because the realm of sentient beings and the realm of phenomena are not two things and they cannot be separated because they are devoid of characteristicsEven those who engage in the conduct of a bodhisattva will swiftly please the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhasIlādevī and Surādevī Pṛthvī and Padmāvatī Mahārājā śā raddhā and modest irīThey always beat the drum of the elixir They will before long become a guide Monks during the fifth weekhey will have unlimited wisdom and they will have unending confidence of speechIt was hard to measure its profundity and depththe omniscient wisdom that is endowed with the supreme of all aspectsBlessed One this Dharma teaching has great powerIn the same way one can also stop lightning hurricanes thunderbolt strikes etcSenior āradvatīputra it is because this transcendent perfection of wisdom is essencelessThrough such considerations he arouses the great compassion toward all living beings without falling into any sentimental compassionThey should demonstrate conviction in demons alone yetWhat are these eightRatnapadmacandraviśuddhābhyudgatarājawent to that temple and when he reached the entrancecures all sicknesses and wards off untimely deathExhilarated they all assailed the BodhisattvaThis supreme level of peace the Rainy Season Palace was both cool and warmFor those who seek the accomplishment of a vajra holderMoreover divine son the second act with immediate consequence of the bodhisattva great beings is as followsThe children of the sugatas are those who cause These kinds of offerings to be made to the relics of the jinasThus bodhisattvas grow the qualities of goodnessThen Brahmā lord of the Sahā World prostrated with his head at the feet of the Blessed One before disappearing from the presence of the Blessed One In that very instant he reached the Brahma realmBecause king of gods the enlightenment of the buddhas arises from the DharmaSimilarly they neither associate the sensory element of the body the sensory element of tangibles and the sensory element of tactile consciousness with omniscience nor do they disassociate them therefromThey will pass genuinely beyond the danger of the convictions of a śrāvaka or solitary buddhaPreventing ignorance prevents formationsIn a future time similarly He will make offerings to millions of buddhasIt is adorned with the figure of the BuddhaBhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs Upāsakas and upāsikāswhy O Lord would great bodhisattva beings have a view concerning physical formsContaminated physical forms are neither fettered nor liberated and similarly contaminated feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are neither fettered nor liberatedNo not at allThey also protected him during his birth as a newborn and while he was being rearedIn front of each of the palm trees was a jewel podium on which eighty thousand divine maidens stood proffering containers with powders of sandal and aloeswood and holding up lighted incense burners with sandalwoodYou will not waste anything of mineI will definitely practice generosity by offering lampsWhy are bodhisattvas not born into such families Because of their past actsdo you think āradvatīputra that this wingless bird would land in Jambudvīpa without being wounded or injuredWhen they teach it to others whether it is from memory or based on a bookSimilarly Subhūti the unmistaken real nature the inalienable real nature realityBlessed One when Mañjuśrī teaches the Dharma all the dwellings of the demons lose their lusterThis is called the circle of wisdom procedureI conquer the darkness of ignoranceThe masses of water ever present In many millions of buddha realmsThen he should offer the same wisdom consort to the disciple sayingThen the god Lord of Peace and Calm asked Mañjuśrīimmerse himself in the forty kinds of right intentionin a further attempt to arouse the Bodhisattvas desires spoke these verses to himThere is the meditative stability named RoamingTheir minds are the same as the minds of all beingsThey are the four kinds of mindfulness the four correct exertionsOnce he was free he remained under the shade of the kakubha tree where he sewed the dusty rag into the robes of a monkI will be a king who travels by the wheel of Dharma endowed with ten powersAwakening venerable āradvatīputra is to understand these phenomena correctly as they arereaching merging and blending with the Great VehicleThen one will be granted the ability to remember everything that has been learnedAnd three billion śrāvakas Gathered for his first assembly The body of a bodhisattva who has entered the womb of his mother develops certain featuresWhat has occurred here We have never seen before Guide of the World tell us The name of that realmThe noble Kaṇṭhaka at a mere sign Carried the protector of this world across the skyAtapa Sudṛśa Sudarśana and AkaniṣṭhaI should ask MañjuśrīSubhūti because the doctrinal wheel of the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas is not an entityYou are not attached not angry not deluded and without desirethey themselves abstain from all other nonvirtuous actions up to and including the holding of wrong views andVīrasena Subāhu RatnakusumaYoung brahmins replied Ajita this is how I see it and this is my philosophyAccordingly Venerable Lord this transcendent perfection of wisdom is established by means of unappraisable deeds innumerable deeds and deeds that are equal to the unequaledBy abiding in this way without abiding the bodhisattva great being quickly and perfectly awakens without ultimately awakening to unexcelled and completely perfect buddhahoodAll the gods will congregate before themAfter the first motion to act the motion would be repeated a second and a third timeThat which wise ones practice and through which They accomplish light rays of great benefitand since they have no hesitation regarding their own levelSo Mahauṣadhi asked himSince he is clearly superior to the entire world he is called the invisible summitThey will wish to see the kings the princes and the kings ministersWhen they see the buddhas with their ten strengths they honor themMañjuśrī it is difficult to understand the ultimate truthThis will cure asthmaEither he will be a universal monarch or he will be a buddha supreme on this earthBhagavān I have benefited beings in the Sahā world realmIt is the owner of all phenomena The mind precedes all phenomenaHowever monks sometime later while the Bodhisattva was setting out for the parks through the western city gate accompanied by a large paradeand visualize in ones heart in the center of a moon diskSenior Subhūti do you hold that attainment will ensue on the basis of things that are nonarisingWhen they heard that sweet speechwho is a kalyāṇamitra for all beingsAs you gaze O Lion among Men With your unblinking and pristine eyesAs he drew near he heard a sound like a smith pumping his bellows coming from his hutOn a wall with a fingernail or with a stick Then all other asuras with loving minds and peaceful mindsThese fearless ones and many others in this great crowd Have practiced for millions of eonswill have an inexhaustible accumulation of wealthand the saṅgha of bodhisattvas gazed upon him from the frontNot coming from anywhere nor going anywhere That is what is called the supreme restraint of the mind Divine son those who on the relative level realize the omniscient wisdom that is endowed with the supreme of all aspectsIn this utterly terrible time of degeneration Remain on the side of Dharma supreme king the blessed thusgone worthy perfect buddha ākyamuninanda those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage would accrue much merit on that basiswhere they are engaged in reciting and receiving the teachings and correctly contemplating themMonk where do you come from Where were you born Where are your father and motherI was already unwell when I went forthReverend āriputra to explain to you the teaching of the full entrance into the domain of the bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation would require more than an eon and even more than thatThen the target will become enthralled simply by drinking it At that moment I spoke with wrathful words Saying to my thousand sonsThen the Bhagavān said to Viśiṣṭacāritra and the other bodhisattva mahāsattvasabides as the letter e at the secret nosetipSubhūti all apprehension constitutes the immaturity of the bodhisattvas The absence of all apprehension constitutes the maturity of the bodhisattvasI will attain the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood even more quickly than that jewel was acceptedTherefore young man you should always practice by thinking I will not weary of seeking kalyāṇamitras venerating them and serving themThe devas there wailed pitifully When they saw the bhikṣu in piecesThis bodhisattva is in his final rebirth and that one is notBodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadrataught the Dharma that is good in the beginning good in the middle good in the endFurther hundreds of thousands of gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas demigods garuḍas kiṃnaras and mahoragas also rejoiced in the words of the Blessed OneOnce the monk had come inside she immediately shut the door and told himthe characteristic that once created they do not remainAnd training in mindfulness Such were the words that emergedThen he gazed into the directions And spoke these words to that ocean of prayerstactical analysis attending the sacred fire playing the lute playing other musical instruments dancing singing chanting storytelling comedyand they in turn upon hearing the Dharma sought to go forth on the spotWith the words Would that I might not experience such sufferings over a long period of time in the inferior realmsāradvatīputra this resembles for example a potter or the skilled apprentice of a potter who is fully aware that when he is turning the wheel in a long whirl he is turning the wheel in a long whirlSubhūti great bodhisattva beings who have not turned back from the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhas are reversibleMañjuśrī when childish ordinary beings practice generosity they do it with disrespect toward miserly sentient beingsnanda would you like to see the jeweled structure that the Bodhisattva delighted in The one that became the Bodhisattvas delight as he stayed in his mothers wombBhaiṣajyarāja after the Tathāgatas passing into nirvāṇaBodhisattva Mahāsattva CandrasūryatrailokyadhārinThe people in the world whose minds have no attachmentThey remain upon the path of concordant patience And are awake through the knowledge of selflessnessTonight all your virtuous and auspicious prayers will be fulfilledUntil they fully and perfectly awaken to unsurpassable complete and perfect awakening may their conduct be in accordance with that of Mañjuśrī himself They should dedicate their merit in this waythe bodhisattva kāśagarbha will hear this with the purified faculty of divine hearing which is beyond human capacity and show himself to those beings in whatever form is appropriateDevoid of all mental constructs am IFriends the family of a bodhisattva in his final existence must have these sixtyfour qualitiesThey give away wives sons daughters And their own heads and are established in enlightenment The Blessed One thought All those shortcomings ensue from monks allowing the going forth of invalidsThose dharmabhāṇakas will have attained the three liberationsIt would not even count for one thousandth or onebillionth of itIf all sentient beings were buddhasHow could physical forms become bodhisattvas How could bodhisattvas become anything other than physical formsThough I have done much for this king he has not taken care of meThis enables the beginner bodhisattvas to obtain the meditative concentration called not forgetting the mind of enlightenment at that very momentthere will be the disaster of their agony in the great fireI shall perfect all buddha qualitiesSome covered their face with a veil and then suddenly revealed itHow should they train in the first setting of their mind on enlightenmentLovingly cared for by numerous yakṣas with their akras And by the worthy onesindeed they will not hate those illintentioned quarrelsome recipients RatherHe teaches the Dharma in the form of a general to those beings who are to be guided by a generalThe Blessed One was also accompanied by a great gathering of eightyfour thousand bodhisattvas all of whom were obstructed by only a single birthProstrations to noble āriputra foremost in great wisdomYoung man when I say samādhi samādhi it means the profound realization of the mindAnd stood before the noblest of menKauśika so it is that the transcendent perfection of wisdom brings about the attainment of all things without attaining anything at alland necessities to those who yearned for provisionsA tathāgata arhat perfectly enlightened buddha comes into this world for the sake of causing beings to acquire the vision of the tathāgatas wisdomThe gods in the sky then addressed this verse to King uddhodana and to the massesIn the same order as just described one should imagine oneself as having the nature of the five deitiesHomage to the Three JewelsAmong them there was one being who was many hundreds of thousands of years old He was aged old feeble hunchbacked and bent like a cows ear He said to themFamily Come Talk sense into our dear boy KolitaIn the same vein if they have not misconstrued the fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas they will subsequently attain this omniscienceAnd will quickly attain the wisdom of buddhahood Due to the absolute purity of what is this purity of phenomena neither attained nor manifestly realized he askedThe joyful Bhagavat had spoken these words and the entire community and the world with its devas humans asuras and gandharvas rejoiced in what the Bhagavat had saidthe emptiness of conditioned phenomena the emptiness of unconditioned phenomenaFoolish humans whose understanding is false Do not see me even though I am present thereAwakening is attained through pleasureThose greatly famous bodhisattvas Know too that this is so with a nail of human bone or an iron oneVimalanetrarāvakas and solitary buddhas do not have great love and great compassionSenior āradvatīputra it is because when the perception of hardship is developed it will not be possible to act for the benefit of innumerable countless sentient beingsOne should know that the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas who are presently alive residing in the world systems of the ten directions numerous as the sands of the River Ganges also make prophecies with regard to those great bodhisattva beingsMoreover Mahauṣadhi you asked how one should consider the aspect of a consciousness that has just undergone transfer but has not yet been rebornin the early morning departed accompanied by the music of hundreds of various kinds of instrumentsIt is the joy of the liberation of nonintimidation when hearing the profound teachingSubhūti when great bodhisattva beings have turned away from physical forms andand having forsaken those two modes of attachment will no longer be subject to rebirthRaise their voices opinionated and impudent While the lion of men remains silentSo it is that the purity of knowers and viewersSome have deluded perceptions and some do not have deluded perception but all are in distress from suffering It is not engaging with the external āyatanas  It is not praising oneselfThat which was in the past is devoid of characteristics And one should be certain that the future is the same Supreme Being you will attain your aim in full Soon you will be endowed with the complete ten powershave no doubt indecision or hesitation with regard to profound phenomena and attributespreserve it recite it to others promote it proclaim it chant itI said nothing in replyand being liberated and not being liberated and they accurately know a mind that has kleśas to be a mind that has kleśasAs soon as he appears he sees the beings who are being burned roasted pained and tormented by birth aging illness death misery wailing suffering and unhappinessāradvatīputra do you think that the designation of physical forms as arising or ceasing constitutes a bodhisattvafor it leads one to take up nonviolencewho terrifies the three worldsAnd I will correct Any error in his recitationThe bondage of liberative art not integrated with wisdom consists of the bodhisattvas planting of the roots of virtue without dedicating them for the sake of enlightenment while living in the grip of dogmatic convictions passions attachments resentments and their subconscious instinctsThe stage of subjugating Rudra In the great charnel ground of ītavana Is that conceptuality is destroyed with ambrosiaThe tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhasI am slandered and reviled harshly abused and told not to create a gatheringThis concludes the seventeenth chapter on practicing austeritiesOf no worth and ungraspable things do not exist Yet beings wrongly view what is without essenceand having renounced a kingdom of a universal monarch you have left the worldThey are wise and do not associate with the envious And they always rejoice in great generositySimilarly they have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood knowing that all things are uncreated because they have no corporealityHe wished to be of service to the world and to assist the worldHe was inflated with pride andThey know their existenceThey should also encourage others to acquire the cultivation of the noble eightfold path and so forthAll physical movements they dedicate to the benefit and happiness of all beingsNonexistent physical forms remain unattached to nonexistent physical forms and the same goes for the other nonexistent aggregates up to and including consciousnessWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas excellent wisdom of the sphere of absorption consist inMaitreya the senior son of the one with ten strengths asked him For what reason did the Guide smile They are to understand all phenomena to be deceptive hollow insubstantial like a mirage like a reflection like an echo like an illusion transient fluctuating and dependently originatingThey will go to the realm of the devasA tathāgata arhat perfectly enlightened buddha comes into this world for the sake of causing beings to acquire the vision of the tathāgatas wisdomOther bodhisattva mahāsattvas as numerous as the atoms in four fourcontinent world realms heard this Dharma teaching and developed the aspiration to the highest complete enlightenment after four lifetimesYou should make your faith in the Three Jewels integral to youOne should give kisses and embracesare themselves skillfully absorbed in the meditative concentrations the immeasurable aspirations and the formless absorptionsYou may wonder noble son what these qualities may imply from maintaining pure conduct for a long time through to staying clear of displeasurethe hand that had the contours of a conch a victory banner a fish a vase a swastika an iron hook and a wheeland he can catch it and put it back in its place without the living beings suspecting their coming and going and yet the whole operation is visibleSimilarly are those who undertake training in order to terminate feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness and become detached from them so that they cease and do not arise actually training in omniscienceOne who has obtained the jewel of empowerment Will attain all accomplishmentsNoble son lack of meaning concerns those who have not accomplished the intrinsic nature not those who haveMañjuśrī when something is baseless how can it have any rootclouds that rained down divine incenseso if we set out upon the ocean an ocean full of many terrorsthat he is physician to the Blessed Buddha and his community of disciplesHaving received ordination I shall purify all negative and unvirtuous factors causing them to fade away disappear and become purifiedSimilarly why do you say that the imperishability of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness is not consciousness and the other aggregatesThey will pass genuinely beyond the danger of ending up as hell beingsfor them as the limit of reality is at peace they are at peace thorough peace and utter peaceDemons and hostile forces will be vanquishedThose who use the saṅghas sesame rice millet horse gram and other grains which are not for them to eat will be reborn in the city of the pretaswhen an elder who was immature dense dimwitted and unskilledThey will not petition the donor or benefactor and they will not utter any words to such an effectThey experience discipline and awakening sentient beings and thusgone ones all in a nondualistic wayMother the court scribe struck meSo I made the rākṣasī enter the sleep named Ignorances Net and I went out at night armed with a sword that glowed like moonlightHe is like the supreme victory banner of all bodhisattvas suitable for a kingThose who make the gesture of homage to a stūpa Either completely or even with just one handMonks the family priest went out to the city of Kapilavastu carrying the written verses and wandered from house to house looking carefully searching for a girl with such qualitieswho has many elephants horses chariots infantry and troopsJust as the extent of space Can never be discovered Throughout all the ten directionsthe inconceivably numerous words of inconceivability concerning the kleśas and the inconceivably numerous words of inconceivability concerning purification Those are the fourBecause it brings the accomplishment of the vast inconceivable qualities of buddhahoodtaking what is not given not maintaining celibacy lyingThese marital unions must be between people who are both pureYou have explained the bodhisattvas revelation of their knowledge wellThe followers of those tathāgatas also saw a great gathering of bodhisattva mahāsattvas a great aggregation of bodhisattvas emerge from the ground and remain suspended in the skyThe river Gaṅgā bountiful meritorious auspicious and clean flows through this famed land irrigating both shoresMonks although the gods who attended upon the Bodhisattva tried to discourage Māra the evil one in these sixteen ways Māra would not be deterredwill attain emancipation through this transcendent perfection of wisdomJust as displaying a lotus Amidst a fire is miraculous So they display the miracles Of both pleasures and trancesYet although they apprehend no sentient beings or anything that is designated as a sentient beingYoung brahmin they asked what is the Middle Country likeNoble son bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities are endowed with excellent insightIf a line appears across the center of ones tongue one will die within two daysBodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvaras mind was filled with compassion on seeing these beingshaving strict control of their speech and giving up all forms of verbal misbehaviorI emulated the previous victorious onesbut we agreed that there was nothing we could do and we became silentIt is taught by all the buddhas For the sake of the bodhisattvas Bodhisattva Gaganagañja was extremely amazedone should offer a bali and that need will be fulfilledIt is born of charity discipline and selfcontrolThe bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation can put the king of mountains Sumeru which is so high so great so noble and so vast into a mustard seedMay I and all sentient beings be safe from all perils calamities and misfortunes SvāhaScented with the fragrant smells of various celestial perfumes and the finest of incenseThe third meditative absorption ensues when one achieves and maintains the third meditative concentration that is to say when one abides in equanimity due to the absence of attachment to joy while both mindfulness and alertness are present and bliss is still experienced by the body This is what sublime beings describe as mindful blissful abiding in bliss and equanimousAlso Mañjuśrī one should understand that bodhisattvas have become thoroughly trained when being generous to a being who has taken rebirth as an animal such as a dog makes them extremely joyful but achieving the state of Brahmā does notYes Senior āradvatīputra it is as you have saidMy body has one hundred arms And with just one of them I can shoot off one hundred arrowsSubhūti it is not only the ephemeral gods headed by Indra the gods headed by Brahmā and the gods headed by Prajāpati who always pay homage to those great bodhisattva beings who practice this profound transcendent perfection of wisdom butand disturbing emotionsBhikṣu develop the supreme difficulttoattain Motivation for the highest enlightenment It is attained because there is no attainmentAs for the division corresponding to ones casteThis same refrain should also be applied extensively to the noble truths exactly as beforeThey saw this Sahā world realm became the size of a hundred thousand world realms and filled with bodhisattvasthe sovereign I had five hundred sons No less indeed than that an eighth of the suns passage remaining before sunset sunset before the stars appear and after the stars appearone should incant mustard seeds mung beans or māṣa pulses with ones personal mantra  timesThere are those with foolish minds Who being ignorant do not see the source of sufferingHow is wisdom not integrated with liberative art a bondageit goes without saying that he is without any conceit regarding his attainment his understanding or his realization There is no basis for itAcquiring the power of merit those sentient beings will themselves eventually actualize such noble formsThe earth has shaken in six ways Millions of lotuses have appeared on the groundWith these mantras one should consecrate One hundred and eight blue cords and strings of silkthat some are born in the higher realms and that some are born in the lower realmsRather a bodhisattva is born in a central landand likewise the correct exertions the supports for miraculous ability the faculties the powers the branches of enlightenment and the noble eightfold pathWho goes ultimately goes notIn that way they have the pure divine vision that transcends that of humansand he knew that these marks could only indicate one of two possibilitiesAll those beings that person supports with his head shoulders or hands for limitless tens of millions of eonsMerchants son you should not celebrate a sacrifice in this way You should celebrate a Dharmasacrificeso we would sooner die and face our death with you than turn you overBhagavān when they pass away they will be reborn as one of the devas of TrāyastriṃśaVenerable Lord The transcendent perfection of wisdom abandons cyclic existences because it is neither an enduring state nor is it perishableOn both sides of the road tall palm trees were adorned with various divine jewels and a jingling network of bells made from Jambu River goldElder in rāvastī there resides one who is verily a lord of DharmaThere are great monarchs cakravartin kings Who have come from billions of realmsFrom a causal relation and a conditional relationOnce they reached the place where he resided the grove of the caretaker of mango trees in the great city of VārāṇasīAs the unclouded lights Of the gods the sun and the moon Are outshone and disappearSimilarly omniscience is neither profound nor subtleand salutationsBhadrapāla felt faithIf there is no senior exemplar he should take up residence with a junior exemplarBut of these two when formerly the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya was engaged in the conduct of a bodhisattvaThey had laid down their burden and fulfilled their aimsThen the Bhagavān at that time recited these versesnanda if any sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage were to describe teach elucidate analyze and genuinely demonstrate these noble meanings and noble words of the transcendent perfection of wisdom to othersThus bodhisattvas are free from acquisition through nonDharmaI did not apprehend the essential nature of anything at allWhether they are in a village or in a temple there will come to them day and night those who wish to ask them about the Dharma and they will delight and please them with their answersa gait as stable as Mount Meru the king of mountainsDo what needs to be done in the lotusAs he sat āriputra signaled to prompt the householder BuddharakṣitaThey do not become fixated on the meditative absorption in loving kindness ormight acquire the path of the ten virtuous actionsThey appear as frightening jackals and dogs As many as the host of stars At the locales of trees And shrinessimilarly who teach and grant instruction in the other transcendent perfections up to and including the transcendent perfection of wisdomand in the same vein that it absorbs or diffuses measures or does not measure enlarges or contracts and strengthens or weakens physical forms The one who benefits bodhisattvas Explains and teaches the practice of restraintyou should know that these bodhisattvas will not have been foreordained by the tathāgatas to attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentThat is designated a girth like the banyan treeOnes nose will stop bleedingThe Jina who is a sun shining in the center of the vast sky of wisdom Dispelling darkness with the light of love and compassionThey will also spit in the places the saṅgha uses not knowing the karma that ripens from itWhat are the three doorways to liberation They are emptiness the absence of attributesSeeing a woman whose name is Tārā Of white and red complexion and beautiful eyesLike a vessel filled with poison they cause painFor this very reason is it called AcalaO homage to the god VimalacandraDo not generate desire for the ten powers of the tathāgatasMonks I then thought to myself There are some monks and priests who believe that they are purified by abstaining from eating foodSimilarly those bodhisattvas who have cultivated the mind endowed with omniscience should be attentive to the formative predispositions that are conditioned by fundamental ignoranceBhagavān from today onward I will never again fall under the power of my mindHere having triumphed through the power of compassion I drank the elixir of nectar For the sake of which Those with the ten powers cultivated compassion for all beingsBy reciting it nonstop one will be adored by everyonethinking I can hear voices and they do not even apprehend the sounds that their ears hear because these are essentially empty essentially void and essentially nonapprehensible They focus on omniscience and apart from that have no other wish to attain clairaudienceThe king went into the forest overwhelmed by reverence and aweBut you Lord you already possess this good fortuneThrough words speech and communication Phenomena are taught using the term cessationAbiding in that natural expression great bodhisattva beings strive toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and yet they do not see anything at all in which they would engagein the same vein the cultivation of the transcendent perfection of wisdom is the noncultivation of the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhassuch as an oxdrawn cart a goatdrawn cart and a deerdrawn cartNo māra or adversary will be able to overcome himAs they enter the potent flavor and attributes of the virtuous medicinal butter

selfThe girls father had died tooThey will have vast and sharp wisdomYoung man bodhisattva mahāsattvas will attain all those qualities and quickly attain the highest complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood if they have one qualityLike a lion he was fearless and without worryThat higher cognition that wisdom Is the inconceivable wisdom of buddhahoodAppropriate attention functions as mental reflectionis due to their own ignorance It is not the fault of the TathāgataSubhūti just as when a man or a woman fetches water from a river waterfall lake pool pond or well with a clay jar that has been firedbowed to the Blessed One with joined palmsThe Bhagavat told SarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhinNoble son bodhisattvas who possess ten such qualities have received abundant teachingor it is distilled

empty and emptiness cannot construct emptinessDear sir why do you not go forthWhen he was dying He heard this sūtraVenerable Lord The purity of the transcendent perfection of wisdom does not appropriate anything at allat which point he said to Kolita Our master Sañjayin concealed his learning from usthey will not perfect the ten powers of the tathāgatasSubhūti those who have conviction in

not endure You who view things thusAs an analogy the fruits of the juniper date mangoWhen the pretas tasted the water their throats widened their bodies became wholeThey offer drink to those in need of drinkFollow my command and adorn yourselvesHow should great bodhisattva beings trainThat is to say if bodhisattvas do not consider those phenomena that are virtuous those that are nonvirtuous those that are specific those that are nonspecific those that are mundane those that are supramundane those that are contaminated those that are uncontaminated those that are conditioned those that are unconditioned those that are common and do not those that are uncommonJust as in the case of physical forms so in the case of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness he will not teach the sacred doctrine according to the notions that these are fettered or that they are liberated and so forthHe next covered everyone in his retinue of hearers and thereafter akra Brahmā and the retinue of the guardians of the worldThen the Tathāgata Gandhottamakūṭa poured some of his food impregnated with all perfumes into a fragrant vesselRather they see that all things are not to be

why Subhūti it is because in a magical display the reflection of the moon in water a dream an optical aberration an echo and a phantom going or coming is nonapprehensibleThey become here the great leaders of humans Endowed with the ten strengths appearing in the world Moreover since they dedicate all the roots of virtue to enlightenmentThat which you understood exactly as it is You must now

thousand eons had passedHow would they treat me if I were to provide them with all the supplies they needBhagavat how can I see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva AvalokiteśvaraThere are two reasons the bodhisattvas who do aspire to the profound Dharma hurt themselves and do not attain the tolerance of the ultimate birthlessness of thingsthe notion of hardship will not ariseAwareness precedes all your actionsThey each go their individual ways And therefore they are called individual beings Venerable Lord with regard to that which is called the transcendent perfection of wisdomTheir voices are the same as the voices of all sentient beingsKauśika it is so It is just as you have spokeninasmuch as physical forms neither arise from anywhere nor do they go anywhereThen after dissuading and turning them awayInfluenced by the acquisitive bhikṣusWhen I was born this trichiliocosm trembledWhat is the nature of the element of consciousness Alas I was deluded about the equal accessibility of

compassion the extent to which he has developed the strength of meditative concentration and brings beings to complete maturationwhatever illusory display is desiredOn the ninth ground their bodies pervade infinitely and so they attain the body that is equal to spaceand similarly refine feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousnessHowever Mañjuśrī the Tathāgata does not form mental constructs or conceptsMoreover āradvatīputra the spiritual mentors to great bodhisattva beings having taught the doctrine so that the bodhisattvas might cultivate the applications of mindfulnessSimilarly O gods this doctrine is profound owing to the profundity of the transcendent perfection of generosity the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdomHe is the one with the rumbling voice of a thundercloud of the nāga king SāgaraI did not teach these faultsMañjuśrī the Tathāgata does not think This sentient being has belief in the perfection of wisdom so for him I shall make a speech related to the perfection of wisdomHis students join their palms and the gods all venerate himTheir minds are unpolluted They have forsaken all carelessness They are great beings who are always carefulHe truly observes that while all phenomena are the same as the limit of realityWhen does a conception arise For whom does the conception appearVenerable Lord Who are theyWhatever is the same as

marks of a great beingThey perfect the transcendent perfection of generosity that is equal to the unequaledI remember countless innumerable eons ago There was a jina named SvarāṅgaghoṣaThese two will become my disciples my foremost and noblest pairYoung man if an offering made to a tathāgata is purified of those three aspects of the action this samādhi will be attainedAll phenomena are without attributes without indications and without signsBhagavān this bodhisattva mahāsattva Gadgadasvara has come wishing to see the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Prabhūtaratna who has passed into nirvāṇaThey always dwell in happiness And have inconceivable pleasure sons were also born to four great kings in four great citystatesthen householder please give me these goddessesIf the support and material riches that were destined for the bhikṣus who diligently practice relinquishment are offered to the bhikṣus exerting themselves in recitation at this point then both actions become root transgressionsYou should also remember it as The Arising of the Intention of Enlightenmentrāḍa Kālāma died just three days ago The ThusGone One then thoughtand was adept in the fourfold path of Brahmā great love great compassion great joy and great equanimity With great awareness he was free of obscurations and had manifested the vision of wisdom free from attachmentMoreover they may also teach them so as to provide a remedy for the arising of afflictions in bodhisattvas who have just recently entered the vehicleEither those two young brahmins are fools or theyre unflappableIn the same vein why do you say that these same designations made with respect to feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness up to and including their designation as entities or nonentities do not constitute a bodhisattvaWhen I see him meditating with a torchlike lusterthe manifestations of beings would utterly collapseThose who have not learned this profundity How can they teach the Dharmaand their faith in the Three Jewels deepenedThey will recite the praises of the Tathāgatas śrāvakasIn buddhahood they will teach the Dharma Through teaching this single yāna He lived at home but remained aloof from the realm of desire the realm of pure matter and the immaterial realmWhile an image is seen in the entire worldHe accumulated the splendors of hundreds of virtues and qualitieswe did not know it we did not understand itand one achieves and abides in the sense field of nothingatallMatter itself is voidSenior āradvatīputra bodhisattvas do not engage in the practice of austerity with the perception of hardshipThat would be impossibleThen the Blessed One decreed In the light of this monks should not allow debtors going forth correct recollection andThey believe they have crossedTheir bodies will have an aroma like gośīrṣa sandalwoodIt is the entering into the realm of the buddhas It is understood by noble beings and realized by solitary buddhaswho practice according to other sūtras apart from the transcendent perfection of wisdom for an eon or longer than an eonMy Lord there is this prophecy and it cannot be deniedTranslated and edited by the Indian master Dīpaṃkaraśrījñāna and the translator monk Gewai LodrMañjuśrī that root would be the transitory collectionHe does not emulate anything other than the real nature of unconditioned phenomenaThey are like the children in the parable who come out of the burning house because of their longing for a deerdrawn cartAnd the gods of the earthThus without any doubts or reservations about this point they trust in the secret of the thusgone ones speechthey do not associate with avarice in order to desist from avariceIn the disturbed era of destruction The dreadful time of great fearWhy is thatwho brings freedom from fear to all beingsAnd because he was aware of their previous intent to set out toward awakeningThose who are of the nature of all things And whose minds know everythingThe one who praises those dharmabhāṇakas Will obtain a supremely greater amount of meritwith great compassion I now teach the Dharma to such sentient beingsgenerosity dedicated to awakening andI have concocted ink from my own bloodHe is a lamp for those in darknessThe monk matricide then told his wardsHis mother then struck him too prompting the lad to thinkHow should they cultivate those fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhasProtector of the World your resolve is firm You will not move from the seat of awakeningSo it is that they should not dwell on physical forms and they should not dwell on anything at all up to and including genuinely perfect buddhahoodDo not fall behind themMoreover Subhūti any aggregate of ethical discipline that is impureAre praised by hundreds of thousands of devas And hundreds of thousands of Brahmās pay homage to you He thoughtwith calm senses physically at ease resplendent without attachment free from anger and without delusionthose born as animalsHe is overjoyed and comes to his balconyThey will overcome all harmI pray that you free me from this inferior female body of a womanSome jumped in front of him and some attacked him from behindBodhisattvas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges Were all revealed by that light rayThey completely lose interest in gain fame and acquisitionsTherefore Bhagavān even though we have taught and instructed other bodhisattvas in the highest complete enlightenmentSince material objects do not really existWhen observing the ascetic practices trainings disciplines and all the commitments they are free from evilthat they do not cognize feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness as consciousness and the restall other phenomena causal and fruitional attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are empty of their own essential natureWhen that blessed thusgone worthy perfect buddha Arisen from Flowers had delivered this teaching concerning sentient beings King Attainment of Victory cut off his hair and beard His son as well as Queen Ratnaśrī and the retinue of queens and servants likewise all cut off their hair and they all took ordination with the Blessed OneEven that would never be able to repay your kindnessKing Jñānabala with his harem sons daughters and attendants on learning that the bhikṣu was ill wept and shed tears If attachment develops That friendliness is a great kleśaThey are freed from the three lower realmsMay they all protect youand the rest of the twenty thousand devasthe three gateways to liberation and in the same veinFrom now on please do not sit on grass on the ground Your body is so young and freshKāśyapa I have made this parable so that its meaning can be understood Its meaning should be seen in this wayThe Buddhas śrāvakas who maintain The miraculous powers they have cultivatedI should honor venerate respect make offerings to and rely upon the sacred doctrine which is calm abundant and through which manifestly perfect buddhahood is attainedMahāmaudgalyāyana supreme among those with great miraculous powers and great magical abilitiesThus in all regards extremely revered it is characterized by accomplishing all the objectives of all beingsFor beings swift accomplishmentThen hundreds of thousands of gods and humans let out hundreds of thousands of exclamations of shock and cries of joywhile the rest will be revealed at length if you converse with chat with and questionBecause they know the subtle nature of phenomenaYour praise for this lone person Is without any boundsand saw Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara thereNoble son the thusgone ones see sentient beings with their miraculous eyes and not with the eyes of humansVenerable Lord Since all things are undifferentiated how are things established as virtuous or nonvirtuous specified or unspecifiedThe Blessed One saidThey who possess this supreme samādhi Always examine themselvesBeholding these colored powders The buddhas are thoroughly delightedThose śrāvakas of the Guide who in this way Have heard this teaching of mine Their body is firm like that of Nārāyaṇa  Their kneecaps are elegantThe meaning of dependent arising is the meaning of the DharmaHe can inhale all the hurricanes of the cosmic windatmospheres of the ten directions into his mouth without harming his own body andNoble son the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has given permission for the sixsyllable queen of mahāvidyās to be given to youSuch a person would indeed have difficulty in doing thatand the space within a precious vessel are both the element of spaceKing Yama will sayWhen they step on the earth they raise no dustI will be a perfect being a sublime physician who cures old age and deathEven though the girls had already experienced the deeds of the Bodhisattva and the power of the ThusGone One out of their fickleness they did not listen to their fathers wordsFollow their example bodhisattvas In order to protect millions of beings Because they know the subtle nature of phenomena They will never hear an unpleasant soundThe king replied Very well then do itto be weak in altruism andThe Tathāgata does not teach the Dharma by means of sound and languageLikewise the transcendent perfection of generosity does not apprehend the limit of future time nor the presentFurthermore noble sons in order to accomplish the store of merit a bodhisattva does not rest in the uncompounded andThey will have anger and they will have hate Their thoughts will be on homes and wealthlike the descent of a nonreturner into a wombnor is it to be apprehended between the twoIndeed son of noble familyAs an analogy although many forms might appear and disappear in a wellpolished mirrorSimilarly imbued with renunciation dwelling in solitude maintaining detachment and remaining in a state of cessation they should cultivate the supports for miraculous ability combining the meditative stability of perseverance the meditative stability of mind and the meditative stability of scrutiny with the formative force of exertionSitting crosslegged On bare groundwhen I was teaching the Dharma to some young monks in the great forest the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and said to meWe will bathe on the banks of the riverThey abide in the abode of the nonduality of the conditioned and the unconditionedThis noble man is going to go to the BodhimaṇḍaFurthermore it is instructive because physical forms are unseenThose beings who are attached to forms Are overcome by unrestrained desires They will not delight in the LokāyatasIt has no comingGreat bodhisattva leaders similarly can never gather enough of the wealth of Dharmalikewise they do not consider whether feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are empty or not emptyThey play with illusory manifestations In order to develop living beings Showing themselves to be old or sick And even manifesting their own deathsAt that moment the bodhisattva mahāsattva Liberator from Fear entered the samādhi called the exalted wisdom mudrā of the tathāgatas the entrance gate to the domain of all buddhasThe monk Stainless Light was too ashamed to be able to speak to the BhagavānThe six seedsyllables are in the six cornersThe water element the fire element the wind element the space element and the element of consciousness do not come from anywhereIn this manner the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class comes to possess the precious wheelWhat do you think Chandaand the path is easy he perfectly accomplished supreme perfect enlightenmentThis Dharma teaching will bring benefit and happiness to many beingsGreat King an uḍumbara flower sometimes though rarely blooms in the world It is the complete wisdom of buddhahood It is what the wise bodhisattva seeksLastly the Bhagavān said to that complete saṅgha of bhikṣusSimilarly they do not engage with the notion that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are calm or that they are not calmThey teach the Dharma for the abandonment of attachments in the form of grasping at a self yet they do not observe grasping at a selfMañjuśrī when a bodhisattva is given the prophecy of awakening to unexcelled and perfect buddhahood all of my realms are threatenedThat Great King is the first mark of a great being found on Prince SarvārthasiddhaThe body of a tathāgata is uncompounded and free of all formative activityMonks the ThusGone One knew that the gods were in doubtAnd so the young brahmin began to recite the Vedas with the teacher of brahminswas esteemed honored revered respected offered to praised and veneratedIn this Jambudvīpa there were two kings named Dṛḍhabala and Mahābalaas soon as the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana had made that resolution of the truthTheir practices are infinite And their spheres of influence are infinitethe dependent origination of all that occursIn due order the stages of conceptusWill never again be Connected with existents Seeking this peace this supreme samādhi I gave away vast amounts of excellent jewelryand sentient beings perceive it to be just that wayBhagavān how is generosity an obscurationāradvatīputra do you think that enlightenment is one thing and that illusions are anotherYet although he saw it all his mind wasnt distracted even onceOur hips are adorned with beautiful chainsWhat are these sevenAccording to the beliefs of sentient beings he displays diverse appearances and diverse lifespansIt is a wheel beyond birth cessation and enduringreveals the vision of the tathāgatas wisdomit was with such an inconceivable miraculous manifestationFor example SubhūtiAfter being taken in the boys began to offer the monks herbs flowers and fruitsThis action constitutes a transgression and deprives them of the happiness of the MahāyānaThen having changed into a garment of three pieces He should correctly draw The Enchantressand the inconceivably numerous kinds of eloquence concerning purification Those are the fourThe fruit of his merit will exceed the formerMonks Māyādevī now set forth surrounded and protected by  richly ornamented horsedrawn chariotsThey have the jingling sounds of silver and gold bellsWhen the Guide entered the supreme city At that time there was no dirt or refusewhatever they do they make these dedications without regressing to the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddhasThese are mental misdeedsThe wise person knows this to be a sign of wisdomI possess ethicsO Avalokiteśvara previously in the pastAt this point the physician said Sir having gone forth in the wellproclaimed Dharma and VinayaSpirits and vetālas who destroy the body From the power of mantras spells and herbsIf in a vessel for wine Monkey feces have enteredWhich will shower throughout the realm of phenomenahe built eightyfour quintillion stūpas that contained the relics of the TathāgataReferring to this the notion of a cloud comes about in the worldWe were without faith delighted in bad actions rejected the Buddha Dharma and SaṅghaFor so long he has given up all possessions and addressed beggars by pleasant names whichever they may like to hearAre you not chattel Are you not a favorite of the king Are you not a threat to the kingThus for all beings who have committed a root transgression who are bound for the lower realms who have exhausted all roots of virtueWe were foolish unwise and unknowing And within the teachings of the Sugata We were content with mere nirvāṇaJust as a tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who is said to be utterly calm and who after turning the wheel of the sacred doctrine no longer apprehends anyone foreordained to attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentāradvatīputra unconditioned elements cannot be designated except in terms of conditioned elements and conditioned elements cannot be designated except in terms of unconditioned elementsor kingdom and all their aspirations will be fulfilledhaving arrived there listen to the Dharma briefly The result of having such faith is as followswho wish to become an eye to the blindMahauṣadhi asked furtherIf the Blessed One would grant me the opportunity said the bodhisattva SarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhinUpon seeing the trutharhat and blessed tathāgata and perfectly awakened Buddha Kāśyapa has prophesied to the young brahmin Uttara sayingShe will cause countless sentient beings to practice the Dharmathe merit generated by a noble son or daughterGood sirs you have all spoken well Nevertheless all your explanations are themselves dualisticEven for the sake of their own lives they do not deprive sentient beings of lifeHow should they train to be reborn in the god realm of the sense field of infinite space andThey should cultivate the notion that they are teaching all sentient beingsThrough that root of merit they did not fall into the lower existences for a hundred million eonslikewise they do not consider whether the ears nose tongue body and mental faculty are calm or not calmWherever there was a threat they would stand as though fastened to stakesVenerable ones to refrain from dispute is the foremost training for spiritual practitionerswho has a hundred thousand times ten million eyesNoble son the bodhisattvas who are experts on these points in relative terms yet not in ultimate terms are said to be experts on the relativeThey maintain discipline to preserve the lineage of the Buddha to preserve the lineage of the Dharma and to preserve the lineage of the SaṅghaHe is the one who is gazed upon by the lord of the demons who beholds him with bright and unblinking eyesThey are lazy and their minds are weakAfter a time monks who were paying homage to stūpas passed byand they will hear There is only one nirvāṇa of the tathāgatas There is no second nirvāṇa other than thatThe pure and bright light sent forth by the Bodhisattva illumined the earthis called emptiness as a gateway to liberationThat which perceives these same six elements to be unitary whole permanent constant eternal pleasurable a self a being a life force a creature a soul a man an individual a human a person me and mine along with the many other such variations of misapprehension is called ignoranceOnce when young Rāhulabhadra had gone to Rājagṛha to receive alms he went to the Veṇuvana grove and there descended into a long pond to wash his almsbowlWhen those hopes were shown to be just that and the prince Sundarananda became a renunciantwherever they are reborn their bodies will be perfectas well as those who worship such Dharma teachers with clothes and ornamentsVenerable Lord when bodhisattvas practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom if they unskillfully engage with the applications of mindfulness then they are merely engaging with mental imagesāriputra all the beings who hear that Dharma from those tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhaseach entered his own divine Brahmā palace andSimilarly the eyes are not one thing and illusions another The eyes themselves are illusion and illusion itself is the eyesVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection constitutes the branches of enlightenmentAs soon as this was given the earth shook in six waysVilifying the monks they again spoke the same verseif without seeing the Buddha hearing the Dharma or serving the Saṅgha you undertake the religious life under the six outsider mastersWhen one does not move about one does not wanderThey are the level of the śrāvakas and the level of the pratyekabuddhasSo the emanation continued If the mind has no formthink I shall certainly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenmentare favored by the transcendent perfection of wisdom and are endowed with skill in meansFree from concerns and with a consciousness that does not dwell they train in observing the body and applying mindfulness to it yet they neither cultivate nor eliminate any phenomena at allThus they stood aside turned their heads and gazed intently at the Blessed OneThey will pass to pleasant forms of existenceIf the buddha realm were burning And in this samādhi they prayed For the burning to completely ceasenot real with no mind without intentionAnd they have their respective husbandsHe has reached the perfection of the supreme wisdom of skill in great methodsthat individual enlightenment is consequent on having understood that all things whatsoever originating from causes are things that will ceaseAfter performing rites for protection good luck and success the five hundred merchants together with the venerable Saṅgharakṣitaso too Mañjuśrī although the Tathāgata the Arhat the Perfect and Complete Buddha is invisibleIn order to benefit sentient beings He gave rise to a skillful outlookThese parasites constantly eat away at womens bodiesit engages with all phenomena without mediationI promised to share any such attainment with my sister so I must do soEven the names of the ten powers of the tathāgatas do not exist internally nor do they exist externally and nor do they abide between these twoO svāhā to VicitrakuṇḍalinBecause he had created such terrible karma When he passed away he fell to the terrible Avīci hell while they understand that that mind too has the essential nature of the limit of realitySimilarly they neither associate the ears the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty with present events nor do they disassociate them therefromSenior Subhūti what nonarising things do you not hold to ariseGaining the fortune for the world of Brahmā is akin to entering nirvāṇaThen at that point the allpowerful Brahmā spoke these versesSimilarly it has not been revealed so that the transcendent perfection of generosity the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdom might be grasped or not graspedThroughout a hundred thousand eonsDoing evil produces the perception of the cities of hellThe thusgone ones feel great compassion for sentient beings since all phenomena are devoid of formation and yet sentient beings experience formationHe placed upon my head his hand Which was shining beautiful the color of goldIgnorance combined with these formations emptiness of ultimate realityVenerable Lord This transcendent perfection of wisdom is the great transcendent perfectionThis is defiled and that is immaculateThose words which would separate me from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment are the work of MāraThe people there do not know of the doctors wonderful abilities and so the doctor thinks to himselfClinging is the causal condition of existencecan hardly be fathomed by nonBuddhists or demonsThe Dharma and the truth are their sonsThen Senior Subhūti addressed akra mighty lord of the godsMy friend I did not have a teacherIt has no goingNoble son you may wonder about the character of the bodhisattvas aspiration that is not inferiorWhen he had listened to this restraint of the body The eminent king gained exceptional accomplishmentThey should not dwell on the notion that I as one who is no longer subject to rebirth will attain final nirvāṇa in this lifeMonks following up on these thoughts the Bodhisattva now began a sixyear period of extremely fierce prescribed practices and hardships that were intensely difficult the hardest of all difficult practiceslassoing rising advancing retreating I continually had correct conduct And established others in correct conductBuddhas have not directly realized purificationMonks noontime passed and it was now evening when Brahmāof Dharma robes alms seat and bedding medicines for when ill and of monastic utensilsEvil one not knowing when the time is right You are like a beggar whose merit has run outand the deities called Gandhavyūhāhāra who were all devoted to the Mahāyāna served and attended upon that Buddha and his bodhisattvasWhat you may wonder does the bodhisattvas freedom from the pains of the afflictions consist inthey are clear because their senses are completely awakeVenerable Lord this transcendent perfection constitutes the applications of mindfulnessThe perfection of patience is a gateway to the light of the DharmaWhen they do so the doctor can heal themIt is like when someone Speaks of the qualities of sandalwood Saying Sandalwood is like this It makes a pleasing incense For example it is like a great fire burning on a mountaintop during the darkest night visible from a league or even five leagues awayThe hairs do not stand on end its nails do not turn blackAnd whose luster makes the whole city shineThey constantly see in those realms The perfect buddhas the guides of the worldit has not been produced by physical forms not by feelings not by perceptions not by formative predispositions and not by consciousnessThe pure light from fire jewels lightning and the stars also do not penetrate this placeCarried away by the bliss of passion they let their juices flowSubsequent to that he served an unfathomable countless number of blessed buddhasThen physician thought to himself This is my responsibility and my responsibility alone so I must go see the Blessed OneAnd having conquered all their pride They start them on the quest for enlightenmentthe treasure of confidence by satisfying all sentient beings with good counselThey discern that physical forms are empty and do not focus on themWhy All words also have that natureThis kind of bad karma is always created By the slaying of a wise bhikṣuKarmic obscurations that remain for eons such as those stemming from the five actions with immediate results will be purifiedas well as the fearlessnesses the unique qualities the powers the strengths the aspects of enlightenment the dhyānaswhich will stop the target from moving aboutLikewise This is perseveranceMoreover āradvatīputra demonic forces will transform themselves into an invisible guiseI myself took up a weapon and myself killed Foolishly I have created bad karma therefore Father Mother based upon the highest merit we have been born in the time of this teachingSimilarly the transcendence of the understanding of all phenomena the understanding of the aspects of the path and omniscience is not omniscience and the restFrom this ignorance arise formations of which there are three typesJust as the victorious lords of the past attained awakeningThey should not dwell on the notion that I will be reborn within an identical class of gods or humans over successive lives or as one with only a single further intervening rebirthhe will make stūpas for those tathāgatas They will be made of the seven precious materials which are gold silver beryl crystal red pearls emerald and white coral They will be a thousand yojanas in height and five hundred yojanas in circumferenceThere are none Lord he repliedand if they were to write on the limitless endless extent of Mount Sumeru as birch bark I would be able to count each letterI had no suffering because of the wounds And my body became as it was before They have practiced in millions of buddha realms It is very rare to see such beingsFor example just as the five great rivers flow into the great oceannanda in that world there will be no stones pebbles or gravelBut not even all the buddhas Can see nonexistence and it has not been revealed so that the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdom might be grasped or not graspedThe wisdomgnosis is the fruitional tantraWas seven hundred and sixty thousand million years Nobody has any desire for dancing singing or making merryAlas For the sake of a livelihood sentient beings act in unreasonable ways deceiving one anotherHe replied This is owing to the nonapprehension of the emptiness of ultimate realityHaving listened to the answers to those Quintillions of correct questionsThe sage was delighted and spoke to his nephew Listen to my instructionsHow should they train in the level of the pratyekabuddhasThe dharmabhāṇaka answeredmost of them became angry malicious and disbelievingmake them into a pill with salt and honey
