It is having no grasping toward all phenomena it is having no clinging to the aggregate of correct conduct
So Mañjuśrī Kumārabhuta along with ten thousand bodhisattvas bowed at the feet of the Thusgone Ratnaketu

What wise person could become fond of phenomena that are so impermanent unstable unreliable and fickle
But how Mañjuśrī
the venerable nanda looked at him and said to the Blessed One
And their three positions on the view Informed noble disciples
Lord if this child becomes literate he shall become a protector of your doctrine
Bring hundreds of thousands of delightful instruments Hand drums flutes lutes clay drums and cymbals

through calling out the name of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
From name and form arise six cognitive fields
The Buddha said to āriputra

You may wonder noble son what these qualities may imply from the bodhisattvas venerability through to their skill in reaching the city of omniscience
The householder meanwhile was feeling regret

They do not consider whether sights are void or not and the same goes for the other sense objects up to and including mental phenomena

In order to defeat all the hordes of extremists
At this the Bhagavān knowing in his own mind the thoughts that were in the minds of those great śrāvakas those sthaviras
Intelligent One the time for renunciation has come
Moreover when melted butter or oil or water is poured onto a mound of sand it cannot be said whether the mound is open or closed

And many beings make offerings to them And in particular they attain the unique wisdom free of darkness 
so for him I shall make a speech relating to the Hearers Vehicle
When he saw how dissimilar was their conduct The king did not show them respect

It gives complete sexual satisfaction
the inconceivably numerous recitations concerning the kleśas and the inconceivably numerous recitations concerning purification Those are the four

There are venomous insects fireflies and ants And dogs and jackals are howling
what need is there to mention engaging in an act of sexual intercourse in which a couples two organs meet

the one who has beautiful eyes like parasols
Some offer a million necklaces They arrive in the sky loud like thunder
Tolerate the bad things the foolish will say And keep and recite this samādhi 
These childish beings are killed like the condemned at the scaffold
Mañjuśrī replied Divine being the fear and regression of beginner bodhisattvas abide within irreversibility itself
The gods who know the time of passing Came joyfully before Queen Māyā They held flowers as well as ointments With folded hands they paid homage
The Tathāgata has compassion for the beings in saṃsāra and
Oh today I have been made perfectly happy
That is the eighth strange and wonderful thing
his total dedication is tantamount to his liberative art
The hairs on his body did not bristle with the fear of creation and destruction nor did his valor ever diminish
You will not attain awakening by sitting on a seat of fine grass
Majesty who would you have defend a position first
Hence they persevere with unswerving diligence
Because one might think Ultimately this is to be understood
who liberates beings from illness
You read aloud the sūtras and commission them to be written
I will see numerous millions of buddhas 
Having taught a hundred thousand sūtras They know that the Dharma is devoid of words 
Subhūti it is because the transcendent perfection of wisdom is absolutely void that
The movement of her limbs is gentle
Māra replied
Furthermore the particulars of the ḍākinīs Should be understood with respect to the central chakra
Rather they put their feet on the ground entirely mindfully and they raise their feet above the ground entirely mindfully
and in the same vein they train in all other causal and fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas
to give up the negative and unwholesome qualities that have already come about
They teach the stainless precious Dharma The ultimate truth of emptiness the subtle mode of meaning 
Similarly knowing that the four meditative concentrations the four immeasurable aspirations and the four formless absorptions are empty of inherent existence
and acting as a condition by which heat or cold is appropriated
When those endowed with skill in means have set their mind on enlightenment

Blessed One in the future where will this Dharma teaching continue to spread in its complete form
Know that such diligent people Will never meet with hardship
They maintain carefulness Their field of activity is meditative seclusion 
Sitting straight and erect he settled his mind and said
Thus by such causes conditions and bases one will come to take birth in the lower realms
Yet the eye consciousness is born from the presence of these conditions
When gems of playful women exquisitely dressed their bodies adorned Play sweet music on the best of instruments
You are the eye of gods and humans
had fully realized the perfection of wisdom were renowned in many hundreds of thousands of worlds
drew his robe over one shoulder and circled the Bodhisattva many hundreds of thousands of times He then took the Bodhisattva onto his lap and spoke these joyful words to King uddhodana
When they sing the sounds of the powers strengths and branches of enlightenment emerge
Similarly one should know the ten powers of the tathāgatas to be emptiness and likewise the four assurances to be emptiness the four unhindered discernments to be emptiness great loving kindness to be emptiness great compassion to be emptiness and the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas to be emptiness
Then there fell sesame rice jujubes and wild rice
And our broad and beautiful hips
The one with the sight of the faultless buddhas Practices the peace of this samādhi 
Those who perceive a precious Indranīla jewel from afar Are very fortunate beings
They do not consider whether physical forms have aspirations or are without aspirations
The womans path will become difficult
Will change from having a female existence And will become a dharmabhāṇaka 
and in the same vein all other attributes or attainments that have not been grasped up to and including omniscience do not constitute omniscience and so forth
Those beings sat before Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and requested him
Bhaiṣajyarāja what is the Dharma robe of the Tathāgata
The sons of the victors manifest such great powers As an act of worship
Sister the earth element does not come from anywhere
This teaching is inconceivable
They attain the dhyānas and the liberations And become worthy of offerings 
The east sank and the west rose the west sank and the east rose
As they see reality they will unite with reality
Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings discern emptiness in all its finest aspects
Because the qualities are immeasurable There is no measure that can be conceived for them
Yet your resolve equals the task so grant them the nectar of immortality
The bodhisattva lion similarly will never give up or be subdued if caught by attackers
One should draw a multicolored lotus of eight petals
Let him serve today the great being Resplendent with the four immeasurables
or it is Brahmā or is Brahmācolored or is like Brahmā or shines with Brahmās light
āradvatīputra do you think that the designation of physical forms as calm or not calm constitutes a bodhisattva
We will see that country yet Master if only for a short while
and finally they will enter the Dharma of omniscience in accordance with their strength location and power
The retinue of consorts completely naked were asleep and oblivious
āradvatīputra do you think that the designations of fundamental ignorance and in the same vein of all the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death as a self or a nonself constitute a bodhisattva
The ThusGone One has many friends
Similarly they should not dwell on the notion that I should attain the body of a superior man endowed with the thirtytwo major marks
ne seer drew near then a second and a third until they all surrounded him
or it leads to physical isolation
However no matter who the ākya girl Gopā encountered whether it was her motherinlaw her fatherinlaw or any other member of the inner quarters she did not cover her face
Monks to these words of Māra the evil one the ThusGone One replied
My son is difficult to match
At that moment the Bhagavān smiled
Seeking only spiritual dominion they should forsake political authority
Mahauṣadhi suppose that in this case from among the different kinds of beings a person in the grip of nonvirtuous actions dies and undergoes transfer
 The four brahmavihāras and the dhyānas The doorways to liberation that have been taught
His intention was enhanced by the sublime and perfectly complete austerities and spiritual practices that he observed on the path of the ten virtuous activities
We have learned them from his son the young brahmin Kolita
like the elephant his look was that of someone with a mind well tamed
Noble son whoever hears this exposition of the thusgone ones greatness will be accepted by the buddhas
Rejoiced and bowed their heads to the ground in veneration
Shows what they have and says I have found food
Divine son ultimately all phenomena are utter signlessness
It shades this supreme being while he practices concentration
pain unease or disturbance
the bodhisattva mahāsattva Sarvasattvapriyadarśana does not now have all his limbs
There is the meditative stability named Seal of the Sacred Doctrine
Tiṣya warmly greeted Koṣṭhila with words of welcome asking
Anger and hypocrisy come eighth
then in that case Venerable Lord what is the meaning of the term great bodhisattva being
In doing so some of them think Because of these methods in the afterlife we shall find heaven and final emancipation
As they do not abide they will see reality
Having collected their things the brahmin set off with the young brahmins for the Middle Country
and likewise that those individuals who enter the stream are discerned
I alone am the perfect Buddha
Bhīṣmārci Bhīṣmottara and Bhīṣmaghoṣa These jinas were guides of the world 
all other attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are neither fettered by nor liberated from their past limits
A man dreams he is in a house Experiencing the bliss of sensory pleasures
The entrances to five thousand treasures became visible as they broke forth from the earth
The experience of discomfort associated with the collection of the five consciousnesses is suffering
The characteristics of a buddha Are the same as those of enlightenment
Grahas born from kumbhāṇḍas
They will never give rise to attachment to any existent And will reach the samādhi of the absence of attributes 
Their sight too is purified They have insurpassable divine sight
Without discipline or austerities without hardship fasting or vows
to comprehend the sameness of the three times
Dwelling in empty solitary places Delighting in reciting the teachings 
May I realize the teaching of emptiness
The seventh aspect of liberation ensues when
Similarly it reveals the world comprising the eighteen sensory elements to be empty
When the completely pure tathāgatas come are seen and speak through the power of their previous prayers they teach the great skillful method of The White Lotus of the Good Dharma to completely pure beings
How so Because they are free of afflictions
Inwardly concerning the characteristics of the maṇḍala
You should not misconstrue this unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration or the transcendent perfection of wisdom
The sense pleasures are like a corpse filled to the brim with excrement
I also do not consider those attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience that the transcendent perfection of wisdom could appropriate or become fixated upon
Like Mahābrahmā he was the whole worlds superior
Monk then you must share one of his teachings
the eyes the ears the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty being empty of inherent existence
He sits on a lion throne on the central mountain
while engaging in the conduct of a bodhisattva to realize the intrinsic characteristics of all phenomena just as they are and therefore be indefatigable in saṃsāra
Anything that could not be sustained as existent or nonexistent could not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
and then go on to attain omniscience
and similarly those who wish to train in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent perfection of generosity should rely upon and venerate spiritual mentors who can confer instruction in the transcendent perfection of wisdom and similarly those who can confer instruction in the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent perfection of generosity
as an analogy a fire arises based on a stick to rub with a stick to rub on and and also a persons effort to generate it
A man crushes all the earth of the worlds in this realm of a billion worlds into powder
and would fall from monkhood
Then those bodhisattvas who had attained the superknowledges transformed their bodies to a height of fortytwo hundred thousand leagues and sat upon the thrones
His peer asked Friend you havent arranged a rendezvous at this house have you
He said I have come a long way
Similarly the sense fields are empty of notions of I and mine
Through this may I also become a buddha like you the god of gods
The unmādas that return every third day Fevers that recur every fourth day
Then he openly pronounces in the presence of the king the ministers the townspeople and the citizens of the land
What is the root of good and evil
They should regard their preceptors and instructors as consultants
Eight hundred dharmabhāṇakas Who were present stood up and said
Brother Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra having heard directly from the Bhagavān about this wisdom insight into skillful methods about the teachings with implied meaning and having heard the prophecies made to the great śrāvakas and having heard of the connections with the past and having heard of the preeminence of the Bhagavān
I answer him by saying There is and is not an afterlife
If there is no torment they will understand that their births have come to an end
Moreover son of noble family bodhisattva great beings should practice generosity in order to attain two things
the real nature of the understanding of all phenomena are all one and the same real nature

The Virile One stands in the center of the navel
The trees and the turrets of his buildings tore and fell over
And look me up and down
he Blessed One replied That monk preacher was a shapeshifter and yet this was so
BlissGone One that is how it is
Always with beautiful banners of victory And the constant sound of bells and little bells
However even when they threw mountains as big as the central mountain at the Bodhisattva the mountains all turned into flower canopies and celestial palaces
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixated on the notion that the sensory elements from the eyes to mental phenomena are purified
Moreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom
Its those who issue from people like you who become my ascetic attendants
Those who have heard have written out possess and read such a sūtra as this will have no craving for anything else
When we reached the shore I circumambulated Bālāha the king of horses three times bowed to him and departed
Bodhisattvas embrace the meritorious nature in the practice of generosity They disengage from the pursuit of wealth and honor
And what is its king
The king then ordered his ministers Gentlemen execute all of these men today
Nārāyaṇa in this way the quantity of merit of bodhisattva great beings who first give rise to the mind of awakening is unfathomable
On what day On such and such a day long ago
The Blessed Buddha was resident at the Kalandakanivāpa in the Bamboo Grove near Rājagṛha
Monks at that point I had the thought
Furthermore Mañjuśrī a bodhisattva who sees the realm of desire as the sphere of nirvāṇa
and again in his mind circumambulated him three times
You should speak in this way Brother wise scholar How can I say anything In front of such a great being 
The father is the skill in liberative technique
And the conduct of all beings
Venerable where have you come from
Venerable nandas hairs stood on end as he exclaimed I pay homage to the Buddha
Draw him holding a smoking stick of incense in his right hand and a basket filled with various adornments in his left hand
He then approached a monk and said
The zenith and the nadir are not discernible and the intermediate directions are not discernible
Venerable Lord How are great bodhisattva beings starting from those who possess all positive attributes and continuing as far as those who possess sublime pristine cognition born in the inferior realms
Bodhisattvas should have humbled their pride like dogs
They will not mention or disclose such forms to be the creations of demonic forces
will perceive in his sleep what is beneficial and what is not
will make assumptions on that basis
so that it was as soft and pleasant to the touch as down and made a pleasant sound
For these reasons Subhūti
on a lion throne made of precious gemstones upon which hundreds of thousands of precious fabrics had been spread
Tell us so that doubts will be overcome Teach the meaning of this exactly as it is
You should absorb yourself in contemplation so that the mind neither settles within nor moves without toward external forms
And begin the practice with a consort
They perceive minds afflicted with hatred correctly as minds that are afflicted with hatred and they perceive minds free from hatred correctly as minds that are free from hatred
For the sake of sentient beings they hold and accept the excellent resources of gods and humans
The inconceivable buddha body Of a buddha is also inconceivable
red wool lambswool a red shawl fine Kāśī cotton cloth of a fitting color
If Your Majesty ignores the princes actions
Ah Arise quickly you who are the most precious being And having arisen bring relief to this saṅgha of bhikṣus xii
They who possess this supreme samādhi Are handsome good looking and attractive
 Hero for many millions of eons constantly You practiced generosity selfrestraint and selfcontrol
Similarly the sensory element of the eyes is also free from contaminants and not included within the three world systems
Yes Mañjuśrī they are
And so on up to passing into nirvāṇa for beings who are to be guided by his passing into nirvāṇa
Consider the way that due to the pillars that support the Palace of Victory the gods of the Heaven of the Thirtythree have a gathering place

standards banners
A long time ago while seeking to benefit beings I made the wish to liberate the world Once I attained the state of awakening beyond old age or death Now that time has come
and these are the retributions for verbal misdeeds
You are not subject to any wish for anything at all
carry out and accrue deeds that are destitute of the sacred doctrine
āradvatīputra whenever great bodhisattva beings with an omniscient mind neither conceptualize these six transcendent perfections nor apprehend them these great bodhisattva beings are said to don the great armor
utter pacification is called the sage
So sure enough in the morning the Blessed One donned his robes picked up his alms bowl
Always venerate your teacher Your parents and similarly all beings
without any loss of meaning or words and for all their words to come forth as those of the Buddha then those bodhisattva mahāsattvas
If the ordinand responds A transgression occurred the inquirer tells him In that case I ask you to leave
the sons and daughters of noble family will arouse the mind of unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening
The strength of ten halfNārāyaṇas is the same as the strength of one Nārāyaṇa
Noble one the one who made the offering to the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Meghadundubhisvararāja
What is acting within the scope of correct conduct It is meditation on the four mindfulnesses

were amazed and filled with wonder
Thus when a person approached a monk with the wish to go forth
With the healing salve of the threefold liberation
I have abandoned many delights And thousands of women so beautiful to behold I now wish for the perfect peace of sacred awakening Since I find no joy in conditioned existence I have left it
I realize that there is no aging no poverty no happiness no sickness nor is anyone ever ill wealthy or poor at all
who teaches the four noble truths who being fearless in four ways is never frightened who has abandoned the five branches

One should make an unguent from malachite and the root of white agastya tree
Just so Mañjuśrī the bodhisattva loves all living beings as if each were his only child
I will do anything so that no one comprehends holds and masters this Dharma discourse

Just like the nāga kings from the east nāga kings from the south west and north also came worried that the cold and wind might harm the ThusGone Ones body
and will become bodhisattvas in their last life
there is nothing apprehensible which would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood by which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attained and in which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attained
The holders of the Dharma treasures of all teachers
Indeed some of the beings came here for the great display In order to observe meditative concentration and a great display one must abide on the level of freedom from attachment

they were not nonentities
Mañjuśrī on what basis do you teach
Similarly they should not even dwell on the notion In this my buddhafield may the term applications of mindfulness exist
who delights in the Dharma

They said to the nāga disguised as the monk preacher What do you know retired devotee
Moreover by the causes and conditions of the bodhisattvas birth there their faith will develop grow and expand further still
Now the Blessed One spoke again to the bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin
They are all purecompletely pure like space 
whenever they do not engage with the notions that physical forms cease and that they are unceasing
is the physical restraint through which bodhisattva mahāsattvas attain the four discernments
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas
you also should obtain this king of samādhis the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomena
characterized by the nonappropriation of physical forms possessed by great bodhisattva beings and similarly the nonappropriation of feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness and so on
will not teach the sacred doctrine according to the notions that physical forms are permanent or that they are impermanent

Sitting and walking during the day In forests in groves and under trees
perceiving them to be like beryl

so that if someone is seeking an opportunity to harm those dharmabhāṇakas they will not find an opportunity to do so
But the Blessed One knew his intention and blessed the Lord of Secrets Vajrapāṇi
it is owing to the nonexistence of that bodhisattva that meditative stability and that transcendent perfection of wisdom that they do not know and indeed that they have no cognition
Desires too are foulsmelling disagreeable and not worthy of being looked upon

Therefore Nārāyaṇa those who do not manifest the four abodes of Brahmā or the accomplishment of the concentrations of noble beings are a long way from abiding in the true practice of chastity
or do they go to the realm of bliss by means of the enjoyment body having left behind their emanation body
Likewise with the Blessed Ones permission the other bodhisattvas each took a seat on their own lotus flower
By this method he benefited innumerable countless hundred thousand quintillions of beings

Faith my friends is a gateway to the light of Dharma for with it ones mind is unshakable

I will refresh your memory he said and reminded him
He discovered the means to complete liberation and entered the city of omniscience
The Bhagavān said to Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta
and similarly they do not consider the transcendent perfection of generosity as an entity or as a sign
As the result of the bad karma of rejecting this sūtra
one does not elaborate about the present
the designation cloud is established in the world In the very same way
With bowls of water by clapping their hands And with sweet lovely wellsung songs 
nanda that is how I practiced for endless eons I saw countless buddhas endowed with glory

It is in this way Subhūti that great bodhisattva beings who seek to attain emancipation in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment should abide in these sacred doctrines and do so without apprehending anything
āradvatīputra do you think that the sensory element of the nose the sensory element of odors and the sensory element of olfactory consciousness constitute a bodhisattva
The Blessed One is endowed with collarbones that are well covered
May they cease
The second retention is of what is known concerning the teaching of all infinite sounds
Noble sons their accumulation of merit is immeasurable
In each of the mansions appeared  rows of palm trees
They offered their divine Brahmā palaces to the Bhagavān
O hrī protector Baṭuka Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa Hū phaṭ
And praising indefatigably The buddhas with pure praises
So then at that very time and on that occasion the Lord dispatched Vajrapāṇi and benevolently granted this mantra and this manual of instruction to the listeners and the bodhisattvas to monks and nuns and to male and female lay practitioners

the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline
it is because those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage have rejoiced in the roots of virtuous action of beginners entering the vehicle who are innumerable and immeasurable in number
what those four are they should be taught in detail
Terrified they thought If were recognized theyll put us in those vats this very day
Learn able to inspire others to learn The two sets of perfection the lists of three
Noble son compared to making offerings to all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas by filling up this great trichiliocosm with precious jewels
if they unskillfully engage with the applications of mindfulness
Disparaging any spiritual practice Ridiculing vajra siblings disciples with shared tantric commitments Breaking the root and branch samaya vows Cursing the lama
Like seeds planted in a fertile field This is called the most precious gem of the Saṅgha
And likewise leprosy white leprosy and a rotten smell
Venerable Lord Are the eyes also free from contaminants and not included within the three world systems owing to the emptiness of inherent existence
so the buddhaqualities do not grow in those determined for the absolute but do grow in those who conceive the spirit of enlightenment after having produced a Sumerulike mountain of egoistic views
Padmaśrīgarbha that these many jewel mansions now fill up and adorn this Sahā world is not due to the power of the ThusGone One
for it endows one with the wisdom of realization
Venerable Lord The sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage
One should endeavor in correct discernment with behavior that is never frivolous
Thus nowhere else were the Bodhisattvas enjoyments as perfectly pure as in the womb of his mother
If you ask Subhūti how great bodhisattva beings act as a helmsman and guide of the worlds
One should eat sugar with clarified butter
Monks King uddhodana accompanied by the great royal procession splendor and ceremony brought the prince to the temple
He does not emulate anything other than unconditioned phenomena
Then the Bodhisattva thought What must be absent for old age and death not to occur
they have attended excellently
Bhikṣus each mendicant bodhisattva taught as many hundred thousand quintillions of beings as there are grains of sand in sixty Ganges Rivers
once death has taken place it has mental feelings
When a bodhisattva gathers sentient beings through the four means of attraction such a bodhisattva is endowed with skillful means
Mañjuśrī that is the first field of activity of bodhisattva mahāsattvas
The world had now become smooth like the palm of a hand
They should minimize pride with respect to all sentient beings

and would never again fall back into such states of existence
It is like a raging fire Or like a sword striking sesame butter
I shall become liberated from suffering
entering homelessness he resides in solitude
or who seek to actualize the fruit of entering the stream cannot abide in it or actualize it without relying on this tolerance or receptivity
What is protecting the Dharma It is subjugating in a way that is in accord with the Dharma those who malign the Buddhas Dharma
By eating it and drinking molasses
King uddhodana did not see the Bodhisattva Displeased with his absence he said
His chariot on the way came to the place Where the bhikṣu lay in eight pieces 
You be happy
From among them arhats will appear in the world
The eight are the eight first vowels
 they maintain the power of patience without maintaining the conceptualization that there are beings
Mahauṣadhi how do you think the poison would compare to the body of the elephant in size
Son did you go to the physician Mother I went to the physician
Venerable Lord in which pure attributes do great bodhisattva beings abide
When the gods saw it their eyes were dazzled and they were amazed
The camphor located in those channels Is the ambrosia emergent from union
Similarly are these five transcendent perfections not designated as transcendent perfections when they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline when they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of tolerance when they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of perseverance or when they are acquired by means of the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration
Above it

Seeing these supreme gods enter his palace
to cognize the present abiding of the dharmadhātu is nondisturbance
The four pure stations and so forth

When the Guide of the World was born all suffering and afflictions ceased
The flower garlands hung as adornments on the Bodhi tree
to comprehend the three times
Form is what causes it to take hold of a body
In the same vein those other nonattributes up to and including the nonaffliction of physical forms and the nonpurification of physical forms are without foundation
āradvatīputra the ten recollections are merely conceptualized
Within the teaching of the highest sage I am supreme among the entirety
before taking their places

As in the parable that I have previously narrated There appears a person who is a lord of generosity Who for eighty years continually Brings satisfaction to a quintillion beings
Rāhula the lifespan of the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Saptaratnapadmavikrāntagāmin will be the same as that of the bhagavān the tathāgata the arhat the perfectly enlightened buddha Sāgaravaradharabuddhivikrīḍitābhijña

The Lord of the World has accomplished what is difficult
that is similar in color and shape to the jeweled structure that delighted the Bodhisattva
Why The Buddha has said
 It is a special attainment being always engaged in meditation It is the knowledge of downfalls and remaining in emancipation
A mass made brilliant by a thousand colors Emerged from your mouth
The one who knows phenomena in that way Becomes strong with the strength of samādhi 
by their truth and their true words may the person named suchandsuch have wellbeing
Moreover Subhūti even if great bodhisattva beings who are irreversible dwell as householders
it would not equal match number compare to or cause it
Thinking I have gained the attainments and achieved direct perception they pride themselves on those achievements
Those that dwell in parks and mansions In gardens and forests In shrines and towns And at tree trunks
What is having a sense of modesty It is that which is not evident to others

Wherever that noble man or noble woman is they will be teaching the Dharma in the presence of the Tathāgata
and come to an end
and in the same vein this mind of the bodhisattvas is unattached to the other sense objects up to and including mental phenomena
if on the other hand there are other sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage
Then one will summon even a celestial girl
When they listen to and hear this Dharma teaching and aspire to it engage in it understand it and possess it
Venerable nanda now stood up from his seat
It is the elimination of kleśas It is ceasing engagement with propensities
is called the purity of the three spheres of subject object and their interaction
Why is that Because bodhisattvas return to the realm of desire and they enter the concentrations
full of praise for the Buddhas words
The nonaccomplishment of such actions is the entrance into nonduality
Homage to Tathāgata Lakṣmyākarṣaṇaśrī
the vinaya of the bodhisattva great beings clarifies the mind streams of all beings causes the wisdom of omniscience to manifest
How should they train in great loving kindness
The two brothers were elated and supremely pleased Together with their companions
pay homage
What do you think Ajita
Subhūti all the other fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas are subsumed within this transcendent perfection of wisdom
and omniscience is the ten powers of the tathāgatas and so on in the same vein

to produce flowers of white blue red or multicolored appearance
Therefore the Tathāgata realized all dharmas to be free from this shore or the other shore
The yakṣas rejoice in it The kiṃnaras praise it in song
Witnessing this the Bodhisattva thought to himself
Or gather the minds of all sentient beings as many as there are into one Or my father bind the sun the moon and the wind with a noose
she thought If I do not gain the monk Vīradatta as my husband I will die Being unable to talk about this to anyone and
The crippled had their capacities restored
Similarly it is owing to the emptiness of internal phenomena that the acceptance of great bodhisattva beings has been taught
Why be sorrowful in Jambudvīpa
He points a threatening gesture at Vasudhā
Now I cannot even enter my own property
 It is the healing of desire the pacifying of anger and the elimination of ignorance
He is neither existence nor nonexistence
twelve thousand bodhisattvas that included
What are those ten They are turning away from unvirtuous qualities not transgressing the thusgone ones points for training freedom from stinginess service to the victorious ones in the past diligence in meritorious acts excellent insight skill in means excellent aspiration abundant weariness and the rousing of diligence
Ajita I have described the qualities of the bodhisattva mahāsattvas who will maintain this Dharma teaching after I have passed into nirvāṇa and that is what they will be like
It teaches the absence of concerns with respect to phenomena and is a gateway to certainty about all phenomena
Yakṣas rākṣasas and kumbhāṇḍas have faith in you You have liberated nāgas mahoragas and garuḍas
When they are cast out from that mass of flames they will be hurled into the Vaitarāṇi River
they will venerate the lord buddhas
in the three periods of the day offer flowers and other things to it while reciting the mantra
To liberate beings from these hundreds of calamities Thus you made your aspiration
This pleases the Tathāgata the Arhat the perfectly awakened Buddha
akra lord of the gods as well as the four great kings the twentyeight great commanders of the yakṣas and the master of the guhyakas who are the type of yakṣa from which Vajrapāṇi came
On that topic the four corners are the four immeasurable states
Although they do meditate on the truths without meditating
Moreover Subhūti when great bodhisattva beings who practice the six transcendent perfections see the four modes of birth of which sentient beings partake namely oviparous birth viviparous birth birth from heat and moisture and miraculous birth
After I attained this highest enlightenment At the foot of a tree by the city of Gayā
and also two thousand bhikṣus who were in training and had transcended training and six thousand bhikṣunīs such as Mahāprajāpatī and bhikṣunī Yaśodharā
They were brave with the confidence that overawes all assemblies
She is to be served as taught by the buddhas
Which quantity of merit is greater
they comprise six that are inner and six that are outer
Ajita I declare to you I proclaim to you
The great king Kubera arrived from the north with several trillion yakṣas holding in their hands precious jewels of the type called starlight They also carried oil lamps and lighted lanterns They held in their hands various weapons such as bows and arrows swords spears lances with two and three points discuses onepointed pikes and javelins and they were armed with strong armor and helmets
They have all gone forth and joined the renunciant order around the ascetic Gautama
In one instant you see The forms voices and postures Of all sentient beings
To some he teaches in the form of a monastic with the appropriate attire and conduct and so forth including all forms previously mentioned and those beings will reach the higher realms
They make offerings without any sense of miserliness greed discouragement or fear and their offerings are vast and extensive
and the inconceivably numerous words of nonmovement concerning purification Those are the four
Omniscience is the nature of wisdom
With the strength of two or even three elephants
To see all phenomena genuinely to see them as they truly are is genuine vision
were all endowed with attributes that are unmistaken inalienable incontrovertible genuine true qualitative permanent stable eternal and unchanging and they were not nonentities then
Similarly they should be attentive to the notions that feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are calm and void
Nor Subhūti will the fruit be attained without cultivating the path
Lord of the World who shines with light Are you dwelling in happiness
Answer simply by saying what is so is so and what is not is not
Subhūti great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of perseverance think
sat down on one side and recited these verses
Would you say that the nature of the realm of phenomena is relative or ultimate
In order to pacify the concepts of the world All buddhas teach this manual of practice
when the west was up the east was down
Their conduct is excellent and they take hold of what is truly essential
Mañjuśrī whoever sees all phenomena as devoid of existence because there is neither mindfulness nor attention has the branch of enlightenment of right mindfulness
This is the army of Māra The evil friend who inflicts torment
āradvatīputra there are views which concern the psychophysical aggregates the sensory elements the sense fields the noble truths and dependent origination
Millions upon millions of gods turned their eyes toward the palace and gazed at it in awe
His head will be split by a thunderbolt
It does not involve transmigration because beings from different classes of existence bring about their rebirth in a common form of birth
All streams and rivers stopped their flow
The strength of ten Ever Ecstatic gods is the same as the strength of one god from the classes of the Four Great Kings
branches of awakening for its anthers and mental stability for its stamen This lotus arose from an immaculate ocean of a vast accumulation of virtues
The Dharma teaching of bodhisattvas similarly is inexhaustible even if it is given to all sentient beings
Subhūti great bodhisattva beings who abide in the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline
They were noble beings great elephants successful and accomplished
One should push ones elbows upward
and similarly just as the notion of stupidity with respect to their aggregate of wisdom is without foundation
they will provisionally not actualize the finality of existence Rather
 Having no attachment for phenomena Always grasping the supreme Dharma
From this day forward you must endeavor to fully safeguard your intentions
then at that time at that instant that very moment among that gathered assembly sitting crosslegged upon the great Dharma seat
One brought water to wash his feet and said
Since all things are accordingly nonexistent and nonapprehensible
When this Dharma teaching was delivered and all these offerings presented
Perfect man no one in the three worlds can compare to you
Those who wish for the state of buddhahood Those who long for selfarising wisdom
The many children of the Buddha were distressed And they experienced the greatest suffering 
As they remembered and recognized who he was they were full of veneration for the Bodhisattva and wrapped him up in divine silk
What is the cause for this extreme beauty
he is without sorrow
In that way the man first promised three carts to those children
He thought
Eventually he reached the house of the ākya Daṇḍapāṇi
This light illuminated the inhabitants of the entire world who were steeped in evil and darkness
Just as Subhūti space is neither long nor short nor square nor round
The vinaya of the hearers is contemplated by individual minds
Monks at these words the ThusGone One repeated to Great TopKnotted Brahmā
Conclusion of the tenth chapter The Entry into the City
āradvatīputra do you think that the designation of the sensory element of the eyes constitutes a bodhisattva
Mañjuśrī
It is like a palmyra tree if you were to lop off its crown it would no longer be green nor would it flourish grow or expand
The sixsyllable queen of mahāvidyās is a recitation that is hard to find
tAnd he is displaying supernatural powers and miracles of extraordinary transformations after having assembled a great retinue
And how many hundreds of thousands of hardships have I had to endureat the hands of enemies and murderers or by thieves and royal henchmen having all my body parts sliced and chopped into many pieces with sharp knives and having been slashed bound beaten and menaced all for the sake of desire or greed
The wisdom circle remains in front
They have no clinging they are attentive And they have no attachment to the world 
owing to the profundity of the inconceivable expanse
Many dogs and jackals are also there Coming out and staring at them
and all attainments up to and including omniscience
Because they do not appropriate they will attain complete nirvāṇa without further appropriation
Then indeed in order to conform to worldly conventions the Bodhisattva dwelt among  women and showed himself to partake of the amorous games with pleasure
His forehead is even
and even prepared the cavalry
If you ask why Senior āradvatīputra it is because all things are unborn in cyclic existence and unemancipated in nirvāṇa
And become before long An illuminating buddha 
Noble son this is how it is As an analogy think of a merchant or householder who has six dearly cherished beloved and adored children
Everyone thought that the young prince was still asleep in his bed
and the inconceivably numerous accumulations of eloquence concerning purification Those are the four
This is my responsibility and my responsibility alone thought King uddhodana
nor do they practice in order to increase them
Giving away ones head represents the bodhisattvas attainment of omniscient wisdom the supreme state that is more exalted than the entirety of the three realms Therefore
Monks in this way the Bodhisattva arose from the seat where he had practiced discipline and hardship for the past six years
You who see the truths and teach the ultimate
He did not even see the hundred buddhas who live in each of those pores let alone any bodhisattvas
who is the one to whom all devas make offerings pay homage and show reverence
Some are teaching the Dharma of peace Through many trillions of parables and reasons
Mañjuśrī what is called attaining acceptance is to attain their unending true nature
They follow the poṣadha vows And follow the path of correct conduct
āradvatīputra do you think that one is liberated by perceiving the sensory element of the tongue the sensory element of tastes and the sensory element of gustatory consciousness as entities
It caused no harm but was true clear and genuine
You have the six great higher knowledges you are unsurpassable And you have perfected yourself for endless eons
One should touch her lotus with ones hand
and I will look after each of them as if they were my only child
If you ask why they are neither fettered nor liberated because they themselves are nonexistent because they themselves are void because they themselves are nonarising because they themselves are nonceasing and so on even up to the attainment of buddhahood
Having made these offerings they then dedicate these roots of virtue making common cause with all sentient beings saying Through these my roots of virtue may the fragrance of divine perfume always arise in this buddhafield
Then Vimalakīrti took the pearls and divided them into two halves
Excellent excellent noble son
He said to me If you wish for the Dharma Promise to be my slave and I will teach you the Dharma
When the king heard that he collapsed on the ground
Cinnamon vacā saffron And an unguent of asafetida mixed with leaves
They retain what they have heard for the sake of showing the path of the hearers to those who have truly entered the Hearers Vehicle
Will you ask me for a boon Tell me I will give you anything
He was honored as the Lokapāla among Lokapālas because he fostered the development of all living beings
Kauśika the transcendent perfection of wisdom does not attain even the transcendent perfection of wisdom whether in the sense of a designation in the sense of an intimation or in the sense of a formulation
Adjustment to this is the entrance into nonduality
Similarly they do not think May I be reborn equal in fortune to the priestly class standing out like a tall sāl tree or among the householder class standing out like a great sāl tree
Male and female nāgas will wish to come to them so as to see them pay homage to them honor them and listen to the Dharma
nanda you should understand this through the following teaching
how will one be born die live and gain happiness
In the same vein that which is empty of the other causal attributes up to and including the noble eightfold path
I then inquired
In the emptiness of nondispersal the emptiness of inherent existence is not discerned
Then seized by the messengers of Yama
The nature of sights is emptiness Emptiness is sights
Great hero you have appeared Tathāgata we supplicate you
Moreover āriputra although that tathāgata will not appear during an eon of degeneration
They are led to attain nirvāṇa And they turn away from saṃsāra 
So it is nanda that because those sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage have been captivated by the brilliance of the transcendent perfection of wisdom no one will have occasion to censure it
disturbing emotions are themselves unarisen on the ultimate level
When these disparaging remarks are repeated to others it causes disrespect in many ordinary beings
The applications of mindfulness are empty of the applications of mindfulness
and repeatedly meditated on it with unadulterated meditation remaining dedicated to that practice of meditation
And the eight branches of the supreme path of the noble ones Are not difficult to attain for one trained in restraint of the body 
I remember ten thousand million buddhas And more to the number of sand grains in the Ganges
So one should not torment oneself with austerities
Blessed One please grant your blessings that this Dharma discourse on the absorption that encapsulates all merit will be practiced and propagated by all means in times to come
Other than the Tathāgata there is no one who can explain consciousness
Prostrations to the tathāgata in the World Where the MirrorDisk Has Been Proclaimed Buddha Whose Mind Is like the Moon
How are bodhisattvas free from stinginess and envy
They respectfully venerate preceptors and masters and speak respectfully to those who maintain pure conduct
Monk as all phenomena are constructed falsely they are nonabiding
Instructor heed me Just as noble arhats renounced killing and swore to refrain from killing for as long as they lived
When there was a jina a supreme being Whose name was Candrasūryapradīpa 
As numerous as are the knowledges of the Buddha There are that many designations for forms
syād yathedam śānti śāravati kānti kāravati kiṃkarasi kiṃkarati kiṃkasikiriṇṭi kiṃrate kiṃvate dharaṇi dhavani bhūmi dhāriṇi himavati jyotiścaraṇe gālāgre May I have wellbeing in the south Svāha
the  kinds of conduct related to delusion and
their nature is without diversity or differentiation
If you ask why O gods
Subhūti it is because physical forms are naturally neither fettered nor liberated
The cessation of outflows and who were in their last bodies 
It then occurred to him Aging and death happen when there is birth
onepointedness of mind based on the aspects of signlessness
the precise identity of existence the source of existence the cessation of existence and the path leading to its cessation
nor will they suffer ailments of the tongue nor will their limbs be defective
 I was always engaged in the discipline of a mendicant I always remained in the solitude of forests
This king of mantras when correctly recited will stop a hailstorm
All vighnas and vināyakas yakṣas and rākṣasas together with the companies of mahākālas and mātṛs fled
His palms and the soles of his feet are soft
The result of your practice of concentration Is that beings are not harmed by afflictions
At that time these verses rang out from the lion throne with its great jeweled lotus inside
Moreover the bodhisattvas in all the various worlds in the ten directions now became visible at the seat of awakening adorning the place with their immeasurable accumulations of merit and wisdom
numerous beings who had not done so before now gave rise to the mind of awakening
for humans like a path
becomes fused with the semen and remains in her birth channel
Pratyekabuddhas live on these kings of mountains
Bhagavān be at ease and be content
A lay vowholder also a yoginī
to have trust in impermanence
along with those gods of the Trayastriṃśa realm those of the Yāma realm those of the Tuṣita realm
And if they all today in unison Were to contemplate the Sugatas wisdom
The purity of his buddhafield reflects the purity of living beings
Bhagavān we lacked understanding lacked skill and lacked knowledge
The Bodhisattva for his part sat there in the perfect crosslegged posture Surrounded by gods he was so beautiful blazing with splendor
Fashioned a bier and placed The bhikṣu inside the casket
It is not being acquisitive of composite things
They have no longing for home and no longing for the forest They have no longing for a monastery and no longing for a village
āradvatīputra do you think that the designations of sounds odors tastes tangibles and mental phenomena as having aspirations or lacking aspirations constitute a bodhisattva
Noble son similarly from the point at which bodhisattvas first give rise to the mind of awakening
They know the skills of healing and bestow happiness And they are able to remove all the pain of suffering 
Bhagavān what cause will inspire this bodhisattva mahāsattva to come to the Sahā world realm I request that the Tathāgata create that cause
not the domain of reasoning not the domain of nonreasoning
Standing before other people that man may praise the fruits qualities explaining about its perfect color scent taste and so on
Now venerable āradvatīputra together with Māra Pāpīyān please teach the Dharma just like the ThusGone One does
one has only to teach them the Dharma for them to realize the basis from which sicknesses arise
Saṅgharakṣita assented with the words I shall do just that
 tBodhisattvas should have the fortitude to give up every part of their bodies
They were free of hypocrisy deceit lies slander harsh words killing harming bondage wrong views threatening quarreling strife fighting dispute dueling and all related afflictions
The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra The Absorption That Encapsulates All Merit
The people on board who wish to save their lives but who do not catch and hold on to a wooden plank log leather bag or human corpse
and for a hundred and forty thousand million years I listened to the samādhi the revealed equality of the nature of all phenomena
They think of things that are nonexistent
In the future there will be some monks who do not train their bodies and minds and do not acquaint themselves with discipline and knowledge
From the first of the vowels Arises a stainless full moon
thinking The Blessed One the ThusGone One the Worthy One the completely perfect Buddha is a god
the sesame oil you get from infusing sesame seeds with campaka flowers before pounding
Lets make sure that he is caught cut slashed tied held harassed cut in pieces gotten rid of and destroyed
They pursued the welfare of all beings and were experts with respect to the entire domain of the buddhas
Similarly inner dependent arising also arises from two principles From what two principles From a causal relation and a conditional relation
Their speech is sweet and fully perfected
Like lightning they bring down a rain of luminous flowers And praise the heroic one with the voice of gandharvas and kiṃnaras
The seven treasures that will be his are the precious wheel the precious elephant the precious horse the precious wife the precious jewel the precious steward and the precious minister
I have committed a horrific deed I have engaged in sexual intercourse
noble disciples observe and dwell on its repeated arising and destruction
As soon as the sun rises all darkness is destroyed
Do not act so as to accrue the fortune for that mass of suffering It would be well were you to explain our plight at length
At the top was a beautifully adorned upper floor scaled to fit a sixmonthold fetus
For all the tathāgata arhat perfectly complete buddhas of the three times this son of noble family is like a minister
In the same vein as before
Consider the analogy of a welltrained doctor who is very skilled in the eight branches of yurveda and expert in all conditions having extensively studied the use of medicinal substances and instruments and who knows the condition of the sick beings whose bodies are tormented by various ailments
then how do great bodhisattva beings abiding in the transcendent perfection of wisdom
Bathing his body with streams of scented water
Oh my that stupid fool so ignorant that he doesnt see your beauty and good looks
Tasting ambrosia is Amitābha
However as soon as the demons released the weapons the weapons turned into garlands and canopies of flowers
Searching in that way he finds the four herbs
Awakening Mañjuśrī is not realized by the body
Oṃ Sāvitrī Daughter of Savitra
Consider noble son the analogy of a lion that conquers alone and unaccompanied those who oppose it through its own diligence strength and power
If you please I will divide it into five patches and those into sections of two and a half
āriputra knowing this body to be a fabrication apart from immature ordinary beings with no education no one would continue clinging to the sense pleasuresit would be impossible
To the bodhisattva great being Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin the blessed thusgone Padmanetra replied
May you have the good fortune of beholding your kinfolk
Struck with the arrow of desire infatuated with smiles on their faces they said
Five hundred upāsakas attained the result of nonreturners
slander
The Bodhisattva then asked Is that a practice specific to his family Or could that happen to anyone Quick tell me the truth
The three worlds are unstable like autumn clouds
Young man the bodhisattvas have four kinds of wealth What are the four kinds of wealth
During those fifty intermediate eons Bhagavān ākyamuni remained silent
they form the concept of a tathāgata thinking This is the Tathāgatas body
among which are the tathāgatas and also the followers of the tathāgatas
What is having sharp knowledge It is knowing the nonorigination of phenomena to be like a dream
In this way they know the lack of reality That phenomena are like illusions with an empty nature
When he did not take it the bodhisattva mahāsattva Akṣayamati implored the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
When I claim to have explained the path through which suffering will genuinely cease having ascertained that śrāvakas will find it conducive to the attainment of sublime emancipation if some virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon Brahmā or anyone else in the world should say in this respect that even if one practices this path it will not be conducive to emancipation that suffering will not cease and that that is impossible I would correctly disregard that reason for contradicting me based on their worldly doctrines
Kāśyapa I have realized the one taste of the Dharma the one taste of liberation ultimate nirvāṇa the eternal nirvāṇa the single level and the domain of space
With a show of respect they said to him Welcome reverend Saṅgharakṣita welcome
and it had been praised in the poetry of the gods
Do not say that reverend āriputra
the nature of this consciousness present in their body
In the midst of the jungle when the lion is not there Many jackals bark
Senior Subhūti as attainment and clear realization are exclusively designated according to worldly convention is it the case that the five classes of living beings are also differentiated owing to worldly convention but not in ultimate reality
What is rejecting incorrect views It is rejecting the view of objective reality
They are not affected by poison They do not drown in water 
While acting in full acquaintance with the absence of marks it nevertheless considers all sentient beings who engage with marks
gazing upon him and contemplating the wisdom of the Buddha and thought
The third root mantra
The five hindrances are a cause of affliction
By means of this mantra And through the ritual of cane or cakes One will obtain a sign during dream
the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment of great bodhisattva beings is easy to bring forth and it is easy to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood
Now tell us king what shall we do
O hey hey Remain remain Bind bind Hold hold Restrain suchandsuch restrain O rṇāmaṇi svāhā
and to give out the medicine of even the smallest Dharma he does not destroy compounded things
one will be able to summon a yakṣiṇī or a girl from the pātāla
adopt and maintain the ways of the ten virtuous actions
Wait a while and you will see the Perfect One Who is like a stainless full moon adorned with a crown of stars
The sublime sage prostrated at the princes feet circled him
What marks
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara wondered By what method can I bring contentment to these beings
Similarly this mind of the bodhisattvas is unattached to the sensory element of sights
He is on the level of seeing all beings
Witnessing this radiance some bodhisattva great beings asked the Blessed
Let him attend upon that learned lord who speaks with the voice of Brahmā
They will ensure that the lineage of the tathāgatas will not be interrupted
During that time he converted the group of five the five friends and fifty highborn village brahmin youths
 With a mind free like a bird one should be completely without grasping
When desire anger or a wish to harm arises bodhisattvas think as follows
seven states of great diminishment seven hundred states of diminishment
The meaning is that ignorance takes on the form of the five aggregates that are grasped onto
Whatever negative actions I have done Under the influence of mind
The worlds guide the omniscient one Taught that pride is the root of suffering
and he established countless beings in irreversible progress toward the highest complete enlightenment And then before that day had ended he passed into nirvāṇa
They will always become overpowered in that way And in the later times they will reject enlightenment 
the lord of asuras the lord of garuḍas the lord of kiṃnaras
The King of Dharma the great physician Gives thousands of millions of teachings
I have also separated my body from the objects of desire
nanda if any sons of enlightened heritage or daughters of enlightened heritage were to extensively describe explain genuinely demonstrate and so forth these noble meanings and noble words of the transcendent perfection of wisdom to others
Was reborn into a kings family Appearing miraculously unstained by a womb 
After fiery sand thrice fell from the heavens upon a young nāga
Senior āradvatīputra in this context when great bodhisattva beings practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom they do not investigate the notion that physical forms are imbued with happiness
and likewise with the natures of all things
His lifespan will be twelve intermediate eons
encounters a campaka tree
He considers vanity futility insubstantiality dependency and placelessness yet
What is skill in examining phenomena It is distinguishing the skandhas dhātus and āyatanas
Some are frightened by the path of action associated with the ten nonvirtues and instead relish the experience of the ten qualities of nomoretraining
They accomplish the benefit of Innumerable countless beings
promising to liberate all beings who are confined to the wilds of cyclic existence
Turn away from or disparage the hidden points
I shall apply myself to make the alms of all the land fruitful
Once the guardians of the world in the four quarters Heard the Buddhas speech
Consider noble son the analogy of the earth that is the ground containing all seeds
They will utter praises of correct conduct But will have no interest in correct conduct
Similarly Subhūti great bodhisattva beings should themselves cultivate the emptiness of internal phenomena
one will obtain inexhaustible wealth
Senior Subhūti if the meditative stabilities and the bodhisattvas are not distinct from one another and if the meditative stabilities are themselves the bodhisattvas and the bodhisattvas are themselves the meditative stabilities and if both the meditative stabilities and the bodhisattvas are the transcendent perfection of wisdom
king of gods The Tathāgata rejoices in your good words
What is meant by engagement in neutral acts
Let us go to the meal Let us proceed to your home xxx
That will be a very difficult task
For so long he has been acquiring increasingly superior roots of virtue so he is the One with Arched Feet
Whoever knows their names and families
What is the path It is the knowledge of impermanence suffering emptiness and selflessness
when they do not make assumptions on account of omniscience and so forth
The flowers scattered by the devas Were strewn on the ground as divine flowers 
Without striving means not to grasp at any dharma
 You who are wise who are the eyes and path for the world You who are a trustworthy holder of my Dharma
It further entails absorption in the four meditative concentrations experiencing all things nonconceptually without relishing the bliss of meditative concentration
This is known as middling dullness
mastery of the mind as one comprehends and enters an ineffable number of ineffable absorptions
In some direction it sees the bloodspattered land of the denizens of hell and then develops attachment toward it
worshiped him by scattering a rain of celestial flowers and sandalwood powder and playing divine cymbals and drums
Because of their compassion for beings and in order to cause beings who have wrong views to be dedicated to the true view
Convey these words of mine to kāśagarbha the one of great compassion
or According to this teaching there is no karmic maturation of either good or bad actions
If the Blessed One was about to foretell actions of the future the rays of light would fade into the space before the Blessed One
Wishing for the state of akra they would then offer gifts and make merits
Now imagine that the combined merit of all those beings who are thus universal emperors becomes the possession of each one of them individually so that they all become great universal emperors
Having been born therein
It is the Great Vehicle and the great armor that constitute the maturity of the bodhisattvas
Laziness makes them fall ill
The mahoragas laud it The bodhisattvas meditate on it
In this regard entities are empty of entities
if they have not misconstrued the fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas
My very sweet words were beloved by many And all beings never had enough of looking at me 
Who only think thoughts about food Carry loads and are beaten by sticks and whips
 Then speak it the sage answered
In those beings who are blinded by darkness clouded vision and the cataract of ignorance he will engender the eye of insight
and they authentically manifest the great happiness of liberation To teach correctly to uphold to investigate and to understand such sūtras
 considering all elements to be present in yellowness
Giving a woman fragrant white flowers incanted with this mantra will enthrall her
They are unequaled in benefiting beings And they are established in omniscience 
Will lack understanding will be dishonest and arrogant And will believe they have attainment when they do not
You will have to spend the rest of your life away from human pleasures
As such when he took his first seven steps he had already attained the state of reality
They should not abide in the space element They should not abide in the consciousness element They should not abide in fundamental ignorance and they should not abide in the other links of dependent origination up to and including aging and death
In case of a dispute one will be able to paralyze the mouth of ones opponent
it is the state of accomplishing the field of activity that is the performance of the conduct of mindfulness understanding comprehension conscience and stability
Divine son ultimately the acts with immediate consequence do not truly exist and do not have any substance It is on them that I base myself without basing myself
and speaking without loss of confidence
In his final existence a bodhisattva must be conceived in the womb of a woman with all of these excellent qualities
a mental feeling
O Blessed One I therefore take refuge in Lord Buddha four times five times ten times fifty times a hundred times or rather many hundreds of thousands of times
Once the body has been formed consciousness is not located in the limbs or any other body part
To him I would have explained this Dharma for the first time and he would not have turned against me
who brings the city of the pretas to an end
Such phenomena are worthless void of no essence
Subhūti if you ask what constitutes the refinement of the extrasensory power realizing knowledge of the cessation of contaminants which great bodhisattva beings have
Although all things are indeed equal to space
Similarly are the immeasurable aspirations and the formless absorptions also nonconceptual
Residing and flourishing in that realm he also teaches the Dharma
He who has done some wrong May curb it through virtue To bring light to this life
Why should the nāgas pay homage to it Because it destroys all habitual tendencies
It is to be welcoming It is to be without laziness
What is the cessation of suffering
Allowing going forth begins with the postulant going for refuge
Even when for example the roar of the king of elephants or the king of beasts is heard the earth remains unafraid utterly and completely unafraid
At that time Brother nanda thought
Alas When I have attained manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment in this buddhafield
like a wishfulfilling jewel for those on the tenth ground
We have heard the innumerable verses on the benefits of the qualities from the Bhagavān
These sentient beings will easily be freed from grasping at that which does not exist
it is because Senior āradvatīputra the transcendent perfection of wisdom the meditative stabilities and great bodhisattva beings are not distinct from one another
Just as the transcendent perfection of generosity will emerge in the world
the seed of consciousness filled with appetite produces the sprout of name and form within whichever mothers womb one will take rebirth through
And a great deal of money and slaves
Instead many delightful sounds were heard
That is to say although bodies that are not meritorious result amongst hell beings or in the animal state or in the world of the Lord of Death or among the demigods
Rather they lack the establishment of the fruit of entering the stream and so on up to and including unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
Hey friend The vajra makes the lotus swell and bloom
and similarly they do not entertain any other such thoughts up to and including the plethora of mistaken views they are never conceived within a mothers womb and they will invariably be born miraculously
Reverend what is it that Saṅgharakṣita has done
The Bhagavān thought I shall perform a miracle so that the youth Candraprabha will attain skill in the realization of the inconceivable Dharma of the Buddha
without these conditions it does not come into being
they abandon all involuntary reincarnation through propensities
Yet whereas a flood of water harms sentient beings the flooding caused by bodhisattvas does not
Though one were to describe the benefits of the ten strengths Throughout countless endless millions of eons
and through the cessation of aging and death sorrow lamentation suffering
āradvatīputra the ten powers of the tathāgatas are merely conceptualized
Plunder from the buddhas and enjoy sublime celestial girls
Alas my dear one with shoulders so well formed With a waist like a bow legs like a deer and rounded hips
and all those up to and including feelings conditioned by sensory contact that is mentally compounded are empty of notions of I and mine
However if that person does not relinquish their remorse
Whether in dreams or during waking hours in all these ways the skillful one teaches the path directly and with straightforward methods
How could bodhisattvas become anything other than the real nature of physical forms
he was still struggling to learn his letters
They think How can I cause all these sentient beings to find definite release through the Buddhas teachings
Divine son ultimately all phenomena are utterly unborn
How then do they serve the Saṅgha
They then approached the place where Lord ākyamuni was seated prostrated their heads at the feet of the Blessed One and took their place to one side
Similarly this mind of the bodhisattvas is unattached to feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness
Some had just one leg while others had up to one hundred thousand
 a completely pure motivation and  the wish to receive the Dharma
His father made him study all fields of knowledge
and similarly the fruit of entering the stream is still discerned as indeed are the fruits of being tied to one more rebirth of no longer being subject to rebirth of arhatship of individual enlightenment and of the tathāgatas arhats genuinely perfect buddhas
and he circumambulated the Blessed One three times
Jayamati a faithful man or woman of a good family
What you may wonder does the bodhisattvas skill in protecting sentient beings consist in
Mahāsthāmaprāpta in that way one after another there appeared two million quintillion tathāgatas arhats perfectly enlightened buddhas named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja in the world realm Mahāsaṃbhavā
You have fulfilled here your excellent intention
Venerable Lord it is because dependent on those great bodhisattva beings rebirths among the denizens of the hells will be cut off
he sees that his mind is refined such that his outlook is heightened
and  emptiness of the essential nature of nonentities
because it adheres to the bodily elements

If it has fallen on the utpala it is the development of insight that should be studied
the faculties endowed with the knowledge of all things
Since they do not progress through faith even in the tathāgatas
acquire the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration
With the exception of a thusgone one a bodhisattva who dwells at the sublime seat of awakening
Similarly they apprehend the applications of mindfulness and develop a view of the applications of mindfulness in an apprehending manner

Mañjuśrī should you wonder whether at that time the monk Vīradatta was someone else you will not find it so
That is the teaching of supreme wisdom From having true correct knowledge

He seemed to eat and drink yet always took nourishment from the taste of meditation
Similarly feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are empty of their own essential nature
but noble son I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit through that alms giving
when the north was up the south was down
And because they fail to comprehend reality they continue to roam through cyclic existence like a swirling firebrand
tWhile bodhisattvas engage in every type of conduct they should not be tainted by that conduct
twelve thousand bodhisattvas accepted that phenomena are nonarising
Who has trained in this restraint of the body 
And your vast rejoicing in compassion and equanimity
the five hundred merchants were securing their wares when they saw Saṅgharakṣita and exclaimed

wish to enter the great wilderness of cyclic existence Thus as they seek to lead everyone into the city of omniscience
The perfection of giving becomes thus fulfilled There is no doubt
Novice we have quite a bit of grain to grind in the mortar
The Buddhas words are unsurpassable There is nothing higher than the Buddhas words

You should know those who do not entertain genuine realization to be the evil associates of great bodhisattva beings
the presence of conditioned elements in unconditioned elements is without foundation

They let their nails hair and beard grow long
The gatekeeper returned from the kings quarters and told the sage Asita to enter the palace
Young man as the bodhisattva mahāsattva Kṣemadattas right hand burned brightly
Monks while the Bodhisattva remained in this way among his retinue of consorts he matured  women along with many hundreds of thousands of assembled gods for the attainment of unexcelled and perfect awakening
And I awoke them to the path to enlightenment For which they had endless devotion

In this way Subhūti great bodhisattva beings should gather the fortytwo syllables in a single syllable
Their desire will be like the flames of a fire They will give teachings to laypeople
Madhura and the gandharva Madhurasvaratogether with a retinue of many trillions of gandharvas
Young man those four the tathāgatas inconceivably numerous appellations

He proceeds in order to perfectly accomplish the ten powers the fourfold fearlessness and the eighteen unique qualities of a buddha
so long will they commit it to writing or have it committed to writing
pick a lock rob at knifepoint
Formations are the causal condition of consciousness
and the knowledge of what are proscribed transgressions and what are not proscribed transgressions
The Licchavi Vimalakīrti addressed that incarnated bodhisattva
they sat in that place with veneration and with respect while the youth Candraprabha kneeling on his right knee with palms placed together
someone to make food offerings to us when we have died
That is called the emptiness of inherent existence

What is it like How is it poor
Those arrogant bhikṣus bhikṣunīs upāsakas and upāsikās to whom he had previously said I am not ridiculing you and who gave him the name Sadāparibhūta

They are human white lotuses They are human tamers They are human moons
Desire is ephemeral like dew on the tip of grass or like autumn clouds
Her nose is well formed with a beautiful complexion
some he gives after piercing a point on the body with a needle

with lightning for lamps and a surrounding railing made of gems and jewels
Then through the reversal of dependent origination they should be attentive to the cessation of the entire great mass of suffering
The blessings should be transferred gradually While confidence should be produced immediately
Monks indeed the very moment that the Bodhisattva attained omniscience all beings throughout all the worlds in the ten directions instantly became ecstatic
this knowledge holder should for the sake of the desired accomplishments enter meditation and recite the mantra one hundred thousand times for each of its syllables
This is the time when the BlissGone One attains immortality
These qualities can also be characterized as their signs marks qualities or benefits

And having the infinite awareness of the sugatas wisdom Are distinctive qualities of the first patience 
Those who turn their minds to this king of the sūtras will have happiness in this world

if he were similarly to exhibit himself entering the stream or being tied to one more rebirth or no longer being subject to rebirth or as an arhat or pratyekabuddha or
after twenty thousand eons had passed
How would they treat me if I were to provide them with all the supplies they need
Bhagavat how can I see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara
There are two reasons the bodhisattvas who do aspire to the profound Dharma hurt themselves and do not attain the tolerance of the ultimate birthlessness of things

You know nirvāṇa to be unmoving in the three times
the emptiness of emptiness the emptiness of great extent
laziness
Who possesses supreme faith and diligence
the bodhisattva great being Nityodyukta
The yoginīs are said to be of five types Corresponding to the five colors
All those beings sustained themselves on the joy of concentration and the joy of the Dharma and in that buddha realm there was no gross type of food
no passing away
the saṅgha of bodhisattvas and the saṅgha of bhikṣus received greatly renowned gifts and honors
One should learn the oral tradition
Son of noble family some people can comprehend the extent of space but noone can comprehend the extent of this noble sons methods and primordial wisdom of his great love and great compassion the extent to which he has developed the strength of meditative concentration and brings beings to complete maturation
whatever illusory display is desired
On the ninth ground their bodies pervade infinitely and so they attain the body that is equal to space
and similarly refine feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness
However Mañjuśrī the Tathāgata does not form mental constructs or concepts
Moreover āradvatīputra the spiritual mentors to great bodhisattva beings having taught the doctrine so that the bodhisattvas might cultivate the applications of mindfulness
Similarly O gods this doctrine is profound owing to the profundity of the transcendent perfection of generosity the transcendent perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent perfection of tolerance the transcendent perfection of perseverance the transcendent perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent perfection of wisdom
He is the one with the rumbling voice of a thundercloud of the nāga king Sāgara
I did not teach these faults
Mañjuśrī the Tathāgata does not think This sentient being has belief in the perfection of wisdom so for him I shall make a speech related to the perfection of wisdom
His students join their palms and the gods all venerate him
Their minds are unpolluted They have forsaken all carelessness They are great beings who are always careful
He truly observes that while all phenomena are the same as the limit of reality
When does a conception arise For whom does the conception appear
Venerable Lord Who are they

In the center of the four neuter letters and two a syllables
He put on his lower robe picked up his Dharma robe and alms bowl
All ninetyone of whom are called Indra Especially protect you With health and wellbeing
Subhūti it is so
Seeking this peace this supreme samādhi I have in the past given away beautifully adorned Villages towns regions and market towns
If you Lion among Men do not consecrate the entire trichiliocosm
or find any other appropriate shelter from the saṅgha or a person you may also accept that provided you take its proper measure
There is faultless realization of peace For the one who practices this samādhi 
the sūtras the sayings in prose and verse the prophetic declarations the verses the aphorisms the contexts the quotations the tales of past lives the narratives
Once all his conceptions are eliminated This entire world is shaken 
fire by heat
those who are not yet assured may receive assurance
Gopā one should never shed tears over people Who do such excellent deeds
They stop playing their percussion instruments and halt their singing
who have not developed the roots of virtue under the guidance of the buddhas bodhisattvas and śrāvakas

I remember countless innumerable eons ago There was a jina named Svarāṅgaghoṣa
These two will become my disciples my foremost and noblest pair

then householder please give me these goddesses
If the support and material riches that were destined for the bhikṣus who diligently practice relinquishment are offered to the bhikṣus exerting themselves in recitation at this point then both actions become root transgressions
You should also remember it as The Arising of the Intention of Enlightenment
rāḍa Kālāma died just three days ago The ThusGone One then thought
and was adept in the fourfold path of Brahmā great love great compassion great joy and great equanimity With great awareness he was free of obscurations and had manifested the vision of wisdom free from attachment
Moreover they may also teach them so as to provide a remedy for the arising of afflictions in bodhisattvas who have just recently entered the vehicle
Either those two young brahmins are fools or theyre unflappable
In the same vein why do you say that these same designations made with respect to feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness up to and including their designation as entities or nonentities do not constitute a bodhisattva
When I see him meditating with a torchlike luster
the manifestations of beings would utterly collapse
Those who have not learned this profundity How can they teach the Dharma
and their faith in the Three Jewels deepened
They will recite the praises of the Tathāgatas śrāvakas
In buddhahood they will teach the Dharma Through teaching this single yāna 
He lived at home but remained aloof from the realm of desire the realm of pure matter and the immaterial realm
While an image is seen in the entire world
He accumulated the splendors of hundreds of virtues and qualities
we did not know it we did not understand it
and one achieves and abides in the sense field of nothingatall
Matter itself is void
Senior āradvatīputra bodhisattvas do not engage in the practice of austerity with the perception of hardship
That would be impossible
Then the Blessed One decreed In the light of this monks should not allow debtors going forth
 correct recollection and
They believe they have crossed
Their bodies will have an aroma like gośīrṣa sandalwood
It is the entering into the realm of the buddhas It is understood by noble beings and realized by solitary buddhas
who practice according to other sūtras apart from the transcendent perfection of wisdom for an eon or longer than an eon
My Lord there is this prophecy and it cannot be denied
Translated and edited by the Indian master Dīpaṃkaraśrījñāna and the translator monk Gewai Lodr
Mañjuśrī that root would be the transitory collection
He does not emulate anything other than the real nature of unconditioned phenomena
They are like the children in the parable who come out of the burning house because of their longing for a deerdrawn cart
And the gods of the earth
Thus without any doubts or reservations about this point they trust in the secret of the thusgone ones speech
they do not associate with avarice in order to desist from avarice
In the disturbed era of destruction The dreadful time of great fear
Why is that
who brings freedom from fear to all beings
And because he was aware of their previous intent to set out toward awakening
Those who are of the nature of all things And whose minds know everything
The one who praises those dharmabhāṇakas Will obtain a supremely greater amount of merit
with great compassion I now teach the Dharma to such sentient beings
generosity dedicated to awakening and
I have concocted ink from my own blood
He is a lamp for those in darkness
The monk matricide then told his wards
His mother then struck him too prompting the lad to think
How should they cultivate those fruitional attributes up to and including the eighteen distinct qualities of the buddhas
Protector of the World your resolve is firm You will not move from the seat of awakening
So it is that they should not dwell on physical forms and they should not dwell on anything at all up to and including genuinely perfect buddhahood
Do not fall behind them
Moreover Subhūti any aggregate of ethical discipline that is impure
Are praised by hundreds of thousands of devas And hundreds of thousands of Brahmās pay homage to you 
He thought
with calm senses physically at ease resplendent without attachment free from anger and without delusion
those born as animals
He is overjoyed and comes to his balcony
They will overcome all harm
I pray that you free me from this inferior female body of a woman
Some jumped in front of him and some attacked him from behind
Bodhisattvas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges Were all revealed by that light ray
They completely lose interest in gain fame and acquisitions
Therefore Bhagavān even though we have taught and instructed other bodhisattvas in the highest complete enlightenment
Since material objects do not really exist
When observing the ascetic practices trainings disciplines and all the commitments they are free from evil
that they do not cognize feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness as consciousness and the rest
all other phenomena causal and fruitional attributes and attainments up to and including omniscience are empty of their own essential nature
When that blessed thusgone worthy perfect buddha Arisen from Flowers had delivered this teaching concerning sentient beings King Attainment of Victory cut off his hair and beard His son as well as Queen Ratnaśrī and the retinue of queens and servants likewise all cut off their hair and they all took ordination with the Blessed One
Even that would never be able to repay your kindness
King Jñānabala with his harem sons daughters and attendants on learning that the bhikṣu was ill wept and shed tears
 If attachment develops That friendliness is a great kleśa
They are freed from the three lower realms
May they all protect you
and the rest of the twenty thousand devas
the three gateways to liberation and in the same vein
From now on please do not sit on grass on the ground Your body is so young and fresh
Kāśyapa I have made this parable so that its meaning can be understood Its meaning should be seen in this way
The Buddhas śrāvakas who maintain The miraculous powers they have cultivated
I should honor venerate respect make offerings to and rely upon the sacred doctrine which is calm abundant and through which manifestly perfect buddhahood is attained
Mahāmaudgalyāyana supreme among those with great miraculous powers and great magical abilities
Thus in all regards extremely revered it is characterized by accomplishing all the objectives of all beings
For beings swift accomplishment
Then hundreds of thousands of gods and humans let out hundreds of thousands of exclamations of shock and cries of joy
while the rest will be revealed at length if you converse with chat with and question
Because they know the subtle nature of phenomena
Your praise for this lone person Is without any bounds
and saw Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara there
Noble son the thusgone ones see sentient beings with their miraculous eyes and not with the eyes of humans
Venerable Lord Since all things are undifferentiated how are things established as virtuous or nonvirtuous specified or unspecified
The Blessed One said
They who possess this supreme samādhi Always examine themselves
Beholding these colored powders The buddhas are thoroughly delighted
Those śrāvakas of the Guide who in this way Have heard this teaching of mine
 Their body is firm like that of Nārāyaṇa  Their kneecaps are elegant
The meaning of dependent arising is the meaning of the Dharma
He can inhale all the hurricanes of the cosmic windatmospheres of the ten directions into his mouth without harming his own body and
Noble son the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has given permission for the sixsyllable queen of mahāvidyās to be given to you
Such a person would indeed have difficulty in doing that
and the space within a precious vessel are both the element of space
King Yama will say
When they step on the earth they raise no dust
I will be a perfect being a sublime physician who cures old age and death
Even though the girls had already experienced the deeds of the Bodhisattva and the power of the ThusGone One out of their fickleness they did not listen to their fathers words
Follow their example bodhisattvas In order to protect millions of beings 
Because they know the subtle nature of phenomena They will never hear an unpleasant sound
The king replied Very well then do it
to be weak in altruism and
The Tathāgata does not teach the Dharma by means of sound and language
Likewise the transcendent perfection of generosity does not apprehend the limit of future time nor the present
Furthermore noble sons in order to accomplish the store of merit a bodhisattva does not rest in the uncompounded and
They will have anger and they will have hate Their thoughts will be on homes and wealth
like the descent of a nonreturner into a womb
nor is it to be apprehended between the two
Indeed son of noble family
As an analogy although many forms might appear and disappear in a wellpolished mirror
Similarly imbued with renunciation dwelling in solitude maintaining detachment and remaining in a state of cessation they should cultivate the supports for miraculous ability combining the meditative stability of perseverance the meditative stability of mind and the meditative stability of scrutiny with the formative force of exertion
Sitting crosslegged On bare ground
when I was teaching the Dharma to some young monks in the great forest the Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and said to me
We will bathe on the banks of the river
They abide in the abode of the nonduality of the conditioned and the unconditioned
This noble man is going to go to the Bodhimaṇḍa
Furthermore it is instructive because physical forms are unseen
Those beings who are attached to forms Are overcome by unrestrained desires 
They will not delight in the Lokāyatas
It has no coming
Great bodhisattva leaders similarly can never gather enough of the wealth of Dharma
likewise they do not consider whether feelings perceptions formative predispositions and consciousness are empty or not empty
They play with illusory manifestations In order to develop living beings Showing themselves to be old or sick And even manifesting their own deaths
At that moment the bodhisattva mahāsattva Liberator from Fear entered the samādhi called the exalted wisdom mudrā of the tathāgatas the entrance gate to the domain of all buddhas
The monk Stainless Light was too ashamed to be able to speak to the Bhagavān
The six seedsyllables are in the six corners
The water element the fire element the wind element the space element and the element of consciousness do not come from anywhere
In this manner the king appointed to the highest rank of the ruling class comes to possess the precious wheel
What do you think Chanda
and the path is easy he perfectly accomplished supreme perfect enlightenment
This Dharma teaching will bring benefit and happiness to many beings
Great King an uḍumbara flower sometimes though rarely blooms in the world
 It is the complete wisdom of buddhahood It is what the wise bodhisattva seeks
Lastly the Bhagavān said to that complete saṅgha of bhikṣus
