The subchapter on containing living beingsThe training rule on AriṭṭhaAt one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time the monk Ariṭṭha the exvulturekiller had the following bad and erroneous viewAs I understand the Teaching of the Buddha the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in themA number of monks heardthat Ariṭṭha had that viewThey went to him and askedIs it true Ariṭṭhathat you have such a viewYes indeed As I understand the Buddhas Teaching the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in themNo Ariṭṭha dont misrepresent the Buddha for its not good to misrepresent himThe Buddha would never say such a thingThe Buddha has given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in themThe Buddha has said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures but much suffering and much trouble and that the danger in them is greaterThe Buddha has said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton similar to a piece of meat similar to a grass torch similar to a pit of coals similar to a dream similar to borrowed goods similar to fruits on a tree similar to a knife and chopping block similar to swords and stakes similar to a snakes head they are much suffering and much trouble and the danger in them is greaterBut even though the monks corrected Ariṭṭha like this he stubbornly held on to that bad and erroneous view and continued to insist on itSince they were unable to make him give up that view they went to the Buddha and told him what had happenedSoon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned AriṭṭhaIs it true Ariṭṭha that you have such a viewYes indeed SirFoolish man whom do you think I have taught like thisHavent I given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in themI have said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures but much suffering and much trouble and that the danger in them is greaterI have said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton similar to a piece of meat similar to a grass torch similar to a pit of coals similar to a dream similar to borrowed goods similar to fruits on a tree similar to a knife and chopping block similar to swords and stakes similar to a snakes head they are much suffering and much trouble and the danger in them is greaterAnd yet foolish man by misunderstanding you have misrepresented me hurt yourself and made much demeritThis will be for your longlasting harm and sufferingThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk saysAs I understand the Buddhas Teaching the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in themthen the monks should correct him like thisNo Venerable dont misrepresent the Buddha for its not good to misrepresent the Buddha The Buddha would never say such a thingIn many discourses the Buddha has declared the obstructive things to be obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in themIf that monk continues as before the monks should press him up to three times to make him give up that viewIf he then gives it up all is wellIf he does not he commits an offense entailing confession The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this caseAs I understand the Buddhas Teaching the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in themthe monk who speaks in that wayThe monksother

all is wellIf he does not he commits an offense of wrong conductIf those who heard about it do not say anything they commit an offense of wrong conductThat monk even if he has to be pulled into the Sangha should be corrected like thisNo Venerable dont misrepresent the Buddha for its not good to misrepresent the Buddha The Buddha would never say such a thingIn many discourses the Buddha has declared the obstructive things to be obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in themAnd they should correct him a secondand a third timeIf he gives up that view all is wellIf he does not he commits an offense of wrong conductHe should then be pressedAnd monks he should be pressed like thisA competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to

rule the training rule on teaching is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing confessionThe subchapter on containing living beingsThe training rule on less than twenty years oldAt one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuaryAt that time in Rājagaha there was a group of seventeen boys who were friendswith the boy Upāli as their leaderUpālis parents consideredHow can we ensure that Upāli is able to live happily without exhausting himself after weve passed awayHe could become a scribebut then his fingers will hurtOr he could become an accountantbut then his chest will hurtOr he could become a money changerbut then his eyes will hurtBut these Sakyan ascetics have pleasant habits and a happy life After eating nice food they sleep in beds sheltered from the windIf Upāli goes forth with them hell be able to live happily without exhausting himself after weve passed awayUpāli overheard this conversation between his parentsHe then went to the other boys and saidCome lets go forth with the Sakyan asceticsIf you go forth so will weAnd the boys went each to his own parents and saidPlease allow me to go forth from home to homelessnessSince the parents knew that the boys all had the same desire and good intention they gave their approvalThe boys then went to the monks and asked for the going forthAnd the monks gave them both the going forth and the full ordinationSoon afterwards they got up early in the morning and criedGive us rice porridge give a meal give nonstaplesThe monks saidWait until it gets lightIf any of those things becomes available youll be able to have itIf not youll have to wait until youve walked for almsBut they carried on as beforeAnd they defecated and urinated on the furnitureAfter rising early in the morning the Buddha heard the sound of those boysHe asked Venerable nanda what was going onand nanda told himSoon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that monks give the full ordination to people they know are less than twenty years oldIts true SirThe Buddha criticized them How can those foolish men do thisA person who is less than twenty years old is unable to endure cold and heat hunger and thirst horseflies mosquitoes wind and the burning sun creeping animals and insects and rude and unwelcome speech And they are unable to bear up with bodily feelings that are painful severe sharp and destructive of lifeBut a person whos twenty years old is able to endure these thingsThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk gives the full ordination to a person he knows is less than twenty years old he commits an offense entailing confession Moreover that person has not received the full ordination and those monks are blameworthy The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this casehe knows by himself or others have told him or the candidate has told himLess than twenty years oldwho has not reached twenty yearsIf intending to give the full ordination he searches for a group a teacher a bowl or a robe or he establishes a monastic boundary he commits an offense of wrong conductAfter the motion he commits an offense of wrong conductAfter each of the first two announcements he commits an offense of wrong conductWhen the last announcement is finished the preceptor commits an offense entailing confessionwhile the group and the teacher commit an offense of wrong conductIf the other person is less than twenty years old and he perceives them as less and he gives them the full ordination he commits an offense entailing confessionIf the other person is less than twenty years old but he is unsure of it and he gives them the full ordination he commits an offense of wrong conductIf the other person is less than twenty years old but he perceives them as more and he gives them the full ordination there is no offenseIf the other person is more than twenty years old but he perceives them as less he commits an offense of wrong conductIf the other person is more than twenty years old but he is unsure of it he

offenderThe fifth rule the training rule on less than twenty years old is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing confessionThe subchapter on containing living beingsThe training rule on KaṇṭakaAt one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time the novice monastic Kaṇṭaka had the following bad and erroneous viewAs I understand the teachings of the Buddha the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in themA number of monks heard that the novice monastic Kaṇṭaka had that viewThey went to him and askedIs it true Kaṇṭaka that you have such a viewYes indeed As I understand the Buddhas Teaching the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in themNo Kaṇṭaka dont misrepresent the Buddha for its not good to misrepresent himThe Buddha would never say such a thingThe Buddha has given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in themThe Buddha has said that theres little enjoyment in worldly pleasures but much suffering and much trouble and that the danger in them is greater  But even though the monks corrected Kaṇṭaka like this he stubbornly held on to that bad and erroneous view and he continued to insist on itSince those monks were unable to make him give up that view they went to the Buddha and told him what had happenedSoon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the KaṇṭakaIs it true Kaṇṭaka that you have such a viewYes indeed Venerable SirFoolish man whom do you think I have taught like thisHavent I given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in themI have said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures but much suffering and much trouble and that the danger in them is greaterI have said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton similar to a snakes head they are much suffering and much trouble and the danger in them is greaterAnd yet foolish man by misunderstanding you have misrepresented me hurt yourself and made much demeritThis will be for your longlasting harm and sufferingThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their mindsHaving rebuked him the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksWell then monks the Sangha should expel the novice monastic KaṇṭakaAnd this is how he should be expelledFrom today Kaṇṭaka you may not refer to the Buddha as your teacherAnd you can no longer share a sleeping place with the monks for two or three nights as can other novicesGo Away with youThe Sangha then expelled KaṇṭakaSoon afterwards the monks from the group of six supported Kaṇṭaka and they were attended on by him lived with him and shared a sleeping place with him Yet they knew that he had been expelledThe monks of few desires complained and criticized those monksHow can the monks from the group of six support Kaṇṭaka and be attended on by him live with him and share a sleeping place with him even though they know that he has been expelled Is it true monks that you do thisIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked them Foolish men how can you do thisThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisAlso if a novice monastic saysAs I understand the Buddhas Teaching the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in themthen the monks should correct him like thisNo dont misrepresent the Buddha for its not good to misrepresent the Buddha The Buddha would never say such a thingIn many discourses the Buddha has declared the obstructive things to be obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in themIf that novice monastic continues as before he should be toldFrom today on you may not refer to the Buddha as your teacherAnd you can no

Ill be going thereYes sir While cleaning the park he saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a treeHe then went to King Pasenadi and said The park is clean sir but the Buddha is sitting thereMarvellous Ill visit himThe King went to the park and approached the Buddha but just then a lay follower was seated thereWhen the King saw him he became fearful and stoppedBut he considered This man isnt likely to be bad since hes visiting the Buddha and so he approached the Buddha bowed and sat downBut when that lay follower because of his respect for the Buddha neither bowed down to the King nor stood up for him the King became annoyedThe Buddha realized what was happening and said to the King Great King this lay follower is learned a master of the tradition and hes free from sensual desireThe King thought This lay follower doesnt deserve to be in an inferior position since even the Buddha praises himAnd he said to that lay follower Please say what you wantThank you sirThe Buddha then instructed inspired and gladdened King Pasenadi with a teaching after which the King got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and leftSoon afterwards King Pasenadi was up in his best stilt house when he saw that lay follower walking along the street holding a sunshadeHe summoned him and said You are a learned Buddhist a master of the traditionIt would be good if you would teach my haremWhatever I know sir I know because of the monks They should teach the haremKnowing that the lay follower was right the King went to the Buddha bowed sat down and saidIt would be good Venerable Sir if you would tell a monk to teach my haremThe Buddha then instructed inspired and gladdened King Pasenadi with a teaching after which the King got up from his seat paid his respects as before and leftSoon afterwards the Buddha said to Venerable nanda Well then nanda teach the Kings haremYes Sir And from time to time he would enter the harem and teachThen after robing up one the morning nanda took his bowl and robe and went to King Pasenadis houseOn that occasion the King was in bed with Queen MallikāThe Queen saw nanda coming and she quickly got up but her burnished golden dressing gown fell offnanda turned around right there and returned to the monastery And he told the monks what had happenedThe monks of few desires complained and criticized himHow could Venerable nanda enter the royal compound without first being announced Is it true nanda that you did thisIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked him nanda how can you do thisThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it Having rebuked him the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksMonks there are these ten dangers in entering a royal compoundIt may be that a monk enters where the king is sitting with his queenThe queen smiles when she sees the monkor the monk smiles when he sees the queenThe king thinksSurely theyve done it or theyre going toAgain because the king is very

Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing confessionThe subchapter on lyingThe training rule on the same sleeping placeAt one time the Buddha was staying at ḷavī at the Aggāḷava ShrineAt that time the lay followers were going to the monastery to listen to the TeachingWhen the instruction was over the senior monks went to their own dwellingsbut the newly ordained monks lay down right there in the assembly hall together with the lay followersabsentminded heedless naked muttering and snoringThe lay followers complained and criticized themHow can the venerables lay down absentminded heedless naked muttering and snoringThe monks heard the complaints of those lay followersand the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monksHow can those monks lay down in the same sleeping place as people who are not fully ordainedAfter rebuking those newly ordained monks in many ways they told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that monks do thisIts true SirThe Buddha criticized them How can those foolish men lay down in the same sleeping place as people who are not fully ordainedThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk lay down in the same sleeping place as a person who is not fully ordained he commits an offense entailing confessionIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksAfter staying at ḷavī for as long as he wanted the Buddha set out wandering toward KosambīWhen he eventually arrived at Kosambī he stayed at the Badarikā MonasteryJust then the monks said to Venerable RāhulaRāhula the Buddha has laid down a training rule that we cant lay down in the same sleeping place as a person whos not fully ordainedPlease find another sleeping placeSince Rāhula was not able to get a sleeping place he lay down in the restroomThen after rising early in the morning the Buddha went to the restroom where he cleared his throatRāhula too cleared his throatWhos thereIts me Sir RāhulaWhy are you sitting here RāhulaRāhula told the Buddha what had happenedSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksMonks I allow you to lay down in the same sleeping place as a person who isnt fully ordained for two or three nightsAnd so monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk lay down more than two or three nights in the same sleeping place as a person who is not fully ordained he commits an offense entailing confession The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this caseA person who is not fully ordainedanyone except a fully ordained monkmore than two or three nightsin excess of two or three nightsfully roofed fully walled mostly roofed mostly walledLays down in the same sleeping placeat dawn on the fourth day if he lies down when the person who is not fully ordained is already lying down he commits an offense entailing confessionif the person who is not fully ordained lies down when he is already lying down he commits an offense entailing confessionif they both lie down together he commits an offense entailing confessionevery time they get up and then lie down again he commits an offense entailing confessionIf someone is not fully ordained and the monk does not perceive him as such and he lays down more than two or three nights in the same sleeping place as him he commits an offense entailing confessionIf someone is not fully ordained but the monk is unsure of it and he lays down more than two or three nights in the same sleeping place as him he commits an offense entailing confessionIf someone is not fully ordained but the monk perceives him as such and he lays down more than two or three nights in the same sleeping place as him he commits an offense entailing confessionIf it is halfroofed and halfwalled he commits an offense of wrong conductIf someone is fully ordained but the monk does not perceive him as such he commits an offense of wrong conductIf someone is fully ordained but the monk is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conductIf someone is fully ordained and the monk perceives him as such there is no offenseif he stays together for two or three nightif he stays together for less than two or three nightsif after staying together for two nights he leaves before dawn on the third night and then stays together againif it is fully roofed but not walledif it is fully walled but not roofedif it is mostly not roofedif it is mostly not walledif the monk sits when the person who is not fully ordained is lying downif the person who is not fully ordained sits when the monk is lying downif they both sitif he is insaneif he is the first offenderThe fifth rule the training rule on the same sleeping place is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe monks rules and their analysisThe chapter on offenses entailing confessionThe subchapter on naked asceticsThe training rule on armies in actionOn one occasion when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryKing Pasenadi of Kosala was marching out with the armyand the monks from the group of six went to see the army in actionKing Pasenadi saw those monks comingand he summoned them and saidVenerables why have you come hereWe wish to see the great kingWhats the use of seeing me finding pleasure in battleShouldnt you see the BuddhaAnd people complained and criticized themHow can the Sakyan ascetics go to see an army in actionIts our misfortune that we must go out with the army for the sake of our livelihood and because of our wives and childrenThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleand the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monksHow can the monks from the group of six go to see an army in action Is it true monks that you did thisIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked them Foolish men how can you go to see an army in actionThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it And monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk goes to see an army in action he commits an offense entailing confessionIn this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monksSoon afterwards a certain monk had a sick uncle in the armyThe uncle sent a message to that monkIm with the army and Im sickPlease come VenerableI want you to comeKnowing that the Buddha had laid down a rule against going to see an army in action that monk thoughtI have an uncle in the army who is sickWhat should I doAnd he told the BuddhaSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksMonks I allow you to go to the army when theres a suitable reasonAnd so monks this training rule should be recited like thisIf a monk goes to see an army in action except if there is a suitable reason he commits an offense entailing confession The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to standthis sort of monk is meant in this caseAn army in actionit has left the inhabited area and is either encamped or marchingelephants horses chariots infantryEach elephant has twelve men each horse has three men each chariot has four men each unit of infantry has four men with arrows in handIf he is on his way to see it he commits an offense of wrong conductWherever he stands to see it he commits an offense entailing confessionEvery time he moves outside of the range of sight and then sees it again he commits an offense entailing confessionExcept if there is a suitable reasonunless there is a suitable reasonIf it is in action and he perceives it as such and he goes to see it except if there is a suitable reason he commits an offense entailing confessionIf it is in action but he is unsure of it and he goes to see it except if there is a suitable reason he commits an offense entailing confessionIf it is in action but he does not perceive it as such and he goes to see it except if there is a suitable reason he commits an offense entailing confessionIf he is on his way to see one division of a fourfold army he commits an offense of wrong conductWherever he stands to see it he commits an offense of wrong conductEvery time he moves outside of the range of sight and then sees it again he commits an offense of wrong conductIf it is not in action but he perceives it as such he commits an offense of wrong conductIf it is not in action but he is unsure of it he commits an offense of wrong conductIf it is not in action and he does not perceive it as such there is no offenseif he sees it while standing in the monasteryif the army comes to where the monk is standing sitting or lying downif he sees it while walking in the opposite directionif he has a suitable reasonif he is insaneif he is the first offenderThe eighth rule the training rule on armies in action is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe chapter on the invitation procedureAbiding in discomfortAt one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryAt that time in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country a number of monks who were friends had entered rainyseason residence togetherThey thoughtHow can we remain united and in harmony have a comfortable rains residence and get almsfood without troubleThen it occurred to themLets not talk to one anotherWhoever returns first from almsround in the village should prepare the seats and set out a footstool a footscraper and water for washing the feet He should clean the bowl for leftovers and set it out and put out water for drinking and water for washingWhoever returns last from almsround may eat whatever is leftover or he should discard it where there are no cultivated plants or in water without lifeHe should put away the seats and also the footstool the footscraper and the water for washing the feet He should clean the bowl for leftovers and put it away put away the water for drinking and the water for washing and sweep the dining hallWhoever sees that the pot for drinking water the pot for washing water or the waterpot in the restroom is empty should fill itIf he cant do it by himself he should call someone over by hand signal and they should fill it togetherHe should not speak because of thatIn this way well remain united and in harmony have a comfortable rains residence and get almsfood without troubleAnd they did just thatNow it was the custom for monks who had completed the rainyseason residence to go and visit the BuddhaSo when they had completed the rains residence and the three months had elapsed those monks put their dwellings in order took their bowls and robes and left for SāvatthīWhen they eventually arrived at Sāvatthī they went to the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery There they approached the Buddha bowed and sat downSince it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monksthe Buddha said to themI hope youre keeping well monks I hope youre comfortableI hope you have had a comfortable rains residence in concord and harmony without dispute and that you had no trouble getting almsfoodWere keeping well Venerable Sir were comfortableweve had a comfortable rains residence in concord and harmony without dispute and we had no trouble getting almsfoodWhen Buddhas know what is going on sometimes they ask and sometimes notthey know the right time to ask and the right time not to askBuddhas ask when it is beneficial not when it is unbeneficialfor Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficialBuddhas question the monks for two reasons to give a teaching or to lay down a training ruleAnd the Buddha said to those monks In what way monks did you have a comfortable rains residence without having any trouble getting almsfoodWhen they had told him the Buddha addressed the monksWhile they dwelt in discomfort these foolish men claim they were dwelling in comfortWhile they dwelt together like animals they claim they were dwelling in comfortWhile they dwelt together like sheep they claim they were dwelling in comfortWhile they dwelt together like enemies they claim they were dwelling in comfortHow can these foolish men take a vow of silence as do the ascetics of other religionsThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it  after criticizing them and giving a teaching he addressed the monksYou should not take a vow of silence as do the ascetics of other religionsIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductWhen you have completed the rainyseason residence you should invite the monks to correct you in regard to three thingswhat has been seen what has been heard or what is suspectedThis will help you live with one another in the proper way help you clear yourself of offenses and help you give priority to the trainingAnd you should do the invitation procedure like thisA competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenToday is the invitation procedureIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha it should do the invitation procedureThe most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder squat on his heels raise his joined palms and sayI invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen what you have heard and what you suspectPlease correct me Venerables out of compassionIf I see a fault I will make amendsFor the second time I invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen what you have heard and what you suspectPlease correct me Venerables out of compassionIf I see a fault I will make amendsFor the third time I invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen what you have heard and what you suspectPlease correct me Venerables out of compassionIf I see a fault I will make amendsA junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder squat on his heels raise his joined palms and sayI invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen what you have heard and what you suspectPlease correct me Venerables out of compassionIf I see a fault I will make amendsFor the second time I invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen what you have heard and what you suspect Please correct me Venerables out of compassion If I see a fault I will make amendsFor the third time I invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen what you have heard and what you suspectPlease correct me Venerables out of compassionIf I see a fault I will make amendsSoon afterwards the monks from the group of six remained seated while the senior monks were inviting correction squatting on their heelsThe monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow can the monks from the group of six act like thisThey told the Buddha He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that the monks from the group of six were acting like thisIts true SirThe Buddha criticized them How can those foolish men remain seated while the senior monks are inviting correction squatting on their heelsThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it  and after criticizing them he gave a teaching and addressed the monksYou should not remain seated while the senior monks are inviting correction squatting on their heelsIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductEveryone should squat on their heels during the invitation procedureOn one occasion while squatting on his heels and waiting for everyone to invite correction a senior monk who was weak from old age fainted and fell overThey told the Buddha and he saidYou should squat on your heels until you have invited correction Once you have invited you may sit downBreach of the invitation procedureAnd the monks thoughtHow many invitation days are thereThere are two invitation daysthe fourteenth and the fifteenthThe monks thoughtHow many invitation procedures are thereThere are these four invitation proceduresThe invitation procedure that is illegitimate and has an incomplete assemblyThe invitation procedure that is illegitimate but

anotherAt the invitation procedure when those monks have completed the rains residence well cancel their invitationThe monks who were friends heard about thisand thought What should we doThey told the Buddha and he saidIn such a caseI allow those monks to do two or three observanceday ceremonies on the fourteenthwith the aim of having their invitation procedure before the other monksIf those quarrelsome and argumentative monks are on their way to the other monastery the resident monks should gather quickly and do the invitation procedure When it has been done they should say to the other monksVenerables we have completed the invitation procedureplease do whatever you think is appropriateIf those quarrelsome and argumentative monks arrive without prior notice the resident monks should prepare seats and set out a footstool a footscraper and water for washing the feet They should then go out to meet those monks receive their bowl and robe and ask if they want water to drinkThen having distracted them they should go outside the monastic boundary and do the invitation procedure there When it has been done they should say to the other monksVenerables we have completed the invitation procedureplease do whatever you think is appropriateIf theyre able to do this its goodIf not then a resident monk who is competent and capable should inform the resident monksPlease

continue the invitation procedureAgreement about the invitation procedureOn one occasion in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country a number of monks who were friends had entered the rainyseason residence togetherWhile they were dwelling in unity and harmony they attained a certain pleasant state of meditationThey considered thisand thought If we do the invitation procedure now the monks might leave to go wanderingWe will then have lost this pleasant abidingWhat should we doThey told the Buddha and he saidIn such a caseI allow those monks to make an agreement about the invitation procedureAnd it should be made like thisEveryone should gather in one placeA competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenWhile dwelling in unity and harmony we have attained a certain pleasant state of meditationIf we do the invitation procedure now the monks might leave to go wanderingWe will then have lost this pleasant abidingIf it seems

by reciting the Monastic Code and we will do the invitation procedure on the day of Komudī the fourth full moon of the rainy seasonThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusIf when those monks have made an agreement about the invitation procedure a monk saysI wish to go wandering in the countryI have something to do there they should tell himThats fine but you have to do the invitation firstIf while that monk is doing the invitation he cancels the invitation of another monk the other monk should tell himYou have no authority over my invitation until I inviteIf while that monk is doing the invitation another monk cancels his invitation the monks should question and examine both and deal with them according to the ruleIt may be that that monk finishes his business in the country and returns to that monastery before the fullmoon day of Komudī If while the monks are doing the invitation procedure a monk cancels the invitation of the monk who has returned the monk who has returned should tell himYou have no authority over my invitationI have already completed itIf while the monks are doing the invitation procedure the monk who has returned cancels the invitation of another monk the monks should question and examine both and deal with them according to the rule The Sangha should then continue the invitation procedureThe fourth chapter on the

demotion banishment reconciliation and ejectionagainst monks who were absentThe monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow can the monks from the group of six do thisThey told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned themIs it true monks that the monks from the group of six are doing thisIts true SirThe Buddha criticized themIts not suitable for those foolish men its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be doneHow can they act like thisThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it after criticizing them

accept thisIf a legal issue is resolved like this it is resolved legitimately by resolution facetofaceThe group of nine on the bright side is finishedResolution through recollectionAt one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuaryAt that time Venerable Dabba the Mallian had realized perfection at the age of sevenHe had realized all there is to be realized by a discipleand had nothing further to doWhile he was in seclusion he reflected on thisand he thought How may I be of service to the SanghaPerhaps I could assign dwellings for the Sangha and designate the mealsIn the evening Dabba came out of seclusion and approached the Buddha He bowed sat downVenerable Sir while I was in seclusion I reflected thatIve attained all that can be attained by a discipleand I was wondering how I might be of service to the SanghaI could assign dwellings for the Sangha and designate the mealsWell then Dabbaplease do soSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksThe Sangha should appoint Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of mealsAnd he should be appointed like thisFirst Dabba should be askedA competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha it should appoint Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of mealsPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe Sangha appoints Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of mealsAny monk who approves of appointing Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha has appointed Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of mealsThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusDabba assigned dwellings to the monks according to their characterHe assigned dwellings in the same place to those monks who were experts on the discourse thinkingTheyll recite the discourses togetherAnd he did likewise for the experts on Monastic Law thinkingTheyll deliberate on the Monastic Lawfor the expounders of the Teaching thinkingTheyll discuss the Teachingfor the meditators thinkingThey wont disturb one anotherand for the gossips and the bodybuilders thinkingIn this way even these venerables will be happyWhen monks arrived at night he entered the fire element and assigned dwellings with the help of that lightMonks even arrived late on purposehoping to see the marvel of Dabbas supernormal powersThey would approach Dabba and sayVenerable Dabba assign us a dwellingWhere would you like to stayThey would intentionally suggest somewhere far awayPlease assign us a dwelling on the Vulture Peak at Robbers Cliff on Black Rock on the slope of Isigili Hill in the Sattapaṇṇi Cave on the slope of Vebhāra Hill in Cool Grove on the hill at the Snakes Pool at Gomaṭa Gorge at Tinduka Gorge at Tapoda Gorge in Tapoda Park in Jīvakas Mango Grove in the deer park at MaddakucchiDabba then entered the fire element and with his finger glowing he walked in front of those monksThey followed closely behind him with the help of that lightAnd he would assign them dwellingsThis is the bed this the bench this the mattress this the pillow this the place for defecating this the place for urinating this the water for drinking this the water for washing this the walking stick these are the Sanghas agreements concerning the right time to enter and the right time to departDabba then returned to the Bamboo GroveAt that time the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka were only newly ordained They had little meritand they obtained inferior dwellings and mealsThe people of Rājagaha were keen to give specially prepared almsfood to the senior monksghee oil and special currybut to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka they gave ordinary food ofporridge and broken riceAfter the meal when they had returned from almsround they asked the senior monksWhat did you get at the dining hallSome saidWe got ghee oil and special curryBut the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka saidWe didnt get anythingexcept ordinary food of porridge and broken riceAt that time there was a householder who gave a regular meal of fine food to four monksHe made his offering in the dining hall together with his wives and childrenSome of them offered rice others bean curry others oil and others special curryOn one occasion the meal to be given by this householder on the following day had been designated to the monks Mettiya and BhūmajakaJust then that householder went to the monastery on some businessHe approached Dabba bowed and sat downAnd Dabba instructed inspired and gladdened him with a teachingAfter the talk he asked DabbaVenerable who has been designated to receive tomorrows meal in our houseMettiya and BhūmajakaThat householder was disappointedand thought Why should bad monks eat in our house After returning to his house he told a female slaveFor those who are coming for tomorrows meal prepare seats at the gateway and serve them broken rice and porridgeYes sirThe monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to each otherYesterday we were designated a meal from the householder who offers fine foodTomorrow hell serve us together with his wives and childrenSome of them will offer us rice others bean curry others oil and others special curryAnd because they were excited they did not sleep properly that nightThe following morning they robed up took their bowls and robes and went to the house of that householderWhen the female slave saw them comingshe prepared seats at the gateway and said to themPlease sit VenerablesThey thoughtThe meal cant be ready since were given seats at the gatewayShe then brought them broken rice and porridge and saidEat SirsBut Sister weve come for the regular mealBut yesterday I was told by the head of our householdto serve you like thisPlease eatThey said to each otherYesterday this householder came to the monastery and spoke with DabbaDabba must be responsible for this split between this householder and usAnd because they were dejected they did not eat as much as they had intendedAfter the meal they returned to the monastery put their bowls and robes away and sat outside the monastery gateway using their upper robe as a backandknee strap They were silent and humiliated their shoulders drooping and their heads down glum and speechlessJust then the nun Mettiyā approached them and saidI pay respect to you VenerablesBut they did not respondA second time anda third time she said the same thingbut they still did not respondHave I done something wrongWhy dont you respondIts because weve been badly treated by Dabba the Mallian and youre not taking an interestWhat can I doIf you like you could make the Buddha expel DabbaWhat should I doHow am I able to do thatGo to the Buddha and sayVenerable Sir this is not proper or appropriate Theres fear distress and oppression in this district where none of these should existFrom where one would expect security theres insecurityIts as if water is burningVenerable Dabba the Mallian has raped meSaying Alright Venerables she approached the Buddha bowed down to himand repeatedwhat she had been told to saySoon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned DabbaDabba do you remember doing as the nun Mettiyā saysVenerable Sir you know about meand a third time the Buddha askedthe same questionand got the same responseHe then said Dabba the Dabbas dont give such evasive answersIf it was done by you say soif it wasnt done by you then say thatSir since I was born I dont recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream much less when awakeThe Buddha addressed the monksWell then monks expel the nun Mettiyāand call these monks to accountThe Buddha then got up from his seat and entered his dwellingWhen the monks had expelled the nun Mettiyāthe monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to themDont expel the nun Mettiyā shes done nothing wrongShe was urged on by us because we were angry displeased and aiming to make Dabba leave the monastic lifeBut did you groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with failure in moralityThe monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow could the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with failure in moralityThey rebuked those monks in many ways and then told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned themHe said Is it true monks that you groundlessly charged Dabba the Mallian with failure in moralityIts true Sir after rebuking them he gave a teaching and addressed the monksWell then because of his great clarity of memory grant resolution through recollection to Dabba the MallianAnd it should be granted like thisDabba should approach the Sangha put his upper robe over one shoulder pay respect at the feet of the senior monks squat on his heels raise his joined palms and sayVenerables these monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging me with failure in moralityBecause of my great clarity of memory I ask the Sangha for resolution through recollectionVenerables these monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging me with failure in morality Because of my great clarity of memory for the second time I ask the Order for resolution through recollectionVenerables these monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging me with failure in moralityBecause of my great clarity of memory for the third time I ask the Sangha for resolution through recollectionA competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThese monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in moralityBecause of his great clarity of memory Dabba is asking the Sangha for resolution through recollectionIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should grant resolution through recollection to DabbaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThese monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in moralityBecause of his great clarity of memory Dabba is asking the Sangha for resolution through recollectionThe Sangha grants resolution through recollection to DabbaAny monk who approves of granting resolution through recollection to Dabba should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upFor the second time I speak on this matter For the third time I speak on this matterPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThese monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in moralityBecause of his great clarity of memory Dabba is asking the Sangha for resolution through recollectionThe Sangha grants resolution through recollection to DabbaAny monk who approves of granting resolution through recollection to Dabba should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upBecause of his great clarity of memory the Sangha has granted resolution through recollection to Dabba the MallianThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusThere are these five factors for the legitimate granting of resolution through recollectionthe monk is pure and free of offenses he has been accused he asks for resolution through recollection the Sangha grants him resolution through recollection the legal procedure is legitimate and done by a unanimous assemblyResolution because of past insanityAt one time the monk Gagga was insane and suffering from psychosisBecause of that he did and said many things unworthy of an asceticMonks accused him of an offense sayingVenerable do you remember committing suchandsuch an offenseI was insane and suffering from psychosisBecause of that I did and said many things unworthy of an asceticI dont remember itI did it because I was insaneBut they still accused himin the same wayThe monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow can these monks keep on accusing Gaggawhen he sayshe was insaneThey told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned themHe said Is it true monks that these monks are doing thisIts true Sir after criticizing them he gave a teaching and addressed the monksWell then since he is no longer insane grant resolution because of past insanity to the monk GaggaAnd it should be granted like thisThe monk Gagga should approach the Sangha put his upper robe over one shoulder pay respect at the feet of the senior monks squat on his heels raise his joined palms and sayVenerables I have been insane and suffering from psychosisBecause of that I did and said many things unworthy of an asceticMonks accused me of an offenseVenerable do you remember committing suchandsuch an offenseI repliedI was insane and suffering from psychosisBecause of that I did and said many things unworthy of an asceticI dont remember itI did it because I was insaneBut they still accused mein the same wayBecause Im no longer insane I ask the Sangha for resolution because of past insanityAnd he should ask a second timeand a third timeVenerables I have been insane and suffering from psychosisBecause of that I did and said many things unworthy of an asceticMonks accused me of an offenseVenerable do you remember committing suchandsuch an offenseI repliedI was insane and suffering from psychosisBecause of that I did and said many things unworthy of an asceticI dont remember it I did it because I was insaneBut they still accused mein the same wayBecause Im no longer insane for the third time I ask the Sangha for resolution because of past insanityA competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe monk Gagga has been insane and suffering from psychosisBecause of that he did and said many things unworthy of an asceticMonks accused him of an offenseVenerable do you remember committing suchandsuch an offenseHe repliedI was insane and suffering from psychosisBecause of that I did and said many things unworthy of an asceticI dont remember it I did it because I was insaneBut they still accused himin the same wayBecause he is no longer insane he is asking the Sangha for resolution because of past insanityIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should grant resolution because of past insanity to GaggaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe monk Gagga has been insane and suffering from psychosisBecause of that he did and said many things unworthy of an asceticMonks accused him of an offenseVenerable do you remember committing suchandsuch an offenseHe repliedI was insane and suffering from psychosisBecause of that I did and said many things unworthy of an asceticI dont remember it I did it because I was insaneBut they still accused himin the same wayBecause he is no longer insane he is asking the Sangha for resolution because of past insanityThe Sangha grants resolution because of past insanity to GaggaAny monk who approves of granting resolution because of past insanity to Gagga should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upFor the second time I speak on this matter For the third time I speak on this matter Since he is no longer insane the Sangha has granted resolution because of past insanity to the monk GaggaThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusThere are three illegitimate and three legitimate grantings of resolution because of past insanityWhat are the three illegitimate grantings of resolution because of past insanityIt may be that a monk has committed an offenseThe Sangha several monks or a single monk accuses him sayingVenerable do you remember committing suchandsuch an offenseAlthough he remembers he sayshe doesntIf the Sangha grants him resolution because of past insanitythen that granting is illegitimateIt may be that a monk has committed an offenseThe Sangha several monks or a single monk accuses him sayingVenerable do you remember committing suchandsuch an offenseAlthough he remembers he saysI remember as if in a dreamIf the Sangha grants him resolution because of past insanitythen that granting is illegitimateIt may be that a monk has committed an offenseThe Sangha several monks or a single monk accuses him sayingVenerable do you remember committing suchandsuch an offenseAlthough he is sane he acts insane sayingI do thisand so do youThis is allowable for meand also for youIf the Sangha grants him resolution because of past insanitythen that granting is illegitimateThese are the three illegitimate grantings of resolution because of past insanityWhat are the three legitimate grantings of

from the group of six did legal procedurescondemnation demotion banishment reconciliation and ejectionagainst other monks without their admissionThe monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow can the monks from the group of six do thisThey told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned themIs it true monks that the monks from the group of six are doing thisIts true Sir after criticizing them the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksYou should not do legal procedurescondemnation demotion banishment reconciliation or ejectionagainst monks without their admissionIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductAnd how is acting according to what has been admitted illegitimateIt may be that a monk has committed an offense entailing

according to an offense wrong speechthen that acting according to what has been admitted is legitimateMajority decisionAt one time the monks were arguing and disputing in the midst of the Sangha attacking one another verbally and they were unable to resolve that legal issueThey told the Buddha and he saidI allow you to resolve such legal issues by majority decisionYou should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the manager of the voteone who isnt swayed by desire ill will confusion or fear and who knows who has and has not votedAnd he should be appointed like thisFirst a monk should be asked and then a competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should appoint monk soandso as the manager of the votePlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe Sangha appoints monk soandso as the manager of the voteAny monk who approves of appointing monk soandso as the manager of the vote should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha has appointed monk soandso as the manager of the voteThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusThere are ten reasons why a vote is illegitimateit is only a minor legal issue the full process for settling it hasnt run its course they havent tried to remember offenses and remind about offenses the manager knows that those who speak contrary to the Teaching are in the majority the manager desires that those who speak contrary to the Teaching be in the majority the manager knows that the Sangha will split the manager desires that the Sangha be split they vote illegitimately they vote with an incomplete assembly they dont vote according to their own viewsThere are ten reasons why a vote is legitimateits not a minor legal issue the full process for settling it has run its course they have tried to remember offenses and remind about offenses the manager knows that those who speak in accordance with the Teaching are in the majority the manager desires that those who speak in accordance with the Teaching be in the majority the manager knows that the Sangha will not split the manager desires that the Sangha not be split they vote legitimately they vote with a complete assembly they vote according to their own viewsFurther penaltyOn one occasion while the monk Upavāḷa was being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an offense he asserted things after denying them denied things after asserting them evaded the issue and liedThe monks of few desires complained and criticized himHow could the monk Upavāḷa act like thisThey told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned themIs it true monks that the monk Upavāḷa is acting like thisIts true Sir after criticizing him the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksWell then the Sangha should do a legal procedure of further penalty against the monk UpavāḷaAnd it should be done like thisFirst you should accuse the monk Upavāḷa He should then be reminded of what he has done before he is charged with an offense A competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe monk Upavāḷa while being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an offense asserted things after denying them denied things after asserting them evaded the issue and liedIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should do a legal procedure of further penalty against himPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe monk Upavāḷa while being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an offense asserted things after denying them denied things after asserting them evaded the issue and liedThe Sangha should do a legal procedure of further penalty against himAny monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of further penalty against him should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upFor the second time I speak on this matter For the third time I speak on this matter The Sangha has done a legal procedure of further penalty against the monk UpavāḷaThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusThere are these five factors of a legitimate legal procedure of further penaltythe subject of the procedure is impure he is shameless he has been accused the procedure is legitimate the procedure is done by a unanimous assemblyThe group of twelve on illegitimate legal proceduresWhen a legal procedure of further penalty has three qualities it is illegitimate contrary to the Monastic Law and not properly resolvedit is done in the absence of the accused it is done without questioning the accused it is done without the admission of the accusedWhen a procedure of further penalty has another three qualities it is also illegitimate not in accordance with the Monastic Law and not properly resolved it is done without having reminded the person of their offense it is done illegitimately it is done by an incomplete assemblyWhen a procedure of further penalty has another three qualities it is also illegitimate contrary to the Monastic Law and not properly resolved it is done without having charged the person with their offense it is done illegitimately it is done by an incomplete assemblyThe group of twelve on legitimate legal proceduresWhen a legal procedure of further penalty has three qualities it is legitimate in accordance with the Monastic Law and properly resolvedit is done in the presence of the accused it is done with the questioning of the accused it is done with the admission of the accusedWhen a procedure of further penalty has another three qualities it is also legitimate in accordance with the Monastic Law and properly resolved it is done after having charged the person with their offense it is done legitimately it is done by a unanimous assemblyThe group of six on wishingWhen a monk has three qualities the Sangha may if it wishes do a legal procedure of further penalty against himhe is quarrelsome argumentative and a creator of legal issues in the Sanghahe is ignorant incompetent often committing offenses incapable of determining whether he has committed an offensehe is constantly and improperly socializing with householdersWhen a monk has another three qualities the Sangha may if it wishes do a procedure of further penalty against himhe has failed in the higher morality he has failed in conduct he has failed in viewWhen a monk has another three qualities the Sangha may if it wishes do a procedure of further penalty against himhe disparages the Buddha he disparages the Teaching he disparages the SanghaThe Sangha may if it wishes do a procedure of further penalty against three kinds of monksthose who are quarrelsome argumentativeand creators of legal issues in the Sanghathose who are ignorant incompetent often committing offenses incapable of determining whether they have has committed an offensethose who are constantly and improperly socializing with householdersThe Sangha may if it wishes do a procedure of further penalty against another three kinds of monksthose who have failed in the higher morality those who have failed in the higher conduct those who have failed in viewThe Sangha may if it wishes do a procedure of further penalty against another three kinds of monksthose who disparage the Buddha those who disparage the Teaching those who disparage the SanghaThe eighteen kinds of conductA monk who has had a legal procedure of further penalty done against himself should behave properlyThis is the proper behaviorHe should not give the full ordinationHe should not give formal supportHe should not have a novice monk attend on himHe should not accept being appointed as an instructor of the nunsEven if appointed he should not instruct the nunsHe should not associates inappropriately with other monksThe Sangha then did a legal procedure of further penalty against the monk UpavāḷaCovering over as if with grassAt one time while the monks were arguing and disputing they did and said many things unworthy of an asceticThey considered this and thoughtIf we deal with one another for these offenses this legal issue might lead to harshness nastiness and schismSo what should we do nowThey told the Buddha and he saidIt may be monks that monks who are arguing and disputing do and say many things unworthy of an asceticIf they consider this and thinkIf we deal with one another for these offenses this legal issue might lead to harshness nastiness and schism then I allow you to resolve this legal issue by covering over as if with grassAnd it should be resolved like thisEveryone should gather in one place A competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenWhile we were arguing and disputing we did and said many things unworthy of an asceticIf we deal with one another for these offenses this legal issue might lead to harshness nastiness and schismIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should resolve this legal issue by covering over as if with grass except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householdersThe monks belonging to one side should be informed by a competent and capable monk belonging to their own sidePlease Venerables I ask you to listenWhile we were arguing and disputing we did and said many things unworthy of an asceticIf we deal with one another for these offenses this legal issue might lead to harshness nastiness and schismIf it seems appropriate to the venerables

except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upWe have confessed these offenses in the midst of the Sangha by covering over as if with grass except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householdersThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusA competent and capable monk

heavy offenses and offenses connected with householdersThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusIn this way those monks are cleared of those offenses except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders and except for those monks who state their objection and those who are absentLegal issuesOn one occasion monks were disputing with monks monks with nuns and nuns with monks Standing with the nuns the monk Channa disputed with the monks making others side with the nunsThe monks of few desires complained and criticized himHow can the monk Channa

Sāvatthī a legal issue had arisen in this wayBut those monkswere dissatisfied with how the Sangha at Sāvatthī had resolved that legal issueThey heard that in a certain monastery there were a number of senior monks who were learned and masters of the tradition who were experts on the Teaching the Monastic Law and the summaries who were knowledgeable and competent had a sense of conscience and were afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the trainingThey thought If these senior monks resolve this legal issueaccording to the Teaching the Monastic Law and the Teachers instructionthen it will be properly resolvedThey then went to that monastery and said to those senior monksThis legal issue has arisen in this wayIt would be good Venerables if you would resolve itaccording to the Teaching the Monastic Law and the Teachers instructionso that it will be properly resolvedThose senior monks thoughtThis legal issue was properly resolved by the Sangha at Sāvatthīand they resolved it in the same wayThose

three senior monks two senior monks one senior monk who was learned and a master of the tradition who was an expert on the Teaching the Monastic Law and the summaries who was knowledgeable and

resolved that legal issue they went to the Buddha and told him what had happened The Buddha said Monks this legal issue has been settled laid to rest and properly resolvedTo persuade those monks I allow three kinds of votinga secret one one by whispering in the ear and an open voteWhat is a secret voteThe manager of the vote should make voting tickets of two different colors approach the monks one by one and sayThis is the voting ticket for those who hold this view and this is the voting ticket for those who hold that viewTake the one you likeWhen someone has taken a voting ticket he should be toldDont show it to anyoneIf the manager knows thatthose who speak contrary to the Teaching are in the majority then that vote is invalid and to be postponedIf he knows thatthose who speak in accordance with the Teaching are in the majority then that vote is valid and is to be announcedWhat is a vote by whispering in the earThe manager of the vote should inform the monks one by one by whispering in the earThis is the voting ticket for those who hold this view and this is the voting ticket for those who hold that viewTake the one you likeWhen someone has taken a voting ticket he

finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe chapter on those from KosambīThe account of the dispute at KosambīAt one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghositas MonasteryAt this time a certain monk had committed an offenseHe regarded that offense as an offensebut there were other monks who did notSome time later he no longer regarded it as an offensebut there were other monks who didThey said to himYou have committed an offense Do you recognize itI havent committed any offense that I should recognizeSoon afterwards the monks achieved unanimity and they ejected that monk for not recognizing the offenseBut that monk was learned and a master of the tradition he was an expert on the Teaching the Monastic Law and the summaries he was knowledgeable and competent had a sense of conscience and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the trainingHe approached his friends and saidThis isnt an offenseand so I havent committed oneI havent been ejectedsince the legal procedure was illegitimate reversible and unfit to standPlease side with me Venerables in accordance with the Teaching and the Monastic LawAnd he was able to form a factionHe then sent the same message to his friends in the countryand again he was able to form a factionThe monks who sided with him went to the monks who had ejected him and saidThis isnt an offenseand so this monk hasnt committed oneHe hasnt been ejectedsince the legal procedure was illegitimate reversible and unfit to standThey repliedThis is an offenseand so this monk has committed oneHe has been ejectedsince the legal procedure of ejection was legitimate irreversible and fit to standVenerables dont side with this monk who has been ejectedBut they still sided with that monkSoon afterwards a certain monk went to the Buddha bowed sat downand told him all that had happenedRealizing that the Sangha of monks was divided the Buddhagot up from his seat went to those monks who had done the ejecting and sat down on a prepared seat He then said to those monksDont always eject a monk just because it seems clear to you that he has committed an offenseIt may be that a monk has committed an offenseHe doesnt regard it as an offense but there are other monks who doIf those monks know This monk is learned and a master of the tradition he is an expert on the Teaching the Monastic Law and the summaries he is knowledgeable and competent has a sense of conscience and is afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the trainingIf we eject this monk for not recognizing an offense we wont do the observanceday procedure with him Because of this there will be arguments and disputes in the Sangha there will be schism fracture and separation in the Sangha and if they understand the gravity of schism they should not eject that monk for not recognizing an offenseIt may be that a monk has committed an offenseHe doesnt regard it as an offense but there are other monks who doIf those monks know This monk is learned and a master of the tradition he is an expert on the Teaching the Monastic Law and the summaries he is knowledgeable and competent has a sense of conscience and is afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the trainingIf we eject this monk for not recognizing an offense we wont do the invitation procedure with himwe wont do the legal procedures of the Sangha with himwe wont share a seat with himwe wont drink rice porridge with himwe wont sit in the dining hall with himwe wont stay in the same room with himwe wont bow down stand up raise our joined palms and do acts of respect for one another according to senioritybecause of this there will be arguments and disputes in the Sangha there will be schism fracture and separation in the Sangha and if they understand the gravity of schism they should not eject that monk for not recognizing an offenseThe Buddha got up from his seat went to those monks who were siding with the ejected monk and sat down on a prepared seat He then said to those monksIf you have committed an offense dont refuse to make amends for it just because you think that you havent committed itIt may be that a monk has committed an offenseHe doesnt regard it as an offense but there are other monks who doIf that monk knows These monks are learned and masters of the tradition they are experts on the Teaching the Monastic Law and the summaries they are knowledgeable and competent have a sense of conscience and are afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training They are unlikely because of me or anyone else to act wrongly out of desire ill will confusion or fearMoreover if these monks eject me for not recognizing an offense they wont do the observanceday procedure with me Because of this there will be arguments and disputes in the Sangha there will be schism fracture and separation in the Sangha and if he understands the gravity of schism he should confess the offense even out of confidence in the othersIt may be that a monk has committed an offenseHe doesnt regard it as an offense but there are other monks who doIf that monk knows These monks are learned and masters of the tradition they are experts on the Teaching the Monastic Law and the summaries they are knowledgeable and competent have a sense of conscience and are afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training They are unlikely because of me or anyone else to act wrongly out of desire ill will confusion or fearMoreover if these monks eject me for not recognizing an offense they wont do the invitation procedure with methey wont do the legal procedures of the Sangha with methey wont share a seat with methey wont drink rice porridge with methey wont sit in the dining hall with methey wont stay in the same room with mewe wont bow down stand up raise our joined palms and do acts of respect for one another according to senioritybecause of this there will be arguments and disputes in the Sangha there will be schism fracture and separation in the Sangha and if he understands the gravity of schism he should confess the offense even out of confidence in the othersThe Buddha then got up from his seat and leftSoon those monks who sided with the ejected monk did the observanceday procedure and the legal procedures of the Sangha right there within the monastic boundaryBut the monks who had ejected him went outside the boundary and did the observanceday procedure and the procedures of the Sangha thereOne of the monks who had done the ejecting went to the Buddha bowed sat downand told him what was happeningThe Buddha replied If those monks who side with the ejected monk do the observanceday procedure and the legal procedures of the Sangha right there within the monastic boundary and its in accordance with the motion and announcements as I have laid them down then those procedures are legitimate irreversible and fit to standAnd if you the monks who did the ejecting do the observanceday procedure and the legal procedures of the Sangha right there within the monastic boundary and its in accordance with the motion and announcements as I have laid them down then those procedures too are legitimate irreversible and fit to standThis is so because you belong to different Buddhist sectThere are these two grounds for belonging to a different Buddhist sectEither one makes oneself belong to a different Buddhist sect or a unanimous assembly ejects one for not recognizing an offense for not making amends for an offense or for not giving up a bad viewAnd there are these two grounds for belonging to the same Buddhist sectEither one makes oneself belong to the same Buddhist sect or a unanimous assembly readmits one who had been ejected for not recognizing an offense for not making amends for an offense or for not giving up a bad viewAt this time the monks were arguing and disputing in the dining halls in inhabited areas displaying improper physical and verbal behavior such as grabbing one another with their handsPeople complained and criticized themHow can the Sakyan ascetics act like thisThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleand the monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow can monks act like thisThey told the Buddha He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that monks are acting like thisIts true SirThe Buddha criticized them and after criticizing them he gave a teaching and addressed the monksWhen the Sangha is divided and the monks are behaving contrary to the Teaching and are not on friendly termsthey should sit down and reflect We wont display improper physical and verbal behavior such as grabbing one another with our handsWhen the Sangha is divided but the monks are behaving in accordance with the Teaching and are on friendly terms they should sit down one seat apartThe monks were also arguing and disputing in the midst of the Sangha attacking one another verballyand they were unable to resolve that legal issueA certain monk went to the Buddha bowed and told him what was happening addingVenerable Sir it would be good if you went to those monks out of compassionThe Buddha consented by remaining silentThe Buddha then went to those monks sat down on a prepared seat and saidEnough monks dont quarrel and disputeA certain monk who spoke contrary to the Teaching repliedWait SirYou are the Lord of the Teaching and there is no need for you to be concerned Just enjoy the happiness of the present lifeWell face the consequences of this quarrelling and disputingThe Buddha repeated his appeal to those monksbut got the same replyThe story of DīghāvuThe Buddha then saidAt one time in Benares monks there was a king of Kāsī called Brahmadatta He was rich and powerful had many vehicles and transport animals and possessed a large kingdom and much wealthThen there was Dīghīti the King of Kosala who was poor and had little power who had few vehicles and transport animals and who possessed only a small kingdom and little wealthAt one time King Brahmadatta armed with his fourfold army marched out to attack King DīghītiWhen King Dīghīti heard about thishe reflected on King Brahmadattas superior wealth and power and concluded Im incapable of repelling even a single strike from BrahmadattaLet me flee the town before he arrivesAnd he fled the town together with his queenKing Brahmadatta then conquered and seized the army the vehicles and transport animals and the country and wealth of King DīghītiKing Dīghīti and his wife set out for BenaresWhen they eventually arrived they stayed in the house of a potter on the edge of the town disguised as wanderersSoon the queen became pregnantShe craved to see the fully armed fourfold army standing on even ground at sunrise and to drink water from the washing of swordsShe told the Kingand he replied How are we going to achieve that when were in such a difficult situationIf I dont get it Ill dieAt that time King Brahmadatta had a brahmin counselor who was a friend of King DīghītiKing Dīghīti went to his friend and told him about his wifes pregnancyand cravingThe brahmin replied Well then let me see the queenThe queen then went to that brahminWhen he saw her coming he got up from his seat put his upper robe over one shoulder raise his joined palms and exclaimed an inspired utterance three timesYou have the King of Kosala in your wombAnd he added Be pleased ladyYoull get to see the fully armed fourfold army standing on even ground at sunrise and to drink water from the washing of swordsThe brahmin counselor then went to King Brahmadatta and saidThe omens are such Sir that tomorrow you should have the fully armed fourfold army stand on even ground at sunrise and have the swords washedThe king told his people to act accordinglyAnd as a consequence the queen was able to satisfy her cravingWhen the pregnancy matured the queen gave birth to a sonThey called him DīghāvuSoon enough Prince Dīghāvu became selfreliantKing Dīghīti thought This King Brahmadatta has caused us much misfortune he has taken our army our vehicles and transport animals and our country and wealth If he finds out about us he will kill all three of us Let me take Prince Dīghāvu to live outoftownAnd he did just thatAs he was living outside of town Prince Dīghāvu was soon training in all branches of knowledgeAt this time King Dīghītis old barber was living under King BrahmadattaOn one occasion he saw King Dīghīti and his wife staying in that potters house disguised as wanderers He then went to King Brahmadatta and told himThe King ordered his people to get King Dīghīti and his wifeWhen they had done soBind their arms behind their backs with a strong rope Shave their heads and parade them from street to street from intersection to intersection to the beat of a harsh drum Then take them out of town through the southern gate cut them into four pieces and place the pieces at the four directionsSaying Yes Sir they bound and shaved King Dīghīti and his wife as instructed and paraded them from street to street from intersection to intersection to the beat of a harsh drumJust then Prince Dīghāvu thought I havent seen my parents for a long timeLet me pay them a visitWhen he entered Benares he saw what was happening to his parentsAs he approached them King Dīghīti said to himMy dear Dīghāvu see neither long nor shortFor hatred never ends through hatredhatred only ends through loveThe people there said to King Dīghīti Youre insane King Dīghīti youre babblingWho is DīghāvuAnd who is he saying this toIm not insane Im not babbling Those who are wise will understandKing Dīghīti repeated what he had said to the Prince a secondand a third time and events unfolded as beforeThen when the parading was finished the people took King Dīghīti and his wife through the southern gate and cut them into four pieces They placed the pieces at the four directions set up guard and departedPrince Dīghāvu entered Benares brought back some alcohol and gave it to the guardsWhen they were lying drunken on the ground he collected sticks made a funeral pile and placed his parents bodies on top He then lit the pile and with joined palms raised he circumambulated it with his right side toward itJust then King Brahmadatta was up in his best stilt houseand he saw Prince Dīghāvu circumambulating the funeral pile with joined palms raised He thoughtNo doubt this is a relative of King Dīghīti This is surely a sign of trouble for me in as much as nobody has told meThe Prince then went into the wilderness and cried his heart out Wiping away his tears he entered Benares and went to the elephant stables next to the royal compound He said to the elephant trainerTeacher I wish to learn the professionWell then young brahmin learn itSoon the Prince got up early in the morning He sang sweetly and played the lute in the elephant stablesKing Brahmadatta too got up early in the morning and he heard Prince Dīghāvu singing He asked his peoplewho it wasand they replied Sir its a young brahmin who is an apprentice of suchandsuch an elephant trainerWell then bring him hereThey brought the Princeand the King asked him whether he was the one who had been singing and playing the luteWhen the Prince confirmed that it was hethe King said Well then sing and play right hereDīghāvu consented and did his best to please the KingThe King said Young brahmin please attend on meand the Prince agreedThe Prince then got up before King and went to bed after him He willingly performed any services and was pleasant in his conduct and speechSoon the King put the Prince in an intimate position of trustOn one occasion the King said to the PrincePlease harness a chariot and lets go huntingHe did as asked and said to the KingSir the chariot is harnessed Please go at your convenienceThe King then mounted the chariotand the Prince drove itBut he drove it away from the armyWhen they had gone a long way the King said to the PrinceUnharness the chariot Im tired and I want to lie downHe did as asked and then sat down crosslegged on the groundThe King lay down resting his head on the Princes lapAnd because he was tired he quickly fell asleepThe Prince thoughtThis King has caused us much misfortuneHe took our army our vehicles and transport animals and our country and wealthHe killed my mother and fatherThis is a good opportunity for me to take revenge And he drew his sword from its sheathHe then thoughtAt the time of his death my father said to me My dear Dīghāvu see neither long nor shortFor hatred never ends through hatredhatred only ends through loveIt would not be proper of me not to follow my fathers advice And he returned the sword to its sheathand a third time he had the same thoughtsThis King has caused us much misfortuneHe took our army our vehicles and transport animals and our country and wealthHe killed my mother and fatherThis is a good opportunity for me to take revenge And he drew his sword from its sheathand a third time he had the same thoughtsAt the time of his death my father said to me My dear Dīghāvu see neither long nor shortFor hatred never ends through hatredhatred only ends through loveand each time he ended up returning the sword to its sheathThen King Brahmadatta suddenly got up frightened and alarmedThe Prince asked what was the matterand the King said Just now I dreamed that Prince Dīghāvu the son of Dīghīti the King of Kosala attacked me with a swordSeizing the Kings head with his left hand and drawing his sword with his right hand the Prince said to the KingSir Im that Prince Dīghāvu the son of Dīghīti the King of KosalaYou have caused us much misfortuneYou took our army our vehicles and transport animals and our country and wealthYou killed my mother and fatherThis is a good opportunity for me to take revengeThe King bowed down with his head at the Princes feet and saidDear Dīghāvu please spare my lifeWho am I to spare your lifeSir its you who should spare mineWell then Dīghāvu if you spare my life Ill spare yoursAnd the King and Dīghāvu spared each others lives They shook hands and made a vow not to harm each otherThe King said to the PrinceWell then Dīghāvu harness the chariot and lets goHe did as asked and said to the KingThe chariot is harnessed Please go at your own convenienceThe King mounted the chariotand the Prince drove itAnd he drove it so that it soon rejoined the armyWhen he was back in Benares the King gathered his court and saidIf you saw Prince Dīghāvu the son of Dīghīti the King of Kosala what would you do to himThey variously repliedSir we would cut off his handswe would cut off his feetwe would cut off his hands and feetwe would cut off his earswe would cut off his nosewe would cut off his ears and nosewe would cut off his headThis is Prince Dīghāvu the son of Dīghīti the King of KosalaYou shouldnt do anything to harm himIve spared his life and he has spared mineSoon afterwards the King said to DīghāvuDīghāvu whats the meaning of that which your father told you at the time of his deathWhen he said Not long he meant Dont harbor hate for a long timeWhen he said Not short he meant Dont hastily break with your friendsAnd when he said For hatred never ends through hatred hatred only ends through love he was referring to your killing of my mother and fatherFor if I had killed you those who wish you well would have killed me and those who wish me well would in turn have killed themIn this way the hatred would never end through hatredBut now you have spared my life and Ive spared yoursIn this way hatred ends through loveThe King thoughtIts amazinghow wise Dīghāvu is in that hes able to fully understand the meaning of his fathers brief statement And he gave him back his fathers army his vehicles and transport animals and his country and wealth and he also gave him his own daughterIn this way monks those kings who had the authority to punish were actually patient and gentleBut you who have gone forth on this wellproclaimed spiritual path you shine when you are patient and gentleA third time the Buddha said to those monksEnough monks dont quarrel and disputeAnd for third time that monk who spoke contrary to the Teaching repliedWait Sir You are the Lord of the Teachingand there is no need for you to be concerned Just enjoy the happiness of the present lifeWell face the consequences of this quarreling and disputingThe Buddha thoughtThese foolish men are overpowered by emotions Its not easy to persuade themand he got up from his seat and leftThe first section for recitation on Dīghāvu is finishedAfter robing up in the morning the Buddha took his bowl and robe and entered Kosambī for almsHe walked for alms and had his meal and after returning from almsround he put his dwelling in order He then took his bowl and robe and while standing in the midst of the Sangha he spoke these versesWhen many voices shout at onceNoone thinks they are a foolEven as the Sangha splitsThey do not think it throughForgetting to speak wiselyThey are obsessed by speechSaying whatever they likeThey dont know what leads them onThey abused me they hit meThey defeated me they robbed meFor those who carry on like thisHatred cannot endThey abused me they hit meThey defeated me they robbed meFor those who do not carry on like thisHatred has an endFor never is hatredStopped by hatredOnly by love does it stopThis is an ancient lawOthers do not knowThat here we need restraintBut for those who knowThe quarrels have an endThose breaking bones and killingThose taking cows horses and wealthThose plundering the countryEven they can stay togetherWhy then cannot youIf you get a discerning friendA steadfast companion good to live withThen overcome all problemsAnd go with them glad and mindfulIf you do not get a discerning friendA steadfast companion good to live withThen like a king giving up his kingdomWander alone like a bull elephant in the forestIts better to wander aloneFor there is no friendship with foolsWander alone and do no badUnconcerned like a bull elephant in the forestThe account of going to BālakaloṇakaAfter speaking these verses while standing in the midst of the Sangha the Buddha went to the village of BālakaloṇakaAt that time Venerable Bhagu was staying near that villageWhen Bhagu saw the Buddha coming he prepared a seat and set out a footstool a footscraper and water for washing the feet He then went out to meet the Buddha receiving his bowl and robeThe Buddha sat down on the prepared seat and washed his feetWhen Bhagu had bowed and sat downthe Buddha said to himI hope you are keeping well monkI hope youre comfortable I hope youre not having any trouble getting almsfoodIm keeping well Venerable Sir Im comfortableIm having no trouble getting almsfoodThe Buddha instructed inspired and gladdened Bhagu with a teaching He then got up from his seat and went to the Eastern Bamboo ParkThe account of going to the Eastern Bamboo ParkAt this time Venerable Anuruddha Venerable Nandiya and Venerable Kimila were staying at the Eastern Bamboo ParkThe park keeper saw the Buddha coming and said to himAscetic dont enter this parkThere are three ascetics from good families staying here seeking their own benefitDont disturb themWhen Anuruddha heard the park keeper advising the Buddha he saidPlease dont block the BuddhaIts our teacher who has arrivedAnuruddha then went to Nandiya and Kimila and saidCome out Venerables our teacher has arrivedThe three of them went out to meet the Buddha One received his bowl and robe one prepared a seat and one put out a footstool a footscraper and water for washing the feetThe Buddha sat down on the prepared seat and washed his feetWhen they had bowed and sat downthe Buddha said to themI hope you are all keeping well Anuruddha I hope youre comfortableI hope youre not having any trouble getting almsfoodWe are keeping well Venerable Sir were comfortableand were not having any trouble getting almsfoodI hope youre living together in harmony without dispute blending like milk and water and that you regard one another with affectionYes we are living together in harmony without dispute blending like milk and water and we regard one another with affectionAnd how do you do thisI think like thisHow fortunate I am to be living with such fellow monasticsAnd I do acts of kindness toward them by bodyand mind both in public and in privateLet me set aside what I wish to do and instead do what these venerables wishAnd thats what I doWe are separate in body but its as if were one in mindNandiya and Kimila then repeated what Anuruddha had saidI hope Anuruddha that youre heedful and energeticYes we are SirAnd how is it that youre heedful and energeticWhoever returns first from almsround in the village he prepares the seats and sets out a footstool a footscraper and water for washing the feet He washes and sets out the bowl for leftovers and puts out water for drinking and water for washingWhoever returns last from almsround may eat the leftovers or he discards them where there are no cultivated plantsor in water without lifeHe puts away the seats and also the footstool the foot scraper and the water for washing the feet He cleans the bowl for leftovers and puts it away puts away the water for drinking and the water for washing and sweeps the dining hallWhoever sees that the pot for drinking water the pot for washing water or the waterpot in the restroom is empty fills itIf he cant do it by himself he calls someone over by hand signal and they move it together We dont speak because of thatAnd every five days we sit together the whole night and talk about the TeachingThe account of going to PālileyyakaThe Buddha then instructed inspired and gladdened Venerable Anuruddha Venerable Nandiya and Venerable Kimila with a teaching He then got up from his seat and set out wandering toward PālileyyakaWhen he eventually arrivedhe stayed in a protected forest grove at the foot of an auspicious sal treeWhile he was staying by himself the Buddha thoughtWhen I was previously surrounded by people I was not at ease because of those monks at Kosambī who were quarreling arguing and creating legal issues in the SanghaBut now that Im alone without a companion Im happy and at ease because Im apart from those monks at KosambīAt that time there was a large bull elephant who was surrounded by a crowd of male and female elephants by young elephants and baby elephants He ate grass with broken tips and other elephants ate the branches that he had folded together He drank muddied water and when he was immersed in a pool the female elephants came rubbing their bodies against hisHe considered this and thoughtLet me leave the herd and stay by myselfHe then left the herd and went to Pālileyyaka to the Buddha at the foot of the auspicious sal tree in the protected forest grove And he attended on the Buddha using his trunk to set out water for drinking and water for washing and to clear the vegetationHe thoughtWhen I was previously surrounded by elephants I was not at ease because of the other elephantsBut now that Im alone without a companion Im happy and at ease because Im apart from those elephantsAfter considering his own seclusion and reading the mind of the elephant the Buddha exclaimed this inspired utteranceThe mind of this large elephantWith tusks like chariot polesAgrees with the mind of the sageSince they each delight in the forest solitudeWhen the Buddha had stayed at Pālileyyaka for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward SāvatthīWhen he eventually he arrivedhe stayed in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasterySoon the lay followers in Kosambī consideredThese venerable monks at Kosambī have caused us much misfortuneThe Buddha himself left because he was troubled by themWell then lets not bow down rise up raise our joined palms or do acts of respect for them And lets not honor respect esteem or associate with them nor give them almsfoodBecause of this they will either leave disrobe or reconcile with the BuddhaAnd that is what they didSoon the monks at Kosambī saidWell then lets go to Sāvatthī and resolve this legal issue in the presence of the BuddhaThe account of the eighteen basesThe monks at Kosambī put their dwellings in order took their bowls and robes and went to SāvatthīWhen Venerable Sāriputta heardthat they were cominghe went to

should a dwelling be reserved for a more senior monkIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductAnd what should we do in regard to food and requisitesFood and requisites should be shared out

procedure was legitimate irreversible and fit to standHe went to those who were siding with him and told themwhat he had been thinkingadding Venerables please readmit meThey then took that monk to the

then approached the monks who had ejected him and saidBecause this monk has recognized that he had committed offense and because he has been ejected and now readmitted the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha for the schism fracture and separation in the Sangha have been removedTo resolve this matter lets create unity in the SanghaThe monks who had done the ejecting went to the Buddha bowed sat downand told himwhat had happenedadding How should we proceed with thisSince this is the case you should create unity in the Sangha so as to resolve this matterAnd it should be done like thisEveryone should gather in one place including those who are sickNoone should give their consentA competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to

and disputes in the Sangha for the schism fracture and separation in the Sangha havent been investigated by the Sangha havent been resolved by the Sangha yet the Sangha creates unity in the Sanghais that unity in the Sangha legitimateThat unity in the Sangha is illegitimateIf the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha for the schism fracture and separation in the Sangha have been investigated by the Sangha have been resolved by the Sangha and the Sangha then creates unity in the Sanghais that unity in the Sangha legitimateThat unity in the Sangha is legitimateSir how many kinds of unity in the Sangha are thereThere are two kinds of unity in the SanghaThere is the unity in the Sangha where the wording is fulfilled but not the purposeAnd there is the unity in the Sangha where both the wording and the purpose are fulfilledIf the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha for the schism fracture and separation in the Sangha havent been investigated by the Sangha havent been resolved by the Sangha yet the Sangha creates unity in the Sangha this is called unity in the Sangha where the wording is fulfilled but not the purposeIf the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha for the schism fracture and separation in the Sangha have been investigated by the Sangha have been resolved by the Sangha and the Sangha then creates unity in the Sangha

chapter on those from Kosambī is finishedThe chapter on those from Kosambī is finishedThe Long Division is finishedThe canonical text of the Long Division is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe chapter on those from CampāThe account of the monk KassapagottaAt one time the Buddha was staying at Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā lotus pondAt that time in the country of Kāsī there was a village called VāsabhaThe resident monk there Kassapagotta was dedicated to the local monasterytrying to get good monks to come to make those who had come be at ease and to make the local monastery grow and reach maturityAt this time a number of monks who were wandering in Kāsī arrived at VāsabhaWhen Kassapagotta saw those monks coming he prepared seats and he set out a footstool a footscraper and water for washing the feet He then went out to meet them received their bowls and robes and asked if they wanted water to drink He helped them get a bath and also with rice porridge nonstaple foods and mealsThose newly arrived monks thoughtHes great this resident monk in that he helps us with all these thingsLets settle down right here in VāsabhaAnd they did just thatSoon afterwards Kassapagotta thoughtThese monks are now rid of their tiredness from travelingAnd by now they know where to get almsMoreover its hard work to seek support from other families all ones life and people dont like to be askedLet me stop helping them with rice porridge nonstaple foods and mealsAnd he did soThose newly arrived monks consideredPreviously this resident monk helped us get a bath and also with rice porridge nonstaple food and mealsBut he has stopped helping us with foodHes hostile this resident monkWell then lets eject himSoon afterwards those newly arrived monks gathered and confronted Kassapagotta about what had happened addingYou have committed an offenseDo you recognize the offenseNo I havent committed any offense that I should recognizeThose newly arrived monks then

chapter on those from Campā is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe chapter on the group of five hundredThe origin account of the communal recitationThen Venerable Mahākassapa addressed the monksOn one occasion I was traveling from Pāvā to Kusināra with a large sangha of five hundred monksAnd I left the road and sat down at the foot of a treeJust then a follower of the jīvakas was traveling toward Pāvā on the same road holding a coraltree flower that he had picked up in KusināraWhen I saw him comingI asked himDo you know anything about our TeacherToday its seven days since the ascetic Gotama attained final extinguishmentThats why I carry this coraltree flowerSome of the monks there who were not yet free from desire threw up their arms and cried collapsed on the ground and rolled back and forth lamentingThe Buddha the Accomplished One has attained final extinguishment too soon too soon has the eye of the world been put outBut the monks there who were free from desire bore it patiently with mindfulness and full awareness sayingAll phenomena are impermanent How could it be any differentPlease stop grievingstop lamentingDidnt the Buddha warn usthat we must be separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to usHow could that which is born become made up and of a nature to fall apart not fall apartThats impossibleOn that occasion a monk called Subhadda who had gone forth when old was part of that groupHe said to the monksPlease stop grievingstop lamentingIts good that we are freed from that great asceticWe were oppressedalways being told whats allowable and what isntNow we can do what we like and not do what we dont likeSo then lets recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law togetherbefore what is contrary to the Teaching shines forth and the Teaching is obstructedbefore what is contrary to the Monastic Law shines forth and the Monastic Law is obstructedbefore those who speak contrary to the Teaching become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weakbefore those who speak contrary to the Monastic Law become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weakWell then Venerable please select the monksMahākassapa then selected four hundred and ninetynine perfected onesThe monks said to himThere is Venerable nanda who although still a trainee is incapable of acting from desire ill will confusion or fearHe has learned many teachings and much Monastic Law in the presence of the BuddhaPlease invite him as wellAnd he didThe senior monks thoughtWhere should we recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law togetherAnd it occurred to themRājagaha has much almsfood and many dwellings Lets spend the rainy season at Rājagaha and recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law together thereNo other

first month doing repairsand then gather for the middle month to recite the Teaching and the Monastic LawThey then spent the first month doing repairsVenerable nanda thoughtIt would not be proper for me to go to the assembly tomorrow if Im still a traineeAnd after spending most of the night with mindfulness directed to the body early in the morning he bent over to lie downIn the interval between his feet coming off the ground and his head hitting the pillowhis mind was freed from the corruptions without graspingAnd Venerable nanda went to the assembly as a perfected oneVenerable Mahākassapa

should undertake to practice the training rules as they arePlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenWe have training rules that relate to householdersThe householders knowwhat is allowable for us

should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha doesnt lay down new rules nor gets rid of the existing ones and it undertakes to practice the training rules as they areThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusThe senior monks saidYou have committed an act of wrong conduct nanda in that you didnt ask the Buddha which are the lesser training rulesConfess that wrong conductIt was because of lack of mindfulness that I didnt ask which are the lesser training rulesI cant see that I have committed any wrong conduct but Ill confess it out of faith in the venerablesYou have also committed an act of wrong conduct in that you stepped on the Buddhas rainyseason robe when you were sewing itConfess that wrong conductI didnt step on it because of disrespectI cant see that Ive committed any wrong conduct but Ill confess it out of faith in the venerablesYou have also committed an act of wrong conduct in that you had women pay respect to the Buddhas dead body first They soiled the Buddhas body with tearsConfess that wrong conductI did this so that it wouldnt get too late for themI cant see that Ive committed any wrong conduct but Ill confess it out of faith in the venerablesYou have also committed an act of wrong conduct in that you didnt even when he gave you a broad hint ask the BuddhaPlease live on for an eonfor the benefit and happiness of the general population out of compassion for the world for the good the benefit and the happiness of gods and humansConfess that wrong conductI didnt ask because my mind was possessed by the Lord of DeathI cant see that Ive committed any wrong conduct but Ill confess it out of faith in the venerablesYou have also committed an act of wrong conduct in that you made an effort for women to be given the going forth on the spiritual path proclaimed by the BuddhaConfess that wrong conductI made this effort because Mahāpajāpati Gotamī was the Buddhas aunt who nurtured him brought him up and breastfed him when his own mother diedI cant see that Ive committed any wrong conduct but Ill confess it out of faith in the venerablesAt that time Venerable Purāṇa was wandering in the Southern

to themDid you see the ascetic nandaDid you give him anythingWe gave him five hundred upper robesKing Udena complained and criticized himHow can the ascetic nanda receive so many robesIs he starting up as cloth merchant or setting up shopKing Udena then went to nanda exchanged pleasantries with himSir nanda did our harem women come hereThey didDid they give you anythingThey gave me five hundred upper robesBut what will you do with five hundred robesIll share them with those monks whose robes are wornAnd what will you do with the worn robesWell make them into bedspreadsAnd what will you do

was telling his slaves and workersto get up early to cook rice porridge and rice and to prepare various kinds of curryAnāthapiṇḍika thoughtWhen Ive arrived before this householder put down all his

with the army for a meal tomorrowWhen the merchant was finished with telling his workers what to do he went up to Anāthapiṇḍika greeted him and sat downAnāthapiṇḍika then told him what he had

sacrificeI have invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for a meal tomorrowDid you say Buddha Did you say Buddha Did you say Buddha Its rare in the worldto hear the word BuddhaIs it possible at this time to go and visit that Buddha that fully awakened and perfected oneNow is the wrong time to visit the BuddhaTomorrow will be the right timeBecause he lay down thinking of the BuddhaTomorrow I will go and visit that Buddha that fully awakened and perfected onehe got up three times during the night thinking it was lightAnāthapiṇḍika then went to the Sivaka gateand the gate was opened by spiritsThen as he was leaving town the light disappeared and it was dark He was paralyzed with fear with goosebumps all overand he wanted to turn backJust then the invisible spirit Sivaka proclaimedA hundred elephants a hundred horsesA hundred carriages drawn by mulesA hundred thousand girlsWearing jeweled earringsAre not worth a sixteenth partOf a single step forwardGo forward householder go forwardGoing forward is better for you than going backThe light returned the darkness disappearedand his fear subsidedand a third timethe light disappeared and he was paralyzed with fearupon which the spirit proclaimed the same versesAnd on both occasions the light returned the darkness disappeared and his fear subsidedAnāthapiṇḍika then went to the Sītavana the Cool GroveJust then the Buddha was walking back and forth outside having got up early in the morningWhen the Buddha saw Anāthapiṇḍika cominghe came down from the walkingpath sat down on a prepared seatCome SudattaAnāthapiṇḍika thoughtThe Buddha is addressing me by nameand glad and joyful he went up to him bowed down with his head at the Buddhas feet and saidVenerable Sir I hope you have slept wellIndeed he always sleeps wellThe brahmin who is extinguishedWhos not soiled among worldly pleasuresBut is cool and ownerlessAfter cutting all attachmentsAfter removing distress from the heartCalmed he sleeps wellHaving attained peace of mindThe Buddha then gave him a progressive teachingtalk on generosity talk on morality talk on heaven and he revealed the danger degradation and defilement in worldly pleasures and the benefit of renunciationWhen the Buddha knew that his mind was ready supple without hindrances joyful and confident he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhassuffering its origin its end and the pathAnd just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properlyso too while he was sitting right there Anāthapiṇḍika experienced the stainless vision of the TruthAnything that has a beginning has an endHe had seen the Truth had reached understood and penetrated it he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty had attained to confidence and had become independent of others in the Teachers instruction He then said to the BuddhaWonderful Sir wonderfulJust as one might set upright what had been overturned or reveal what was hidden or show the way to one who was lost or bring a lamp into the darknessso that one with eyes might see whats therejust so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to the Buddha to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monksPlease accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeAnd please accept tomorrows meal from me together with the Sangha of monksThe Buddha consented by remaining silentKnowing that the Buddha had

understandThen after instructing inspiring and gladdening him with a teaching the Buddha got up from his seat and leftAfter finishing his business in RājagahaAnāthapiṇḍika set out for SāvatthīNow at that time Anāthapiṇḍika had many friends and acquaintances who listened to him On his way to Sāvatthīhe told people to make monasteries to build dwellings and to prepare offeringsTheres a Buddha in the worldHes been invited by me and will be traveling this wayAnd those people did as Anāthapiṇḍika had urged them to doAfter arriving at Sāvatthī Anāthapiṇḍika searched all around town for a place for the Buddha to stay thinkingWhere might the Buddha staythats neither too far from the village nor too close that has good access roads thats easily accessible for people who seek him that has few people during the day and is quiet at night thats free from chatter and offers solitude thats away from human habitation and suitable for seclusionAnāthapiṇḍika saw that Prince Jetas parkhad all these qualitiesHe then went to Prince Jeta and saidSir give me your park to make a monasteryI wont give it even if you cover the park with ten million coinsIts a dealNo it isntThey then asked judges to decide on the matterThey saidSir since you gave a price the park is soldAnāthapiṇḍika then had gold coins brought out in carts and covered the Jeta Grove with ten million coinsAfter one more load had been brought out there was still a small area near the gateway that was not coveredAnāthapiṇḍika told his peopleGo and get more coinsWell cover this area tooBut Prince Jeta thoughtThis must be an important matter since hes giving up so much moneyAnd he said to AnāthapiṇḍikaIts enoughdont cover that areaLet me keep that areaThat will be my giftAnāthapiṇḍika thoughtPrince Jeta is a wellknown personIts very beneficial that such wellknown people gain confidence in this spiritual pathAnd he granted that area to Prince JetaPrince Jeta then had a gateway built at that placeAnāthapiṇḍika had

the hall with the peaked roofAt that time people were doing careful building workAnd the monks who supervised the building work were respectfully supported with robes almsfood dwellings and medicinesThen a certain poor tailor thoughtThis must be an important matter since these people do such careful building workI too should do building workHe then made a mixture of mud made bricks out of it and built a wallBut because of his lack of skill the wall was not straight and it fell downand a third time the same thing happenedHe then complained and criticized the monksThese Sakyan ascetics teach and instruct only those who give them robes almsfood dwellings and medicines They only supervise their building workBut since Im poornobody teaches instructs or supervises meThe monks heard the complaints of that poor tailorThey informed the Buddhawho gave a teaching and addressed the monksYou should put a monk in charge of the building workThe monk in charge of building work should make an effortto complete the dwellings as quickly as possibleand he should repair what is broken or damagedAnd he is to be put in charge like thisFirst a monk should be asked and then a competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should put monk soandso in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder soandsoPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe Sangha puts monk soandso in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder soandsoAny monk who approves of putting monk soandso in charge of that building work should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha has put monk soandso in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder soandsoThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusThe instruction on the best seat etcWhen the Buddha had stayed at Vesālī

ParkAnāthapiṇḍika then went to the Buddha bowed sat downVenerable Sir please accept tomorrows meal from me together with the Sangha of monksThe Buddha consented by remaining silentKnowing that the Buddha had consented Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and leftThe following morning Anāthapiṇḍika had various kinds of fine food prepared He then had the Buddha informedthat the meal was readyThe Buddha robed up took his bowl and robe and went to Anāthapiṇḍikas house where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monksAnāthapiṇḍika then personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl Anāthapiṇḍika sat down to one sideSir what should I do in regard to the Jeta GroveYou should dedicate the Jeta Grove to the Sangha everywhere present and futureYes And he did just thatThe Buddha then expressed his appreciation with these versesCold and heat are kept awayAnd predatory animals tooAnd creeping animals and mosquitoesAnd also chill and rainIt keeps away the burning windThat terrible thing that comesIts for the sake of shelter and happinessTo attain absorption and to see clearlyGiving dwellings to the SanghaIs praised as the best by the BuddhaTherefore the wise manSeeing what is beneficial for himselfShould build delightful dwellingsAnd have the learned stay thereFood drink cloth and dwellingsWith an inspired mindHe should give to theseTo those who are uprightThey will give him the TeachingFor removing all sufferingAnd understanding this Teaching in this very lifeHe attains extinguishment free of corruptionsThe Buddha then got up from his seat and leftReservation of seats etcOn one occasion a certain government official who was an jīvaka disciple was offering a meal to the SanghaArriving late Venerable Upananda the Sakyan made the nearest monk get up before he had finished his mealThere was an uproar in the dining hallThe official complained and criticized himHow can the Sakyan ascetics arrive late and make the nearest monk get up in the middle of his mealThere was an uproar in the dining hallIts impossible to eat as much as you like when youre not seatedThe monks heard the complaints of the officialand the monks of few desires complained and criticized himHow could Upananda act like thisThey told the Buddha and he saidIs it true Upananda that you acted like thisIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked himFoolish man how can you act like thisThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it after rebuking him the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksYou should not make a monk get up who hasnt finished his mealIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductIf youre asked to get up and you have already refused an invitation to eat more you should say Please go and get some waterIf the other goes all is wellIf not you should properly swallow the mouthful and give the seat to the more senior monkUnder no circumstances should you block a more senior monk from a seatIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductOn one occasion the monks from the group of six asked the sick monks to get upThe sick monks saidWere not able to get up were sickSaying Well make the venerables get up they took hold of them lifted them up and then released them when they were standingThe sick monks fainted and collapsedYou should not make the sick get upIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductThe monks from the group of six took possession of the best beds sayingWere sick and noone can make us get upYou should give suitable beds to those who are sickThe monks from the group of six used a pretext to reserve resting placesYou should not use a pretext to reserve a resting placeIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductAt that time the monks from the group of seventeen were repairing a large dwelling nearbyintending to stay there for the rainy seasonThe monks from the group of six saw thisThese monks from the group of seventeen are repairing a dwellingLets throw them outBut some of them saidLets wait until theyve finished repairing itSoon afterwards the monks from the group of six said to those from the group of seventeenLeave this dwelling is oursShouldnt you have told us beforehandWe would have repaired another oneDoesnt this dwelling belong to the SanghaYes it doesWell then leave this dwelling is oursThe dwelling is largeYou can stay here and so can weBut they said Leave this dwelling is ours and they grabbed them by the neck and threw them out in angerThe monks from the group of seventeen criedWhen other monks asked them whythey told them what had happenedThe monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow can the monks from the group of six angrily throw other monks out of a dwelling belonging to the SanghaThey told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that you did thisIts true SirThe Buddha criticized them and after giving a teaching he addressed the monksYou should not in anger throw a monk out of a dwelling belonging to the SanghaIf you do you should be dealt with according to the ruleYou should allocate the dwellingsThe appointment of allocators of dwellingsThe monks thoughtWho should allocate the dwellingsThey told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksYou should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the allocator of dwellingshe is not swayed by desire ill will confusion or fear and he knows which dwellings have and have not been allocatedAnd he should be appointed like thisFirst a monk should be asked and then a competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should appoint monk soandso as allocator of dwellingsPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe Sangha appoints monk soandso as allocator of dwellingsAny monk who approves of appointing monk soandso as allocator of dwellings should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha has appointed monk soandso as allocator of dwellingsThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusThe allocators of dwellings thoughtHow should we allocate the dwellingsThey told the BuddhaFirst you should count the monks and the beds You should then allocate one monk to each bedWhen they were allocating the beds there were beds left overYou should allocate one monk to each dwellingWhen they were allocating the dwellings there were dwellings left overYou should allocate one monk to the precincts of each dwellingWhen they were allocating the precincts there were precincts left overYou should give out additional sharesIf another monk arrives after the additional shares have been allocated then if youre unwilling you need not give him a shareOn one occasion the monks allocated a dwelling to one who was outside the monastic boundaryYou should not allocate a dwelling to one outside the monastic boundaryIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductAt that time after accepting a dwelling the monks reserved it at all timesAfter you have accepted a dwelling you should not reserve it at all timesIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductI allow you to reserve it for the three months of the rainyseason residence but not at other timesThe monks thoughtHow many times are there for the allocation of dwellingsThere are three times for the allocation of dwellingsthe first the second and when given up in betweenThe first allocation is on the day after the full moon of JulyThe second allocation is one month after the full moon of JulyThe allocation of what is given up in between the two is on the day after the invitation procedure and is for the purpose of spending the next rains residenceThe second section for recitation is finishedOn one occasion Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had accepted a dwelling at Sāvatthī but then went to a certain village monasterywhere he was also allocated a dwellingThe monks there thoughtThis Upananda is quarrelsome and argumentative and creates legal issues in the SanghaIf he spends the rainy season here none of us will be at easeWell lets question himAnd they said to UpanandaHave you not been allocated a dwelling at Sāvatthī Yes I haveBut being only one person why do you reserve two dwellingsI will give up this oneand take the one at SāvatthīThe monks of few desires complained and criticized himHow could Upananda reserve two dwellings for himselfThey told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned UpanandaIs it true Upananda that you did thisIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked himFoolish man how can you reserve two dwellings for yourselfWhat you had been allocated at Sāvatthī you gave up when you were allocated a dwelling here And what you have been allocated here you have now given upYoure now excluded from bothThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it after rebuking him the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksA single monk should not reserve two dwellingsIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductAt one time the Buddha gave many talks about the Monastic Law spoke in praise of the Monastic Law and of learning the Monastic Law and he repeatedly praised Venerable UpāliWhen the monksheard this they thoughtWell then lets learn the Monastic Law from Venerable UpāliAnd many monks both senior and junior as well as those of middle standing learned the Monastic Law from UpāliOut of respect for the senior monks Upāli taught while standingAnd out of respect for the Teaching the senior monks too were standingBoth the senior monks and Upāli became tiredThey told the BuddhaA junior monk who is teaching should sit on a similar or higher seat out of respect for the TeachingA senior monk who is being taught should sit on a similar or lower seat out of respect for the TeachingOn one occasion many monks were standing in the presence of Upāli honoring the recitation They became tiredI allow those who are entitled to a seat of the same height to sit togetherThe monks thoughtWho are entitled to a seat of the same heightI allow those with a difference of three years or less in seniority to sit togetherOn one occasion a number of monks entitled to a seat of the same height were seated on a bed the bed broke They were seated on the same bench the bench brokeI allow a maximum of three on a bed or benchThe beds and benches still brokeI allow a maximum of two on a bed or benchAt that time being afraid of wrongdoing monks who were not entitled to a seat of the same height did not sit together on a long seatI allow those who are not entitled to a seat of the same height to sit together on a long seat except with a paṇḍaka a woman or a hermaphroditeThe monks thoughtWhat is the size of the smallest long seatA seat for three is the smallest long seatAt one time Visākhā Migāramātā wanted to build a stilt house for the benefit of the Sangha including a porch and elephant globesThe monks thoughtWhat stilthouse equipment has the Buddha allowed and what has he not allowedThey told the BuddhaI allow all stilthouse equipmentAt one time King Pasenadi of Kosalas grandmother had just diedAs a result many unallowable goods were given to the Sangha that isa high couch a luxurious couch a longfleeced woolen rug a multicolored woolen rug a white woolen rug a red woolen rug a cottondown quilt a woolen rug decorated with the images of predatory animals a woolen rug with long fleece on one side a woolen rug with long fleece on both side a sheet of silk embroidered with gems a silken sheet a woolen rug like a dancers rug an elephantback rug a horseback rug a carriageseat rug a rug made of black antelope hide an excellent rug made of kadalīdeer hide a seat or bed with a canopy a seat or bed with red cushions at each endI allow you to use a high couch after cutting its legs down to size to use a luxurious couch after removing the images of predatory animals to make a pillow after removing the cotton down from the cottondown quilt and to make floor covers of the restWhat is not to be given awayAt one time in a village monastery not far from Sāvatthī the resident monks were fed up with assigning dwellings for newly arrived and departing monksThey considered thisand thought Well lets give all the dwellings belonging to the Sangha to one of usWell then use what belongs to himAnd they did just thatWhen newly arrived monks said to themPlease assign us a dwellingthey replied There are no dwellings belonging to the SanghaThey have all been given to one of usSo you have given away the dwellings belonging to the SanghaThe monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow can monks give away dwellings belonging to the SanghaThey told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that they did thisIts true SirThe Buddha criticized themHow can those foolish men give away dwellings belonging to the SanghaThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it after criticizing them the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksThere are five things not to be given away either by a sangha a group or an individualEven if given away they are not actually given awayIf you give any of them away you commit a serious offenseWhat are the fiveA monastery or the site of a monasteryA dwelling or

serious offenseWhat is not to be shared outWhen the Buddha had stayed at Sāvatthī for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward Kīṭāgiri with a large sangha of five hundred monks including Sāriputta and MahāmoggallānaThe monks Assaji and Punabbasuka heard about this and saidWell lets share out all the dwellings belonging to the SanghaSāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna are in the grip of bad desiresWe wont assign dwellings to them And they shared out all the dwellings belonging to the SanghaThe Buddha eventually arrived at KīṭāgiriAnd he said to a group of monksGo to the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka and sayThe Buddha is coming with a large sangha of five hundred monks including Sāriputta and MahāmoggallānaAssign dwellings to the Buddha to the Sangha of monks and to Sāriputta and MahāmoggallānaSaying Yes Sir they did just thatThe monks Assaji and Punabbasuka replied There are no dwellings belonging to the Sanghathey have all been shared out by usThe Buddha is welcomeand he may stay wherever he likesBut Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna are in the grip of bad desiresWe wont assign dwellings to themSo you have shared out the dwellings belonging to the SanghaThe monks of few
