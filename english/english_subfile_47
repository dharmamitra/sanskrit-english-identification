I shall inform him after he has awakened Kasyapa said You may wake up the king The gatekeeper said in reply The king must not be woken up If he is awakened he will be greatly enraged and once he is enraged he will punish me The Elder Kasyapa said to the gatekeeper When the king has been awak ened you should inform him that Kasyapa has come here wishing to enter nirvana That is why I want to see the king Then Kasyapa went into the city to beg for food After having begged for food he went to Kukkuta Mountain which broke into three portions On the mountain he spread some grass on the ground and pondered while saying to his own body Formerly the Tathagata covered you with a robe made of castoff rags You should stay till the time of the Dharmapitoa of Maitreya He also uttered the following stanza With my supernatural powers I shall keep this body Covered with this robe of castoff rags Till the emergence of Maitreya Buddha That Buddha using this body May edify his disciples At that time Kasyapa contemplated on three matters First after entering nirvana his body should be dressed in his robe of castoff rags and buried under the three portions of the mountain like a child in his mothers womb without being lost or injured and be kept till the time of the DharmapitaAa of Maitreya Second if Ring Ajatasatru comes the mountain should open Kasyapa thought If King Ajatasatru could not see my body he would vomit hot blood and die Third if Ananda comes the mountain should open When he emerged from his contemplation he forsook his life and entered nirvana After his nirvana the earth quaked in six ways Sakra and innumerable heavenly beings presented various heavenly flowers as offerings to the body of Kasyapa The three portions of the mountain closed together to bury his body As Sakra and the other heavenly beings were separated from Kasyapa they felt sad and regretful and uttered the following stanza The whole world has nobody To depend upon Now this Kasyapa The second Buddha is extinct The right Dharma has collapsed like a landslide The Transmission of the THharmapitaka The ship of the right Dharma is tossing The tree of the right Dharma has withered The sea of the right Dharma is turbulent To the delight of the king of Maras Who enjoys this disaster of the Dharma After having said this they suddenly disappeared When Ananda was in the city of Rajagrha and had not yet come out Kasyapa entered nirvana The Elder Ananda having begged for food in the city of Rajagrha meditated on imper manence while King Ajatasatru dreamed that his maternal clan had perished He was startled by the dream and awoke in terror The gatekeeper reported to the king saying Kasyapa has been here wishing to see the king He was going to enter nirvana Upon hearing these words the king fainted and fell to the ground After worshipping him he stood up and wept sor rowfully saying I have just heard that the Elder Mahakasyapa has entered nirvana Ananda said in reply The Great Strenuous One has entered nirvana At that time King Ajatasatru said to Ananda Let me see Kasyapas body I wish to make offerings to it Ananda then took the king to Kukkuta Mountain Ananda saw that many Raksasas were guarding the body of Kasyapa King Ajatasatru saw the same and he also saw that Kasyapas body was covered with heavenly flowers Having seen this sight he raised his hands to pat his own head and prostrated himself at full length like a tree pushed down by an elephant to worship at the feet of the body After worshipping the body he wished to get some firewood to cremate it At that moment Ananda said Great King what do you wish to do The king replied I wish to burn the body of Kasyapa Ananda said in reply Do not bum it Do not burn it This body is preserved by divine power When Maitreya Buddha attains supreme enlightenment he will come here surrounded by ninetysix crores of disciples to take Kasyapas body and show it to them Maitreya will say This Kasyapa was a disciple of Sakyamuni He was the foremost in contentment with few desires and he also collected the Dharmapftaa of Sakyamuni Then he will utter the following stanza This recluse bhiksu surnamed Kasyapa A great disciple of Sakyamuni Buddha Whose supreme good views benefitted the world Accepted and upheld the Bhavmapitaka of that Buddha ib Maitreyas disciples will think In those days the human body was so small Was the body of Sakyamuni the same as this or larger When Maitreya Buddha sees his disciples he will say to them The samghati robe made of castoff rags in which Mahakasyapas body is wrapped was the samghati robe of Sakyamuni the Worldhonored One Upon hearing this his disciples will feel sorry and disappointed and thus his ninetysix crores of disciples will attain arhatship They will also achieve the merits derived from the observance of disciplinary rules and moral conduct They will then build a stupa on top of the mountain King Ajatasatru returned to his city and the three portions of the mountain closed together and covered the body again King Ajatasatru built a stupa to which he offered different kinds of incense and flowers The Causes of Ananda When the Elder Kasyapa had entered nirvana King Ajatasatru worshipped at Anandas feet and said Elder when the Buddha entered nirvana I did not see him and when the Elder Mahakasyapa entered nirvana I did not see him either If you Elder wish to enter nirvana I hope you will come to see me Ananda said in reply Let it be so  Now Sanakavasin the lord of merchants returned from over seas After storing away his treasures in his house he went to the Bamboo Grove The Elder Ananda was then standing at the door The Transmission of the Dharmapitoa of the preaching hall Sanakavasin went up to Ananda wor shipped at his feet and sat to the side Sanakavasin then said to Ananda Elder may it be known to you that I have returned safely from overseas and wish to hold the quinquennial assembly in order to earn merit from the Buddha and all the monks Where is the Buddha now Ananda said in reply The Worldhonored One has entered nirvana Upon hearing this Sanakavasin fainted and fell to the ground but when his attendants sprinkled water on him he soon regained his senses Then he said Where did the Elder Sariputra enter nirvana And he also inquired where Mahamaudgalyayana Mahakasyapa and some others entered nirvana After making the inquiries he said again Elder I wish to hold the quinquennial assembly in order to gain merit Ananda said You may do so as you wish And he did so as has been extensively related After the conclusion of the great assembly Ananda said to him Now you have completed the quinquennial assembly in order to gain merit from the Dharmapitaa of the Worldhonored One Sanakavasin also made a great vow saying I shall always wear this sana garment till my death The Elder Ananda received and retained eightyfour thou sand Dharma teachings all that the Buddha and the arhats had spoken Sanakavasin also received and retained them all He completely possessed the three clear insights and was wellversed in the Tripitaka At that time the Elder Ananda was residing at the Bamboo c Grove and there was then a bhiksu who recited a stanza in the following way A man lives up to a hundred years Without seeing a heron Another man lives for only one day But he has seen a heron This man has much more wisdom and fame Than the one of a hundred years He said to him The stanza you are reciting was not spoken by the Buddha You should say If one man lives for a hundred years without perceiving the rise and fall of things and if another lives for only one day but perceives the rise and fall of things this man possesses much more wisdom than the one who lives a hundred years Moreover there are two kinds of people who slander the Buddha One kind of people are infidels who slander the Buddha out of hatred and resentment The other kind though believers do not properly accept and understand the meanings of the Sutras and are also considered slanderers of the Buddha Just as a man with no feet and no mouth is useless these two kinds of people are useless as they cannot understand the proper meanings o f the words jati and aristaka mentioned in the Sutra And he also uttered the following stanza An ignorant man has no wisdom His actions are useless If a wise man does not accept the Dharma His wisdom is like poison By hearing the recitation of right knowledge One may gain the fruit of liberation The bhiksu who recited the stanza returned to the place of his teacher and said Ananda said The Worldhonored One spoke thus If one man lives for a hundred years without perceiving the rise and fall of things and if another lives for only one day and perceives the rise and fall of things the second man is much better than the one who lives a hundred years The teacher said to his disciples Ananda is getting old The Transmission of the Dharmaptfaa If a man reaches senility He loses his power of memory His wisdom and vigor Also grow old He also said to his disciple Recite as you do Do not follow his words When Ananda went again to that place he heard reciting the same stanza The Elder Ananda said to him I have told you this was not spoken by the Buddha He answered Ananda saying My teacher said that Ananda was getting old and that his memory had become poor Ananda reflected and wished to go to the teacher to tell him the meaning Then he considered the mind of the teacher He saw in his mind that the teacher would not accept the meaning He thought again Was there any other bhiksu who could tell the teacher And he saw that nobody could tell him Ananda considered the matter If the Buddha were in the world I would report the matter to him and to Sariputra Maudgalyayana Kasyapa and others But the Buddha and all the others have entered nirvana I also wish to enter nirvana By the power of the Buddha the Dharma will abide for one thousand years He also uttered the following stanza I am now thinking of myself As a bird wafting in the wind They have entered nirvana Having cleared all impurities and bonds They were lamps in the world That dispelled the darkness of ignorance O f those great energetic ones Who observed numerous rules and ceremonies I am the only one surviving Like one tree remaining in a forest Then Ananda enjoined Sanakavasin saying The Worldhonored One after having transmitted the Dharmapftaa to Mahakasyapa entered nirvana and Mahakasyapa after having transmitted it to me entered nirvana Now I wish to enter nirvana and you should accept and guard this Dharmapifoa of the Buddha In the country of Mathura there is a mountain named Urumanda In the country of Mathura there is a wealthy person who has two sons named Nata and Bhata whom the Buddha predicted would construct a monastery on that mountain Again in the country of Mathura there is a perfumer named Gupta who will have a son named Upagupta He will be a Buddha without the characteristic marks of a Buddha as was predicted by the Worldhonored One who said A hundred years after my nirvana he will perform the functions of a Buddha  Sanakavasin said in reply Let it be so Having transmitted the Dharmapftaa to Sanakavasin the Elder Ananda rose early in the morning dressed himself in his robes and went to the city of Rajagrha to collect alms of food He thought I promised that at the time of entering nirvana I should go to see King Ajatasatru Ananda then went to the royal palace and said to the gatekeeper I am here wishing to see the great king You may go into the palace to inform the king about it The gatekeeper said in reply The king is now sleeping I shall inform him after he has awakened Ananda said You may wake up the king The gatekeeper said in reply The king must not be woken up If he is awakened he will be greatly enraged and once he is enraged he will punish me The Elder Ananda said to the gate keeper When the king has awakened you should inform him that Ananda wishes to enter nirvana That is why I have come to see the king b Ananda then went into the city to collect alms After having collected alms he reflected If I enter nirvana at this place King Ajatasatru will not give a portion of my remains to the people of Vaisali and thus the people of Vaisali will certainly bear a grudge against King Ajatasatru If I enter nirvana in the country of Vaisali the people of Vaisali will certainly not give a portion of my The Transmission of the Dharmapifoa remains to King Ajatasatru and thus King Ajatasatru will also certainly bear a grudge against the people of Vaisali Therefore I shall enter nirvana in the middle of the Ganges Then the Elder Ananda went to the Ganges Meanwhile in his sleep King Ajatasatru dreamed that the handle of his canopy was broken but the canopy did not fall down He was startled by the dream and woke in fear The gatekeeper reported to the king saying Ananda has been here wishing to see Your Majesty He is going to enter nirvana Upon hearing these words the king fainted and collapsed onto the ground When he had just recovered a little consciousness he thought Where will the Elder Ananda enter nirvana At that moment a divine being in the grove said to King Ajatasatru The Elder Ananda a prince of the Buddhadharma protected the Dharmapitaka and with a mind of resolve has brought his existence in the triple world to an end With a quiet and tranquil mind he has gone to the country of Vaisali to enter nirvana King Ajatasatru then assembled his four divisions of troops elephants horses chariots and footmen and proceeded to the bank of the Ganges In the country of Vaisali there was also a divine being who uttered the following stanza to the people of Vaisali This recluse Ananda Has dispelled the darkness of ignorance To all the multitude of the world He shows equally the mind of compassion He has come to the country of Vaisali With the intention of entering nirvana At that moment Ananda was sailing in a boat to the middle of the Ganges when King Ajatasatru arrived and saluted Ananda uttering the following stanza with his hands joined palm to palm The son of the Buddha enters nirvana With a mind of equality toward the triple world The Buddha whose face resembled a lotus flower Has already entered nirvana You are the one under whom we take refuge You should never leave us or abandon us At that time the people of Vaisali worshipped at Anandas feet and said to him At this place you are remembered by men and heavenly beings but now you wish to realize extinction In this world Gautama was the supreme one with perfect wisdom and with eyes resembling lotus flowers For the benefit of the forlorn and solitary you should embrace the world The Elder Ananda thought in this way If I enter the country of Magadha the people of Vaisali will be vexed and annoyed But if I enter the country of Vaisali the king of Magadha will be vexed and annoyed Today I must think over what is appropriate for me to do Knowing that it was the proper time he uttered the following stanza ic May half of the merit of the Dharma Be given to the king of Magadha The other half of the merit To the masses of Vaisali Thus the two peoples May make offerings properly When the Elder Ananda was about to enter nirvana the earth quaked in six ways There was then a recluse possessing the five supernatural powers who was living in the Snow Mountains with five hundred disciples The recluse wondered why the earth quaked and then he perceived that Ananda was about to enter nirvana Thus he went with his five hundred disciples to Ananda and upon arriving there he worshipped at bis feet and said with his hands joined palm to palm I shall obtain from the Elder the Dharma as spoken by the Buddha and become a fully ordained monk to lead a pure life of celibacy The Transmission of the Dharmapitoa Then a conception arose in the mind of the Elder Ananda All my disciples should come When he had this idea in his mind all of his five hundred disciples being arhats came together to the assembly The Elder Ananda rotated this earth with his super natural powers and the recluse with his five hundred disciples became fully ordained monks At the first karman act of the ordination ceremony the recluse and his five hundred disciples attained the fruition of srotaapannas those who have entered the stream of holy living at the second karman they attained the fruition of sakrdagamins those who will be reborn only once more at the third karman they attained the fruition of anagamins  and at the fourth karman they attained the fruition of arhatship free from all afflictions As the recluse and his disciples became monks in the middle of the Ganges he was named Madhyantika After having done what he wished to do Madhyantika worshipped at Anandas feet and said these words Just as the Worldhonored One converted Subhadra as his last disciple and Subhadra entered nirvana before him you being my upadhyaya should also allow me to enter nirvana before you as I do not wish to see my teacher entering nirvana The Elder Ananda said to Madhyantika The Worldhonored One transmitted the Dharmapitaka to Mahakasyapa and entered nirvana and Mahakasyapa transmitted it to me and entered nirvana Now I wish to enter nirvana and you should receive and maintain the Dharmapitoa The Buddha has said The country of Kasmira is the best place for a monastery of meditation One hundred years after my nirvana there will be a bhiksu by the name of Madhyantika who will uphold the DYirmapitaka in the country of Kasmira Therefore you should take the Dharmapitaka to that country Madhyantika said in reply Let it be so Having transmitted the Dharmapitaka to Madhyantika the Elder Ananda manifested his supernatural powers and made eighteen transformations walking standing sitting lying down in midair and entering the fire samadhi After the conclusion of the samadhi his body issued rays of various colorsblue yellow ia red and whitewith flames coming out of the upper part of his body and water flowing from the lower part or water flowing from the upper part and flames coming out of the lower part At that time the body of Ananda was upright and dignified like a famous mountain out of which pure water flowed and upon which different kinds of flowers grew Ananda reflected that he wished to give half of his body to the king of Magadha and the other half to the people of Vaisali Then with his supernatural powers he fulfilled this wish to be an almsgiver By the Diamond of Wisdom he cut his mountainlike body in two and gave half of it to the kingdom of Magadha and the other half to the people of Vaisali After Ananda entered nirvana King Ajatasatru and all the heavenly beings venerated one half of his remains while the people of Vaisali venerated the other half Two stupas were erected one in the city of Rajagrha and one in Vaisali The Causes of Madhyantika When the Elder Ananda had entered nirvana Madhyantika thought My teacher instructed me to bring the Buddhas Dharmapfraa to the country of Kasmira Madhyantika then went to the country of Kasmira where he sat upon a rope couch and thought again As this country of Kasmira is a possession of the Naga king if I do not subjugate him he will not come into my realm I should enter the samddhi of suchness With the power of the samddhi of suchness he caused the country of Kasmira to quake in six ways so much so that the Naga king could not rest Thus the Naga king came to Madhyantika who then entered the samddhi of compassion The Naga king raised a gale but could not stir even a corner of robe Then he started a thunderstorm but Madhyantika transformed the thunderstorm with his divine power into heavenly blossoms such as utpala blue lotus kumuda  pundarika  and other flowers all of which dropped to the ground He also tried to injure Madhyantika with various weapons which were turned by divine The Transmission of the Dharmap itaka power into heavenly flowers He also used a big mountain to press onto Madhyantika and the big mountain became a heavenly blossom Then the following stanza was uttered in the air A big wind was blowing But it could not stir a corner of his robe Thunderstorms and weapons were turned Into celestial blossoms As snow on a mountain Under the light of sunshine Is melted altogether Without any remnant When he entered the samadhi of compassion Fire could not burn him Weapons and poisonous injuries Could never approach him Thereupon the Naga king was frightened and he then went to Madhyantika and said to him Holy man what do you instruct me to do Madhyantika said Give this place to me The Naga king said in reply It is impossible Madhyantika said It has been predicted by the Buddha that a most superior place for meditation i b would be initiated in this land namely the country of Kasmlra The Naga king said again Is this predicted by the Buddha Madhyantika replied It is so The Naga king said again How much land do you wish to have Madhyantika said I wish to have a place as large as a couch The Naga king said Such I shall give At that time Madhyantika enlarged his couch by super natural power to the size of a kutarunavaka covering the great earth The Naga king said again How many people will follow you Madhyantika said There will be five hundred arhats Again the Naga king said If there is one less than five hundred arhats I shall retake the residential place Madhyantika wondered whether there would be five hundred arhats in the Dharmapitaka Then he perceived that there would be no less nor even more than that number So he answered the Naga king saying Let it be so The Elder said again If there are almsreceivers there must be almsgivers I shall bring whiteclothed lay believers to the country of Kasmira The Naga king said Let it be so Madhyantika then brought a large number of whiteclothed lay believers to the country of Kasmira where they founded vil lages and towns The lay believers said to Madhyantika How shall we sustain ourselves in this place Madhyantika then by his supernatural powers brought the lay believers to Gandhamadana Mountain After arriving there the lay believers dug kunkuma  which they brought back and planted in Kasmira At that time all the Naga kings at Gandhamadana Mountain became angry and Madhyantika converted and subjugated them The Naga kings asked Madhyantika How long will the Worldhonored Ones Dharmapztoa stay  Madhyantika said in reply It will last one thousand years The Naga kings promised that so long as the Buddhadharma stayed in the world they would allow him to stay in their country Madhyantika said in reply Let it be so Madhyantika brought the turmeric back to the country of Kasmira and planted it While the Worldhonored Ones Dharmapitaka remained Madhyantika widely spread it and manifested various supernatural powers He studied the Buddhadharma together with the almsgivers so as to make them understand and comprehend its meaning Then he entered nirvana like a fire extinguished by water and his body was cremated with ox head sandalwood and other fragrant woods His sarira were collected and a stupa was erected for them The Causes of Sanakavasin When the Elder Ananda had entered nirvana Sanakavasin went to the country of Mathura On the way there was a monastery named Pindavana in which Sanakavasin spent a night In the monastery there were two old bhiksus who were discussing a stanza The Transmission of the Dharmapftaa Nonviolation is the first precept The best learning is the selection of the Dharma The bhiksus believed that      This was spoken by Sanakavasin i c Sanakavasin said to the two bhiksus The idea you uttered was not spoken by me What I said was the harmony of the right Dharma Elders once in the past there was a lord of merchants in the country of Varanasi who intended to sail on the great sea with five hundred traders On the way they met with apratyekabuddha who was sick The lord of merchants detained the traders to look after tine pratyekabuddha and he personally attended to him with the medicine prescribed by a physician When tine pratyekabuddha became a little better the lord of merchants took out a sana garment It had been rough and coarse but was made soft and smooth by treatment with washing and dyeing After bathing the pratyekabuddha he offered the garment to him saying Worldhonored One that garment of yours is rough and coarse May the Worldhonored One accept mine after taking a bath I shall now enter nirvana in this same garment The lord of merchants said Do not enter nirvana When I return from the sea I shall offer to you Worldhonored One garments food drink bedding and medicine so long as you do not enter nirvana I shall now sail on the sea and cannot stay here The pratyekabuddha said Now I must enter nirvana You have done great meritorious deeds for which you should feel happy Then the pratyekabuddha showed the eighteen transformations to the lord of merchants and after showing the supernatural transformations he entered nirvana The lord of merchants made offerings to the body and made a vow I have performed various meritorious deeds for this bhiksu With this good root I shall obtain what I ought to obtain The lord of merchants at that time was myself That is why I have met with a supreme teacher who caused me to gain the Way I wore this sanavasa when I became a monk in the Dharmapifaa of the Worldhonored One With this sanavasa covering my body I gained the Way and with this sanavasa covering my body I shall enter nirvana I have always worn this sanavasa even when I was a lay believer clad in white I also wore this garment That was why I was named Sanakavasin I received full ordi nation and after the completion of the fourth karman I also received the greater precepts Even before entering nirvana I shall always wear this sanavasa That is why again I am named Sanakavasin At that time the Elder Sanakavasin gradually proceeded to the country of Mathura and went to Urumanda Mountain where he sat on a rope couch On Urumanda Mountain there were two Naga kings who were brothers followed by five hundred Nagas Sanakavasin reflected If I do not subjugate them I shall not be able to edify them Thus he shook the mountain with his super natural powers Being enraged the two Naga kings went to the place of Sanakavasin started a strong storm and set a fire ia Sanakavasin entered the samadhi of compassion which could keep the storm and fire away from his body and transformed the water and fire into celestial blossoms namely utpala kumuda pundarika and other flowers which all fell to the ground The Nagas again caused a thunderstorm which was also transformed into celestial blossoms by supernatural powers They also tried to throw various kinds of weapons at Sanakavasin and these were again transformed into celestial blossoms They tried to press Sanakavasin with a big mountain and he also transformed the mountain into a heavenly flower Then the following stanza was uttered in the air A strong gale and storm Could not hurt him Thundering lightning and weapons Turned into celestial blossoms As snow on a mountain The Transmission of the Dharmapitoci Under the light of sunshine Is melted altogether Without any remnant When he entered the samadhi of compassion Fire could not burn him Weapons and poisonous injuries Could never approach him Then the two Naga kings went to Sanakavasin and said to him Holy man what do you instruct us to do Sanakavasin said in reply I wish to build a monastery on this mountain You should listen to me The Naga kings said in reply It is impossible The Elder said Such has been predicted by the Worldhonored One who said A hundred years after my nirvana a monastery with the name Natabhatika shall be constructed at the best quiet and calm place on Great Cream Mountain  The Naga kings said again Is it predicted by the Worldhonored One The Elder said in reply It is so The Naga kings said If it has been predicted by the Worldhonored One we shall listen to you Then the Elder meditated and observed whether the almsgivers of Natabhatika Monastery had been born or not and he saw that they had been born Sanakavasin rose early in the morning dressed himself in his robes carried his alms bowl and went to the country of Mathura to collect food After having collected food he went to the place of the almsgivers Nata and Bhata The two men said in reply If it is predicted by the Buddha we shall construct the monastery Then the two of them built a monastery on the mountain fully provided with garments dec orations and other articles This monastery was thus named Natabhatika ib The Causes o f Upagupta   When Sanakavasin had constructed the monastery on Great Cream Mountain he contemplated whether the perfume dealer named Gupta had been born or not and he saw that he had been born He then contemplated whether son Upagupta who would as the Worldhonored One had predicted be a Buddha without the characteristic marks of a Buddha and who will per form the functions of a Buddha one hundred years after my nirvana had been born or not and saw that he had not yet been born With his power in expedients Sanakavasin taught the per fume dealer to be energetic One day Sanakavasin went to house with a large number o f disciples on another day he went to his house with only one disciple and on still another day he went to his house alone Gupta was performing Buddhist functions and when he saw that Sanakavasin came to his house alone he asked Holy man why are you alone without any disciple following you The Elder said I am an old man how can I have anybody following me If somebody is energetic and takes delight in becom ing a monk then I shall have a follower Gupta said I take delight in the enjoyment of the five desires at home and I cannot leave my home to become a monk But if a son is born to me he will follow the Elder The Elder said Let it be so Let it be so Forever keep this promise and never go back on your word A son was then born to Gupta and was named Apagupta When he had grown up Sanakavasin went to Gupta and said to him Formerly you promised me If a son is born to me I shall give him to the Elder Now a son has been born to you You should allow him to follow me to become a monk Gupta said Now I have only one son When the second son is born I shall give him to the Elder Then Sanakavasin pondered whether this child was Upagupta or not and he saw that he was not So he said to Gupta Let it be so When the second son was born he was named Dhanagupta After he had grown up Sanakavasin went to Gupta and said to The Transmission of the Dharmapstaa i c him Formerly you promised that when your second son was born you would give him to me Now that the child is born you should allow him to follow me to become a monk Gupta said May the Elder not feel displeased I have two sons to manage my family properties together I order one to procure wealth and one to safeguard it If a third son is born I will give him to the Elder Then Sanakavasin pondered whether this child was Upagupta or not and he saw that he was not So he said to Gupta Let it be so Then the third son was born a child with handsome features and very lovable As his pleasant appearance surpassed that of other men and was second only to that of heavenly beings he was named Upagupta When this child had grown up his father kept him to make a lawful living and gained much profit Then Sanakavasin went to Gupta and said to him Good man formerly you promised that when your third son was born you would give him to me Now that this child is born you should allow him to follow me to become a monk Gupta said in reply I vowed to order him to make a living If he neither gains nor loses he will be allowed to become a monk Then the king of Maras caused all the people in Mathura to purchase his goods so that he gained profits Sanakavasin went to Guptas place when Upagupta was sell ing perfume The Elder said to him Do you know what is good and what is bad in your mind and mental activities Upagupta said in reply I do not know what is good and what is bad in my mind and mental activities The Elder said The mind and mental activities that tally with greed hatred and ignorance are bad and if they tally with nongreed nonhatred and nonignorance they are good At another time the Elder went again to Upagupta and said to him Good man how are your mind and mental activities Are they good or bad He replied saying I do not know what is good and what is bad in my mind and mental activities The Elder said If you wish to know what is good and what is bad in your mind and mental activities you should accept the Way and eliminate what is bad in your mind and mental activities I shall do some thing Then the Elder made some pills with black and white clay and said to him If an evil mind arises you may take one black pill and if a good mind arises you may take one white pill You should practice the contemplation of impurity and be mindful of the Buddha as well as meditate on him as has been said At that time Upagupta intended to do good in his mind and mental activities but he collected many black pills without even a single white one Then he thought that he should try to get twothirds black pills and onethird white ones He thought again that he should get half black pills and half white ones He further thought that he should get twothirds white pills and onethird black ones And he even thought that he should have only a good mind so that the pills he took were all white ones There was then in the country of Mathura a courtesan named Vasudatta whose maidservant once went to the place of Upagupta ia to purchase perfume and received more than she had bought When she returned her mistress asked her Where did you get so much perfume You may tell him that I desire to have enjoyment with him When the maidservant told this to Upagupta he said You may tell her that this is not the time for me to see her The maidservant returned and told this to her mistress who said He cannot afford to give me five hundred silver coins so he would not come Then she sent again her maidservant to go and tell him I need no money I only need you to come and have enjoyment with me The maidservant again went to the place of Upagupta and told him this message There was then a merchant coming from northern India to the country of Mathura with five hundred horses and various kinds The Transmission of the Dharmapitaa of merchandise An intimate friend of the rich mans son discovered his body in the filthy place and reported the matter to the king The king said to him You will seize Vasudatta amputate her hands and feet cut off her ears and nose and scatter her body in the wilds As ordered by the king her hands and feet were cut off and scattered in the wilds Upon hearing that Vasudatta had had her hands and feet cut off and scattered in the wilds Upagupta thought Formerly I did not wish to see her and enjoy the five desires with her but now I wish to see her and have a look at her hands feet ears and nose And then he uttered the following stanza b In the best of clothes was she formerly clad With different jewels was she decked Such were the things with which Her person was adorned One who takes delight in liberation Who wishes to leave the world with detestation Should not go to see her then When she was decked with precious jewels But should go to see her now Without joy and without arrogance Her beauty is in its original form The sight of her arouses disgust and repugnance Upagupta accompanied by a boy holding an umbrella went into the wilds The maidservant in remembrance o f her mistresss kindness stayed beside her to drive away the crows not allowing them to attack and peck her It is really a great pain Now I am on this ground smeared with blood and my whole body is red Such being my body how can anyone have a lustful mind at the sight of it Then she said to her maidservant Collect my hands feet ears and nose and put them in one place so that he may not see them The maidservant placed them together and covered them with a piece of cloth Then Upagupta arrived and stood looking at Vasudatta Formerly when my body was capable of enjoying the five desires I sent for you but you said that it was not the time Why do you come now when my hands and feet have been amputated and I am in a bloody mire And she uttered the following stanza Formerly this body of mine Resembled a lotus flower I wore a precious garment O f great price for its adornment But devoid of merit I could not see you Such as I am now why do you come This body of mine is without ornaments and without joy smeared with blood for scented oint ment It is for the sake of contemplating lustful desire and impurity that I have come And he also uttered the following stanza Upon hearing these words Vasudatta deeply feared rebirth and when she heard about the virtues of the Buddha she changed her mind and took delight in nirvana In reply to Upagupta she uttered the following stanza This is so this is so This is as you have said You are truly intelligent and wise And possess great kindness You should tell me more now About the Buddhas wonderful Dharma Upagupta then preached the Dharma namely the four noble truths point by point He also contemplated the body and through the contemplation of the body he realized the detestability of the world of desire As he himself preached the Dharma he thoroughly comprehended the four noble truths and attained the fruition of an anagamin while Vasudatta attained the fruition of a srotaapanna At that time Vasudatta said to Upagupta Excellent Mahasattva  it is by your power that the three evil ways and the places of great sufferings are closed and that the path leading to heaven and nirvana is opened Now I take refuge in the Tathagata the one worthy of worship and fully enlightened as well as in his Dharma and Sangha And she also uttered the following stanza I go to take refuge in the Buddha The Most Honored One among bipeds The Transmission of the Dharmapitaa Whose eyes resemble blue lotuses And who is praiseworthy among men and heavenly beings And also in his pure Dharma free from desires As well as in the supreme arhat Sangha Having made her happy through his preaching of the Dharma Upagupta returned to his own place and shortly after his depar ture Vasudatta died and was reborn in the heavens At that time the heavenly beings informed the people of Mathura that she had been reborn in the heavens After hearing this the people made offerings to her remains Upagupta thought that he was unskillful and blunt in measurement and calculation Sanakavasin went again to Gupta and said to him This son of yours has been predicted by the Buddha who said A hundred years after my nirvana he will perform a Buddhas functions You should allow him to follow me and become a monk Then Gupta allowed him to become a monk At that time the Elder Sanakavasin brought Upagupta to the Natabhatika Monastery and made him a fully ordained monk At the moment of the first karman he got rid of all bondages and attained the fruition of arhatship Sanakavasin said to Upagupta Good man you have been predicted by the Buddha A hundred years after my nirvana there will be a bhiksu named Upagupta who will be a Buddha without the characteristic marks of a Buddha and will perform a Buddhas functions And he also said that among the Buddhas disciples you would be foremost in edifying others Good man you should perform beneficial deeds for the Buddhadharma Upagupta said in reply Let it be so And Sanakavasin taught him to preach the Dharma When all the people of Mathura heard that a bhiksu named Upagupta who was a Buddha without the characteristic marks of a Buddha was going to preach the Dharma innumerable thou sands of people wished to go to listen to him The Elder Upagupta then contemplated in samdhi and saw that when the Buddha preached the Dharma his audience consisting of the four groups of devotees sat in a group shaped like a crescent moon He contemplated again In what order did the Worldhonored One teach the Dharma And he saw that the order was the taste of desire the faults of desire the outlet of desire the four faiths and so on one by one up to nirvana Upagupta also preached the Dharma in the same way At that time the king of Maras rained pearls on the assembly to distract the minds o f the people As the people in the assembly were distracted none of them could understand the four noble truths Upon seeing that the minds of the people were distracted Upagupta thought to himself Who is doing this to distract the minds of the assembly Then he found that it was being done by the king of Maras On the second day the people who came doubled in number and Upagupta again preached the true Dharma o f the four noble truths point by point At that time the king of Maras again rained b gold to distract the minds of the assembly and none of the people could understand the four noble truths Upon seeing that the minds of the people were distracted Upagupta thought to himself Who is doing this to distract the minds of the assembly Then he found that it was being done by the king of Maras On the third day the people who came doubled in number and Upagupta again preached the Dharma while the king of Maras again rained pearls mixed with gold to the accompaniment of heavenly music performed by apsaras  As the people in the assembly were not free from desire their minds were excited by the sight of the beauties and the sounds of music and they listened no more to the preaching of the Dharma The king of Maras then put a garland around the neck of Upagupta Upagupta thought W ho is doing this He found that it was being done by The Transmission of the Dharmapitoza the king of Maras He pondered in his mind As this king of Maras always caused disturbance to the Dharmapjtaa of the Worldhonored One why did the Worldhonored One not edify him Then he thought to himself I may edify him as the Buddha predicted that I would be a Buddha without the characteristic marks of a Buddha to edify people and convert them Then he considered Is this the right time for me to edify him He saw that the time had arrived for the king of Maras to receive edification At that time the Elder Upagupta took three corpses the first of a dead snake the second of a dead dog and the third of a dead man With his supernatural powers he transformed the three corpses into garlands and took them to the place of the king of Maras At the sight of Upagupta the king of Maras was greatly pleased  Upagupta has accepted my edification And he stretched his body to receive the garlands Upagupta tied him up with his own hands fastened the dead snake on his head and fixed the dead dog and dead man under his neck Upagupta said to the king of Maras As you first insulted me with unrighteous flowers now I return you by fastening corpses upon you Now you are dealing with a son of the Buddha If you have any supernatural power show it to me Just like a gale that agitates the water of the sea into waves but cannot stir Malaya Mountain so the king of Maras wished to free himself from the corpses but could not do so even though he tried with utmost effort He was as helpless as a gnat trying to move a mountain Greatly enraged the king of Maras rose up into the air and uttered the following stanza If I cannot free myself From the corpses on my neck I may be freed by other divine beings With powers greater than mine The Elder Upagupta also uttered the following stanza You may go to take refuge under Brahman  The sun the moon and Sakra You may go into fire and the great sea The corpses will not be burned rotted or loosed I have bound these corpses Tightly on your neck It was done by supernatural power And none can detach them The king of Maras went to Mahesvara and Sakra in the Thirtythree heavens as well as to the Four Heavenly Eings trying to get rid of the corpses but he could not free himself from them Then he went to Mahabrahman It is like water that cannot break the shore of a great sea He also uttered the following stanza c If Snow Mountain is bound With fibers of lotus root It can be lifted up Without much difficulty It is by the power of divinity That corpses are fixed on your body I do not have the ability To rid you of them All the powers possessed By me and the heavenly beings Cannot surpass those of the Tathagata And his disciples As other lights are inferior To the light of fire As the light of fire is inferior To the light of the sun As a man has to stand up from where he has fallen you have to stand up through his supernatural powers since your downfall was caused by his supernatural powers Then the king of Maras realized that the The Transmission of the DharmapitaAa supernatural powers of a son of the Buddha were great He pon dered over the matter and uttered the following stanza If Mahabrahman takes refuge In the Buddha his disciples and the Dharma Who else can estimate and measure The divine powers of the Tathagata The Tathagatas divine powers Really could have subjugated me But out of pity and compassion He did not subdue me Now I have come to know the powers of the Buddha and it needs no extensive reiteration He also uttered the following stanza Now I understand That the Worldhonored One is compassionate And that his mind is free from impurities Comparable to a golden mountain Because of my ignorance I disturbed the Buddha everywhere And did evil at all places But he did not subdue me by force Then the king of Maras who was the lord of the world of desire had no place to escape from Upagupta and pondered over the matter He gave up his arrogance went to Upagupta and wor shipped at his feet saying Elder since the time of the Bodhi tree up to the present day the evils I have committed against the Worldhonored One are immeasurable and innumerable Once I caused the Buddha to have no food to eat when he went to the house of a Brahman in the country of Sala That was done by me For the evils I committed the Buddha did not blame me Some times I changed myself into a dragon a snake a wicked demon or various kinds of fearful things to frighten him but the Worldhonored One never blamed me Elder today you are pitiless and cause the whole world of heavenly beings and Asuras to blame and sneer at me making me feel ashamed i a Upagupta said to him You are unwise and do not know how to think of things trying to compare the merit of the compassion of the Tathagata with that of a bhiksu It is like comparing a grain of mustard seed with Mount Sumeru or equating a glowworm with the sun or taking a scoop of water and putting it on a par with the great sea The compassion of a sramana is not comparable to that of the compassionate Buddhas of the ten quarters That was why the Buddha could endure the evils you committed The king of Maras said The Buddha had cut off all delusions and dissolved all doubts and had great patience As I was wicked and had passions I was always ready to annoy the Buddha The Worldhonored One protected me with his compassion That was why the Buddha did not subjugate me Elder you should instruct me Upagupta said in reply Good man now listen to me You committed so many evils and did so many bad things toward the Buddha that unless you cherish a mind of faith and respect for the Tathagata you cannot be absolved from your misdeeds As the Buddha had foresight far into the future he did not subjugate you He also uttered the following stanza Your mind has lacked deep respect But the Tathagata has initiated it From smallness it will increase to greatness Until you gain the fruit of nirvana Of all the evils you have committed Only a brief part has been told You should wash away the defilement of passion With the water of the wisdom of recollection He also uttered the following stanza Many things I did To vex the Worldhonored One But he was not angry I wish to be compared to a son The Transmission of the Dharmapitaka Whose guilt and faults are forgiven By his fathers pardon At that time the king of Maras spent much time in meditating on the beneficence of the Buddha and as he remembered the Buddha his mind was cooled down He worshipped at the Elders feet and uttered the following stanza The Elder today Has accepted me And enabled me to revere The Worldhonored One Now these corpses Are bound on my neck As my ornaments May the great recluse By the power of compassion Remove them for me i b The Elder Upagupta said If you can make a promise I shall remove them for you The king of Maras inquired What prom ise Upagupta said From now onward you should never annoy bhiksus The king of Maras said in reply Let it be so But you should teach me how to do it The Elder answered saying The Dharmapitaka of the Worldhonored One should be widely spread and that is what I am doing Being amazed the king of Maras said again Teach me how to do it The Elder said in reply You should know that I became a monk one hundred years after the Tathagata entered nirvana I have seen the Dharmakaya of the Worldhonored One but I have not seen his Rupakaya  As you are now accepted by me you should show me the Rupakaya of the Tathagata I now take delight in nothing else except in seeing the body of the Buddha The king of Maras replied with the following stanza When you see what I appear to be The material body of the Tathagata You must not worship me Only to the Allwise One Should homage be paid If the Elder paid it to me I should be destroyed Now I am not qualified To bear the worship of a holy man Just as the bud of an airavata tree Cannot bear the weight O f the tusk of an elephant Thus we should make this agreement I shall not worship you The king of Maras said again Just wait a few moments I shall enter the grove and transform myself into the form of the Buddha with brilliant golden hues and a halo as bright as sunlight just as I did once in the past to mislead a wealthy man named Sura Such a material body was wonderful I shall now appear as it so that all those who see it may have faith with joy Then the Elder Upagupta said in reply Let it be so And he removed the three corpses as he wished to see the physical body of the Tathagata Then the king of Maras went into the grove and transformed himself into the body o f the Buddha Having assumed the form of the Buddha he came out of the grove just as a woman goes behind a screen to adorn herself and comes out again after having dressed up The physical form of the Tathagata was incomparable and none of the people who saw it was not pleased to see it It was like a colored painting with different hues When the king o f Maras had glorified the grove with his transformed body he also appeared as Sariputra at the right side and Maudgalyayana at the left Again he appeared as Ananda holding an alms bowl at the back and as Mahakasyapa Aniruddha Subhuti and so on as one thousand two hundred fifty great sravakas surrounding the transformed Buddha in a group shaped like a crescent moon After having made these trans formations he went to Upagupta Being greatly delighted to have The Transmission of the Dharmapitoa seen the Buddhas physical form Upagupta rose from his seat and watched the physical form of the Buddha without turning his eyes away from it for a moment And he uttered the following stanza Impermanence is merciless It ruined the Tathagatas material form Impermanent was the Tathagata He dissolved his form and entered nirvana Upagupta fixed his attention on the Buddha and his mind could not part from him Now I see this transformed body and it is the same as seeing the real Buddha With a concentrated mind he put his hands palm to palm and uttered the following brief stanza in praise of the Buddha c His face is superior to a lotus flower His eyes better than the bloom of the utpala His color outshines a grove of many blossoms And also surpasses real gold He is more lovely than the moon His light is brighter than the sun His wisdom is deeper than the sea Steadier than Mount Sumeru is his immovability It was created by his own deeds And was not made by others For countless and innumerable kalpas He cultivated pure deeds of body and speech And practiced the six paramitas perfectly As ornaments for his unhindered body All those who see him are overjoyed He is admired even by his enemies Now as I see the Tathagata How can I not feel joyous As he was thinking of the Buddha Upagupta did not sense that it was Mara and prostrated himself at full length at the feet of the king of Maras like a great tree with its roots broken falling on the ground Being startled the king of Maras said Elder you should not break your promise The Elder said in reply What promise The king of Maras said We made an agreement that when I appeared as the Buddha you would not worship me Why do you worship me now The Elder rose from the ground and replied in a low voice I am not unaware that the Tathagata entered nirvana like fire extinguished by water But I saw the physical body of the Tathagata it was so wonderful that I worshipped it I did not worship you The king of Maras inquired You prostrated yourself with your head touching my feet how can you say that you did not worship me Upagupta said I neither worshipped you nor did I break my promise Now listen to me Suppose there is a Buddha image made of clay the worshipper thinks of it as the Buddha and not as clay Now as I see you I think of you as the Buddha and not as a Mara Then the king of Maras ceased to assume the appearance of the Buddha made offerings to Upagupta and returned to his own place Four days later the king of Maras struck a bell with his own hands to make an announcement to all people Those who wish to be reborn in the heavens and attain nirvana should go to Upagupta to seek advice and receive the right Dharma from him Those who have not seen the Buddha should go to Upagupta Then the king of Maras uttered the following stanza i ia Those who wish to enjoy wealth and nobility And do not like to live in poverty Who wish to enjoy heavenly bliss And the great happiness of nirvana Should listen to and accept the Dharma And ponder over its meanings and main points The Transmission of the Dharmapitaka Those who have not seen The supreme one among bipeds The great teacher possessing compassion Who spontaneously gained the holy Dharma Should all go to Upagupta He is the man acting as a bright lamp For this world At that time his voice was heard throughout the country of Mathura After Upagupta had subdued the king of Maras the Brahmans and all the other people in the country of Mathura went to Upagupta He was sitting on a lion seat and preaching the Dharma for the congregation without any fear in his mind like a lion He uttered the following stanza A man without intelligence Can never ascend the lion seat If he ascended the high seat He would be deeply struck with great fear Only a man as fearless as a lion Who can refute the theories of the heretics Is competent To ascend the lion seat Upagupta preached the Dharma point by point namely the four noble truths which were first spoken at the beginning At that time innumerable people attained the fruition of a srotaapanna a sakrdagamin or an anagdmin and eighteen thousand persons renounced their homes and attained arhatship through the prac tice of meditation and the strenuous cultivation of the Way On Urumanda Mountain there was a cave eighteen cubits long and twelve cubits broad At that time all the disciples had done what they ought to do and the Elder Upagupta said to them I have taught all my disciples to attain arhatship Each of you who have attained arhatship should put a chip four inches long into the cave In one days time eighteen thousand arhats put chips into the cave It became widely known throughout the great earth up to the seaside that in the country of Mathura there lived Upagupta who was the foremost in teaching and converting the people as the Buddha had predicted The Causes of Sanakavasins Attainment of the Way i ib  When Sanakavasin had made Upagupta a monk and Upagupta converted and subdued the king of Maras Sanakavasin thought for the sake of converting living beings I have already received the right Dharma and now I wish to proceed to the country of Kasmira to enjoy the bliss of samddhi as it was predicted by the Worldhonored One that the county of Kasmira would be a firstrate place for sitting in meditation Then Sanakavasin went there and entered a cave to enjoy the bliss of samddhi When a gust of cool wind blew on his body he realized arhatship and enjoyed the bliss of emancipation Then he uttered the following stanza Wearing a sana garment Keeping contact with five kinds of samddhi At the best place on the mountain I sit erect in meditation The Causes of Upaguptas Disciples The Causes of the Son of a Tigress When Upagupta was residing at Natabhatika Monastery on Great Cream Mountain in the country of Mathura a tigress gave birth to a cub not far from the monastery As she could not go to seek food she died of starvation With a mind of beneficence and compassion Upagupta fed the cub Upagupta had five hundred disciples who had not gained the fruition of the Way They said to their teacher Why do you feed a living being bom in an unfor tunate state of existence Their teacher said in reply Good men it is for the cause of its emancipation Upon hearing these words his disciples were amazed and had doubts in their minds How can a living being born in an unfortunate state of existence acquire the cause of emancipation The cub had a short span of life and when it was about to die Upagupta said to it All deeds are impermanent all things are devoid of an ego and nirvana is quietude You should have faith in me and abhor the way of rebirth as an animal Then the cub cherished a mind of faith and respect toward the Elder After having had faith and respect it died and was reborn among human beings in the country of Mathura When he reached the age of seven he was converted by Upagupta and became a monk and in i ic seven years he attained arhatship With his supernatural powers he plucked different kinds of flowers to offer to Upagupta Upagupta was surrounded by his disciples as the arhat dis ciple came through the air and stood before him The five hundred disciples who had not gained the Way said to their teacher This is our schoolmate He is still young so how could he have gained the merits of supernatural powers Their teacher said in reply He was the cub in his previous life and you asked me why I should feed such a living being as he It was because he had seen me and heard the Dharma that he gained his present fruition Then Upagupta preached the Dharma to his five hundred disciples And so they got a deep sense of shame cut off their passions and attained arhatship The Causes of Gorasa In southern India there was a man who became a monk in the Buddhadharma and always feared rebirth but was unable to attain nirvana He thought in his mind Who can preach the Dharma to edify me If anybody can preach the Dharma to edify me I shall attain nirvana Then he heard that in the country of Mathura there was a disciple named Upagupta whom the Worldhonored One had predicted would be the foremost in edification Having heard this he went to Upagupta in the country of Mathura  Upon reaching there he worshipped at his feet and said with his hands joined palm to palm Elder the Buddha has entered nirvana Elder you should now perform the Buddhas functions and preach the Dharma for me When Upagupta saw that this was the monks last reincarnation that he feared the pains of rebirth and that he came from a distant place with a thin and extremely weary body he said Good man rest yourself for a while The man was used to living on milk and curds but in the country of Mathura there was food and drink of every description except milk and curds so Upagupta asked him to proceed by another path On the other path the man met with a group of women carry ing milk curds beverages and ghee They were coming from another country with the intention of entering this country The women asked the Elder why he was so weak and thin He said in reply Sisters I was born in southern India and always lived on milk and curds But in this country of Mathura there is food and The Causes of Upaguptas Disciples drink of every description except milk and curds and that is why I am weak and thin Then to make him strong all the women gave him milk curds and ghee for several days Upagupta then preached the Dharma for him and he prac ticed it with diligence and attained arhatship Upagupta said to him Take a chip and put it into the cave He followed the instruction The Causes of a Southern Indian i a In southern India there was a man who had immoral relations with the wife of another man and often went to her house His mother not wanting to allow him to do so said to him If a man commits this evil deed he will stop at nothing in doing evil Out of anger that man murdered his mother and after committing the crime he went to another country As he could not satisfy his five desires in that country he felt so deeply vexed and miserable that he became a monk in the Buddhadharma Then he thoroughly mastered the Tripitaka and became a man of great erudition Surrounded by his disciples he went with them to Upagupta at Natabhatika Monastery in the country of Mathura Upagupta observed him in contemplation and saw that he had murdered his mother and that on account of this felony he could not perceive the truth or gain the fruit of the Way Although he came from a distant  place did not greet him with comfort The bhiksu then went far away from there with a mind of shame Upaguptas five hundred disciples who had not gained the Way witnessed the incident and felt displeased with their teacher He would preach the Dharma for an old bhiksu with a dull and stupid mind but would not preach for this bhiksu who is clever and intelligent wellversed in the Tripitaka and followed by his retinue Upagupta saw that his disciples harbored a feeling of anger against him and he also saw that their minds had to be con verted and quelled by his upadhyaya Sanakavasin At that time Sanakavasin was residing in the country of Kasmira and when he observed whether Upagupta was performing the Buddhas func tions or not he saw that his five hundred disciples were indignant with him and did not show respect to their teacher Having seen this he reflected cWhy does Upagupta not edify them Then he i b made a deeper observation and saw that they could not be edified by Upagupta and that they should be edified by him Sanakavasin went to that monastery by his supernatural powers while Upagupta was rambling outside Sanakavasin then entered the monastery with a long beard and long hair and wear ing a coarse garment Upon seeing him the disciples of Upagupta said to him Ignorant old man where did you come from with a long beard and long hair and wearing a coarse garment to our teachers monastery Our upadhyaya did not preach the Dharma to an intelligent bhiksu wellversed in the Tripitaka who came here before How can he preach it for you an old and dull man When Sanakavasin entered the monastery he sat on the seat of Upagupta Upaguptas disciples were angry at seeing it and tried to drag him off with their hands but he was as immovable as Mount Sumeru Then they intended to rebuke him but they lost their voices So they reported to Upagupta saying A poor old bhiksu has come into the upadhyayas monastery and is sit ting on the upadhyayas seat Upagupta said to his disciples in reply Nobody except my upadhyaya can sit on my seat When Upagupta returned to the monastery he made offerings to his  upadhyaya Sanakavasin with the utmost veneration and took a small seat sitting on it beside his teacher The name of the samadhi that is comprehended by the wisdom of a pratyekabuddha is unknown to Sariputra The name of the samadhi that  is comprehended by the wisdom of Sariputra is unknown to Maudgalyayana The name of the samadhi that is comprehended by the wisdom of Maudgalyayana is unknown to Mahakasyapa And the name of the samadhi comprehended by the wisdom of my upadhyaya is unknown to me Sanakavasin said again Good man at the time of my nirvana the Dharma of all these samadhis will be lost Moreover the Jataka stories of the Worldhonored One with their seventyseven thousand names will also be lost Ten thousand Abhidharmas will be lost too When the disciples of Upagupta heard this they felt sorry and vexed and then they thought The wisdom of this bhiksu is superior to that r i c  of our upadhyaya Thus their arrogance vanished Sanakavasin preached the Dharma to edify the disciples and all of them attained arhatship At that time the Elder Sanakavasin said to Upagupta Good man the Worldhonored One transmitted the Dharmapitaka to Mahakasyapa and entered nirvana Mahakasyapa transmitted it to my upadhyaya and entered nirvana and my upadhyaya trans mitted it to me and entered nirvana Now I transmit it to you and shall enter nirvana You should guard and protect this Dharmapitaka In this country of Mathura a man will be born with the name o f Dhltika He will become a monk and you may transmit this Dharmapitaka to him When the Elder Sanakavasin had transmitted the Dharmapitaka to Upagupta he rose into the air by his supernatural powers appeared in the four respectinspiring postures and entered the fire samddhi After the conclusion of the samddhi different kinds of flowers blue yellow red and white emerged from his body Water flowed from the upper part o f his body and fire spurted from the lower part Fire also spurted from the upper part while water flowed from the lower part His body was as upright and dignified as a mountain with water coming out from one side and fire from the other With his various super natural powers Sanakavasin made the bhiksus and lay support ers happy and free in their minds After having made such transformations he entered nirvana like a fire quenched by water At that time Upagupta and eighteen thousand arhat disciples made offerings to the body for which they built a stupa and a temple The Causes of a Northern Indian When Upagupta was residing at Natabhatika Monastery in the country of Mathura there was a good man in northern India who became a monk in the Dharma of the Worldhonored One He was welllearned and intelligent and he thoroughly mastered the Tripitaka He preached the Dharma so well and in such a good way that wherever he went he was invited by the people to preach the Dharma Thus he preached the Dharma in three ways for the people He often thought to himself W ho can preach the Dharma for me so as to enable me to gain the Way He heard that in the country of Mathura there was a bhiksu named Upagupta who was foremost in edification and had been predicted by the Buddha to be a Buddha without the characteristic marks of a Buddha After hearing this he went to that country and reached Nata bhatika Monastery Elder you are now performing the Buddhas functions May you preach the Dharma for me Then he uttered the following stanza The Causes of Upaguptas Disciples The Buddha who had great compassion Has already entered nirvana And you are now performing the functions of the Buddha For the ignorant blind and dull in the world You are the light of wisdom Illuminating the world like sunlight There is no other teacher in the world You are the only one to be our teacher The best one in edifying disciples Why did he not obtain the holy Dharma in his previous incarnation He saw that it was because the conditions were incomplete Upagupta provided the conditions to make them com plete He also saw that the mans mind took delight in the bliss of sitting in meditation and did not wish to preach the Dharma Upagupta said to him Good man if you can accept my instruc tion then I shall preach for you He said in reply I shall do so Upagupta said You should preach three kinds of Dharma He i  a asked again W hat Sutra shall I preach Upagupta said The five merits of learnedness Now I have taught you the three kinds of Dharma Then the monk preached the Dharma according to the sequence and after having preached the Dharma he attained arhatship Thus he took a chip and threw it into the cave The Causes of Devaraksita When the master merchant Devaraksita who was in the country of the Nakulas and who always took delight in almsgiving and had faith in the Buddha intended to sail overseas he announced like a lions roar If I return safely from the seas I shall sponsor the quinquennial assembly o f the Buddhadharma All the heavenly beings heard and remembered his words and all the people in the country came to know about it saying Devaraksita the master merchant has made a lions roar saying When I return from the seas I shall sponsor the quinquennial assembly of the Buddhadharma  There was then living in that country an arhat bhiksuni She observed in her meditation whether Devaraksita would safely return from the seas or not and she saw that he would safely return She also saw that after his return he would sponsor the quinquennial assembly of the Buddhadharma She again tried to see how many monks would join in the assembly and she saw that the number would be eighteen thousand arhats twice as many learners and innumerable ordinary persons Who would be the Presiding Elder of the assembly She saw that the Elder would be named Asadha Then she observed whether the Elder Asadha would be an arhat an anagamin a sakrdagamin or a srotaapanna and she saw that he would be an ordinary person She again observed whether that person would be energetic or indolent and saw that he would be energetic Then she contemplated with the intention of inquiring whether he was acting for his own benefit or for the benefit of others and she saw that he was acting for his own benefit Why am I still not in strict propriety He looked at himself again and saw that his garments were coarse and shabby and so he asked a young disciple to have them washed and dyed After having his garments dyed and tidied he wore them and sat straight The bhiksunl thought again Does the Most Virtuous One understand my words And she saw that the most virtuous monk did not understand what she meant For the third time the arhat bhiksunl went to the monastery worshipped the monks in due order and said Most Virtuous One you are not in strict propriety The most virtuous monk said angrily I have shaved i b my beard and hair and have washed and dyed my garments Why do you say I am not in strict propriety The bhiksunl said to the most virtuous monk How can you think that these are the proprieties of the Buddhadharma If you can attain the four fruitions then they are the proprieties of the Buddhadharma Furthermore Most Virtuous One the master merchant Devaraksita has made an announcement like a lions roar W hen I return safely from the seas I shall sponsor the quinquennial assembly of the Buddhadharma Have you heard that The most virtuous monk said in reply I have heard it She asked again Most Virtuous One do you know the number of monks who will join in the assembly I do not know was the reply Then the bhiksunl said of her own accord that the number of monks would be eighteen thousand arhats twice as many learners and innumerable ordi nary persons Most Virtuous One an ordinary person will be the Presiding Elder and will be the first to receive offerings in the assembly of arhats Upon hear ing these words the most virtuous monk wept sorrowfully The bhiksunl said Why do you weep Sister answered the monk I am getting old I am not competent to do anything The bhiksunl uttered the following stanza The Tathagatas Dharma can be perceived At no fixed season and occasion Again Most Virtuous One you should go to Natabhatika Mon astery where lives the bhiksu Upagupta whom the Buddha pre dicted would be the foremost in edification among his disciples Then the elderly bhiksu went stage by stage to Natabhatika Monastery in the country of Mathura He has come to greet you Most Virtuous One The bhiksu was glad to hear this and washed his feet Upagupta edified him and found him some lay supporters to look after his bath food and drink with various offerings He also said to the karmadana  Now we have a bhiksu who has gained the two liberations coming to our place of meditation All of the eighteen thousand arhats entered the place of meditation while the bhiksu came and sat on the chief seat at the place of meditation and fell asleep The karmadana took a lamp and placed it in front of him with a snap of his fingers The bhiksu was awakened and wished to take up the c lamp Then Upagupta entered the fire samadhi and thus all of the eighteen thousand arhats also entered the fire samadhi The bhiksu was glad to see this sight and uttered the following stanza All the bhiksus are sitting Crosslegged on the ground Like dragons in coils Brilliant as trees of lamps Upagupta edified him by preaching the Dharma and then the bhiksu strenuously practiced meditation and attained arhatship Having done what he wished to do he returned to his own country Upon seeing that the bhiksu had arrived the arhat bhiksuni went to the monastery and worshipped him saying Most Virtuous One you are today in strict propriety The bhiksu said in reply Sister it is all due to your effort The Causes of Upaguptas Disciples When the master merchant Devaraksita safely returned from the seas he sponsored the quinquennial assembly At that time eighteen thousand arhats joined the assembly and there were twice as many learners and innumerable ordinary persons making strenuous efforts The most virtuous Elder said the following mystic prayer to Devaraksita Tavatah yavantah evambhavantah bhavantah bhavisyati Such as it is now may it be so in the future And he repeated the same prayer at the conclusion of the meritorious quinquennial assembly Devaraksita the master merchant inquired of the Elder The Worldhonored One has preached various Dharmas Are they any different from what the Elder has said in Tavatah yavantah evambhavantah bhavantah bhavisyati The Elder said in reply Good man I said the prayer in consideration of your merits Once in the past ninetyone kalpas ago we were both master merchants and managed a big ship which we sailed overseas to obtain precious things When the ship was fully loaded we sailed back to Jambudvipa On the sea we encountered a hurricane and the ship was blown aground on a sandy beach We collected sand and built a stupa in honor of Vipasyin Buddha the fully enlightened one and offered precious things to the stupa At that time the heavenly beings showed us the way and we reequipped our big ship The heavenly beings said Tn seven days there will be a high tide which will take your ship to Jambudvipa On the seventh day the high tide came and took our ship to Jambudvipa On account of our construction of the a sand stupa I was not reborn in the evil ways of existence for ninetyone kalpas and on account of that cause I was able to attain arhatship while you were able to make offerings to eighteen thousand arhats and twice as many learners as well as innu merable ordinary persons making strenuous efforts As you have made offerings to the Three Treasures I said the prayer Moreover my good man the pains of rebirth are limitless and you should renounce your home to become a monk in the Buddhadharma Thereupon Devaraksita became a monk and attained arhatship The Causes of the Brahman with the View That the Ego Is Real When Upagupta was residing at Natabhatika Monastery in the country o f Mathura there was in Mathura a Brahman who always held the view that the ego is real He asked a Buddhist disciple Is there any being who can create birth and death The Buddhist disciple said in reply Brahman please go to Natabhatika Monas tery where a bhiksu named Upagupta is always preaching the Dharma of egolessness The Brahman went accordingly to that monastery when Upagupta was preaching the Dharma for the four groups of devotees Upon seeing the Brahman Upagupta uttered the following stanza of nonego There is no ego in the world And nothing that is mine There is no personality and no life Except the concept of birth and death Upon hearing the Dharma of egolessness the Brahman cut off his view that the ego is real and became a monk at the place where Upagupta was then preached the Dharma to him and through the energetic practice of meditation the Brah man attained arhatship Having done what was to be done the Brahman took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of Sleepiness When Upagupta was residing at Natabhatika Monastery in the country of Mathura a good man who relied upon him became a monk However this man was fond of sleep and would fall asleep even when Upagupta was preaching the Dharma Upagupta asked him to go to a place of meditation and he went there and sat crosslegged under a tree but he still fell asleep as before With his supernatural powers Upagupta caused pits one thousand cubits deep to appear at the four sides of the bhiksu to frighten him Upagupta then made a road by magic power for him to i b follow The bhiksu followed the road and came to Upagupta who asked him to go back to the place where he had been sitting The bhiksu said in reply Upadhyaya there are pits one thousand cubits deep there Upagupta said Those deep pits are small the biggest pits are those of rebirth They are known as the pits of birth old age disease death sorrow grief suffering and vexa tion If one does not know the four noble truths one falls into them The bhiksu then went back to sit crosslegged under the tree in meditation and as he feared the deep pits he did not fall asleep again With a feeling of dread he meditated energetically got rid of all passions and attained arhatship Then he took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of the Provisor When Upagupta was residing at Natabhatika Monastery in the country of Mathura a good man who was a native of the Eastern Country became a monk in the Buddhadharma and as he was able to act as a provisor whichever monastery he stayed in the bhiksus always asked him to be their provisor So he went to that place and upon arriving there he worshipped at his feet and said Most Virtuous One the Buddha has entered nirvana and you Most Virtuous One are performing the Buddhas functions May you preach the Dharma to me Upagupta con templated and saw that this was last reincarnation and that he feared rebirth He contemplated again why he did not gain the Holy Way and saw that it was because conditions were incomplete What were the expedients by which to make them complete If he could act again as a provisor the conditions would be complete But he also saw that the man was extremely tired of it and did not wish to act as a provisor The bhiksu also asked How many monks are there in this monastery The Most Virtuous One said in reply There are eighteen thousand arhats twice as many learners and innumerable energetic ordinary persons Then the bhiksu acted as a provisor to all the monks so that they might concentrate their minds on the practice of the Way The provisor bhiksu rose up early dressed in his robes and with alms bowl in hand went into the country of Mathura There was then a wealthy man coming out of the country of Mathura and he met the bhiksu on the way He had never met him before it was the first time he had seen him Upon seeing him he worshipped at his feet and after worshipping him he asked Most Virtuous One are you coming from a far distance or from somewhere near here The bhiksu replied I come from the Eastern Country The wealthy man asked him For what business have you come here The bhiksu said in reply I came to Upagupta with the intention of hearing the Dharma But Upagupta asked me to be provisor to the monks I do not know who are zealous and who are not zealous among the people of Mathura The wealthy man said You need not worry about this matter I shall be the provisor in your stead I shall provide all the monks with all their food drink clothes and medicine Then the bhiksu and the wealthy man jointly provided food and drink and other things as offerings to the monks for the three months of the retreat during the rainy season The bhiksu The Causes of Upaguptas Disciples contemplated the merits he had achieved and attained arhatship So he took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of the Artisan There was then in the Eastern Country a good man who became a monk in the Buddhadharma and as he was a good artisan wherever he went the monks would ask him to construct monas teries and build houses As he did so every day without ceasing he was greatly tired of the task So he thought to himself I wish to sit in meditation and contemplation The Buddha has said that all bhiksus should sit in meditation to cultivate the Way and should not be lazy and indolent And he reflected Who can preach the Dharma to edify me Then he heard that in the country of Mathura there was a bhiksu by the name of Upagupta whom the Buddha had predicted would be foremost among the disciples in edifying others So he went to him worshipped at his feet and said Most Virtuous One the Buddha has entered nirvana and you Most Virtuous One are performing the Buddhas functions May you preach the Dharma to me Upagupta saw that this was the monks last reincarnation and that he feared rebirth He contemplated again why he did not obtain the Holy Way and saw that it was because causes were incomplete What were the expe dients by which to make them complete He saw that if the man acted again as an artisan the causes would be complete But he saw that the man was extremely tired of it and did not wish to act as an artisan Upagupta said to him Good man if you follow my instruc tions I shall preach the Dharma to you Let it be so was the reply And so he got up early took up his alms bowl and went into the country There was then a wealthy man coming out of the country of Mathura He met the bhiksu on the way whom he had never seen before it was the first time he had seen him I shall make various preparations for the bhiksus Then the bhiksu and the wealthy man intended to build a monastery at a place where there was no monastery Working together with the wealthy man the bhiksu held a rope to measure the ground Before the rope touched the ground he contemplated the merits he had achieved therefrom and got rid of all passions After having attained arhatship he took a chip and threw it into the cave The Causes of Food and Drink In the country of Mathura there was a good man who became a monk at the place where Upagupta was and as he was greedy for food he could not gain the Way Upagupta said to him I shall give you some food tomorrow On the following day he filled a vessel with gruel and placed it together with an empty vessel in front of him saying You may take the food and empty the vessel He also said Cool the gruel and eat it slowly As the bhiksu was greedy for food he wished to eat more So he blew on the gruel to make it The Causes of Upaguptas Disciples cool This he did once or twice and then he said to the upddhydya I have cooled it down Upagupta said Although you could cool the milk gruel your mind is hot with the fire of desire and love You should also cool the heat of your greediness and wash away the heat in your mind with the water of the contemplation of impurity If you are fond of food and drink you should consider them as if you were taking medicine When the bhiksu had taken all the gruel he vomited it and filled up the empty vessel Upagupta said You should eat it up The bhiksu said to the upddhydya This vomit is unclean how can I eat it Upagupta said again You should now con template that all things are impure like snot and spittle Then Upagupta preached the Dharma to him and after hearing the Dharma the bhiksu diligently practiced meditation and attained arhatship He took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of Contentment with Few Desires There was a good man in southern India who became a monk in the Buddhadharma and was contented with few desires taking i b no delight in earthly glory never rubbing his body with ghee never bathing in warm water and never eating ghee for he was always in fear of rebirth As his constitution was weak in the four ele ments he did not gain the Holy Way He thought in his mind Who can preach the Dharma to me Then he heard that in the country of Mathura there was a bhiksu by the name of Upagupta whom the Buddha had predicted would be the foremost among his disciples in edifying others So he went to him and worshipped him with hands joined palm to palm saying Most Virtuous One the Buddha has entered nirvana and you Most Virtuous One are performing the Buddhas functions May you preach the Dharma to me Upagupta saw that it was his last reincarnation and that he feared rebirth He contemplated again why he did not gain the Holy Way and he saw that he was weak in his four elements and so he always took delight in crudeness and simplicity and did not wish for earthly glory Upagupta said to him Good man you should follow my instructions and I shall preach the Dharma to you Let it be so was the reply In order to edify him Upagupta asked the lay supporters to prepare various foods and drinks and baths for the monks He also said to a young bhiksu You should help this bhiksu to take a bath The young bhiksu then rubbed the mans body with ghee and bathed him in warm water At mealtime different kinds of delicious food were provided for him and the bhiksu finished all the food In a few days when his body had gained strength Upagupta preached the Dharma to him Through energetic meditation the bhiksu attained arhatship and then he took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of the Raksasas In the country of Mathura there was a man who asked permission of his parents to become a monk He went to Upagupta and upon reaching him he worshipped at his feet and said Most Virtuous One may I renounce my home to become a fully ordained bhiksu in the Buddhadharma On the way he thought If I reach home I might be detained and not allowed to become a monk Midway there was a Deva temple and so he went in to spend the night there Upagupta produced two Raksasas by his supernatural powers one of whom carried a corpse into the temple and the other of whom went in emptyhanded In the temple the two of them contended for the corpse One said I obtained this corpse The other one also said I obtained this corpse In this manner the two Raksasas competed with each other for the corpse without coming to a decision They asked the man W ho carried this corpse into the temple The man reflected If I tell the truth then the one who came in emptyhanded will The Causes of Upaguptas Disciples certainly kill me If I do not tell the truth the one who came with the corpse will kill me But I would rather die than tell a lie So he said to the devils He carried it here The devil who came emptyhanded grasped his arm and intended to eat him but the devil who came with the corpse helped him to free himself from the grip The devil again got hold of his foot and intended to eat him and the devil who came in with the corpse again helped him to free himself from the hold In this c manner they struggled for a long time until sunrise Two days later the man came to Upagupta and upon reaching there he was made a monk He practiced the Way diligently and attained arhatship Then he took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of the Tree In the country of south India there was a good man who became a monk in the Buddhadharma but was bound to his body by a feeling of affection He rubbed his body with ghee bathed it in warm water and nourished it with various kinds of food and drink As he was so much attached to his body he could not attain the Holy Way So he thought W ho can preach the Dharma to me When he heard that in the country of Mathura there was a bhiksu named Upagupta who had been predicted by the Buddha to be the foremost among his disciples in edifying others he went to Upagupta in the country of Mathura Upagupta then brought him to the mountains where he produced a big tree by his super natural powers and he said You should climb up this big tree The bhiksu then climbed up the tree Under the tree a large pit one thousand cubits in depth and width was also produced by miracu lous power Upagupta said to the bhiksu again Put down your feet one by one The bhiksu accepted the instruction and put down his feet He said again Let go of one hand This the bhiksu did as he was instructed He said again Let go of the other hand The bhiksu said in reply If I let go of the other hand I shall drop into the pit and die Upagupta said You have agreed with me that you will accept all my instructions Why do you not accept my words now At that moment the affection of the bhiksu for his body van ished and when he let go his hand and dropped down he did not see any pit under the tree Upagupta preached the Dharma to him and he diligently practiced meditation Thereupon he attained the fruition of arhatship Then he took a chip and put it into the cave a The Causes of a Miser In the country of Mathura there was a good man who became a monk at the place where Upagupta was but he was a great miser Due to his stinginess he could not gain the Holy Way You should also offer the Dharma to others Even the food and drink you have received in your begging bowl should be given to others as alms If you cannot give extensively you should share the food the moment you receive it with the two persons sitting beside you On account of his illiberality the man did not share his food with others for one day and even for two days The two persons who sat beside him were both arhats Only on the third day when he had received a large amount of food and drink did he share it with the two persons Then Upagupta edified him by preaching the Dharma to him and through meditation he attained arhatship Then he took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of Upaguptas Disciples The Causes of the Ghost Once in the country of Mathura there was a good man who became a monk at the place where Upagupta was but he was fond of sleeping Upagupta preached the Dharma to him and brought him to a forest where he fell asleep in the course of practicing medita tion under a tree In order to frighten him Upagupta transformed himself into a ghost with seven heads Holding the branch of a tree he suspended the ghosts body in the air before the bhiksu who was startled from sleep and had a great fear of it He rose from his seat and returned to his original place but Upagupta ordered him to go back to the place of meditation The bhiksu said  Upadhyaya in that forest there is a ghost with seven heads holding the branch of a tree and suspending its body in the air before me in a very fearful manner Upagupta said Bhiksu there is nothing fearful in the ghost What is most fearful is the mind of sleepiness If a bhiksu is killed by a ghost he will not enter rebirth but if he is killed by sleepiness he will experience endless birth and death The bhiksu then returned to the place of meditation and saw the ghost again As he feared the ghost he dared not sleep Then the bhiksu diligently practiced meditation and attained arhatship So he took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of Being Bitten by Vermin Once in the country of Mathura there was a good man who became a monk at the place where Upagupta was Upagupta preached the ib Dharma to him and the bhiksu practiced meditation diligently with the intention of just gaining the fruition of a srotaapanna As he was not indolent in his practice he might be able to rid himself of the fear of being born in the evil ways of existence and then would be reborn seven times in the heavens and seven times among human beings Then after having enjoyed the bliss of men and heavenly beings he would enter nirvana Having perceived his intention Upagupta went with him to the country of Mathura to collect alms from house to house They came to the house of a candala  whose son had gained the fruition of a srotaapanna but suffered from a nasty disease his whole body was bitten by vermin and he had foul breath Upagupta said to his disciple Look at this child Though he is a srotaapanna he still suffers such pains And he uttered the following stanza Born in the caste of candalas Attached to the pleasures of the three realms With vermin biting his body He loved pleasure freely and so He fell into the pains of the three realms Look at this son of the Buddha He has gained the Way And was able to overthrow the three evil ways But as he was idle and thoughtless He was born in the caste of candalas You should not cherish such an idea But should meditate upon the pains of the three realms The bhiksu inquired saying W hat were the deeds by which this person attained the stage of a srotaapanna but has to suffer such pains Upagupta said in reply In a previous life he became a monk in the Dharma o f Sakyamuni Buddha and he was a karmadana while the monks were sitting in meditation Among the monks there was an arhat who suffered from such a malignant disease that he scratched noisily So he thought to himself I have now attained the fruition of a srotaapanna and there is no need to be energetic any more The child today is the karmadana of the past As he scolded the arhat took him out and sent him to the place for candalas he is now receiving the retribution When the bhiksu heard about this matter he had deep fear and cultivated devotion diligently whereby he attained the frui tion of arhatship Upagupta also converted the candalas son who abhorred the Kamadhatu and attained the fruition of an andgamin Thereupon he passed away and was reborn in the five Pure Dwelling heavens A chip was taken and put into the cave c The Causes of Contemplation on a Skeleton In the country of Mathura there was a good man who became a monk at the place where Upagupta was Upagupta taught him the contemplation of impurity and so on and by the contemplation of impurity he suppressed his passions so that they could not arise Upagupta said Good man you should be energetic do not be idle and negligent said in reply I have done what is to be done and have attained arhatship Upagupta said Good man have you seen the woman wine seller named Stonecutter who lives in the domain of the country of Gandhara This woman claims to have gained the Way just as you do and says that her passions have been cut off while they are not cut off This is undue selfconceit You should observe whether this woman has gained the Way or not The bhiksu said I cannot see her He wished to go to that country and his teacher gave him permission He rose early in the morning put on his robe carried his alms bowl and entered the village to collect food The wine selling woman took out some food and intended to give it to the bhiksu but at the sight of the woman his mind was excited by lustful desire He took some grits and butter out of his own alms bowl to give them to the woman At the sight of him the womans mind was also excited by lustful desire and she smiled revealing her teeth Before touching her body or even exchanging a word with her the bhiksus mind was excited But when he saw the woman smiling and revealing her teeth he contemplated im purity and perceived that her whole body was nothing but a skel eton After making this contemplation he attained arhatship Having done what was to be done he uttered the following stanza An idiot is ignorant On seeing external beauty He craves it with attachment A man who has wisdom Perceives the internal ugliness And may obtain liberation The ignorant one is bound By outward appearance One who is wise is not bound By external appearance The bhiksu returned to Upagupta in the country of Mathura and Upagupta asked him Did you see that woman said in reply I saw her according to the Dharma Then he took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of Upaguptas Disciples The Causes of Avarice ia In the country of Mathura there was a householder who was enormously rich at the beginning but gradually became poor after wards having only five hundred silver coins in his possession He thought in his mind I wish to become a monk in order to cultivate the Way in the Buddhadharma In case I need medicine and robes after becoming a monk I may use this money to purchase them So he went to become a monk at the place of Upagupta and ordered his servant to guard the money every day Upagupta said Good man according to the Dharma of becoming a monk one should be contented and with little desire What is the use of these five hundred silver coins You should offer them to the Sangha The bhiksu said in reply This is the money for me to buy medicine and the three robes Upagupta asked him to go into his room where he produced by miraculous power one thousand silver coins and said to him This money is given to you for buying medicine and the three robes When the bhiksu heard this he gave up his five hundred silver coins as alms to the Sangha Upagupta preached the Dharma to him The bhiksu then practiced meditation dili gently and attained arhatship and so he took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of a Bamboo Brush In the country of Mathura there was a good man who became a monk to cultivate the Way at the place where Upagupta was Upagupta preached the Dharma to him and the bhiksu practiced meditation diligently attaining the fruition of a srotaapanna So he thought in his mind I have overturned the evil ways of existence and have done what ought to be done Upagupta said Good man you should be energetic do not be idle and negligent The bhiksu said in reply I have already attained the fruition of a srotaapanna and have overturned the evil ways of existence I shall not be idle and negligent again but shall be reborn seven times in the heavens and seven times among human beings to enjoy the bliss of men and heavenly beings and then I shall enter nirvana Wishing to arouse his fear  Upagupta rose early in the morning put on his robe took up his alms bowl and went with the bhiksu to the country of Mathura to collect food from house to house They came to the house of a candala whose son was a srotaapanna but suffered from a malignant ulcer The physician said to him You should brush the ulcer with a bamboo brush to make it bleed and I shall apply medicine to the wound Upon hearing this advice the man brushed his body often every day with ib a bamboo brush On seeing this sight Upagupta showed it to his disciple and said Good man did you see this srotaapanna suffer ing from such pains The bhiksu said in reply Upadhyaya what were the deeds that produced such pains Upagupta said in reply This person became a monk in the  Dharma of right enlightenment of Sakyamuni Buddha There was then a bhiksu who acted as a karmadana to supervise those who were sitting in meditation Among the monks there was an arhat who came to sit in meditation at the place for meditation and as he suffered from scabies he scratched himself The karmadana said to him Most Virtuous One why dont you take a bamboo brush to brush your body so that you can make a noise He took him by the hand and led him out of the place for meditation saying You ought to go to the house of a candala and not disturb the monks The arhat said in reply Good man you should be energetic do not be idle and negligent so that you suffer the pains o f birth and death Upon hearing these words the karmadana repented before the Most Virtuous One and when he had repented he attained the fruition of a srotaapanna The bhiksu then thought in his mind I have overturned the evil ways of existence and there is no need to be energetic any more  Upagupta said to his disciple The karmadana at the place of meditation in a previous life is now this candalas son Because he said to the arhat in his former life Why dont you brush your body with a bamboo brush he is now receiving this retribution that The Causes of Upaguptas Disciples requires him to brush his body with a bamboo brush today In his former life he also said to the Most Virtuous One You should go to the house of a candala Thus he was born in the caste of candalas in his present life When Upaguptas disciple heard these words he had fear in his mind He practiced meditation diligently and attained arhatship Upagupta also preached the Dharma to the candalas son who abhorred the Kamadhatu He attained the fruition of an anagamin whereupon he passed away and was reborn in the five Pure Dwelling heavens A chip was taken and put into the cave The Causes of Parental Sentiment In the country of Mathura there was a householder to whom a son was born but the child died at the age of one He was reborn in the house of another householder and died at the age of two He was again reborn in the house of still another householder and died at the age of three In this manner he was reborn in a fourth fifth sixth and seventh place At the seventh place he had lived to the age o f seven when a thug kidnapped him and took him to the mountains Upagupta saw in contemplation that this was the last reincarnation of the child and in order to convert him he went to the mountains and sat crosslegged There he produced by miraculous power the four divisions of troopselephants horses chariots and footmen As the thug was frightened he went to Upagupta who withdrawing his miraculous power preached the Dharma to him Upon hearing the Dharma the thug perceived the four noble truths and became a monk He practiced the Way in the Buddhadharma and handed over the child to Upagupta Upagupta asked the child to renounce his home and preached the Dharma to edify him Through the diligent practice of meditation the child attained arhatship Having gained sainthood he contemplated and saw that his parents were in great distress So he returned to his parents and said Parents do not be distressed On seeing that their son had c come back the parents were greatly delighted The child arhat preached the Dharma to his parents until they attained the frui tion of srotaapannas Then he went to his sixth parents and said to them Parents do not be worried I was your son once born and reared by you and died at the age of six His parents were greatly delighted to hear this and when he had preached the Dharma to them they attained the fruition o f srotaapannas In this manner he preached the Dharma and edified his fifth fourth third second and first parents until all of them attained the fruitions of srotaapannas Then he took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of the River In the country of Mathura there was a good man who became a monk at the place where Upagupta was and as Upagupta preached the Dharma to him he cultivated himself diligently and attained the four stages of dhyana When he reached the first stage of dhyana he had the impression of being a srotaapanna at the second stage of dhyana he had the impression of being a sakrdagamin at the third stage of dhyana he had the impression of being an anagamin and at the fourth stage of dhyana he had the impression of being an arhat The bhiksu was greatly frightened when he saw that the robbers were coming to kill him and then he thought I am not an arhat If I were an arhat I would have no fear I may be an anagamin The Causes of Upaguptas Disciples Among the merchants there was the daughter of a house holder who had lost her companion and had no friend Upon seeing the bhiksu she worshipped at his feet and said to him May the holy person take me along and travel with me The bhiksu said The Worldhonored One has made a rule that should not travel with a woman alone You may follow me at a distance as far as if I were a lion Upagupta then produced a big river and the bhiksu intending to cross the river waded through the water at the lower reaches of the stream while the woman waded through the water at the upper reaches When the bhiksu saw that the woman was nearly drowning in the middle of the river he thought The Worldhonored One permitted a monk to drag a woman out of the water when she was about to be drowned he does not commit an offense thereby Having thought so he pulled her out of the water and when the woman had been pulled out a lustful desire was aroused in his mind Then he thought again I am not a an anagamin An anagamin is free from lustful desire I may be a sakrddgamin or a srotadpanna When the woman was brought ashore he thought Now I wish to cast away all the disciplinary rules to cohabit with this woman Upagupta withdrew his miraculous power and stood before the bhiksu saying Good man are you an arhat At that time the bhiksu repented in the presence of Upagupta who preached the Dharma to him The bhiksu practiced meditation diligently and attained arhatship and then he took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of a Whim in Meditation In the country of Mathura there was the son of a householder The bhiksu accepted the instruc tion and went to the mountains where he sat crosslegged under a tree Before becoming a monk the bhiksu had a wife with regular features and when he was sitting in meditation he thought of his former wife Upagupta transformed himself into the form of the bhiksus exwife and stood before him Upon seeing the transfor mation the bhiksu said to her Why did you come The woman said in reply You called for me The bhiksu said I was sitting here and never said anything How could I have called for you The woman said in reply You called for me mentally while in meditation for enlightenment though not orally The woman then uttered the following stanza A shameful thing is of two kinds One is oral and one is in the mind Of these two kinds A mental shame is worse Without awareness in the mind There could be no oral utterance Upagupta withdrew his miraculous power and returned to his own form and standing before the bhiksu he uttered the following stanza If you were not delighted To look at that woman And did not wish to see her You would not think of her If you have relinquished desire You should take no such delight What one has vomited One should never eat again Upagupta further preached the Dharma  who practiced meditation diligently and attained arhatship Then he uttered the following stanza The upadhyaya has seen reality And has edified me As I venerated him I have gained the Holy Way Then he took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of Upaguptas Disciples The Causes o f the Cowherds ib Once Upagupta was going to the country of Central India and on the way there he saw five hundred cowherds Upon seeing Upagupta the five hundred cowherds went to him and Upagupta preached the Dharma to them When they had heard the Dharma they perceived the four noble truths Thus they offered their cows to Upagupta and became monks at his place practicing the Way Upagupta preached the Dharma to them and all of them attained arhatship They took chips and put them into the cave The Causes of the Transformed Person In the country of Mathura there was a good man who became a monk at the place where Upagupta was in order to practice the Way Upagupta preached the Dharma to him and after having heard the Dharma he reached the four stages of worldly dhyana At the first stage of dhyana he had the impression of being a srotaapanna at the second stage of dhyana he had the impres sion of being a sakrdagamin at the third stage o f dhyana he had the impression of being an anagamin and at the fourth stage of dhyana he had the impression of being an arhat saying I have done what is to be done And so he became idle and indolent and was no longer energetic Upagupta said to him You should be energetic do not be lazy and negligent The bhiksu said in reply I have done what is to be done and have even attained arhatship Upagupta asked him to go to the mountains to sit in medita tion and he also transformed himself into another bhiksu in order to sit with him in meditation and give him advice the transformed bhiksu taught him the methods of meditation and also asked him W ho accepted you to become a monk and who is your upadhyaya The bhiksu said in reply Upagupta is my upadhyaya and he accepted me as a monk The transformed bhiksu said It is a great merit for you to have Upagupta a Buddha without the characteristic marks o f a Buddha for your teacher He also inquired What scriptures are you reading and reciting From the Sutras the Vinaya and the matrka have you gained anything of the Buddhadharma The bhiksu answered saying I have attained the fruition of a srotaapanna and even arhatship The transformed person asked again By which way did you attain them The bhiksu said in reply I attained them by the worldly way The transformed person said What you have attained is but the way of worldly truth You have not gained the Holy Way Upon hearing these words the bhiksu was deeply vexed with grief So he went to Upagupta and said to his upadhyaya I am but an ordinary person May the upadhyaya preach the Dharma to me Upagupta accordingly preached the Dharma to him and through diligent practice of meditation the bhiksu attained arhat ship He took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of Taking No Delight in the Dwelling Place c In the country of Mathura there was the son of a householder Not long after he had taken over the family properties he cherished the desire to become a monk and said to his parents Permit me to become a monk to practice the Way His parents said in reply We have no child except you We are still living so how can you leave us behind to become a monk When the son heard what his parents had said he was vexed with grief and for six days he refused to take food After having become a monk he thought to himself I have previously promised my parents that after becoming a monk I would go to see them frequently So he said to his upadhyaya that he was going to his parents Wait for some time I wish to know your intention and when your intention is satisfied you may give up the disciplinary rules Then he ordered him to go to the country of Mathura and he transformed himself into the corpse of the bhiksus former wife being carried by four persons out of that country The bhiksu was then going back to see his parents when he saw a corpse being carried out midway  He asked the corpse bearers Who is this person They said in reply This is the corpse of the wife of soandso the son of a householder who recently became a monk She died of vexation and despondence We are removing it to the sitavana  Having heard this the bhiksu went with them wishing to see the body Upagupta caused the corpse to emit many worms and blood Upon seeing this sight the bhiksu entered into the contemplation of impurity and through diligent practice of meditation he attained arhatship When he had done what was to be done he went to Upagupta and worshipped at his feet Upagupta said Did you see your wife He answered saying I saw her in accordance with the Dharma Then he took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of a Monks Pewter Staff In the country of Mathura there was a good man who became a monk at the place where Upagupta was Upagupta preached the Dharma to him and after having heard the Dharma the bhiksu gained the four stages of worldly dhyana The bhiksu thought to himself I have done what is to be done There is no need to be energetic any more Upagupta said to him Good man you should be energetic do not be lazy and negligent The bhiksu said in reply Upadhyaya I have done what is to be done and have attained arhatship ia The upadhyaya ordered him to rise early in the morning dress himself in his robes hold his alms bowl take up his pewter staff and go into the presence of the monks before entering into the country There were then five hundred upasakas following behind him with food and drink in their hands Upon seeing them the bhiksu knew that they respected him and he claimed to be a man of superior merits Thus he had a feeling of selfconceit and then he reflected I am not an arhat May you preach the Dharma to me Upagupta accordingly preached the Dharma to him and through the practice of meditation the bhiksu attained arhatship Then he took a chip and put it into the cave The Causes of Sudarsana In the country of Kasmira there was a bhiksu by the name of Sudarsana who had gained the four stages of worldly dhyana and was esteemed by the Naga king Then a drought with scorching heat occurred in the country of Kasmira and all the people asked the bhiksu to pray for rain Upagupta reflected I wish to edify Sudarsana and it is time now For the sake of expedient edifica tion Upagupta caused that there should be no rain for twelve years and when the heretics saw this phenomenon they said to the people There will be rain after the lapse of twelve years The people being worried and distressed to hear these words went to Upagupta and asked him to pray for rain Upagupta said I should not pray for rain In the country of Kasmira there is a bhiksu by the name of Sudarsana and you may go to beseech him Then the people of Mathura sent a messenger to Sudarsana asking him to pray for rain As Sudarsana possessed the mirac ulous powers of the four stages of dhyana he went to the country of Mathura by divine power and the people asked him to The Causes of Upaguptas Disciples pray for rain Then Sudarsana prayed for rain which poured down on the earth filling the whole of Jambudvipa The people thought Since the bhiksu Sudarsana was able to cause such a torrential rain he is superior to Upagupta At that time Sudarsana followed by many people was going out of the country of Mathura while Upagupta followed by a few people was coming into the country of Mathura When the bhiksu Sudarsana saw that many people were following him while only a few people were following Upagupta he had a feeling o f selfconceit and then he reflected I am not an arhat An arhat should have no selfconceit So he went to the place o f Upagupta and upon arriving there he worshipped at his feet and said The Buddha has entered nirvana Most Virtuous One you are perform ing the Buddhas functions May you preach the Dharma to me Upagupta said You are not keeping the precepts in the right way as taught by the Buddha and you claimed superiority over me giving rise to arrogance and selfconceit Where did the Buddha say that he allowed his bhiksus to pray for rain Upagupta preached the Dharma to him and upon hearing the Dharma the bhiksu diligently practiced meditation and attained arhatship So he took a chip and put it into the cave b The Causes of the Fief for a Monastery Upagupta constructed not one but a hundred monasteries in the country of Mathura At that time the king of Mathura was named Citraketu a man who had no faith but troubled and disturbed the monks as well as their attendants and almsgivers Then the innumerable monks together with their attendants and alms givers went to Upagupta and told him about this matter I must go in person By miraculous power Upagupta suddenly disappeared in a wink from Natabhatika Monastery and reached Kukkuta Monastery in the city of Pataliputra Upon hearing that Upagupta was coming King Asoka deco rated the frontier with incense and flowers arranged dancers and musicians with various kinds of adornment and went with his ministers and people of the country to welcome Upagupta The reigning King Citraketu of that country has no faith but troubles and disturbs the Buddhadharma It befits Your Majesty to ask him to protect the Buddhadharma King Asoka then ordered his minister Radhagupta saying Y ou will dispatch a man immediately to kill that king Upagupta said to King  Do not kill that king Let Your Majesty just instruct him not to trouble and disturb the Buddhadharma again hence forward King Asoka then wrote a letter with his own hands marked it with his teeth and handed it to a Raksasa After taking the letter the Raksasa instantly reached that country King Citraketu received the letter respectfully and read it and after reading the letter he struck a drum and made an announcement that thence forth all people in the country should not trouble or disturb the Buddhadharma Then King Asoka prepared various kinds of offerings and after having accepted the offerings Upagupta suddenly disappeared from Kukkuta Monastery and returned to Natabhatika Monastery The Causes of Upaguptas Disciples The Causes of Dhitika Upagupta contemplated whether Dhitika was born or not and saw ic that he was not yet bom Thenceforth he went to the place of parents every day One day he went to their house with many b h i k s u s  another day he went there with only two b h i k s u s  and on still another day he went alone The householder seeing that Upagupta came alone to his house asked him Holy man why do you not have any disciples following you The elder said in reply I have no disciple The householder said I take delight in living at home and would not like to become a monk If a son is born to me I shall give him to you Most Virtuous One to be your disciple Then a son was born to the householder but he died shortly afterwards When the second son was born he also died soon When the third son was born he was named Dhitika and given to Upagupta to become a monk Upagupta made him a fully ordained monk At the moment of performing the first k a r m a n  he attained the fruition of a s r o t a a p a n n a  and at the moment of performing the fourth k a r m a n  he attained arhatship This cave which is eighteen cubits in length and twelve in breadth is already filled up with chips four inches long Now I wish to enter nirvana you should safeguard and protect this p a r in ir v a n a  Dharmap i t a k a  Seven days later when Upagupta was about to enter nirvana various heavenly beings made the matter known to all the people in the whole of Jambudvlpa among whom there were a hundred thousand arhats while harmonious learners energetic ordinary bhiksus and whiteclad lay people were innumerable and count less When the time arrived for the nirvana of Upagupta he rose up into the air by supernatural powers and made different kinds of miraculous transformations in the postures of walking stand ing sitting and lying down When he was in the samadhi various colorsblue yellow red and whiteissued from his body When water flowed out from the upper part of his body fire spurted from the lower part when water flowed out from the lower part fire spurted from the upper part With various divine powers he aroused a feeling of great happiness in the minds of his fellow monks and all human and heavenly beings and enabled them to gain emancipation Then he entered nirvana like a fire quenched by water The chips collected were used to cremate his body and a stupa was built to which offerings were made At the time of Upaguptas nirvana a thousand arhats also sacrificed their lives and entered nirvana When Dhitika had a safeguarded and protected the Dharmapifoa he also entered nirvana This is the end of the Causes o f Upagupta The right Dharma always abides For a long time without dying The stupa containing sariras Will also last like this May the people who uphold the Dharma Enjoy happiness illimitable May they live in the same way Always abiding and imperishable From the Causes of King Asoka up to the nirvana of Upagupta there are altogether thirtyone hundred verses each consisting of thirtytwo syllables in the foreign  The number of disciples is twentyeight persons xviiiTHE COLLECTION FOR THE PROPAGATION AND CLARIFICATION OF BUDDHISM VOLUME I Compiled by Shi Sengyou at Jianchu Temple in Yangdu during the Liang dynastyFascicle One Preface The awakening is as boundless as the ocean The wisdom is as completely illuminating as a mirror The law dominates beyond the world in which we cling to language therefore it created the Duke of Zhou and Confucius just as if fashioning clay into gures Nevertheless the greater the Way is the more difcult it is to believe the higher the tone of the music the fewer there are who can sing it harmoniously Mount Sumeru is lofty and steep where very strong winds Skt Treasures accumulate in a depository and then theft occurs Once upon a time when the Tathāgata resided in this world his edication shook the trichiliocosm and yet the four devils harbored grudges and the six masters embraced poisonous thoughts not to speak of today the last phase of the period of the Semblance Dharma Almost ve hundred years have passed since the time the Great Dharma reached the east Those who have right views propagate and support  and those who are evil and deluded slander  As for perverse Confucianists who abide by literature they keep their distance from Buddhism because it is considered heathen  The hedan bird screeches in the night  yet it cannot split the darkness for broad daylight This will cause those of weak and inrm natures to follow false debates and go astray for a long time and those who have disordered logic to pursue heretical doctrines and indulge in everlasting  This is why it is easy to fall into hell and difcult to ascend to the pure state I Sengyou am of supercial learning but I am deeply bent on propagating and guarding  Thereupon making use of short intervals of medical treatment or spare moments while dwelling in the mountains I have compiled intelligent writings of ancient and modern times and collected polished essays by Buddhist clergy and laypeople In addition among written records and literature by distinguished scholars of former ages I have compiled all those that are advantageous as well They are classied and arranged in fourteen fascicles The Way is propagated by people and the teaching is claried by literature Therefore it is called the Collection for the Propagation and Clarication  At the same time led by my shallow thought I append my own discussion at the end However my learning is solitary and uncultivated and my knowledge is limited I am ashamed of being narrowminded Wellversed expert gentlemen please grant your aid to enlarge this compilation Mouzis the Elucidation of Delusions  or the Exposition by Mouzi Bo Governor of Cangwu Prefecture Mouzi has already studied the Classics commentaries on them and all philosophers works Regardless of the size or length there was no book he did not like Although he was not delighted with books on the art of war he still read them He read books on the immortals and immortality but restrained himself and never believed  he considered them to be preposterous In the time after Emperor Ling had passed away the world was in turmoil Only Jiaozhou was relatively peaceful People of the heterodoxy moved en masse from the north to settle there Many practiced the art of the immortals abstaining from grain to prolong their life spans There were many contemporary people who learned  Mouzi always rebuked them by the Five Classics None among the Daoists and practitioners of the heterodox arts dared respond to  compared this with the case where Meng Ke drove off Yang Zhu and Mo Di Before this Mouzi ed with his mother to Jiaozhi  At the age of twentysix he returned to Cangwu and took a wife The governor heard that Mouzi abided by learning and visited him to ask him to become a civil ofcial At that time was just in the prime of his youth and had intensely set his heart on learning He did not accept the offer after all During this period all the provinces and prefectures were suspicious of each other and isolated from one another without communication Since had profound learning and great knowledge the governor of Cangwu prefecture wanted to send him as a diplomatic envoy to pay homage to Jingzhou  Mouzi believed that while it is easy to decline honor and rank it is difcult to shirk a mission As it happened the regional governor of the province Mouzi was a welleducated recluse and summoned him Again Mouzi feigned illness and excused himself  A younger brother of the regional governor the governor of Yuzhang prefecture  had been murdered by the Leader of Court Gentlemen Ze Rong  The regional governor then planned to send the Commandant of Cavalry Liu Yan who commanded troops and who was about to head to  was afraid that would provoke reciprocal suspicion from the outer world and the troops would not be able to proceed So he asked Mouzi My younger brother was killed by a rebel My great indignation about this as his brother who shares the same esh and bones arises from the bottom of my heart I am about to send the Commandant of Cavalry Liu there I am afraid that the outer world is in turmoil and travelers cannot get through Now I would like you to oblige us by giving your consent to going to Lingling and Guiyang and to making their roads available for our passage At this point his mother suddenly passed away and he was not able to make the trip Therefore he nds approval as noble Then Mouzi had the earnest intention the Buddhist Way and concurrently studied Laozis Five Thousand Words  He took in the profound subtle meanings as if they were wine and drink and played on the Five Classics as if they were the Chinese zither and the reed organ Many common people condemned him thinking that he had gone against the Five Classics and turned to a heterodox way Even if he wished to engage these people in disputation it was not the Way Even if he wanted to keep silent he was unable to do so Consequently he spent time with brush and ink to briey cite the words of the sages and wise ones in order to make a testament of with explanations This is called Mouzis the Elucidation of Delusions  A person asked From whom was the Buddha born Does he or does he not have ancestors and a country  What does he look like Mouzi replied You have big questions I have heard the state of the Buddhas transformations It is impossible to record his chronicle since he accumulated moral conduct for several hundreds of billions of years Nevertheless when he came into the existence in which he would become the Buddha he was born in India in the provisional form of the son of  the queen of King uddhodana Once while taking a midday nap she had a dream that she rode upon a white sixtusked elephant She was very delighted and accordingly felt that she had become with child On the eighth day of the fourth month was born from the right armpit of his mother He landed upon the ground took seven steps forward and said raising his right arm There is no one in Heaven and Earth who goes beyond me At that time Heaven and Earth quaked tremendously and the palace became bright all over On the same day a servant of the royal family also gave birth to a child and a white horse in the stable bore a white colt The king instructed them to always attend the prince The prince had thirtytwo major marks and eighty minor marks of physical excellence He was one zhang and six chi tall and his body was of a golden color all over He had a protuberance on the top of his head His jaws were just like those of a lion His tongue was so long that it could cover his face His palms had the pattern of a thousandspoked wheel The light radiating from the top of his head illuminated everything for ten thousand li When was seventeen years old his the king chose as consort a girl from a neighboring state Whenever the prince  seated himself he moved his seat away from her When he slept he did not share a bed with her The Way of Heaven is quite evident yin and yang had relations  Consequently she conceived a son who was born six years later The king regarded the prince as invaluable and extraordinary and he built palaces for him and arranged female entertainers and precious amusements in a row in front of him But the prince did not wish for worldly pleasure his intention lay in morality At midnight on the eighth day of the fourth month of the year the prince turned nineteen years old He called Chandaka had him put the bit and bridle on Kaṇṭhaka and mounted the horse Spiritual beings helped them lifting them up and ew out of the palace The next day were found empty and no one knew where was There was none among the king the ofcials and the people who did not sob  They pursued and caught up with him in a eld The king said  Before you were born I prayed and asked the gods  Now I already have you you who are just like a precious stone or a jade tablet What are you going to do The prince replied All things are impermanent any existence will pass away I would like to learn the way and liberate all sentient beings in the ten directions The king realized that was steady and rm So the king rose and returned  The prince promptly departed He contemplated the Way for six years and nally attained buddhahood There are altogether twelve kinds of scriptures he authored eight hundred and forty million fascicles in all Among them a large fascicle contains less than ten thousand words and a small fascicle consists of more than a thousand words The Buddha gave the teaching all over the world and liberated the people Accordingly on the fteenth day of the second month he entered nirvana His teaching and precepts continuously exist If we follow the teaching and precepts and are capable of practicing them we will be able to attain wuwei as well and happiness will be passed on to later generations Those who observe the ve precepts have six purication days in a month On the day of purication one concentrates his or her mind repents and turns over a new leaf ramaṇas observe two hundred and fty precepts and have purication every day Their precepts are not what laymen Skt upāsaka are not able to learn Their proper deportment and course of action are not different from those of the classical rites of antiquity Throughout the day and night they talk about the Way and recite sutras and do not take part in worldly affairs What is the meaning of buddha Mouzi replied The word buddha is a posthumous title just as the Three Augusts are called gods and the Five Thearchs are called sages  The Buddha is the founder of morals and the originator of divinities The term buddha means awakened is beyond our sensory perception he can transform into and manifest as various entities he sometimes appears and sometimes disappears he can become smaller or larger he can be a round or a square shape he can become old or young and he can hide and reveal himself He goes through re without being burned He steps on a sword without being injured He can be in lth without being soiled Even if he experiences a calamity it has no effect on him When he wants to travel he ies through the air and when he sits he emits light Therefore his title is Buddha A person asked What is called the Way What category is the Way Mouzi replied The term Way means to lead It leads people to wuwei Pull it forth and it does not advance Pull it back and it does not retreat Lift it and it does not ascend Lower it and it does not descend Look at it and it has no shape Listen to it and it has no sound Outside of the visible world is vastness meanders beyond it Therefore it is called the Way A person asked Confucius considered the Five Classics to be the teaching of the Way which should be recited while folding ones hands before  b ones breast and practiced Now the Way you explain is the absolute vacancy and beyond our sensory perception Why is it different from what the sage said Mouzi replied You cannot consider what you are familiar with to be important and what you are unfamiliar with to be trivial You are confused by matters of the outside world and lose yourself in the mind In doing something you should not lose morality It is just as in the case that one should not lose gong and shang when tuning the strings of a musical instrument The Way of Heaven is regulated with the four seasons and the ways of human beings are regulated with the ve cardinal virtues Laozi said There was something mixed coming into existence before Heaven and Earth It can be considered as the mother of the world I do not know its name but if I dare to give a name to it it is called the Way The Way helps people in being able to serve their parents at home helps those who govern the state in ruling over the people and helps those who establish themselves without the assistance of others in harnessing themselves If you practice  it will ll the universe If you reject and do not practice it it will disappear and yet will not leave you behind You do not understand this Why it is different from the Way of which Confucius speaks A person asked The greatest reality does not look adorned and the highest level of expression has no polished  concise words that is comprehensible is elegant Things that require less work and yet achieve a goal are clever Therefore pearl and jade are rare and yet valuable while rubble is common and worthless The sages established the foundation of the Seven Classics which consist of less than thirty thousand words and within which all issues are treated The Buddhist scriptures are numbered at some ten thousand fascicles whose words are in the hundreds of millions which is more than one person is able to sustain I think they are troublesome and unimportant Mouzi replied The reason large rivers and oceans are different from a pool of water on a street is because they are deeper and wider The reason the Five Sacred Mountains are dissimilar to mounds is because they are taller and bigger If are not extremely higher than mountains and hills even a crippled sheep could climb up to the peaks If are not extremely deeper than small streams even a small boy could take a bath in the abysses Qiji a legendary ne horse capable of covering a thousand li in a day does not live in a garden and a sh that swallowing a boat does not swim in mountain streams that are several ren deep If you break open a threecun large oyster to look for a pearl a bright moon or if you try to nd a brood of Chinese phoenixes in a nest of thorny brambles it will certainly be difcult to nd them This is because the minor cannot contain the great The Buddhist scriptures expand issues for hundreds of millions of years in the past and still state main points for all ages When the primordial substance had not yet arisen when the primal beginning had not yet been produced and when Heaven and Earth began to rise their slightness could not be grasped and their minuteness could not be entered the Buddha governed over them all even the vast world outside  analyzed within the profound and subtle world and missed nothing to record about them Therefore the scriptures are counted in some ten thousand fascicles with words in the hundreds of millions Why it is unimportant Even though cannot be sustained by one person it is like the case where you drink water when arriving at a river The sun and moon are both bright but each has its own time to shine Each of the twentyeight constellations has its own place over which it rules Multifarious medicinal herbs grow equally but each of them has its own effect to heal sickness Foxfur robes are worn to protect against coldness while linen clothes are worn to keep out heat A boat and a carriage travel different routes from each other though both of them transport travelers The reason Confucius did not take the Five Classics to be perfect and further wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Canon c of Filial Piety is simply because he wanted to propagate the means of the Way by which people may act freely Even though Buddhist scriptures are numerous result in one Although the Seven Classics are different from each other the esteem in which they hold morality benevolence and righteousness results in the same too Why there is something to dismiss A person asked If the Buddhist Way is the most august and the greatest why did Yao and Shun the Duke of Zhou or Confucius not cultivate it No expression is found in the Seven Classics Master you have already indulged in the Book of Odes and the Book of History  and have been delighted with the Book of Rites  and the Book of Music  Why are you also fond of the Buddhist Way and happy about this foreign method How could surpass the Classics and their commentaries and be better than the sages works If I were you I would not accept it Mouzi replied It is not necessarily that only books of the words of Confucius are  just as medicines do not have to be prescribed by the great doctor Bian Que  Whatever meets righteousness is followed and whatever heals sickness is good Gentlemen extensively take all that is wholesome in order to complement themselves Zigong said What necessity was there for my master to have a regular master Emperor Yao served Yin Shou Emperor Shun served Wu Cheng Dan studied with L  and Confucius studied with Lao Dan ie Laozi but none of these are found in the Seven Classics Even though these four masters are sages when compared with the Buddha they are like white deer compared with a kylin or swallows compared with a Chinese phoenix Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun the Duke of Zhou and Confucius still studied with them Moreover the Buddha has the marks of physical excellence he can transform he has supernatural powers and he has no set pattern In the items and meanings of the Five Classics there are some lacunae As for the fact that the Buddha is not mentioned  how worthwhile is it to be doubtful and suspicious A person asked It is said that the Buddha has thirtytwo major and eighty minor marks of physical excellence Why is he so different from people I am afraid that this is an extravagant expression and a description of unreality Mouzi replied As the saying goes The fewer chances to see the more suspicious  A man sees a camel and says that it is a horse with a swollen back Emperor Yaos eyebrows were of eight different colors each of Emperor Shuns eyes had double pupils the mouth of Gao Yao was a crows beak King Wen had four nipples Yu had three orices in each ear the Duke of Zhou was hunchbacked Fuxi had a nose a dragons and Confucius had a depression on the top of his head Laozi had a sunshaped lump and the mark of a moon on his forehead and two nose bridges He held the Chinese characters of the Ten Celestial Stems in his hands and treaded upon the two and the ve  These men are not different from people are they How worthwhile is it to be doubtful of the Buddhas marks of physical excellence A person asked The Canon of Filial Piety says Your body hair and skin are received from your parents Do not dare to damage them When Zengzi was about to die he said Uncover my feet uncover my hands Now śramaṇas shave their heads Why do they go against the sages words They do not follow the way of lial piety You are always fond of discussing right and wrong and correcting wrong to right yet on the contrary it is alright  dont you Mouzi replied It is not benevolent to slander sages and virtuous people It is not intelligent that correction is not much to the point How can you cultivate virtue being neither benevolent nor intelligent How can I easily discuss with  Once upon a time a man of Qi crossed a large river by boat and his father fell into the water If he had cultivated himself as is usual for a lial son folding his arms  his father would have died by drowning Confucius said If you can be faithful to the Way with them you may not yet take measures suited to the occasion with them This refers to acting in what is considered a proper manner at the time Moreover the Canon of Filial Piety says Kings of previous times had the highest virtue and the essential points  Taibo however had his hair cut off and his body tattooed following the custom of the WuYue region  disregarding the righteousness toward ones body hair and skin stated in the Canon of Filial Piety Nevertheless Confucius praised him   may be said to be a man of the highest virtue Confucius did not defame Taibo for having his hair cut It can be said that the utmost concessions are that śramaṇas give up their family property abandon their wives and children do not listen to music and do not look upon worldly things Why they go against the sages words and do not follow lial piety Yu Rang swallowed charcoal and lacquered his body  Nie Zheng ayed the skin of his face and punished himself after committing a successful assassination Gentlemen consider that these people were brave and died for righteousness I have heard no one slander their selfmutilation or suicides Compared to the actions taken by these four people śramaṇas shaving their beards and hair is not far removed from them A person asked There is no happiness beyond having posterity and there is no impiety greater than having no posterity ramaṇas abandon their wives and children and give up wealth or they never marry for their entire lives Why do they carry out practice against happiness and lial piety They themselves suffer and yet they have nothing wonderful They exhaust themselves and yet they have nothing marvelous Mouzi replied One who is strong on the left must be weak on the right One who formerly had the extensive must later have the narrow Confucius says Meng Gongchuo is excellent as a chief retainer of the Zhao or Wei  but he is unt to be a high ofcial of Teng or Xue Wives children and belongings are extra in secular life Purity and wuwei are the wonders of the Way Body or wealth which do you think more valuable Again said One may observe customs handed down from the three preceding dynasties  read the arts of the ways of Confucians and Mohists recite the Book of Odes and the Book of History cultivate etiquette respect benevolence and righteousness and consider cleanliness  The people of the world will hand down virtuous works to the next generation and he will brim over with fame Such are what mediocre people perform and what people of peace and nonworldly desire do not seek Therefore if in front of you there is a pearl like that of the Marquis of Sui but there is a tiger behind you even though you may see you will run away Xu You lived in the nest of a tree yi and qi starved on Shouyang The sage Confucius praised their virtues and said They are the ones who sought benevolence and attained it I have never heard them ridiculed for not having posterity or property ramaṇas cultivate morality instead of having worldly pleasures and return to virtuous wise people having given up the joys of having wives and children In addition said  adjusts his clothes and cap and imbues his appearance with dignity Even though Yuan Xian was poor he did not take off his cap made of birch bark When Zilu encountered danger he did not forget to tie the chinstraps of his cap Today śramaṇas shave off their hair and wear undyed cloth When they come across other people they make no decorum of kneeling and standing up Those who possess the lowest degree of virtue how not to lose it and therefore they do not possess virtue During the times of the Three Augusts the people ate meat wore animalskin clothing and lived in nests in trees or caves Why would they need zhangfu caps or furs woven with adornments the people of that time are said to have been virtuous honest trustworthy and wuwei If you have a good faculty of hearing you will not be deluded Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun the Duke of Zhou and Confucius cultivated worldly affairs while the Buddha and Laozi pursued wuwei Confucius traveled to more than seventy states Xu You heard that there was to be an abdication of the throne  and he then washed his ears in a gulf because he thought the abdication was so foul that it polluted his ears The way to be a gentleman is sometimes to go out and sometimes to remain in seclusion or to sometimes remain silent and to sometimes speak out He does not let his emotions overow and he does not give full sway to his nature Therefore the reason why the way is noble lies in the purpose for which it is employed What reason is there in rejecting them  An inquirer said In the Way of the Buddha it is said He has died What then is trying to call back A person replied  tries to call the spirit of the dead back  Mouzi asked If the spirit returns he revives if it does not return what is the spirit then called replied It becomes a spiritual being  Mouzi said That is correct Without doubt the spirit does not perish Only the physical body decays and becomes rotten The body is just like the roots and leaves of the ve major grains and the spirit is compared to the seeds and kernels of the grains The roots and leaves come into existence and then inevitably die attain the Way and only their bodies perish Laozi said The reason we have great calamity is because we have a body If we did not have a body what calamity would we have He also said When the work is done retiring into obscurity is the Way of Heaven Someone said Those who practice the Way die and those who do not practice the Way also die If one attains the Way even if he dies his spirit returns to Heaven If he has committed evil conduct after death his spirit inevitably receives retribution Ignorant people are in darkness about the established facts while intelligent people foresee things that have not yet germinated Comparison between practicing the Way and not practicing the Way is just like that between gold and grass Having wholesomeness and being given happiness are the comparison between white and black How could there not be a difference Nevertheless you ask what is the difference  A person asked Confucius said While you are not able to serve human beings how can you serve the spirits While you do not know life how can you know about death The sage declined to answer this  Now Buddhists always speak of matters of c life and death as well as of the affairs of spiritual beings I am wondering if this goes against the words of sages and saints Those who follow the Way ought to make the mind absolutely vacant and simple and return to the principle of simplicity Why then do disturb our will by talking about life and death Why do they speak unnecessary words about spiritual beings Mouzi replied It appears that your words are so to speak like those who observe the outside and yet are not aware of the inside Confucius deplored the fact that Zilu did not consider the whole issue from beginning to end The Canon of Filial Piety says Build the ancestral shrine  Offer sacrices in the spring and autumn thinking of them It continues Devote yourself to loving and respecting them while they are alive Devote yourself to mourning after their death Did not teach people to serve the spiritual beings and to know about life and death The Duke of Zhou begged for Emperor Wus life and said I Dan am versatile and able to serve spiritual beings What does this mean Isnt the tenor of life and death stated in the Buddhist scriptures of this kind The essence of the highest Way is to truly esteem solitude Why would Buddhists be fond of debate about life and death Can there be a bell or a drum that makes a sound by itself They only produce sounds when struck A person asked Confucius said It may be said that you see the elegance of ceremonial forms and yet lack knowledge about the truth of morality or that you catch a glimpse of the light of a torch or candle but you have not yet seen the sun in the sky What Confucius spoke of are the ways to correct social customs or practices Formerly wishing to live in the region of the nine barbarian tribes of the east Confucius said If a gentleman dwelled among them what vileness would there be When Confucius could not nd an ofcial position in the states of Lu and Wei and when Mencius was not employed in the states of Qi and Liang how could they have taken service in the states of the barbarian tribes of the east and north  Yu is from Qiang the barbarian tribe in west China and yet he was a sage You Yu was born in Di to the north of our great land and yet Qin establish hegemony Guan and Cai came from the basin between the Yellow River and the Luo River but they spread a false rumor  A commentary says The polestar is located in the middle of the sky in the north above us Seen from this point of view the land of Han ie China is not necessarily the center of the universe According to what the Buddhist scriptures state all sentient beings of the entire universe belong to the Buddha What reason do I have to abandon the way of Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun the Duke of Zhou and Confucius Gold and pearl never impair each other You say that other people are deluded yet it is you yourself who is deluded A person asked It cannot be said to be charitable to give away ones fathers property to a stranger Nowadays a Buddhist scripture states that Prince Sudāna gave his fathers property to complete a strangers granted a precious elephant belonging to the state to its enemies and his own wives and children to others It is said to be uncivil to not respect ones own parents and yet to respect others It is said to be immoral to not love ones own parents and yet to love others Prince Sudāna was neither lial nor kind but Buddhists respect him Isnt this peculiar Mouzi replied In the doctrine of the Five Classics the rst son from the legal wife is designated as heir Yet the Great King saw Changs ambition he moved his youngest son Jili who was Changs father up in the succession to become his heir Consequently the enterprise of the Zhou dynasty was achieved and by means of this a peaceful world was realized In the custom of marrying a woman a man must inform his parents  Emperor Shun married without telling his parents People of integrity must be invited for service and talented vassals wait to be drafted for public services Ning Qi knocked on horns to beseech Lord Huan of Qi  With King Tang won the throne and with Qi state attained hegemony According to etiquette a man and a woman should not put their hands on each other if the wife of ones elder brother is drowning it is an expedient way in emergency to put ones hands on her in order to pull her out of the water Why should a great person comprehend ordinary matters Prince Sudāna saw that the world is impermanent and money and property were not real treasures for him Therefore he donated at his will and by doing so he achieved the Great Way His fathers kingdom received the blessings and enemies were unable to invade his fathers kingdom When attained buddhahood his parents and brothers were all able to attain liberation as well If this is not a lial and benevolent  then what is benevolent and lial A person asked In Buddhism wuwei is of value giving alms is pleasurable and observing the precepts requires as much caution and attention as if one were approaching an abyss Today śramaṇas give themselves up to wine Some have wives and children or purchase at a low price and sell at a high price  They devote themselves to such swindles This is a great hypocrisy in the world Is this what is called wuwei in Buddhism Mouzi replied Gongshu Ban a master carpenter in Lu state during the Spring and Autumn period was able to give people a hatchet an ax and an ink line  but he was not able to make them as skillful as himself Sages are able to impart their ways to others but they cannot make others follow and perform them Gao Yao was able to punish thieves but he couldnt make greedy people become Boyi and Shuqi The ve penalties can punish villains but they cannot regenerate such evil people to be Zeng Shen and Min Ziqian Emperor Yao was not able to educate Dan Zhu and the Duke of Zhou was unable to admonish Guan and Cai Wouldnt Tangs teaching be clear Wouldnt the Duke of Zhou be possessed of morality Nevertheless there was no help for bad people Figuratively speaking if people who are well versed in the Seven Classics are smitten with money and women can it be said that the six arts that these people have mastered are depraved and lustful Hebo even though he is the god  cannot drown people who stay on land A violent wind though it blows swiftly cannot ing dust onto the surface of deep water How can you say that Buddhism has vice A person asked Confucius said Luxury leads to haughtiness and frugality to meanness It is better to be mean than to be haughty Shusun said Frugality is respectful Luxury is the worst among evil acts Today Buddhists consider donating all ones property to be honorable and giving all ones money to others to be valuable Neither case prohibits making donations When  Shun tilled on Mount Li his benevolence did not reach even the neighboring area Taigong butchered cows  but his kindness did not extend to his wife and children For those who have abundant property and plenty of money it is valuable to give alms to others For those who live in poverty and who are often poor it is valuable to follow the Way Boyi was not contented to take the reins of the state Yu Qing gave up a ef of tens of thousands of households and gave relief to destitute people in a crisis Needless to say if you sink in fortune in order to give rise to good intentions your merit and virtue are as lofty as Mount Song or Mount Tai and as vast as a great river or the ocean Those who embrace a compassionate heart are rewarded with happiness and those who harbor evil receive misfortune as retribution It has never happened that those who have planted rice will harvest wheat or that those who have caused disaster will obtain happiness A person said Among qualities nothing surpasses sincerity in speech nothing goes beyond truth Laozi eschewed artful expressions and showed respect for simple words Buddhist scriptures do not directly indicate the matter and yet extensively take allegories in vain Allegory is not the essence of reason Even though have numerous expressions and extensive words they are similar to a cart full of fragments of jade pieces which are not considered to be treasure Mouzi responded Things that both have seen can be explained with the real thing but things that only a speaker has seen are difcult to explain in exact words Formerly a person who had not seen a kylin asked someone who had seen one What kind is a kylin The one who had seen it answered A kylin is just like a kylin The questioner said If I had seen a kylin then I would not have asked you the question How can I understand this The one who had seen a kylin said The kylin has a body like a roe deer a tail like a cow hooves like a deer and a back like a horse The questioner understood right away The Analects of Confucius states He who takes the reins of government by means of virtue can be compared to the north polestar Here a celestial body is referred to and compared to a human being Zixia said It is just as all plants have differences  The three hundred chapters in the Book of Odes  collecting events and arranging them into each category In writings by the thinkers of the numerous schools and books about the occult up to books classied for sages there is none that does not employ allegories or use parables The Yellow Emperor considered the ve kinds of meat ie beef lamb pork sh and venison to be the best to keep us in good health Confucius said He does not detest nely cleaned rice and nely minced meat Nowadays śramaṇas put on red robes have only one meal a day and shut off their six sense organs throughout their lifetimes If they are like this what fun do they have Mouzi replied  Wealth and high position are what people desire but if a gentleman does not obtain them in the proper way he would not place himself there Poverty and meanness are what people detest but if a gentleman cannot avoid them in the proper way he would not abandon them Laozi said The ve colors cause people to become blind The ve notes  cause people to become deaf The ve avors cause peoples tastebuds to be paralyzed Going at full speed in the wild while hunting makes people crazy Rare goods distract people from having conduct sages take care of their bellies and not their eyes How could these words be false Hui of Liuxia did not change the way he acted even after he was offered a position as one of the three highestranking ofcials Mu of Duangan did not barter his body for the wealth offered by Lord Wen of Wei state Xu You and Chaofu lived high up in a tree which they said was more peaceful than the imperial palace Boyi and Shuqi starved on Mount Shouyang but they said they were more satised than King Wen and King Wu Why do you say that śramaṇas have no fun A person asked If Buddhist scriptures are profound and extravagant why do you neither talk about them at court nor discuss them with your superior and father You cultivate only at home and relay to your friends Why do you also study the Classics and commentaries and read various philosophers works Mouzi replied You have not yet reached the origin and yet you ask about the streams  Laozi said When scholars of the highest class hear about the Way they diligently practice it Scholars of the middle class when they hear about the Way keep only half in their mind Scholars of the lowest class when they hear about the Way have a great laugh at it Since I am afraid that will burst into laughter I will not talk about Buddhism When one is thirsty he does not necessarily drink the water of a large river But how can he be dissatised with the water of wells and fountains was greatly delighted with this Next day he asked of the entire body of ministers What god is this Fu Yi a wellread greatly experienced person answered I have heard that in India there was a man who had attained the Way He could y in the air and had sunlight on his body I am worried that that god Then the emperor came to realize this and dispatched eighteen people including the Inner Gentleman Cai Yin the Gentleman of the Palace Guard Qin Jing and the Disciple of the Erudite Wang Zun They copied the Buddhist scripture the Sutra of Fortytwo Chapters  in the country of Dayuezhi  The sutra was deposited in the fourteenth cubicle of the Lantai stone chambers  Then outside the Yong gate to the west of Luoyang a Buddhist temple was built On the walls was painted an illustration of a large military group of mounted soldiers circumambulating a pagoda thrice clockwise Furthermore buddha images were made and placed on the Qingliang Tower of the southern palace and on the Kaiyang Gate of the city wall During his reign Emperor Ming had his mausoleum called Xianjie constructed in advance Illustrations and images of the Buddha were made and placed on it as well At that time the nation was rich the people enjoyed peace and barbarians in distant regions admired our morality Why do they talk about right and wrong and take up right and wrong for discussion I think that these commit the theft of virtue  Mouzi replied Suppose you are afraid that next spring there will be a serious famine so you do not eat in the autumn  Although these actions are taken in order to be fully prepared beforehand it is unavoidable that you look stupid Laozis maxim refers only to those who have attained the Way What do those who have not attained the Way know When the Great Way is explained in one word the whole world is joyful Isnt this great eloquence ramaṇas of today have not yet attained the Way How can they help but to speak Even Laozi who said those who know do not speak still made speeches If he remained silent how could he give the account of the Five Thousand Words  It is all right if one knows and does not speak it But if one is unable to know and furthermore unable to speak it he is just stupid Consequently he who is able to speak but unable to carry it out is the teacher of the nation He who is able to carry out but unable to speak it is the force of the nation He who is able to carry out the Way and also speak it is the treasure of the nation Each of these three types of people has an applicable point How then could they commit the theft of virtue Spoken language and discussion have their own proper and adequate times It is said about Qu Yuan  When the Way prevails in the world he is straightforward When the Way does not prevail in the world he can roll up and keep them close to his heart About Ning Wuzi it is said  When the Way prevailed in the world he displayed his intelligence When the Way did not prevail in the world he behaved like a stupid person Confucius said Not to talk to one with whom you may talk is to waste a person  To talk to one with whom you may not talk is to waste your words Therefore to be intelligent or to behave like a stupid person both have their proper times speech and discussion serve several purposes Why we debates and discussion without carrying out  A person asked Why do you say that Buddhism is the most esteemed and the happiest teaching of wuwei and freedom from avarice Many people and scholars in the world slander  saying that Its words and theory are vague difcult to take up  and absolute emptiness is hard to believe Why  Mouzi replied The most delicious food does not satisfy every palate Great music is not familiar to every ear Even if Xianchi is played Dazhang is set forth Xiaoshao is set out and the music is sung nine times no one joins in the chorus if music from a stringed instrument of Zheng and Wei is played or if current popular songs are sung unexpectedly clap their hands on the beat without fail Therefore Song Yu said A visitor sang in Ying  When he performed simple and crude folk songs those who joined in the chorus numbered a thousand people Han Fei criticized Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun from a narrow viewpoint as if looking at through a tube To hear the clear note shang and say that it is the note jue is not the fault of the player but due to the listeners poor faculty  To see Hes jade and call it a stone is not because the jade is ignoble but due to the beholders lack of knowledge A snake with supernatural powers can regenerate its body into one even if it is cut into many pieces but cannot cause people not to cut it apart A turtle with mysterious powers appeared to Lord Yuan of Song state in a  c dream but could not evade the net of Yu Qie The Great Way is wuwei which is neither what ordinary people understand nor what may increase its value by praise nor what may lose its value by slander Whether or not it is employed is up to Heaven Whether or not it is believed is up to fate A person asked You interpret the Buddhas teaching with the Classics and their commentaries Your expressions are rich and the meanings are clear Your compositions are energetic and the explanations are beautiful Isnt this due to your rhetorical skill rather than being the truth Mouzi replied No it is not Even though I recited the Five Classics I just considered them to be owery and had not come to realize their truth Now I see the doctrines of the Buddhist scriptures read the essentials of the Laozi  abide by the nature of tranquility without worldly desires and contemplate the practice of wuwei When I come back to view the affairs of the world I feel as if I am stealing a glance at a gorge from high above the earth or as if I am ascending Mount Song and Mount Dai to look over the small foothills The Five Classics are just like the ve avors and Buddhism is just like the ve grains  Since I heard the Way I have been in a condition that is just like clouds opening up to reveal the sun or entering into a dark room holding a torch A person asked You said that scriptures are as deep as great rivers and seas and the words are brocade and embroidery Why do you respond to my questions referring to the Classics such as the Book of Odes and the Book of History instead of using Buddhist scriptures A hungry man does not need the granary of Mount Ao to ll his stomach The Way is established for the wise Debate is well constructed for knowledgeable people Books are transmitted for those who understand them Things are claried for people of insight I refer to phrases since I think that you know the meanings If I speak with the words of Buddhist scriptures and discuss the essentials of wuwei it would be like explaining the ve colors to the blind or playing the ve notes for the deaf Even though master Kuang was artful he could not strum a Chinese zither that had no string Although fox and badger furs are warm they cannot warm the dead Gongming Yi played the musical piece Cao in the note qingjue for a cow but the cow just bent her head down and ate as before This does not mean that she did not listen to  but the music did not meet her ears On the other hand if there were the buzz of a mosquito or gady or the lowing of an orphaned calf she would promptly swish her tail strain her ears and stamp on the ground listening to it This is why I only respond to your questions referring to the Classics A person asked Once when I was in the capital I entered Dongguan Library and studied at Taixue National University where I saw what talented scholars regulated and I listened to what the circle of Confucian scholars discussed However I never heard that to cultivate Buddhism is considered valuable and that to damage ones appearance by oneself is considered superior When you get lost alter the route One who is versed in the Way cannot be surprised by strange things One who discerns tones in words cannot be deluded by words One who understands righteousness cannot be swayed by prot Laozi said Fame harms oneself It is needless to speak of the highest Way which is vast and what sages of the highest class practice is as expansive as the sky and as deep as the sea It is not suitable for people who peep over a wall or for those who consider a several renhigh wall to be tall This is proper as a matter of course see the gate  while I a see the room  They seek perfection while I preserve the One You should change course immediately I ask you to follow  You have not been aware of what the causes of fortune and misfortune are like A person asked With the words of the Classics and their commentaries and the splendid doctrines you praise the Buddhas conduct and extol his virtue which is lofty as it rides the high clear clouds and is wide as it goes beyond the end of the earth Can it be that exceed the essential qualities and surpass the reality  My praises are just like adding a speck of dust to Mount Song and Mount Tai or collecting the morning dew and throwing it into a large river or the sea Your slanderous words are like using a ladle and goblet to attempt to reduce a large river or the sea or plowing by foot to attempt to lower Mount Kunlun or raising a hand to block the sunlight or lifting a lump of earth to block the ow of the Yellow River My praises cannot make the Buddha loftier and your slander cannot bring him low A person asked Is the issue of longevity stated in the talisman registers of Wang Qiao Chisongzi and the eight immortals and in the one hundred and seventy fascicles of Divine Book  the same as that in the Buddhist scriptures Mouzi replied A comparison between these texts of the immortals and the Buddhist scriptures in category is just like comparing the ve powers with the Five Thearchs  or comparing Yang Huo with Confucius himself A comparison in shape is just like comparing foothills with Mount Hua and Mount Heng or small creeks and ditches with large rivers and seas A comparison in elegance is just like comparing a tiger hide with a sheepskin or mottled hemp with brilliant and beautiful embroidery There are ninetysix different teachings but the most esteemed among them is none other than Buddhism The texts of the immortals when we listen to their words sound great and ll our ears but when we seek their efcacy it is like grasping at wind or trying to catch a shadow Hence the texts of the immortals are not upheld in the Great Way and are not valued in wuwei How could they be the same A person asked Some among the practitioners of the Way avoid grain and do not eat it yet they drink wine and eat meat They say also that this is the way of Laozi In Buddhism however to drink wine and eat meat are the heaviest violations to the precepts and yet do eat grain Why do they contradict each other Mouzi replied There are extant about ninetysix various teachings in total So far as having no worldly attachment and wuwei are concerned nothing is more esteemed than Buddhism I have inspected the two volumes of the Laozi and have learned that this scripture prohibits the ve avors but I have never seen any word to proscribe against the ve major grains The sage formulated the writings of the seven canons in which there is no mention of a prohibition against eating grain Laozi wrote the Five Thousand Words and yet the issue of abstaining from grains is not indicated The sage said Those who eat grain are intelligent Those who eat grass are silly Those who eat meat are violent Those who eat vapor have a long life The people of the world do not understand this matter they see that the six kinds of birds stop breathing and do not eat in the autumn and winter seasons and then they try to imitate them They do not know that each thing or being has its own true nature It is just as a magnet attracts iron and yet it cannot pull a hair A person asked Should we rather stop eating grain or not Mouzi replied Before I understood the Great Way I once learned the way of abstaining from grain too There are several thousand and several hundred methods to abstain from grain When I practiced them they were not effective at all when I performed them there were no signs at all Therefore I just gave up  I observed the three teachers with whom I studied They described themselves to be seven hundred ve hundred and three hundred years old  but in less than three years after I had begun to study with them they all died The cause of their deaths is probably that they abstained from grain did not eat it and ate various fruits they went back for second and third servings when they enjoyed meat they had an entire barrel of wine when they drank their spirits b were muddled and delirious the energy of grain did not ll  and their ears and eyes were deluded and were not debarred from lewdness and evil Thereupon they all died before reaching the age at which one may know the decrees of Heaven  Even Emperor Yao Emperor Shun the Duke of Zhou and Confucius were all unable to live to a hundred years of age Nevertheless foolish and deluded people of these latter days want to seek inexhaustible longevity by ingesting drugs and the avoidance of grain How sad A person asked Those who practice the Way say that they can prevent disease and do not get sick or that they can recover from illness without acupuncture and medicine Why do Buddhists recommend acupuncture and medicine when someone becomes ill Mouzi replied Laozi said When things reach their prime they begin aging This may be said to be the deviation from the Way Anything that deviates from the Way soon comes to an end Only those who have attained the Way will not be reborn Since they are not in the prime they will not age either Since they do not age they will not become ill Since they do not become ill they will not decay Shen Nong tasted the avors of the various grasses and he was about to die several tens of times The Yellow Emperor bowed with his head to the ground and received acupuncture from Qi Bo How could these three sages be inferior to Daoist practitioners of the present time Why do you distinguish them from each other arrange them and indicate their differences Furthermore you cause those who learn the teaching to be suspicious I am afraid that this is wasteful and futile Mouzi replied Although we call all of them grass the natures of various grasses cannot be distinctively explained We call them all metal but the natures of various kinds of metals cannot be distinctively explained All things are just so Why would this not be so only in regard to teachings In bygone days Yang and Mo blocked the path of a group of Confucianists Their carts could not advance and people could not make progress It was not until Mencius opened up that the people came to know what to follow master Kuang played his Chinese zither waiting for someone who could understand his tune to appear in later ages Sages formulated the model decorum hoping that gentlemen would see it in the future Buddhism is not incorrect but numerous private teachings obscure its justice Thereupon I distinguish and differentiate  The intelligence of Zang Wen and the uprightness of Weisheng were what Confucius was very stern about All of his words were to correct the vices of the world Why is it wasteful and futile to distinguish teachings from each other A person asked It is all right if you slander the immortals repress unusual things and do not believe that there is a way to immortality Why do you believe that it is only Buddhism by which one should attain liberation The Buddha lived in a foreign land You have not set foot on that soil and have not yet seen the place You have only read the writings and trust in what did He who sees a bright aspect is unable to know the reality He who sees a shadow is unable to discern the form What you believe is almost untrue Mouzi replied Confucius said See what a man does observe what he has done and examine with what he is content None could respond to me and they all backed down Many of them corrected their resolution and changed their intention Why do you alone have difculty reforming yourself Mouzi replied When light feathers meet with wind high above they are blown away When ne stones get into the ow of water from a mountain stream they are carried down Mount Tai alone remains unmoved in a whirlwind Massive rocks are not swept away even by a rapid current When plum trees are nipped by the frost they become leaess but pines and cypresses are hardly withered Consequently they humbly backed down You are not going to vanquish even a stupid person such as myself not to speak of those who are well versed in the Way You do not reform yourself and yet want to change others I think that this should be considered respectful and valuable and I am afraid that Buddhism is not as good as  Mouzi said Pointing to the south when it is in fact the north one says to himself that he is not confused Considering west to be east he says to himself that he is not stupid Being a owl he laughs at phoenix Holding mole crickets and earthworms one ridicules turtles and dragons Cicadas do not eat but gentlemen do not value them Frogs and pythons hibernate but sages do not attach importance to them Confucius said Of all life between Heaven and Earth human beings are the noblest I have never heard that he respected cicadas and pythons Nevertheless among the people of the world there are inherently those who eat sweet ag and discard cinnamon and ginger and who decline to drink sweet dew but sip unrened vinegar The ne hair on the skin although it is small can be examined if you look at it  Mount Tais loftiness cannot be seen if you turn your back on it It is a matter of whether or not you pay attention to it or whether or not you are careful In Lu state the Ji family was respected and Confucius was vilied In Wu state Great Steward Pi was considered to be capable and zi Xu was not considered to be good So given these situations your questions reasonable A person asked The school of Daoism says Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun the Duke of Zhou Confucius and seventytwo of his disciples did not die and became immortals The school of Buddhism says All people die and no one can avoid death Why Mouzi replied These are absurd statements not what the sages said Laozi said Even Heaven and Earth cannot last long How much less can human beings Confucius said Furthermore withdraw from the world Those who are benevolent and lial permanently exist For as long as I have read books of the six arts and looked at biographies and records Emperor Yao passed away Emperor Shun was on the mountain of Cangwu there is Emperor Yus mausoleum at Guiji Boyi and Shuqi have their tombs on Mount Shouyang King Wen died before he could put King Zhou to death King Wu could not wait for King Cheng to grow to adulthood but he passed away there is a chapter regarding the reburial of the Duke of Zhou Confucius had a dream two pillars   there is a record for the age of Bo Yu when he died before his father ie Confucius there is a record that Zilus was salted there is the expression of  It is fate for Boniu there is Zeng Shens expression  Uncover my feet and there are the records for Yan Yuan that said Unfortunately he was shortlived and then composed the parable of a young plant that does not go on to ower All these are written in the Classics and are the utmost signicant words by sages The people of the world take as testimony and say did not die I wonder however why your responses are arranged in thirtyseven sections Is there any model for this Mouzi replied  rolling mugwort wheels were invented and driftwood boats and oars were devised spiders webs nets were invented bird tracks written language was created Therefore it is easy to accomplish something if there is a model while it is difcult to accomplish anything without a model I read the essentials of the Buddhist scriptures which list thirtyseven elements  The Laozi Daojing consists of thirtyseven chapters as well Thereupon I modeled after these  Then the deluded people who heard became reverent and nervous they turned pale They stood up folding their hands in salute We dared to make stupid statements without worrying about fortune and misfortune Now we have heard your instructions and very rapidly just as hot water melts snow We wish to receive the ve precepts and become Buddhist laypeople The Discourse to Correct Faulty Accusations by an Anonymous Writer There was an idiosyncratic person who brought a false charge against the Buddha He said Yin Wenzi is a man who possessed supernatural power Moreover he had a disciple who had attained the Way to transform and so on Moreover he made prohibit from destroying life forbade their style of marriage and proscribed them from having offspring And so forth I corrected this The accuser already said that the Buddha does not exist Furthermore he said that Wenzi had supernatural power He also said that there was a disciple who attained the Way who could transform who was broadminded and who completed the marvelous principles These are supercial and heartless words Now Yin Wenzi is precisely a disciple of Laozi Laozi is namely a disciple of the Buddha Therefore it is stated in the sutra I have heard it said that in Zhugan there was an old teacher who thoroughly entered nirvana and who eternally and everlastingly remains there without beginning or end Zhugan means India If the Buddha was not before Laozi how could call the one who was born before himself  If Laozi was not before Yin Wen how could ask for the Daodejing Inferring from this the Buddha was formerly Wenzis ancestor and the original of all sages How could it happen that a disciple can supernaturally transform and his teacher cannot Moreover when a sage governs the world he certainly rules over it with morality If the people in remote regions do not submit  he  pacies them with civil culture and virtue He uses weapons only if compelled to out of necessity He is one who will remove violence stop ghting save the people and carry out a minor killing in order to stop mass murder Consequently in the Spring and Autumn period when feudal lords subjugated  they took actions relying on the principles of justice and order If their hostile state had a fault they assuredly beat a drum in order to make known and assembled troops of justice in order to deal with those who caused the fault They did not punish others for ambiguous reasons Therefore when their enemies were subjugated they soothed in a soft and gentle manner and neither inicted punishment indiscriminately nor used armed force excessively beyond all reason When they won they performed the rite of mourning for those who had lost their lives in battle When they killed they wept with grief for those who had been killed Accordingly to arrest by means of temptation was severely censured and causes of extermination were strongly restricted To appease evil in order to quell injustice and to use the road of the other state in order to carry out an atrocity  are variants of the Classics and their annotations Therefore when met the feudal lords at Song state for a treaty of alliance the reason gave priority to Jin state and restrained Chu state is because he hated who were deceptive and wore armor under their clothes in order to wage a surprise attack on the people of Jin and he respected the virtue of honesty Resentment and benevolence toward an enemy should not affect the descendants  Heavy punishment should not be recklessly dispensed This is a clever system for all rulers to follow and an excellent law for governing a country Generals and jingoistic fellows of later ages when they were troubled by the degeneration of morals began to compete with each other depending on their cunning powers and indulged their ravenous minds with deceptive plots When they did battle in a eld they were unrestrained in attacking and killed everything in sight When they annihilated a city they completely buried the inhabitants alive to the last person Therefore Bai Qi  who had buried alive many people of Zhao state who had surrendered cut off his own head at Duyou Dong Zhuo  a tyrannical vassal of the Later Han dynasty was slaughtered at a palace gate Gentlemen know that such inevitably come to ruin The whole world grieves when are slaughtered The harm of armed might reaches this point This is what we should be distressed by and why we should sigh deeply  How could there be a sage who wants to indulge in cunning and exterminate common people Moreover ten households a wise person can be found not to speak of a vast area mile after mile Zhonghua was born in the eastern barbarians Wenming was from the western barbarians How could there be a xed place from which sages and wise people emerge How could there be a sage who hates the enemies power and wants to exterminate them without even a single survivor how different is this from the case where once a pestilential vapor runs rampant it cannot be purged by any clear and good thing or that once a re is set in the center of a eld orchid and caryopteris divaricata a water plant with a foul smell that lasts very long are both burned Wasnt the tyranny of King Jie and King Zhou just like this To engage in argument referring to these is sufcient to abuse others with slander and to confuse ignorant and inexperienced people How could it be a rebuke is kindhearted logical and thoughtful Again the accuser said Yin Wenzi deceived  he told them that there are thirtytwo levels of Heaven and so on Moreover he recklessly quoted the Loutanjing  heavenly palaces is two hundred and forty thousand li in circumference One side of the heavenly palace has a hundred gates and the gate is ten thousand li wide and so on  I replied The Buddhist scriptures state that in realms of the heavens and the earth there are stages from high to low Nevertheless the accuser has exaggerated and either fabricated a false statement or was confused and misled and could not investigate the reality How could there be a land two hundred and forty thousand li in circumference containing gates four million li wide in total This case serves as an example for the rest  and it is enough to clarify that he made many mistakes Even slaves and herders may know that this is not so not to speak of intellectuals wants to show his erudition and yet only reveals his stupidity Again the accuser said The Buddha also went all around the ve realms of existence  He committed many transgressions and atrocious acts yet he still attained buddhahood This is not a law to frighten those who do evil Moreover in counting people there are few good people but many bad people When bad people die they would ll up the realm of the six domestic animals It has been a long time since the creation of the world up to the present day  then animals would occupy ninetenths and the human race would already be rare I corrected this It is indeed as you said that the Buddha was once evil too The reason he attained buddhahood is because he corrected his mistakes and followed what is good If he had grown evil if he had never reformed himself and if he had been deluded and consequently had kept going  he would have received suffering for a long dark period he would have transmigrated in the ve realms of existence without the means for liberation was able to dig up the saplings of various evils extinguish the ember of the three poisons cultivate the wholesomeness of the ve precepts and accomplish the excellence of the ten wholesome acts He practiced like this kalpa after kalpa Even when he was tired he never stopped He completely understood the ultimate state of things and claried that the three periods ie past present and future are empty Thereupon he was able to liberate himself from the illusory world of birth and death and go beyond to the place of wuwei In counting the number of insects in the world we cannot reach a calculation people who reside in China are like the number of extremely small ne hairs that grow on a horses body How could it be said that ninetenths  It is not a book like those the Three Augusts and the Five Thearchs or words of instruction and admonition The words of the ancestors older by three or ve generations recorded in the Sequel Scripture of No Spirit are similar to those of the petition to the Celestial Thearch This itself nearly reveals a fabrication without question I will now deal with it for the time being Generally people of the world frequently say If a person dies he will perish without the numen and the spirit  In that case if there is no numen there is no Celestial Ofcer and if there is no spirit then there is no place where gather If ones descendant who believes in the Buddha traces back to what his ancestor did and nds fault to reproach even if ones ancestor was a wise person or gentleman if he did not necessarily do the same thing as his descendant while he was alive then the Celestial Ofcer will take him into custody The Celestial Ofcer orders the corpses of Yan and Ran to suffer the pain of slaying and benevolent ancestors to have powerful poisons added to their esteemed bodies How could this be done by an intelligent upright and honest spiritual being  Then if could not be done  it  b must be done by a fox a badger an evil spirit of mountains and rivers or a lewd and erce ghost How could such a being overpower the spirits of both kindhearted and wise people and trouble those who observe the Buddhist precepts This is extravagant and futile and so on I corrected this In teaching there are both depth and shallowness All of this was already stated completely in the beginning section Let me repeat it No one surpasses Yao and Shun in being respectful to others and humble about themselves Therefore the Spring and Autumn with Commentary by Zuo Qiuming states The bells of a carriage horse make known publicly The images comparable to each other by the ve colors make the differences of things known publicly Therefore the residences of monarchs require the Gate of Gold  the steps of white jade leading to the throne  an astronomical observatory for the emperor  and a gate of the imperial palace in order to distinguish them from of the common people and make clear between the noble and the humble Consequently when hears the sound of his drums and tambours and sees the shape of a feather banner he thinks of his leaders and commanders When hears the sound of the Chinese zithers  and sees stately manners he thinks of his ofcers of the court When we change standpoint and viewpoint both our internal feeling and external appearance become different Now of the fellows who spend days in leisure those who see forms and yet do not reach the Way all respect noble status and disregard humble status Therefore all Buddhists admire and respect relics and try to keep the image of him in their hearts Consequently they inscribe and display illustrations and images of the Buddha extend respect to him and donate curios of great value in order to enhance the temple of worship First his ears and eyes are pleased and gradually he may be led to the principles of justice Sentient beings are pulled out from the three lowest realms of existence and no one is left behind It is just as when a container is lled with water it adapts to the volume  If a hole is bored into the bottom  or if it has no bottom it simply cannot hold  Moreover persistently makes a false charge that the teaching of weal and woe was made by the Buddha It should be said that he does not understand the foundation  I will again briey explain it  good or ill fortune and virtue or vice is similar to shadow or sound and form or voice The Buddha the Duke of Zhou and Confucius however all claried loyalty lial piety truthfulness and obedience Those who follow these principles have good fortune and those who go against them experience bad luck When the way to cross over water has been shown by using a boat and oars but it is impossible to cross over by foot The way to instruct people and the skill to save people from distress and death are also similar to Shen Nong ate grain to satisfy his hunger and the Yellow Emperor hung down his garments in order to control coldness and heat If someone wishes to be sated while his mouth is closed or if he asks for warmth while he remains naked we cannot grant upon him by force The reason Bian Que was called a good physician is because he prescribed medicine according to the disease and simply did not lose the proper way No one blames him for causing people not to die Furthermore Bian Que said I am able to cause people who ought to live not to die but I am unable to cause people who ought to die to live longer c If the master were in the position of a son he would be impious to his parents and if he were in the position of a vassal he would be disloyal He is offered good medicine but he does not take it Accordingly he experiences woes and on the day he dies he will further blame the sages and deeply resent the good physician is just like  who runs toward the east and through his own force throws himself into a trap Again the accuser said Among śramaṇas those who reside in the capital city and Luoyang are numerous but I have not heard that they could lengthen the emperors life spans To a great degree cannot harmonize yin and yang in order to cause a year of abundance enrich the people prevent calamities cure epidemics overcome and suppress disturbances and so on To a lesser degree cannot avoid grain in order to breathe pure  protect life surmount difculty prolong life stay young forever and so on I corrected this That is not so Zhuangzhou says Those who thoroughly understand the conditions of life do not strive after what they cannot do in life This is a case of having ascertained that the life span cannot be changed If ones lot in disposition and life could be sought by means of wisdom and virtue then that of the two sons Fa and Dan would have been sufcient to cause their father Wen to live until a thousand years old When Yanzi died said Heaven is destroying me lamented greatly over  The misfortune that happens once every one hundred and six years will occur whenever the time arrives Therefore Yao had a big ood as if water had lled the sky Tang had a drought In Zhuolu there was bloodshed enough to oat a large shield In Banquan corpses covered the wilds Why did not dispel while sitting on their thrones and rescue before happened To anticipate a long life doing these things is a sort of there was still something for which he had to wait  Yet even if like this it is still possible to die young when the time comes No one can live forever From a śramaṇas viewpoint immortals such as Chisong and qiao are just like infants who have not yet become young boys Why for the sake of longevity would they rack their brains perform at the common level and compete with Juan and Peng The one who criticizes improperly wants to develop the debate by covering his fault He stands on an aggressive position and refuses to listen to counsel his words have no constancy and his memorial to the throne makes no distinction between sovereign and subject I hate that the compound color green takes over yellow That excessive noisy sound has never been arranged I will exclusively follow the example set by my late teacher  who did not answer questions about life and death Again the accuser said At the end of the Han dynasty there was Ze Rong  who gathered an army and became a dependent of Tao Qian  the governor of Xuzhou Qian had him supervise the transportation Nevertheless although Rong earlier believed in Buddhism he dared to seize government freight for his own prot he built Buddhist temples and so on He gave away wine and food to all passersby and so on He was later attacked by Liu You and killed and so on I corrected this This criticism does not need a rope to bind  he is bound by himself The Buddhas teaching leads with benevolence and humanity not killing faithfulness and honesty not boasting incorruptibility and virtue not stealing as the most important principles Laozi said Arms are ominous instruments Those who are close to them are evil He committed murders which is a violation a of the rst  He accepted a mission  took advantage of it and did not repay his master  He seized government property in order to prot himself stealing the third  The Buddhist scriptures state not to give wine as charity but Rong did so freely drinking intoxicants the fourth  If one violates all the precepts he is working toward death This can be compared to the case where a ofcial who perverts and tyrannizes without restraint after resigning from ofce can be easily put down by a vefoottall boy He was addicted to drink and arbitrarily exceeded his authority without restraint Speaking of his natural abilities he had an average advantage Regarding his virtue he did not have any at all He is just like a worldly person who appears virtuous and yet whose mind is wicked whose appearance is stern and yet whose innermost heart is weak whose mouth praises Yu and Tang and yet whose acts match those of King Jie and Zhi He brought disaster on himself Again whose fault would it be Again the accuser said Zhou Zhongzhi believed in the Buddha and was diligent too Nevertheless he did not receive any fortune after all and so on I corrected this saying Now that I think of his words seems to rejoice in others calamities are not logical Even though Zhongzhi had an inclination toward the Way he did not make the decision to receive the precepts and become a disciple  He had a superiorlevel of talent but he also had a streak of obstinacy He had not yet been united with the Daoist principle of an infant On this account it is reasonable that he was defeated and suffered a downfall when he met a powerful man who was jealous of those better than himself Even if were just as the accuser says there are those who even though they are diligent are still killed How does this differ from the case of Yan and Xiang Tuo a genius who at only seven years old was a teacher of Confucius both of whom died young or the case of yi and Shu who starved to death or the case of Bi Gan who was faithful to  yet sank to the misfortune of having his heart cut out or the case of Shen Sheng who was very lial and yet ended in the sorrow of hanging Comparisons like these are too many to mention Confucius said The virtuous are longlived and people of justice are prosperous Nevertheless even they cannot escape  Be sure to be aware of the testimony of your former lives It is truthful Again the accuser said Families who serve Buddhism are pleased with death and hate life If he cannot why does he speak conversely A Buddhist scripture states He who considers himself to have attained the Way is capable of abstrusely seeing that others are the same as himself and of equalizing merits and demerits When such a person experiences the change from life to death is indistinct and there is no emotional sign for him When he walks in the land of weal and woe he remains calm and is not distressed He is delighted with the laws of nature and he knows his life This is why to enhance their sincere  Therefore the Buddha has the justice of the universal vow of great compassion We feel sympathy and sorrow even for an enemys death recompense his enmity with virtue and forgive his past misdeeds Could it be possible that there is no sorrowful and mournful feeling since the heartbreak of our own esh and blood spontaneously ourishes Those who love their parents and relatives do not dare hate others they are deeply afraid to put others in the same situation as themselves Everyone thinks that he cannot examine himself  and has no time to be concerned about himself in regard to a later existence these are all outstanding wonderful transcendent clearly seen true in reason and real phenomena How could those who have become accustomed to hearing a folk song such as Yellow Flowers enjoy the melody of Cloud Gate  Moreover people of the world value classical books written by the Duke of Zhou and Confucius From the time of Emperor Yao to the Han period the nine provinces never inuenced foreign regions What was it that moved Emperor Ming of the Han dynasty What virtue did he possess that he alone was illuminated by supernatural light All peoples feelings like these are entirely involved with longestablished custom and people cannot be free of worries and petty notions and cannot see by means of the profound eyes Consequently truth is not far away but people give rise to suspicions and sink in  How sad it is Gentlemen of the Middle States are versed in the subjects of ceremony and righteousness but they are inexperienced in knowing the human mind How then could they know the mind of the Buddha Now  c in worldly affairs and familiar mattersnot to speak of in your spirit the selfif your plan is not good you will still be visited by vicissitude If you are successful the spirit you will be ennobled without limit If you are unsuccessful you will eternally fall without end Moreover want to follow the view just like a frog in a well and they recklessly repress the Great Way They end up only entrapping their spirits at the bottom of the heavenly snare Now with unenlightened knowledge they try to illuminate what is profound Therefore they cannot nd even their own failure by themselves How then could they clarify what they have to attain They should clarify the direction in which their dark spirits and seek the wholesome way They should rmly cultivate themselves taking Buddhist scriptures as their guide Those Buddhist scriptures contain the virtue taught in the Five Classics they are deeply enhanced with very promising reality they include the void by Laozi and Zhuangzi and they completely emphasize the teaching that all phenomena are empty  With lofty words and real principles reverently move ones spirit They shine as brightly as the sun and they are as clean as wind Except for a sage who can expound them I will sincerely look into the views of people of the world juxtapose those views with the Buddhist doctrines and clarify  The Discourse states Now if the mind leaves ones whole body from the heels to the crown of the head and goes up through the air it will go on without stopping Then the four directions and the upper and lower directions are all boundless Life is not created all by itself It certainly transmits what has been saved up If we trace what is transmitted there is nonbeginning What is produced repeatedly without ceasing for successive generations is nonending Regarding the body every day we all make use of the essence that is limitless and came intimately from nonbeginning and that will furthermore be ceaselessly transmitted into the future Then into the immeasurable and boundless vastness for eternal time from nonbeginning to nonending people originally throw themselves one after another and spread out declare that there are three thousand suns and moons and twelve thousand worlds arranged in the universe They count as many countries as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River and put in order as many kalpas as there are ying particles of dust Why do doubt the other side ie Buddhists while being content with themselves Therefore what people of the world think great is what the Way considers to be minor What has been said The time before Xuanyuan ie the Yellow Emperor is remote antiquity possibly seems like yesterday in the lofty view of those who have mastered the Way of Heaven It is said that the Book of History is to know distance but it is not beyond the time of Tang and Emperor Yu  Phrases composed in the Spring and Autumn Annals are limited to kingcraft There is piety in the Book of Rites goodness in the Book of Music warmth in the Book of Odes and cleanliness in the Book of Changes  Now in innitude if we display three thousand shining suns and moons and correctly see the twelve thousand arranged worlds then we will know that what the Duke of Zhou and Confucius wrote are possibly just like responses to the vulgar demand to rule over in a region as small as a snails tentacles where Chu state and Man state  Moreover would be rather insufcient and only about the matters of ones present life What exists beyond life has been left as it is and never discussed If this is not the case why do they emphasize having a physical body as the beginning and leave out being a spirit after death  climbed up Mount Meng when Lu state looked a small  went up Mount Tai when the world appeared small to him These mark the boundaries between Confucianism and Buddhism In addition the f en ie the books written by Fuxi Shen Nong and the Yellow Emperor and the dian ie the books by the Five Thearchs have already been lost Compilations by scholars of shallow learning are exclusively comprised of tracts on governing  If there were transcendent remarks  some were scattered and lost in historical records and some were destroyed at the time of the incident of burning and burying  The ways of Laozi and Zhuangzi and the arts of all the perfected such as song and qiao can truly cleanse our minds and nourish our bodies but none of these are collected in the Six Classics either Accordingly scholars merely stick to the incompleteness of literature which relieves only tries This too is sad They are just like those who when walking under a stratus cloud do not believe that the sun and moon exist The expressions  in alternating yin and yang is called the Way and The unforeseen movement in alternating yin and yang is called a spirit possibly mean that the ultimate of nonexistence is the Way where both yin and yang are integrated Therefore it is said The successive movement in alternating yin and yang That which descends from the Way enters into vigorous spirits which exists beyond yin and yang and which is not examined by these two factors Hence it is simply said that The unforeseen movement in alternating yin and yang Junpings theory that one produces two refers to the spiritual intelligence indicates this If these two phrases do nothing to clarify  then with what is the vigorous spirit clearly dened Moreover although the spirits of all sentient beings are ultimately equal transmigrates following the conditions they met and forms a dull or ingenious consciousness In addition and its root are free from decay Now even though Shun was born as the son of Gu the spirit of Shun is certainly not something that Gu passed on to him Nor is the spirit of Shuns unworthy son Shangjun what Shun gave to him either Before birth there is generally of dullness or ingenuity  Since the root is established before birth we know that is immortal after death Furthermore if are immortal they are different from each other Accordingly the stupid and the sacred are distinct from each other We know that the distinctions between the stupid and the sacred and between birth and death do not change the immortal status of the spirits Therefore it is said that The vigorous spirit receives a physical body and transmigrates all over the ve realms of existence while Heaven and Earth are formed and destroyed innumerable times The physical body had the doublepupil eyes when he was born the ignorant man Gu The stupid and the sacred naturally should separate from each other Wouldnt it be that the spirit of Zhonghua was dull a long time ago but he established a cause kalpas ago and consequently conditions met after a myriad of transformations Now his spirit solitarily separates from others but in remote antiquity there was a chain of transmigrations of the dull spirit Accordingly is the completion of the renement  These three issues If the formation of a physical body the formation of the spirit and if the cessation of a physical body the cessation of the spirit then when the body is injured the spirit should be damaged as well or when the body falls ill the spirit should also be fatigued It is reported that there are people whose bodies are perishing or who are about to die and yet whose spirits and consciousnesses are calm and perfect When took hold of hand through the window was extremely ill Nevertheless there was no change as a person of virtue This is simply a testimony to the immortality  Even if we accept that there is spirit there the mountains are simply large piles of soil and the rivers are merely accumulated water How could the spirit that attained the One ie the origin of all phenomena be produced from such coarse materials as water and soil works upon rocks and streams and entrusts itself there and is solemnly united with them If the mountains fall to pieces or the rivers dry up certainly does not go to ruin together with the water and the soil  The spirit is not what the form makes So it is in the case of human beings The spirit is the word to express more ingenious than all things under the sun If is created availing of the form and perishes following the form the form is considered to be the origin  The vigorous spirit goes forth in all directions owing on boundlessly reaching to Heaven above and wreathing round the Earth beneath Sages search out exhaustively what is deep and wise people investigate what is the minutest As for people such as Zai  Zi Zhuang Ji  zha of Wu and Zifang wherever the operation of their vigorous directs their course their spirits go fast even though they do not hurry and without going they penetrate the universe from their own place All these sages wise people and virtuous people are the same as common foolish people in that their bodies rot and stink or that they delight in tasty food Could there be a reason why receive the bodies of common people to be born and perish following  We must think of this too The Duke of Zhou offered a sacrice to Heaven and Earth for Minister of Agriculture Houji and performed a sacrice to the ancestors for his father King Wen Some people of the world say that this was a waste of lial piety If there is no reason for it the spirits of King Wen and Houji cannot be said to have perished If perform purication for three days they must see those for whom the purication has been performed Can we conclude that the Duke of Zhou did not see King Wen and Houji since ordinary people do not see them When buried between Ying and Bo he said  bones and esh have returned to earth but his spiritual vapor goes wherever it likes He meant the immortality  The most virtuous administration follows Heaven Great turmoil lls Heaven This is essentially what the mind and the spirit do It does not mean that Jie did not know Yaos virtue The desires of his physical body went against his spirit The consciousness capable of knowing Yao and his ruin from vice was always contained in his spirit If had not taken the throne and lived a thousand years when he did evil he might be visited by pain successively or when he did a minor good act he might become somewhat magnanimous Couldnt he have overthrown his evil and cultivated his virtue little by little What his spirit contains as before includes the consciousness to know Yao which must have had at least a chance to be used Moreover if life span had increased to a thousand years and he had not ceased  it would be possible that his desires would have all been pacied and his spirit would have become as exquisite as that of Yao As the new moon and the full moon take turns oysters and clams respond to each of  Generally all beings are equally created by mysterious changes c How could it be that only several matters are so and myriad changes are exactly not so Therefore those who are put to death on the charge of murder who are punished on the charge of inicting injury upon others who are put in jail who do not commit a crime now or who are guilty and yet are as free from punishment as those who are innocent have all rst established conditions in the unseen world and now the reason of the human world reveals the results of these conditions Hiding and revealing are one and the same If a sin is formed in hiding an abomination reveals itself clearly There is nothing at all strange in this He who has done evil evidently gets the worst of it in hiding Why is this strange With the immortal spirit that contains the consciousness to know the virtue of Emperor Yao appear and disappear in countless generations Suffering initiates evil and pleasure leads to good In addition there is the foundation of the sun and moon that bestows light to shine brightly Rather than being afraid of being Jie and Zhou in remote antiquity all people should gradually become Tang and Wu in the future not to mention the young people of rened taste who let their minds oat on a limpid stream When you see from this standpoint it is clear too that people are able to become buddhas Life arises entirely from the germination of feeling  when a male and a female unite their essences  all creatures are incarnated completely refers to that their essences are united through feeling When feelings meet selves various spirits receive physical bodies It greatly appears as if feeling is the foundation of life Even though the Five Thearchs and the Three Augusts transcended feeling and probed into the spirit they still have to follow all principles Even met the conditions a long time ago and now they have to condescend to enter incarnation through the essence be born mutually following  and produce numerous offspring to say nothing of feelings are linked to their spirits and whose bodies become extinct How would it be possible that they will not receive bodies again and will not go through the transmigration of birth and death innumerable times If the consciousness is able to clear the foundation of immortality receives the training of diminishing ones actions from day to day diminishes it and again diminishes it and certainly arrives at wuwei there will be no feeling to lead to desire Only the spirit will shine and then there will be nothing equivalent to life When there is no life there is no body There is no body and yet there is the spirit This is the meaning of dharmakāya The Yellow Emperor Yu Shun Duke Ji  and Confucius are admired and trusted by the people of the world When we see that ascended to Heaven was given the reins that was like a hidden dragon and like a soaring bird that the sincerity of the Duke of Zhou raised a headwind that lifted up the fallen rice plants and that sang a song with stringed accompaniment while he had nothing to eat that all took their ultimate spirit as their essence and consequently became what the function of their spirits manifested as responses of a free and easy manner Even though the law of manifestation is external it just appears and disappears following the movement of numinous powers There must be also something beyond the human tether The chart emerged from River and writing came out from the Luo  The bush of lucktea grew vigorously without being planted  Within one night the trees grew so large around that one could encircle them with both arms and then suddenly vanished When Emperor Wu of the Zhou dynasty was subjugating King Zhou of the Yin dynasty a reball ew over the palace and became a raven A large threelegged caldron became light while a small one became heavy in accordance with the virtue of the rulers All these events suddenly happened and the changes occurred being affected by numinous powers a At the culmination of dharmakāya numinous powers ingeniously touch sentient beings and transform in order to manifest shines upon the spirit and its achievement brightens all things What wonder could it not exhibit What change could be limited Why would it merely ascend to the nine heavens walk like a dragon in the underworld inhale wind or abstain from grain Regarding the obscure appearance and disappearance of various auspicious omens which were mentioned above they have already left form and entered into the spirit and they are the same as the profound metaphysical agency Why do the people only believe in this ie Confucianism and restrain themselves from that  The Dharma King who was deeply awakened is pure just lofty and bright Truly there is testimony for this He is just in front of you without the least distance yet ignorant people are not aware of it How sad it is The various signs stated in the Hongfan chapter  that is to say the corresponding auspicious and inauspicious  are all derived from the mind The sorts  such as a white rainbow piercing the sun Venus entering into the Pleiades a variety of millet plants growing in a cold ravine city walls collapsing or frost falling  are entirely caused by human feelings and remotely presented as natural phenomena And just as there is no shape without shadow or no voice without sound there is no human feeling without reward or retribution How could apply only to the sorts piercing the sun or frost falling  All minutely respond to various human feelings no one can escape from phenomena that manifests due to the law of reward and retribution Sometimes however is formed over and above ones physical body and sometimes it is cast on incidents Various extraordinary things ll the world and numerous phenomena reach our eyes Therefore the Buddhist scriptures state that the forms of all existences are produced from thought Moreover the scriptures say that the mind is the origin of existences the mind makes Heaven and the mind makes Hell The meanings derive from those mentioned above Hence those who have a virtuous mind and pure feelings will certainly be reborn in the outstanding and magnicent state Those who have corrupt feelings and who commit impure acts will be eternally deluded in the region of the three lowest realms of existence Isnt this what has the law of truth yet is straightforward cleanses our spirits uplifts our thoughts and causes us to sincerely make up our minds with awe  Even though a myriad of feelings all mutually constitute conditions and form consciousnesses that move and make phenomena in fact the nature of feelings is nonexistence Since the time opened the ferry for enlightenment his solitary voice enables us to extinguish worries in a ash but no one has reached this point I will further explain and clarify it Sacred spirits shine abstrusely and yet they have no consciousness for thinking This is because there is severance between the mind and things and only the spirit exists there Now if the mind and things interact and it is not the state of spirit only even if you are as subtle as was Yanzi  you will certainly be intent on looking up to  be fond of benevolence be delighted with mountains nearly attain to  and be often empty of avarice  This is all because the mind is exerted and gives rise to consciousness For sure the functions subtly make contact with each other and the consciousnesses cleverly follow one after another just as ames come together resulting in a big blaze b If by means of the realization of emptiness the mind is set at rest the function of the mind ceases and feeling and consciousness become exhausted and the spiritual intelligence is perfect How could constantly exist the good cook Ding who was shown an ox yet he certainly was not looking at the whole body of the ox  It is what the Buddhist scriptures state the law of changes and dispersions and the nature of phenomena and consciousness are empty a dream an illusion a shadow an echo a bubble or the moon reected on water Isnt this so Yanzi was aware of like this Therefore he dealt with existence just as he did with nonexistence he touched a real thing just as he did an unreal thing and he did not perceive existence to offend him and consequently did not respond to it Now when we observe Yanzis being often empty of avarice we see that in fact existence is nonexistence Although they go toward the Great Way in haste they are called insane just the same as those who pursue a demented person who is running toward the east They all defy the principles trespass against the benecial activity  go against Heaven and act recklessly is not true existence not to speak of touch taste sound and color and shape  they are also mere shadowy apparitions falsely made by feeling In addition even if a boat is hidden in a narrow ravine can be moved by a person of great strength Changes happen more quickly than lightning The future has not yet come the past has already vanished and the present does not stay Even in the instant of the blink of an eye or an intake of breath nothing can be grasped What are you going to abide by and consider as existence It is astounding that false existence covers up the spirit there is a mirror When it is covered with dust if there is only a little shines fuzzily but when accumulates it shines dimly when piles up more thickly still shines but it is rather dark Since original nature is bright even if the mirror is covered by dust it still shines Although from dimness to darkness the essential point follows the mirror it is not extinguished When we discern things with such a dusty mirror it is certain lose more and more according to the amount of dust  and make mistakes The principle of the spirit of a human being is similar to this When the false existence implicates the spirit exquisite or coarse consciousness arises The consciousness clings to the spirit Consequently although a person dies does not perish If it is permeated with emptiness the repeated permeation certainly leads to the exhaustion  and then the original spirit is probed We follow  and open and clear them with emptiness How could those people with pure minds not be delighted by the exhaustion  Therefore in ancient times took advantage of the void and entered the Way Even if those who have attained buddhahood are as numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges River has not yet reached the point where they are too numerous Why is it imbued with all things in the phenomenal world and why does it make a relationship with them Furthermore is equal in being primarily void Why is it divided into the ignorant and the sacred Again it has already been said that the mind makes all things in the phenomenal world Before all things in the phenomenal world were created what implicated the mind and made it move to produce them I answered The spirit is subtle while the physical body is coarse but both make interactions Now although an ignorant person is mean he is essentially able to know about the past in the present and to think of other places while being here All this is due to the fact that the spirit has functions so if we can completely train  we will know that is basically equal c and void I have explained that the mind makes all things in the phenomenal world When we observe reality based on this view that these three issues are assuredly true The reason they are so is however derived from nonbeginning How could there be the beginning of nonbeginning How could it be an issue whether or not those who learn understand A sage is indeed a coagulum  who simply gives up the physical body and who is simply moved and later responds is beyond our comprehension namely outside of the universe where there is nothing by which we are moved Therefore left it intact and did not discuss it Now we live together treading upon Earth under the canopy of Heaven Outside of upon which we tread and under which we reside could there be nality The reason Yu assisted the ve regions ie Dian Hou Sui Yao and Huang and governed no more than the nine provinces probably means that simply the areas that are reached by worldly inuences How could such borderlands be discussed Now we inferred from upon which we tread and under which we reside and have nally reached what we cannot discuss is therefore the same as this In the case where we infer the function of the spirit of the present seek the beginning point in the past and nally reach what the sage left intact and did not discuss an element of truth simply threads together too How could we discuss it alone All are derived from conditions made in the unseen world and following the universe they are eternal but because what peoples senses feel is limited Peoples minds receive the sacredness by which they form the consciousnesses It is just as when peoples eyes meet with sunlight by which they come to see Now if very tiny hairs are spread a thousand steps away from us weaksighted people cannot see them even availing of  yet they have no shortcomings in perceiving the tiny hairs and avoiding danger Why is the tiny hair a hundred xun away questioned on the basis of the vagueness of a thousand steps away Those who do not master the foundation of conditions that give rise to phenomena and who lack feeling have no chance to meet sacredness but they have no shortage in knowing and reaching the ferry that leads to the Way Why is the teaching that was already claried questioned due to the vagueness of the beginning of conditions that give rise to phenomena A person asked People of today say that since they do not understand the beginning of conditions that give rise to phenomena they cannot believe in the Buddha Is this not affections of the mind Why doesnt the sage clarify it I answered What is called affections of the mind is a state of harboring or of exciting  and there is still an incomprehensible point in reason We ought to avail ourselves of the sacredness in order to understand it thoroughly Therefore if people enjoy themselves being impeded by existence then claries with the signicance of suffering and emptiness If love without distinction is not propagated then he shows benevolence through the act of diving into  Those who practice the teaching do not necessarily reach all together Accordingly the three vehicles are established Since acts vary cultivations differ from each other So the six pāramitās are elucidated There is not even a single lack in the responsive activity for the ferry and the bridge to  It can be said  is simply moved and later responds a Consequently the heavenly beings who listened to the teaching on Vulture Peak were entirely relieved those who arrived at the ultimate state were numerous Would they have further questioned the beginning of conditions that give rise to phenomena and later arrived at the principle The clear instruction is adequate If you cultivate as said what would be decient Otherwise how different are those who still certainly do not believe in and in the end have excessive doubts about what is beyond our comprehension from those who get a fatal disease and yet do not take medicine that is offered or from those who are struck by a stray arrow and yet do not take the shaft out bearing the pain and who demand to know the basics of the construction of the arrow and the medicine and so on and end up in death This is entirely because those who have cultivated from ancient times and yet have not attained great good fortune cause the people who believe in today to absurdly doubt  How could this be considered to be real affections of the mind based on reason The unreasonable movement of the mind full of absurd doubt assuredly has nothing to move the sacredness and to be able to elucidate If we sincerely go with faith awakening will come later in accordance with the response Once we attain awakening what is aroused can nally reach the acme of the unseen world Those who stick to absurd doubt who do not return to purity and who do not straighten themselves out will precisely fall into the disaster of delusion for a long time To turn ones back on differs slightly from facing it but to go up is greatly separated from falling into  Shouldnt you be careful A person asked Confucius teaches  will not seek to live at the risk of injuring their virtue In the Buddhist scriptures too the practices for bodhisattvas are prescribed Laozi elucidates the utmost of wuwei that is to say the culmination of nirvana However have never spoken about supernatural power and the attainment of buddhahood Could there be something Confucius and Laozi have left out By clarifying the Way do you want to stir up among people and cover up the real for attaining the Way How can I stop giving rise to the question that there is no reality in Buddhism I answered In the origination of edication each teaching depends on to what it responds When the pure wind became becalmed the two chapters of the Daodejing were compiled in order to stop the movement If Yan  Ran  Zai  Zigong Yin Xi and Zhuangzi were externally commended in the conduct of Confucianism and the profound learning in order to lead to the height of what people of the world feel and they internally received the learning of nonarising in order to specialize in seeking the principle of the spirit who in the world would know it As for the class of people such as Ran Qiu Ji Lu Zixia Zisi Mencius Linzong Kangcheng Ge Gong Yan ping Ban Si and Yang Wang some played their part within ethical education some ended up by themselves living an easy life free from worldly matters and they were not delighted with the Buddhist teaching All stopped within their scarce conditions and nally did not go any further Therefore Confucius and Laozi spoke out and instructed Confucianism promulgates benevolence and Daoism restrains activity Even though the benevolence and good  the inactivity  and what the Buddha spoke of are common regarding the dharmakāya and nirvana express nothing Therefore are simply obscure Moreover generally it is said that  does nothing  but there is nothing that it does not do and The dharmakāya has no form and universally enters into all things Arent the same in tenor Thereupon even though the three teachings b of Confucius Laozi and the Tathāgata are different courses from each other they are all of a piece in learning wholesomeness A person asked From the time of the Three Augusts and the Five Thearchs up to the time of Confucius and Laozi there must have been people who cleansed their minds by the Buddhist teaching Why is this I answered I have already made clear my intention about this in my previous discussion Scholars of shallow learning exclusively compiled the vestiges of political affairs If there were otherworldly statements some were dispersed into historical records and some vanished at the time of burning and burying  Now I will repeat and express what I have in my mind It is stated in Kong Anguos preface to the Book of History Shangshu xu that the writings by the Three Augusts are called the Three Ancient Books which speak about the Great Way At that time lial piety and benevolence were fully practiced Why would they have had to teach humanity and justice  The people did not leave behind simplicity and honesty How could such as Laozi and Zhuangzi incite them to do so If it is not claried that the foundation of the spirit is nonarising and the nature of all things is empty in order to illuminate the culmination what is considered to be the Great Way This writing has disappeared Who in the world could know about it The historian Qian talks about the Five Thearchs resided on the hill of Xuanyuan climbed up Mount Kongtong and ascended Mount Wan and Mount Dai went to Youling and Panwu and his outstanding vestige is beyond waves  How could we know that were not derived from the Way of the Tathāgata During the longlasting period of the Five Thearchs Yao reigned for one hundred years and Shun for only seventy years In the style of Guang Cheng Dawei Hong Yai Chao Xu  Zhifu the northerner  and the four immortals of Mount Gushi the profound manners were accumulated and brimmed over at that time Of the books by the Five Thearchs however there are only two compositions extant the Tang and the Yu  which are not complete How can we accept that it is entirely false that there were Buddhist practitioners in ancient times just because the ourishing of the highest path is not found in these incomplete compositions Now here we see the ruler of spiritual intelligence who roamed in the great and vast world the seven sages who all together went to Mount Juci and a holy man seen on Mount Gu Ye They were beings in transformation How could we know that what sublime words elucidate is not the spirit that went to extremes beyond numerous kalpas Guang Cheng said The essence of the ultimate Way is deeply obscure He means the heroic valor concentration  He who attains my Way will be the August at the highest or a king at the lowest means that one can ascend or descend according to the edication he is similar to the Flying Emperor the wheelturning noble king  He who fails in attaining my Way will see the light for the highest or he will become the earth for the lowest refers to those who transmigrate in Heaven and in the human realm  he sensed the great lofty air  called him the Heavenly Master and withdrew from that place is also the ten epithets  The Way was deeply practiced at that time Thereupon what the various schools of thinkers collected seems understandable but it is obscure Furthermore the learned among government ofcials do not say that are elegant and instructive Consequently the result is that those who follow the worldly way and who do not deeply master the Way depend on history books that restrain them from reaching the doctrines disregard the profound edication complying with immediate feelings and put their vigorous spirits in eternal trouble Boyi said in the Book of Mountains and Seas  In the country of Tiandu the people are very dear to others and love each other In Guo Pus commentary on the book it is said The country we formerly called Tiandu is Tianzhu where Futu originated and the expression to be very dear to means to love also a model of the Tathāgatas great benevolence Originally was known in the times of the Three Augusts and the Five Thearchs Although the national statute records do not impart  this is insufcient to cause doubt Generally how can we surmise things that happened from the three dynasties to the time of Confucius and Laozi which were not recorded in books of history Confucius asked about rites and Laozi responded to  Now when the existence of various writings for a hundred generations is uncertain there is nothing fully complete in reason How could we judge solely by our observation that Confucius and Laozi had no exchange  Replying to a question of Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty Dongfang Shuo advised him to ask a man from Central Asia about the black ashes he had obtained which Zhu Falan later said were the remains burned in re at the time of the exhaustion of a kalpa Liu Xiangs Biographies of Arrayed Transcendents states that seventyfour men are found in the Buddhist scriptures Again it was not Emperor Ming of the Han dynasty that began  Nevertheless those who exercise their spirits and stick to mundane matters are many and evident while those who form sincerity in the tranquil and subtle state are rare and inconspicuous Therefore the fact to secretly be grateful is simply not exposed in sentient beings The eminent Buddhist monk Fotudeng was a kindhearted sage at the time of Shi Le and Hu told Shi Hu that In the city of Linzi county there is the old site of the King Aśoka Temple where there is still a image and the dew basin is buried in the earth twenty zhang under a big tree in a deep forest An envoy of Hu looked for them relying on the illustration and found everything had mentioned Recently when Yao Les uncle was a king of Jin he saw a bright light at the site of the King Aśoka Temple so called by the elders in Puban of Hedong Seeking  he had his men dig there and obtained relics of the Buddha in a silver case inside a stone container Today bhikṣus live in a new temple  From the observation of these facts a long time has passed since Buddhist practices were transmitted to the land of Qi and Jin The reason was not mentioned in the three commentaries is similar to the reason why in the history books written by Gan Bao and Sun Sheng ie the Jinji and the Jinyangqiu there are no remarks about the Buddha During the Jin period ourished in the Jiangzuo area  A person asked If all buddhas actually exist understand thoroughly all phenomena and are able to do all things freely with their awesome supernatural powers why do they not brightly manifest themselves today Why a do they not cause those of exquisite and those of weak equally to have faith and awaken them to the truth Why do they not make the class of gentlemen see Buddhism Accordingly people do not equally believe in  and they fall down together into the suffering of an icchantika Among the people of the states of Qin and Zhao six hundred thousand were buried by Bai Qi and Xiang Ji in a day Actually all people of good ethics of all ages and all those who were buried neither necessarily have the conditions from previous lives for great wholesomeness nor do they accumulate great evils without any conditions Nevertheless had no chance to see the Buddhas mercy and were buried together on the same day Sadly this misery is completely equal  watched this extremely cruel from their seats and never responded What can be considered to be their mercy The condition does not overturn ones fate and virtue does not cause people to leave the world that is to say cannot save people On what basis can it be considered that supernatural power is free and wonderful Marquis Yang of Lu state put off the sunset by guiding the sun with a spear when he fought Han state Geng Gong welled out water  Song of Jiujiang   tigers kept out of Jiujiang and locusts were held back at the state boundary Since they all thoroughly employed the power of their minds freely they could mysteriously move nonhuman beings  It goes without saying that the Buddhas supernatural power to pacify Qis mind and tame Jis mind is in order to save the lives of a million people Moreover among Buddhists there are those who become śramaṇas and burn their bodies those who renounce moral laws and cut the six feelings and those who suffer from labor or squander their fortunes in order to serve a temple and images It is a pity If it is said that the response will come in the future the six hundred thousand people mentioned previously were different the goodness and evil of their actions and yet they were equally killed through injustice Even if good and evil acts differ from each other why is there difference only in what they undertook after death The future is vast and restless What are we supposed to expect there Are we supposed to be afraid that there is really no future A sutra says As toes touch the earth all triplethousand buddha lands appear and all people even to the extent of the blind the deaf the dumb prisoners and those who are suffering attain peace Regardless of distance life or death and observance of the precepts ie Buddhist or nonBuddhist the Buddha is equally benevolent to everyone If has the benevolent mind he should see peoples suffering and he should give peace to them in the same manner as in this  Moreover Buddhist scriptures have many words like this to make us happy In fact somewhat unexpectedly there is no immediate response If you actually look at the path from above you will not see anything difcult Nothing in its regular course is the Way The Buddha simply established the Way by means of the spirit b Hence virtue and the Way are one The spirit and the Way are two different issues Since they are two  they illuminate in order to lead to transformations Since one they always have causality and yet nothing to create Each of myriad transformations certainly follows causality and is created in the Great Way The reason we call him the Buddha is because he is free from all existing things and is beyond comprehension it is not because he can save people absurdly apart from conditions they created in their previous existences Guidance of the spiritual function entirely pervades just like complying with a precipice What part is illuminated is simply unthinkable The Buddha is probably none other than the Way of sages It is just as with Yaos distinguished corresponding manifestation that when causality is ripe even without doing anything his achievement spontaneously manifested  The reason the tones of a bell move nonhumans just as the tunes of Zou Yans music caused a variety of millet to grow in a cold ravine is because the mind profoundly corresponds  not to mention ingenious sages who consider the principle of the spirit as virtue Generally all those who have encountered each other in a far buddha land have a strong will and a pure spirit that have increased in brightness through many kalpas Thereupon they are able to take in and understand him thoroughly The result is that ākyamuni emits light that shines throughout the ten directions Prabhūtaratna caused a to spring up  and the world of Merupradīparāja Tathāgata was moved into Vimalakīrtis room  How could the Buddha manifest himself alone  can see the Buddha As for people like the gentlemen here today they were not born in the fortunate of the Arhat but live within the land governed by Yu  Since in sincerity they all went against in their former  they meet perversity in their present  Even if a person is as upright as yi and qi or as dutiful as Liu and Ji as long as what he sets his mind on is against  how can he feel and see the Buddha The gentleman among men is in fact the small man of Heaven On what basis could one who contains the highest spirit respond to the affections of their minds They themselves do not see  If some people were born following a condition and have the sincerity to practice the six pāramitās due to acts made in their previous life they feel and see brightly by themselves There must be such people time after time If so and if there are Buddhist clergy and laypeople side by side how do we know the difference between them Hence whether or not one sees the Buddha is due to the difference in the response  How could you doubt the existence of the Buddha because you are not clear about the glorious appearance  There are numinous beings between Heaven and Earth It is clear that the vigorous spirit is not perishable Now the spirits of the people of the states of Qin and Zhao arose together with the universe Even if Heaven and Earth are settled and corrupted are imperishable How could the two generals Qi and Ji destroy six hundred thousand spirits at once Spirits are unable to be exterminated what are exterminated are physical bodies Just as the Buddha says what is usually perishable are the physical bodies of sentient beings How can we make this clear  The method of Qian is to change and transform so that everything obtains its correct nature as appointed  All lives extending to those of birds pigs dogs and sheep are treated equally in the hexagrams and the six diagrams for divination  People eat other living creatures in order to support themselves They are as cruel as spiders that spin their webs  Hawks and tigers cannot survive unless they catch and eat  but people can on cooked grain and vegetables Even so people still kill and eat other living creatures they are very ferocious The Way of Heaven is extremely fair what it disseminates is life How could it allow people to oppress the lives and suppress a response from the unseen world Even though the six hundred thousand people must have been dissimilar to one another in charactersome were good and some were bad I am afraid that they did not differ in mercilessly eating other sentient beings The good is different from the bad Therefore they received in their lifetimes should have certainly been dissimilar they were all equal in harming sentient beings Consequently they should assuredly have received detriment on the same day Daoist sayings and what people of the world say are nothing new Regarding Lord Yu and Bing Ji their virtuous conduct of rescuing and making others happy was later rewarded On the other hand Yan Yannian  Tian Fen of the Wei dynasty and Emperor Xuan of the Jin dynasty murdered and received retribution in turn These are all found in books of history of the Han and Wei dynasties as what was believed in the world  to save the lives of others will pass on blessings to his descendants not to speak of the case where ones vigorous spirit becomes the subject to save or destroy others lives he will have reward or retribution in his later existence If we destroy or save others lives we ourselves will certainly receive retribution or reward Needless to say if one satises or frustrates the spirit of others he will ascend or fall in his own spirit Those killed by Yannian were all ordinary small people while Dou Ying who was killed by Tian Fen and Wang Ling who was driven to commit suicide by Sima Zhongda who later became Emperor Xuan were talented people a prime minister and a loyal ofcial of the Wei dynasty were dissimilar in their intelligence and social status but were equal in receiving retribution In respect of receiving retribution it is regardless of excellence or humbleness there is no difference between a general a minister and an emperor of the Jin dynasty Isnt it the case where the Way of Heaven is extremely fair the children regardless of the distinction of their mental faculty or where the principle lies in a persons life not in their nobility or humbleness Even though a hog and a sh are humble each of their lives is correctly based on the Way of Heaven When we observe a large bird circling in the air a small bird chirping the ox whose lowing Gelu recognized and the deer who moved Xi Ba  is deeply affectionate toward the fellow animals of its kind  there are a pregnant woman and a young child If a person cuts open and scoops out  or roasts the young child this is called an unjust and grievous offense one at which Heaven shudders To hunt pregnant animals in spring or to roast or salt down a lamb and a young bird are the same in the Way of Heaven How could there be no retribution Nevertheless following the proper in which people drank blood we now cannot suddenly stop hunting and shing Therefore a sage king educated by keeping away from the slaughterhouse and kitchen This is probably because he tried to lessen the harm submitting to the fact that people slaughter  If one walks into a slaughterhouse and hears cries he cannot bear  To set up hunting seasons in accordance with the wolf and the otter is done because it is hateful to injure pregnant animals at the inappropriate time Since the former kings relieved the masses and helped meet an urgent need they had very deep benevolence but they could not exercise strict control over immediately Therefore he values equally the lives in the ve realms of existence and set forth the abandonment of the destruction of life as the rst of many precepts King Bimbisāra received retribution a white hare the ākya clan was ruined because yellow sh indicate the natural features of retribution If had been able to listen to the Way and had cultivated the teaching and the precepts with respect they would certainly not have fallen into a pit at Changping and been buried alive as were the soldiers of Lord Mafu  Even after falling into the pit if they had believed in the teaching and had been able to practice thoroughly they would have surely transcended their impending difculties If the sin caused by the condition in a previous existence is heavy it is hard to receive the reward for his former  but the virtue he earns by observing the precepts arrives later and he will surely not be buried alive again in his next existence What you said about dispersing the spiritual function over the distressed in order to remove them from suffering injustice is just such a case as this It is the highest benevolence If one who is good in secular values and yet who does not have faith in the Way destroys the lives of many living creatures retribution exposes him to danger This is just as it should be The Buddha avails himself of the principle  lives up to the very nature of things and saves people through the Dharma He cannot unreasonably save those who do not follow the Dharma and the principle How could the Buddha be unreal This can be compared to the case of Bian Que  Even though he tried to cure a sick person with medicine if did not trust him and did not take the medicine the disease would not be cured The reason Yang of Lu state put off the sunset by guiding the sun with a spear when he fought Han state Geng Gong of the Later Han dynasty welled out water by adjusting himself and vowing twice in the land of Xiongnu and the distant ancestor Jiujiang had virtue by which locusts and tigers were kept out of the area is entirely because their strong sincerity moved  That the Way of the Spirit is moved is precisely the same as that the Buddha is moved If those who could have moved the Way of the Spirit had been in the states of Qin and Zhao they would surely not have fallen into trouble That is to say all those who fell into trouble had no sincerity By what could they have moved the Buddha and harmonized and softened Qi and Ji Since those who possessed supernatural power congregated at the hall of a thoroughly educated one  it was possible to see Mount Sumeru in a mustard seed Moreover although they were now a tiger and a dove they might have been human beings in their previous existences They had once had the formation of a condition Therefore they met the Buddha and received the good fortune of sacricing his physical body to save the tiger and cutting off a piece of his thigh to give instead of the dove  The cessation of blowing sounds from the myriad apertures completely attributes to each of their own causes Why do you doubt the Buddha If your determination is rm when you think of him you will see him and when you speak to him he will listen to you Confucius met the Duke of Zhou in a dream Emperor Gaozong of the Yin dynasty saw the gure of Fu Yue and Fu Yue in fact came to him there is a long interval between the time of the Duke of Zhou and that of Confucius and Fuyan is a long distance away  The separation in time and distance however did not obstruct these profound b meetings When we presume from this point we should believe that if we purify our thoughts and perceive  we will see Amitābha Buddha beyond myriad worlds without any effort Why do you say that there is no difference and the bare empty sky The Way lies in training the spirit not in having the physical body exist Hence śramaṇas shave their heads burn their bodies encourage their spirits and cut off association  The spirit is imperishable and it is capable of traveling quickly to wherever it is going  strive for principles of human relationships and are distressed with their six feelings If they sincerely take the tonsure by themselves and cut off  they will diminish from day to day and through the purication they will actually draw close to the Way Even if they made strenuous effort to make a good reputation for themselves or expended all their fortune to build a fabulous residence if they die soon after that what they receive in name and reality does not go beyond robbers and boasters just as is stated in the Laozi Daodejing If they construct a mansion where images of deities are placed and where it is profound tranquil and solemn their physical bodies will comply with its subtlety and their spirits will follow the profundity If the physical body is subtle the response will be pure to be robbers and boasters or to be close to the Way If they go secretly and are united with the spiritual intelligence happiness and prosperity will manifest in their later existences How can we see what they will obtain  Activities in human affairs are certainly linked to the Way of the Spirit In the phenomenal world nothing exists irrationally everything must have a reason to exist If profound and unseen reward or retribution is not like what I have said above for what reason were the six hundred thousand people buried alive Now among people of the Warring States period there were those as ingenious as An Qi those as profound as the four white and bright men of Mount Shang and the man who became an emperor by having a noble face and who became a monarch by giving a part of his efdom to feudal lords ie Emperor Gaozong of the Han dynasty Wouldnt this be a corresponding manifestation of reward from each persons previous existence Inasmuch as happiness in this existence is the result of actions made in a previous existence it is clear that the actions one makes in this existence will result in reward and retribution in his next existence Now the difference of personality in this existence is made clear by the previous existence so why is only what one accepts in his next existence allowed to be exceptional According to what a sutra expresses To take the chance to see the Buddhas edication is entirely due to the fact that there was originally an excellent condition  Therefore when one meets  he feels as if he has met before Nevertheless you said that there has been no sudden corresponding manifestation of response and all faults have nothing to do with  You should fear the offense of disgracing the Sage I venture to ask you Is the one who made up the ctitious idea a sage a wise person or a small person The Sage does not have an invariable mind of his own It is probably because he educates the masses following their natures and has them fulll  If the spirit perishes when the body dies should just devote themselves to do their best with the Confucian teaching to the ends of their lives Again what is the matter try to delude people by saying that the spirit is immortal and deceive them by telling about the attainment of buddhahood induces people to take the tonsure and burn the skin and causes married couples to divorce There are innumerable people who have refrained from having offspring What are these ctitious ideas good for The harm they cause is much more painful We know that this is not what sages and wise people did If the person belongs to a group of people like Fan Xu  he restrains himself out of fear that the Duke of Zhou and Confucius may consider him a heretic and does not venture to act recklessly If he is below the level of that group he is merely one of the goodfornothings Five hundred years  people like Nāgārjuna ryadeva Aśvaghoṣa Kātyāyanī Dharmaṣresthin Vasubhadra and Dharmatrāta respectfully explained the teaching of the Way in the Dazhidulun the Zhonglun  the Bailun and a group of the Abhidharma discussions These people had a genius for supernatural powers The eight wise men such as Jīvaka and Jiantuole about whom Sun Chuo recently composed a hymn and those whose portraits Zhi Daolin drew together with a eulogy such as Dharmarakṣa Yu Falan Daosui and Que Gon have the spirit that shines over the Chinese nation Zhu Faxing of China was compared to the Director of the Imperial Secretariat Yue d  by his contemporary  rīmitra of the Jiangsu area during the Eastern Jin dynasty was highly evaluated for the outstanding and lofty state of his mind by all the princes Guo Wenju was broadminded profound and sincere and he had faith only in Buddhism Generally since the time of Nāgārjuna could there be people who entirely incur danger caused by the deceit of those goodfornothings mentioned above In that case wouldnt the matter of Master Yellow Face be undoubted The image relics teeth hair other articles and remaining footprints of the Buddha are still luminous in his homeland This fact is also evidence of the Way There are many people in the foreign land who have keen natures for examining things and who are intelligent In addition their sensual desires are generally deep Since the time their ancestors stood in front of the Buddha all of them have accumulated acts intimately transmitted in the world and relied on the facts The image the relics and the legacy brightly educate the people and their harmonious relationship is clear Hence the descendant kings bade the whole nation to observe the precepts The four kinds of Buddhist disciples devote themselves wholeheartedly to ascetic  They will have no regret even if they were to die  If the doctrines are peculiar and vague and if there is nothing real and wonderful in these events would be willing to exert themselves to control their carnal desires in order to respect the Invisible One If the image and the articles are not real and if rumors are circulating why do people both of the past and of present times torment themselves to leave behind carnal desires in order to make progress toward the goal I would like to argue  The reason why from former times is not evident for those who study the Way is because lies in holding onto life but suffering arises from holding onto life Therefore all buddhas enlighten them by means of suffering and lead them by means of nonbirth nonbirth cannot be quickly realized If one collects merit and sublimates himself more and more he can be led to the clear serene culmination For this reason the Way is as vast as a blue sea No matter how small there is nothing that is not ferried across and no matter how large there is nothing that is not led Even though is very much opposed to the teaching of striving after making a living and holding onto life it also teaches the ve cardinal duties and induces people to practice and assist ethical education The reason why people of the world say that weal and woe are not well timed in the Way of Heaven is similar to the reason why the historian Qian had deep emotion about Boyi First of all why would the sage Confucius have made a reckless statement Shangchen died a natural death in old age even though he had murdered his father King Cheng and his son King Zhuang was sagacious and assumed the hegemony Generally these matters cannot be entirely understood in reason but could there be anything that is not understood in reason We cannot help believing the teaching that if one accumulates enough good deeds he will have blessings in his later existence and he will have misfortune in the three lowest realms of existence Even though the physical body has life and death the vigorous spirit will certainly receive responses to what one has done in his lifetime Causes and conditions however have a sequence It is just as there are early or later manifestations of fortune or misfortune in ones lifetime If are encompassed within the framework of one hundred years there is no one wether young or old who is not included Even whose hair has faded and turned to yellow and whose back is hunched over and covered with spots like the blowsh still feel that the time they have lived is eeting not to mention those who have lived for a shorter time Moreover time never stops and the movement is everlasting The time that has already passed is incalculable and limitless Why is it difcult to come up to one hundred years by accumulating moments that are as brief as the blink of an eye Peoples attachment to their physical bodies which are as shortlived as morning dew has mostly nothing in the reality of the clean and remote  Why do they content themselves a water clock with become rotten and stink abuse the eternally existing spirit and not themselves cast obstructions to the remote wind Since they merely wander in the realm of human beings and are noisy on the worldly path they simply feel that the human way is prosperous and belittle the idea of spirits the clear spaciousness of the universe and the wonder of the sun and moon shining through Could it be possible that there is no dignity of awesome numinous beings of various sages there and there is only a multitude of people who busy themselves with worldly matters Certainly we will think of the eternal in order to open the thought of the Way of the Spirit and feel tranquility in order to elucidate the corresponding manifestation of numinous beings In the past in Lu state Confucius wrote the Five Classics by which he educated the people of the world When he looked down from the top of Mount Tai and Mount Meng both the world and Lu state appeared small to him Doesnt this indicate that his spirit united with the universe and consequently he transcended this world If this is so the Five Classics were probably written merely to respond to trivial requests for a momentary lifetime How is it possible that the people of the world block the Buddhist Dharma and do not believe in it Is the reason you do not believe in the Buddhist Dharma because there is no spiritual intelligence but the multitude or because that there is spiritual intelligence but there is no buddha If there is no spiritual intelligence at all but the multitude then who ordered the swallow to cause the Shang dynasty to be born into the world Who left the footprints of a giant that caused to have a feeling and give birth to Qi  The Han Wei Jin and Song dynasties all had an auspicious decree from Heaven  If there are the principles of spirits there must be the subtle zenith If he who is marvelous since  b he has gotten the One is not the Buddha who else could he be Why is it necessary to deceive the people and later teach them In that case it is not open to question that the Dharma is real and the teaching is truthful Therefore by law all beings respond to the spirits who have reached the profound culmination In the case of Yao various kinds of animals that lived far away danced being impressed with his virtue Isnt this the manifestation of moving and responding between Yao and the animals The Buddha is the foundation of various manifestations of moving and responding For the sun moon the seas and the high mountains there are the morning and evening rites and the signicance of the worship of viewing the mountains and rivers from a distance not to mention the Buddhist Way that many people cultivate those of high rank trace to the very source of spirits beyond the realm of arising those of middle rank receive a physical body in the subtle realm of arising ie the realms of heavenly beings and human beings and those of low rank can be exempted from the three lowest realms of existence What the worldly teaching propagates is to attain peace and order in the whole course of ones life Those who deeply master are rare while those who the world are numerous How could they have ever participated in  They just follow worldly trends and say that if one dies his spirit perishes Consequently they do not strive for a lofty aspiration in the pure and distant  and utilizing every spare moment many people comply with worldly trends Therefore the way of gentlemen is seldom practiced If we examine with the Buddhist Dharma our physical bodies are not ourselves probably they are only like an inn in which to rest for awhile The spirit is the part of ourselves  It exists boundlessly and eternally and has no end  The virtue of those who have the best virtue pervades over them limitlessly Those who are good in the middle rank are slowly led to purity are promoted and attain the exhaustion  Those who are least virtuous in the low rank just have a chance to reform their evil acts and they may make up for mistakes they have made to move to an upper rank Therefore from ancient times regardless of sharp and dull faculties there are innumerable people who keep themselves pure hold a lofty aspiration behave prudently in the present existence in order to shape karma in the next existence and go on to supreme virtue This is the efcacy of the Buddhist Dharma These are all what worldly customs and traditions block and what the Buddha opens up As for the category isnt it the vast bright way to the wondrous existence Why do you disregard it and not uphold it Wind after passing through a ame is warm and it is assuredly fresh when it blows through a forest Water becomes muddy in a rapid stream and when it becomes puried the rocks can certainly be clearly seen Gains and losses in the function of the spirit also lie in to what the spirit entrusts itself Not having faith in the Buddhist Dharma is not necessarily due to ones temperament but is probably because of ones frame of mind If you try to keep your mind away from worldly affairs and move what is projected to the pure and subtle  the Buddhist doctrine will be clear and all matters can be believed Since you can eternally save all the karma of your ancestors both evident and hidden up to a hundred past generations it is the great lial piety Since all sentient beings benet from benevolence it is the highest mercy Since the spirit concentrates and becomes subtle it is the culmination of the Way If what began even in the mind of an ordinary person is placed on the right track at the beginning even if many kalpas pass for sure it will directly gather at the profound culmination in the end Equally if the same person fails to get onto the track and goes astray he will aimlessly go a long way and eternally sink into the nine realms of the transmigration of birth and death How sad it is If what I said above is not true why in the world do virtuous sages suddenly appear why are stupid and humble people born and brought up and why are there all buddhas in the upper stratum and ying and wriggling insects at the bottom All of these are the natural features of the gains and losses of the spirit c People have a physical body of seven chi and grow old and die in several tens of years of which half is entirely occupied by nighttime Since there are many days to go into mourning or to get sick suffer for half of their remaining time not counting nights In addition the prime of life passes  and when one has honor and fame he is certainly afraid of being disgraced Pleasure really comes together with distress and there is no perfect peace however strive with each other in entering the steep path of popular custom and hate to advance on the spacious path of the Buddhist Dharma What do you think of their intelligence There are really many people in the world who are troubled about the Buddhist doctrine since they cannot understand the beginning of the conditions that give rise to phenomena conditions that give rise to phenomena is vast and limitless and it is not reached by our recollections I would like to repeat and explain this The sage created the Book of Changes can practice divination by interpreting the sun moon and heavenly bodies that hang down from the sky and know good or bad luck peace or upheaval Nevertheless when we investigate why it results in such a situation we are unable to know anything since the sage did not clarify it Now if we give up what we can know because we do not know why it results in such a situation and take actions contrary to divination or against the signs of the sky would anything be lost To go against the Buddhist Dharma because the beginning of conditions that give rise to phenomena is not clear is similar to this Moreover people say that the spirit originally does not exist since they do not remember what they thought in their former existences When he thinks of this he has a vague feeling and remembers nothing not to mention one who has experienced the transmigration of birth and death and who has gone through different bodies When Zilu asked about death the Master said While you do not know life how can you know about death When he asked about serving spiritual beings said While you do not know about serving men how can you know about serving spirits Wouldnt it be that although You was completely fond of bravery and sincerely served his master he should have originally asked questions about matters within his lifetime Even though had questions about birth and death and the origin of spiritual beings they are not from real affections of the mind based on reason Therefore  mans nature and the Way of Heaven cannot be heard In Buddhist statements there is the phrase The fourteen questions regarding the issue of of sentient beings or the issue on whether or not has boundaries are entirely left intact and not answered by all the intelligentsia If answering indeed has no benet to fall into viciousness Then the Way to respect sages and to believe in the Buddha should decline what it renounces and should take what it is granted just as when a thirsty man goes to drink water from a river and scoops up water from the stream to satisfy himself Would it be necessary for him to trace the very source on Mount Kunlun Generally in the Buddhist Dharma unreasonable things like disobeying Heaven and hindering the principles can be doubted Now in Buddhism there is no unreasonable hindrance and there is truth to follow the mandate of Heaven and purify the spirit Wouldnt this really be so Trouble and misfortune happen in events every now and then Natural disasters rise in force imperceptibly Even rened and noble people or those who have a million followers spontaneously have a physical body and a spirit at the beginning and wait for impermanence  just sitting there Even though the members of the household are with stern severity or the wife and children are to be smirking and chattering they suddenly become downcast and absentminded How much less can we rely adequately on peoples minds They wastefully slander the profound teaching and indulge themselves in wanting to harm it uselessly but the spirit is immortal Even if they desire its morality they cannot have it and they must receive a body because of a sin they have committed Sentient beings who have no redeeming features and various kinds of insects of the present time are all examples of this Those who try to seek should consign themselves only to sincerity believe in the Buddha rely on the mind and observe the precepts in order to reinforce their vigorous spirits If you receive the aid of numinous beings in your lifetime you will be pure and peaceful after death If you are pure and peaceful endlessly then you will directly attain buddhahood The Buddha is originally said to be this state but people disparage it On what basis do you judge that people are better than the Buddha They are not better  They cannot stop falling into the evil realms where they eternally receive intense suffering It is beyond our control in the secular world that there are people who are born into the six extreme evils Those who are diligent in what they hear and see when they are about to die they mostly have a stable mind on their deathbeds Even if those in urgent and desperate situations chant the name of Avalokiteśvara with wholehearted devotion there is almost no one who will not be favored with salvation How can they increase their spirits and manage myriad cycles  If you rely on the Duke of Zhou and Confucius to educate the masses and taste the Buddhist Dharma to nourish the spirit you will be an intelligent ruler in your lifetime and a bright spirit after death and you will always manage  How could the Tathāgata deceive me does not lead to wasting money and harming people by worshiping a pagoda making luxurious images and supporting incapable monks with tolerance Those who do not see the profound reality of things and yet look at immediate disadvantages will unrestrainedly insult the Dharma Formerly Master Huiyuan puried his karma on Mount Lu I went there and stayed for fty days His teacher Master Daoan had spiritual virtue that was spontaneously wonderful He was a bhikṣu such as is rarely encountered Both were originally of wide knowledge in the Way and later lived in isolation on a mountain often talked with me under the trees on a cliff or in a valley were philosophical but there was spontaneously something to admonish people in their expression What is well conrmed refers to that created a written language on the basis of birds footprints that he who traced the very source of the spirit could hear peoples songs  or that Emperor Wen of the Han dynasty who recovered the power took Tiyings word and consequently corporal punishment was permanently abolished Certainly phenomena suddenly come out of the affections of the delicate mind and nally shoot up into the sky If I suddenly die how could I not know that I am transcending to  End of Fascicle Two of The Collection for the Propagation and Clarication The Discourse to Explain the Way by Sun Chuo There was a person who was doubtful of the highest Way  I explained to him thus Hence those of limited knowledge expect what emerges within what they each view Those who feel satised even while in a snare are suspicious about the capability of those who swim around in an ocean Those who can y only to a height of several ren doubt the ability of those who can soar high into the sky People bound by the worldly teaching and who indulge in looking at the traces of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius say that the highest virtue reached its culmination with Yao and Shun and that sublime words were completed in the Laozi and the Book of Changes The zhangfu is abandoned by people who customarily wear almost nothing and Emperor Shuns musical composition Dashao and Daxia are ignored in rural areas If these people are extremely deluded and cannot be improved they will not be moved by words and explanations I will try to clarify the tenor of Buddhism hoping that there may be someone who will come to be awakened in due course The Buddha is the one who has realized the Way The Way is what leads sentient beings It does nothing but there is nothing it does not  c accomplish Since it does nothing it is free from preoccupation peaceful and spontaneous Since there is nothing it does not accomplish it spiritually educates all beings In what all beings seek there is the variety of low and high Therefore of the methods to transmit the teaching some are precise and some are less exact The foundation of the teaching is given to those of superior faculty Misfortune is visited upon those who do not follow the teaching Those who indulge in wine are imposed with a penalty Those who steal are meted out appropriate punishment  There are the criminal laws established by the three dynasties and the ve penalties People who violate the law are not pardoned This is the rulers common institution of which prime ministers and governors take charge If a sage king rules over the world and ofcials are intelligent and broadminded the criminals mentioned previously will certainly be thoroughly inspected and there will be no hope of avoiding punishment If vicious people are not allowed to indulge their selfinterest there will be no violators in the state and wise and virtuous people will certainly be cited and evaluated for reward Moreover when the ruler is bright his vassals are honest the world is pure and the law prevails we can especially distinguish good and bad from each other and not be confused about right and wrong Needless to say in the place where deities are present regardless of distance and obscurity they are intelligent upright and honest in punishing the evil and helping the good Hence reward and retribution will visit even an extremely small merit and a very small demerit without the slightest aberration When we go over the testimonies of weal and woe of all ages they all have derivations and are recorded in evidence How could they be concealed The reason is because in a family that has plotted a crime its descendants will not ourish Daoists clearly proscribe that a family can inherit the position of general beyond three generations Isnt this because weapons are evil and warfare is a perversion that leads to killing many people Wei Ke followed initial will and attained the reward of the grass trap Zidu was faithful and received the conferment a very fast horse After Prince Xiang of Qi state pinned the blame on  the disaster of falling from a vehicle befell him Prince Hui of Jin state ignored courtesy Consequently he was at a disadvantage and had difculties Hanyuan This is all corroborative evidence that the dead retaliate against or reward the living With regard to that Xuan Meng had pity for a starving man at Yisang and an old lady who beat cotton in water sympathized with the weariness of Huaiyin these all show that with a meal one who had suffered from starving was saved Moreover Zhao received help from who betrayed his master  and the old lady received the reward of a thousand pieces of gold Therefore when you achieve virtue secretly blessing is revealed in all things It is compared to sowing grain seeds in the soil and then reaping a harvest one hundred times greater  The earth and the grain have no feeling toward human beings yet a natural advantage comes to them  A person criticized this saying If the issue of reward and retribution indeed entirely has signs why does the teaching of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius not proscribe killing Do you think that the sages had the intention of killing  The person answered No I continued You are really aware that they had no intention to kill However they killed because it was simply the intention of the masses As the times go and the world changes insincerity and simplicity arise in human beings In the time of Tang and Yu decorum occurred for the rst time Accordingly in the three dynasties the net of criminal law became more evident Even though executions were strictly carried out this still did not prevent as heinous as a ruler and his a vassals exterminating each other or fathers and sons killing each other Sages were aware that the peoples feelings were indifferent to killing and it was impossible to swiftly put an end to it Therefore they gradually restrained the people and had them seek the appropriate manner This is compared to the case where a viper bites a mans leg and he must have the leg cut off in order to save himself from death or a man who has a malignant tumor in the body must gouge it out in order to save his life To lose one in order to keep ten is to weigh the signicant over the less signicant Hence the reason criminals are executed in fall and winter is because they take life according to the seasons  In the politeness of providing a way of escape if a bird or beast comes toward  he sheathes his bow  If you have heard the cries or seen them alive when their meat is served to you you will not eat it If you go shing you will not use a net As for discussions of lawsuits you will reprieve the death sentence and in a time of natural disasters you will grant amnesty If you must pass a sentence of death you will do so with tears in your eyes feeling sympathy and never joyful This shows that ones gratitude for having been given birth and raised is deep This is what is called It does all and yet does not rely on them it excels and yet it does not preside over all This virtue covers and yet one does not think its merit lies in oneself How can we punish brutal men restrain wicked people and exercise control over the masses I answered This is not so The Duke of Zhou and Confucius are nothing other than the Buddha the Buddha is nothing other than the Duke of Zhou and Confucius Thus one who holds the reigns of the August is the August and one who is on the throne of a king is a king Buddha is a Sanskrit term the Chinese translation is Jue It is compared to Mencius who considered sages those who are rst awakened  The purport is the same  In responding to the demands of the world and serving as a model for people they probably comply with the time the Duke of Zhou and Confucius relieves the extremely corrupted world while the Buddhas teaching simply claries the fundamental law  Both are consistent they do not differ as to the goal Namely it is just as the sages of nonBuddhism differ in the depth of their deeds Therefore those who consider retrogressively see one as two always while those who understand properly have nothing to go to other than one A critic said In the teaching of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius lial piety is considered to be the root Filial piety is the culmination of virtue and the foundation of all actions When this foundation is established the way arises and  reaches to spiritual intelligence Consequently in cases where children serve their parents they attend to their parents with devotion while are alive and they offer worship to their parents after passed away Among three thousand offenses there is nothing heavier than having no offspring Our bodies are from our parents and we must not presume to injure or wound them Thus Yuezheng was injured in the leg and was overwhelmed with shame for the rest of his life b However the way of the śramaṇa is to leave his native place recklessly to abandon his parents to stay with strangers to shave his beard and hair to damage his natural appearance to have no sign of supporting while they are alive to discontinue the rite of ancestor worship after death and to consider his parents by blood to be the same as mere passersby In going against good conscience and hurting human feelings nothing is worse than this How is this different from mowing down the roots  trimming the branches and trunks and then saying that will be distinguished and grow tall and thick If skin did not exist how could hair attach to it This greatly contradicts the worldly teaching How are you going to reassure us about this matter I answered This is really a serious delusion of the extremely vulgar and a great error caused by your wrong view Parents and child are one body and they cast their lots together Therefore if a mother hurts her nger her child feels a utter in his heart even if he is away from her It is because their common vapor causes him to feel and respond to it Their unity leaves no space between them If a father is prosperous his son will rise to a high position If a son attains high rank his father will be respected Therefore lial piety is valuable It is valuable because we can rise in the world practice the way  and glorify our parents for a long time Even if we were to prostrate ourselves before our parents cherish them and offer them a feast of the three different kinds of meat every day we would still not be able to cause all people to respect us These are the ways to nourish our parents I have already elucidated the foundation of lial piety I will talk to you further about the next issue Shu of Yin opposed the ruler Lord Zhuang of Zheng state and organized a meeting for Lord Zhuang and Lord Zhuangs mother who had had a conict with her son yet was praised as faithful and lial in a history book Shi Que killed his son because he had kept company with Zhouxu who had ascended the throne by killing the heir of Wei state and displayed integrity as a loyal military man The Zuoshizhuan states that when a son can enter government service his father teaches loyalty to him once name is recorded on the orders of appointment and he is commissioned it is considered an offense to serve two masters In this case those who tie the chin straps for holding the cap at court have to give up the way of liality Because if he sees is in danger he will sacrice his life but will pay no attention to his parents All these peoples names are recorded in history books and their services are gloried as the highest of the teaching  How could the recorders of history consider their impiety to be a sin Therefore as the proverb says When you look for a loyal subject you must go to the clan that produces lial sons This indicates that even though there is a minor fault on one hand there is a great favorable aspect on the other hand Moreover Gun was exiled to a border region but Yu did not ask for permission to leave ofce If had abandoned Yaos decree in order to look for his father he would have placed the highest government affairs his personal sorrow Taibo of the Zhou dynasty left his relatives in the distance sought escape in a strange land cut his hair and tattooed his body complying with the customs there and never returned to his homeland in his lifetime or even after his death Nevertheless he is praised for having the highest virtue in Confuciuss Analects and recorded as a man of great morality in the history books This is actually because he was indifferent to the honorable throne and maintained the nobility of effacing himself the merit he made by trying to give the throne three times is lofty and the fault he committed by damaging his body c is minor Consequently he was able to make great changes to the barbarian customs and leave his teaching to history Gao Xing of Liang state damaged her looks and kept her chastity Princess Bo of Song state followed righteousness and neglected her life Both their names are ranked among those women who died to defend their chastity and their virtue is considered a model for all women If you keep in mind the morality of these two ladies you will simply escape the charge of being stupid and immoral When we speak in accordance with these points we can see that is in order of the importance of the by which we abide Formerly the Buddha was a crown prince but he abandoned his country and studied the way  He wanted to keep the original feature completely and enter the Way he was afraid that he would not be able to escape from being detained  So he cut his beard and hair and changed his court dress of a crown prince  He showed to not return outwardly and tried to govern himself in simplicity internally Thus he gave up the palace and stayed in a vast forest He took off the clothes of imperial emblem in order to put on a robe of deerskin Then he took as his dwelling a place where tree branches hung down and a mat of grass as his cushion He saved himself the trouble of combing his hair He avoided the nuisance of taking a bath He tightened the reins of running after empty fame power and wealth and closed the gate of carnal desires His eyes were restrained from black and yellow His ears were closed to lewd sounds His mouth forgot sweet and bitter His thought was released from joy and sorrow His mind left behind nuisances He stuck to the One and controlled his wandering spirit He let his mind play in the three groups of the four stages of meditation and he went in and out of the twelve gates of meditation While he meditated he folded his hands over the navel was silent remained still like a mountain and was as serene as deep water His spirit was just like cold ashes and his body was like a withered tree He sat upright for six years Then enlightenment was achieved and he was called the Buddha He is equipped with the three transcendental knowledges and the six supernatural powers His graceful body which is zhang and six tall has a golden glow Its light suppresses that of the sun and moon His voice is in harmony with the winds that blow from the eight directions His body has the thirtytwo and eighty minor marks of physical excellence His spirit is completely free Thus he saunters beyond the three realms of existence transforms freely in boundless realms and makes the sky revolve the earth dance the mountains y and streams meander He appears and disappears suddenly His supernatural transformation is unceasing Wherever his mind is directed nothing can hinder him By the great doctrine he reformed a great number of evil beings to correct their courses None among the numerous demons and those who had followed minor teachings did not adhere to the teaching of the Buddha At this point in time Heaven became pure and Earth was made prosperous The various things obtain their full development Living creatures even wriggling  were immersed and nurtured in mysterious liquid Withered and dry were refreshed and bloomed returned to his native country in glorious radiance where he extensively expounded the teaching His father the king was moved became awakened and ascended to the place of Buddhist practice too In this way brought honor to his father What lial piety can be compared to this Thereupon later generations receive and propagate the teaching They resolve to revere the lofty path They all follow their parents they hold nothing other than what esteem If they have brothers their parents support is not abolished Since they are able to cultivate the great work immensely their gratitude to their parents is not neglected Moreover enable the dead to attain happiness in order to be reborn in Heaven Isnt this the way to the Great Pervader that concurrently holds wholesomeness  that the neighbor of the east side butchers an ox  while the neighbor of the west side offers sacrices to a god In the Yin dynasty a variety of millet was considered to be good  but in the Zhou dynasty the highest virtue was more esteemed than offerings On this point the period of the rise and fall is apparent There are twelve kinds of scriptures in Buddhism Four among them exclusively hold that exhorting people to be lial is important The attentive intention can be said to be perfect Nevertheless ordinary people do not know the details of their origin They have not gotten involved in the place concerned with  but then make wild talk and reckless speech they wholeheartedly attack and criticize  With a view as small as the light of a rey or candle they doubt that is as abundant as the light of the sun moon and stars With knowledge as shallow as a drop of dew on the tip of a blade of grass they doubt the quantity of water in a deep ocean They consider false accusations to be eloquence and having determination to be an honor They can be said to be those who are disrespectful to great men and disgrace the ordinances of Heaven Response to He Chengtians Letter by Layman Zong Bing The Criticism on the Discourse on Buddhist Laymen and Clergy Hes Letter to Zong Recently I received a letter from you virtuous Gentleman for Palace Attendant which says that you are diligent in Buddhist rituals for rebirth in the Western Paradise The determination of a person of virtue and talent is great How could I regard ten thousand kalpas to be extravagant Since those who become monks ought not to clarify this issue why do we lay Buddhists keep silent I am very ignorant but I hope you will have good ideas to enlighten me Sincerely yours He Chengtian Zongs Response to Hes Letter Monk lins Discourse on Buddhist Laymen and Clergy which you sent to me is clear in writing and excellent in its points of argument I am however in the dark about the explicit principles and I have not yet understood thoroughly the intention of  The principles of the unseen world are not based on human affairs alone The Duke of Zhou and Confucius were doubtful of them but they did not provide an explanation If they are vast and simply empty why do all sages including Zhuangzi and Laozi say that there are spirits If there is the spiritual intelligence on what basis did judge is really not like what the Buddha says Now we are altogether within the connes of ordinary people Even when we infer familiar matters we still make many errors and mistakes through which we fall into disaster Sometimes we think that it is alive but it turns out to be dead or that it is dead but in fact it is alive In all of our familiar matters we have never seen those who always gain and  never lose On what basis does determine outside of Heaven and Earth beyond hundreds of million of kalpas and of the imperceptible  and say with certainty that what debate is not true If we infer according to facts and are not allowed to obtain the reality then we may have doubt The physical body of a human being is very coarse while the spirit is quite subtle If the physical body follows the spirit how could both equally die responds to the affections of the mind is  the city wall collapsed when the wife of Qi Liang cried frost fell  a white rainbow pierced the sun when Jing Ke attempted to assassinate the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty and Venus went into the Pleiades when Bai Qi sent provisions to King Zhao when a doctor practicing the medical science of admonishing the vapor makes water or re in the mind always responds to it by becoming cold or warm Needless to say if we are exclusively sincere and ingeniously cultivate with the most brilliant wisdom and the highest energetic will is moved and responds and we will receive a body moreover we will be reborn in the land of the seven treasures How could this be not true Furthermore states Even if we try to reduce the existence of a tree by analyzing it into smaller pieces nothing harms the luxuriant hangs down its leaves to make shade Even if we try to separate materials from a room and empty it nothing damages the majestic beauty of the room Precious brocade produces splendor by various colors What is called fundamental nonexistence stated in the Buddhist scriptures does not mean that everything various conditions come together in unity is empty Therefore this is called the truth of existence  in Buddhism Since nature is fundamentally nonexistence it is called the truth of nonexistence  Although I do not know the Buddhist doctrines completely I think that this advocacy is explicit and very stable Everchanging existence from ancient times suddenly ends up in emptiness Just at the time of its peak of eforescence wouldnt it be in permanent existence This can be also compared to Huizis expression All creatures may be born and may die at the same time The sun in the meridian may decline at the same time The fact of death and decline is constantly clear prior to the time before its birth and the meridian Ignorant people do not see the reason they merely see its existence Hence the Marquis of Qi state who usurped the place of the Shuangjiu family wept falsely and longed for their happiness Wise people have the mind that is one with truth Thus Yanzi often was nearly empty he appeared to have no although he had it and seemed lacking although he had real  Additionally if we look at those in the level further below even if they are not capable of purifying themselves with the most virtuous words in order to exhaust the delusion of attachment and competition how could there be nothing similar to a little bit of this appreciation of emptiness To clarify impermanence increases the feeling to crave for the shelter  Furthermore states Consequently they were not adopted for the foundation of the teaching I think that we can analyze the reason for this as easily as pointing to the palm of our hand The boat that was hidden in a ravine and was secretly carried away means that the present time does not stay as it is stated in the Buddhist  scriptures If this can actually be claried things and self are permanently unreal How could it not be the main theme of the truth Probably there were not many who understood it Therefore it was simply not considered to be the fundamental teaching The eminent Zhi was not yet the same as the Buddha as it is said Why does slight these most virtuous words just because they have frequently been spoken in the Middle Kingdom If mysterious light is examined there is no light as small as one cun in diameter If mysterious transformation is analyzed there is not even a very small amount of reality If you repeat the word the immeasurable life in vain who has seen a hundredyearold man All these kinds of things are entirely said to be inconsistent with actual facts Supernatural light mysterious transformation and immeasurable life all derive from sincere faith which is profound and wonderful Hence people are simply going to be reborn in the buddha land and to be closely illuminated by light and their life will be immeasurable Those who sink in evil views and who are absurdly disrespectful to mysterious transformation are indeed widely separated in the principles from those who have sincere faith How could they see auspicious omens in the actual phenomena  The mind without greed is the foundation of the ten wholesome acts Thus we can cut off Hell facing down and be reborn in Heaven looking up This is also what means by saying If you obey righteousness and follow the Way the principles correct your mind Since we hold sincere reverence in mind we worship and repent our sins Since we are aware of impermanence we have no stinginess in the mind abandon wives and children and make donations Moreover how could it be said without going through the intention to be respectful to not take advantage of the feeling to not be stingy Nirvana is considered as having no happiness to be happy The dharmakāya is considered as having no body to be the body If you neither long for nor determine them it can be to increase the thought to indulge in idleness and give rise to the mind of curiosity If you sincerely praise and revere  indulgence in idleness will gradually be removed and you will obtain the benet in no benet Would this be concerned with the custom of competing for a benet  Again says In the great purpose of Buddhists the eight kinds of sufferings derive entirely from craving They clearly express the twelve causations and simply have lofty people clarify the spirit in nonarising Those who hope for this path can be said to have desire for nondesire With regard to instructing and leading ordinary people Heaven and Hell have the reality of reward and retribution just as shadow and sound  Similarly because of Yu Gongs benevolent work were invited to ofcialdom and given a ef Yan was fond of killing people and consequently he was executed Those who are afraid of being executed and who want to be given a ef will certainly reject killing and cultivate benevolence Even though those who practice with wonderful determination in order to hope for Heaven and who attentively the ve precepts in order to keep away from Hell have desire for necessary desire they practice the pure path to reduce themselves day by day until they attain wuwei This is also like heading west in order to seek Ying ie the capital of Chu state  Why would you worry that they will not arrive there Furthermore shows dislike The red and blue colors dazzle the eyes that appreciate colors build up private power and organize sectarian inuence They demand the fame of pursuing cultivation with determination and dedication and indulge in the desire of excelling and competing This is assuredly the ugliness of a black locust or it can be merely said that even if the law was set at a low  by the misapplication of the law a higher tax is demanded How could the  a Buddha then be treated rudely and said to have created the law for greed Wang Mang stole the Six Classics in order to seize the emperors throne The First Emperor of the Qin dynasty built Afang Palace under the pretext of having an audience Would we put the blame for these actions instead on the ethical education given by their predecessor kings Again states We should reject the tracks of the exoteric and esoteric  but keep their important purposes Certainly he wishes for people to pursue their advantages and reform their minds in order to reach their natures The sage has no invariable mind of his own he simply accommodates himself to others minds which he takes to be his own mind If it is the true nature of living creatures that the body dies and the spirit perishes in conformity with the nature of mortality would have surely just transmitted the teaching in cooperation with the Duke of Zhou and Confucius Why is it necessary to deceive by speaking of the immortality and imposing the Buddhist doctrine upon them shaving their hair and burning their skin and to cut off the marriage relationship The number of descendants extinguished by them is incalculable If they harm themselves like this and injure the virtue of fullling their natures why wouldnt ākyamuni prevent them from doing such things Fellows who lack faith are not willing to cultivate their advantages and reform their minds Those who have faith are indeed the peers of Jīvaka Jiantuole Gītamitra Zhu Fasheng Bo Fazu Dharmarakṣa Yu Falan Zhu Faxing Yu Daosui Que Gongze Fotudeng rīmitra Guo Wenju Shi Daoan Zhi Daolin and Master yuan Why should they have recklessly damaged human principles and taken the tonsure for the edication of the insincere man  These are all simply because the reality of spiritual wonder attracts minds from a distance and achieves the enterprise of supernatural power and pure truth You sent this discourse from afar on the pretext of your lack of faith  Moreover people of the world who doubt all think to be wonderful too Therefore I have tried to answer by myself in order to offer some help for people to understand Buddhism The issue that people of the world judge whether or not Buddhism is good is entirely a great the destinies of human beings Therefore I have exhausted my ignorant thoughts and composed the Discourse to Clarify Buddhism in order to present what I have in my mind Sincerely Zong Bing The Elucidation of the Criticism on the Discourse on the Equality of Good ie the Discourse on Buddhist Laymen and Clergy by He Chengtian I formerly sent you the Discourse on the Equality of Good together with an inquiry about your opinion I received your thoughtful response Although I cannot submit to all  I do not hold fast very much to biased views either I am however seeking a jade that glows in the night in a vast sea and I have simply not yet obtained it I think that the Buddhist scriptures are from a school that is a good branch of the nine schools including Daoism and Mohism In benevolence and giving alms is no different from the Middle Kingdom Great people and gentlemen consider benevolence to be their duty They have nothing to bear in mind They just harmonize ordinary peoples ears and eyes by images and adornments If it is still a slight that b wastes and harms  the benet it propagates will probably be apparent Thus exists together with  People of fantastic taste having appeared is then considered to be better than Confucianism to surpass Laozi and to alone be noble This that people have not been able to seek the foundation of the worthy words left and yet they are misled by a nonessential theory To know the words you must wait for one who understands beyond words If you have faith only because of the reward and retribution of Heaven and Hell and the testimony that causes and conditions are not destroyed control your feelings take coarse food are completely diligent in worship and hope that you will probably be sheltered under the jeweled canopy or that you will ascend to the seat of Merupradīparāja  this is just nothing but Chunyu Shengs big joke Your discussion says  all the sages including Zhuangzi and Laozi say that there are spirits If there is the spiritual intelligence on what basis did judge that the principles of the unseen world are vast and simply empty is really not like what the Buddha says I would like to respond to this There are rites and music in the world in which we live while there are spiritual beings in the netherworld What sage kings consider to be the teaching is not obscure about its existence from the beginning If there are reward and retribution in the next life could it be the case that the Duke of Zhou and Confucius just keep silent and do not have even a few words about it If an infant is approaching a hole in the ground ordinary people are frightened by this Wouldnt sages still be merciful If the physical body follows the spirit how could both equally die I answer The body and the spirit mutually support each other People of ancient times compared them to a torch When rewood burns down the ame becomes weak When the rewood completely burns the ame dies out Even though is subtle how could it alone be transmitted Again you said  responds to the affections of the mind is the city wall collapsed  frost fell when Zou Yan cried out toward Heaven a white rainbow pierced the sun  and Venus went into the Pleiades  when a doctor of admonishing the vapor makes water or re in the mind the patients body always responds to this by becoming cold or warm If we are exclusively sincere and ingeniously cultivate is moved and responds and we will receive the body moreover we will be reborn in the land of the seven treasures How could this be not true I will respond to this the city wall collapsing frost falling piercing the sun and going into the Pleiades are not examples that elucidate the next life They should not be referred to in the present discussion Furthermore to see admonishing with water or re and to wish to be able to be reborn in the country of the seven treasures can be compared to the case of having observed a blacksmith decorate with gold then wishes to be able to mold and cast itself  You will know at last that this is impossible Everchanging existence from ancient times suddenly ends up in emptiness Just at the time of its peak of eforescence wouldnt it be in permanent existence If as you say in the discussion just at the time of its peak of eforescence it already inevitably has the reality of emptiness in that case things are permanently empty and emptiness and things are the same If emptiness and existing objects are no different from each other why are the wise and the ignorant so called in different ways The Way so called in former times has no form in shape and no affairs in function It nourishes wisdom and inspires peace and harmony in ones mind Would it alone be afraid of conditions from former lives before removing clinging and attachment You say  merely see its existence but are they superior to in this point To laugh and sneer at the Marquis of Qi state who was satirized by Chunyu Sheng is just like the case where those who retreated fty steps laugh at those who retreated a hundred steps Furthermore you say The boat that was hidden in a ravine is secretly carried away means that the present time does not stay as is stated in the Buddhist scriptures If this can actually be claried we will know that both things and self are permanently unreal I will respond to this Regarding the issue that leaving secretly means not staying  wouldnt it mean to enter death from life or to enter nonexistence from existence There is a passage   will be frightened in his body  but there will be nothing to harm his mind He takes as a temporary dwelling so he has no resentment of death Jia Sheng also said We simply transform to the dead While they are alive they are anxious about the afterlife They attach their minds to immeasurable life and have ambition to be reborn in Heaven Moreover you say Supernatural light mysterious transformation and immeasurable life all derive from sincere faith which is profound and wonderful I do not follow  either because those who are disrespectful to the wonderful edication are seeking the light of  but you simply seek it in sincere faith When we ponder the teaching of ākyamuni it delivers people by means of expedients If there is the corresponding manifestation like this why does he not show its mysterious transformation in order to cause people of evil views to understand Why doesnt he value several tens of millions of talks and yet is sparing of momentary supernatural light He speaks eloquently with the voice of the phenomenal world in vain and he has come to an end without clarifying the true wisdom Sentient beings are exhausted throughout life and do not know in what to take refuge Isnt this sad Again you say Since we hold sincere reverence in mind we worship and repent our sins Since we are aware of impermanence we have no stinginess  abandon wives and children and make donations How could there be the case stated in the Discourse on Buddhist Laymen and Clergy to ask for one hundred times  I will answer this To be complicated and skillful in order to begin a matter is not as good as to remove greed and cease competitiveness To observe the precepts in order to cleanse penitence is not as good as annihilating a glorious hope in order to accomplish simplicity to say nothing of inviting what one prefers and praying for a benet or forgeting ones blood relations and desiring fame If you say there is no of asking for  I do not believe it Furthermore you say Nirvana is considered as having no happiness to be happy The dharmakāya is considered as having no body to be the body If you sincerely praise and revere  indulgence in idleness will gradually be removed and you will obtain the benet in no benet I am responding to this Nirvana is considered as leaving behind suffering to be happy The dharmakāya is considered as taking the suffering to be the body That is just the reason people who praise and revere are unable to cut off  If it results in no benefit what do those who diligently cultivate it attain and why do you say they attain it in no benefit This is the testimony that both the body and the spirit are exhausted I am afraid that this is not what you should articulate in your discussion Moreover you say Those who hope for this path can be said to have desire for nondesire Similarly because of Yu Gongs benevolent work were invited to ofcialdom and given a ef Yan was fond of killing people and consequently he was executed Even though those who practice with wonderful determination  in order to hope for Heaven and who attentively the ve precepts in order to keep away from Hell have desire for necessary desire they practice the pure path to reduce themselves day by day until they attain wuwei This is also like heading west in order to seek Ying which is in the south Why would you worry that they will not arrive there I would like to answer this What was caused by shadow and sound however must be matched to the original form and voice How can a form of usual produce a shadow of eighty thousand yojanas To be stagnant just like to have desire for nondesire is still usually to stagnate in the object of desire The ears and eyes preside over different  Engineering and art craft are different kinds of work Thus even if the metal and stone are able to harmonize Mount Tai would not be able to reveal its height Even if wild geese and swans get together the deep autumn is not able to transmit its intention Even though you say to head west  you have traveled this far from Ying What can you do about it Furthermore you say If it is the true nature of living creatures that the body dies and the spirit perishes in conformity with the nature of mortality the sage would have surely just transmitted the teaching in cooperation with the Duke of Zhou and Confucius Why is it necessary to deceive by the immortality and imposing the Buddhist doctrine upon them shaving their hair and burning their skin and to cut off the marriage relationship  I am responding to this What are  Chinese people receive the vapor that is pure and peaceful and they have benevolence and righteousness in their minds Therefore the Duke of Zhou and Confucius elucidate the nature and the teaching in which they learn  People of foreign countries receive a nature that is tough and strong and they are greedy angry and perverse Therefore ākyamuni was strict with the rules of the ve precepts In the discussion you sent to me this is called the sage has no invariable mind of his own he simply accommodates himself to other peoples natures In the admonition to chastise cruelty there is nothing more painful than Hell In the exhortation to lead to good there is nothing better than Heaven The Duke of Zhou and Confucius do not do so They follow its natural temperament and leave behind its very  Misconduct in sexual behavior and stealing are set forth in the ve penalties The crime related to wine is claried in the section called the Announcement about Drunkenness  in the history of the Zhou dynasty   in the spring hunting will not surround a marshy thicket  When we see living creatures we cannot bear their death the laws for the ve offenses in hunting and chasing game from only three directions  We sh without a net Hence benevolence is extensively diffused and benets reach even to pigs and sh For a gathering on a happy occasion there is always on a cutting board Even old people are able to have meat  We till land in spring and gather the harvest in fall Sericulture and weaving are done in a timely manner The three numinous beings have come and a hundred deities are all worshiped Furthermore we make clear the praise of offering a libation in worship while we are strict in the punishment about dubious laws To give an account of the questions asked by the chief magistrate of Pu is the foundation to exhort the teaching To expound answer the fume rising as the vapor claries the testimony of our next life In addition you state in your discussion people like Jīvaka tuo and rīmitra  On what basis do you now conclude the superiority or inferiority of people who lived a hundred years ago or who live several thousand li away One such as Bhikṣu lin is a monk in appearance but has disinterestedness like Heaven He seems to discern truth or falsehood profoundly Particularly he is not willing to fear the scriptures to protect his master and to garnish illusory remarks For this reason I respect him It is said in Sun Xinggongs Discourse that Dharmarakṣa is erudite and intelligent and Yu Falan is sincere and knowledgeable With whom of the Middle Kingdom do you want to compare these two people Moreover Ying the king of Chu built a Buddhist temple Ze Rong offered relief to starving travelers How could they have pure character and behavior Formerly when I was in the eastern capital city  ramaṇa Daohan visited me from Wuzhong and exhorted me He was very earnest and sincere Because of this he stayed for three nights He talked for my sake about the conditions of rening the body and purifying the spirit and the testimony of the arising and extinguishing of sin and merit I folded my hands before my breast and listened to his outspoken remarks without sleeping from night till morning The reason a person rises in the world becomes famous has faith and practices the Way really relies on the teaching of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius Zilu says When I hear wellintentioned advice if I cannot carry it out in practice I am concerned only that there is I have yet to hear I have to do many things Why should I suddenly abandon this and attend to that  In addition I sought the written form  which is well matched to human feelings had been established and I came to know that the next life is above my means Having investigated thoroughly the endless grief throughout our lifetime I have realized that it is difcult to receive this body again Sages are my teachers How could the Duke of Zhou and Confucius deceive me Hoping that the aged and respected person of great intelligence instructs others without being wearied I have simply not yet kept silent here You said formerly you had already sent the Discourse to Clarify Buddhism Sincerely He Chengtian Response to He of Hengyang the Criticism on the Elucidation of the Discourse on Buddhist Laymen and Clergy by Zong Bing I have respectfully read the discussion you sent to me You repress the edication of Buddhism and set forth your aspiration in the teaching of Confucianism signicant matters are collected and expressed and your talent in literature and argument examines and claries  Having observed your intention I see that you do not mean that the one who established Buddhism is not a sage but the teaching is an expedient  without truth I have not completely appreciated on what basis you base your belief that has no truth Now when we determine and see a longrange plan of things together the gains and losses are about on par Couldnt it be that we have had holy people who talk to each other pointing at their palms Sages make an exhaustive discrimination of what is right and effect the complete development of every nature till they arrive at what is appointed for it  If there are those who do not attain points as if they have cast those people into a moat Now delude people the immortality of the spirit and deceive them the attainment of buddhahood They indulge in shaving the head wearing red robes and burning their bodies and ngers  In addition they do not employ their natural gifts in order to support their parents and the way of husband and wife or father and son From the time Buddhism was introduced to the thirtysix states west of the Sha River near Turfan prior to the time of its introduction to China those who cut off relations number in the hundred millions or hundred billions If we think of those who were born in barbarian tribes and who came to  such as You Yu and Jin Ridi there were more people who were about to be born and yet who could not  If Buddhism has no truth wouldnt the cruelty of casting people into a moat be unspeakable Do you say you want it in order to exceed the proper limits in righting a wrong or in order to govern foreign people whose natures are tough and strong and who are angry and perverse The sort of people who are angry and perverse will still not believe and will not be frightened if you bind them with the threearticle law  or punish soon after rewarding Would it be possible to rule over them by means of the tenets  nothing other than form fundamental nonexistence nirvana the dharmakāya the twelve causations  and kalpas as numerous as the minutest particles of dust Those who receive this instruction are what you call people who receive the vapor that is pure and peaceful and who have benevolence and righteousness in their minds Since we avail ourselves of pure and peaceful in order to explicate the sublime words and encourage the righteous nature in order to learn the subtle practice we are consequently able to purify our illumination and contemplate the Dharma When the Dharma and illumination are all empty we reach the Way  These are entirely stated in the Buddhist scriptures and are what you believe As to people in modern times who are superhuman and have excellent virtue such as the eight wise men for whom Sun Xinggong made eulogies and the ve thinkers praised by Zhi Daolin they are all considered to be lofty by their contemporaries Therefore the two could make a composition about them How can this be called wild talk I have no idea with whom I should compare these bhikṣus Falans disciple Daosui however has not yet caught up to his master I do not know of Bhikṣu Huilin at all If you say that is as good as Wenbing he may not naturally fall behind Daosui but he must still be below Dharmarakṣa and lan The comment I made previously is not an impropriety of speech If has the appearance of a Buddhist monk who is sincere and capable disinterestedness like Heaven and profound knowledge truth and falsehood why is it not certain that akradevendra will transform and willfully urge him to attain buddhahood In the discussion I received you express a doubt If there really are reward and retribution in the next life why did the Duke of Zhou and Confucius keep silent without even a few words about it This is indeed a common question based on prejudice This is truly something we should clarify together The sacred spirit originates profoundly As it is moved then it responds It is not something that leads people prior to a necessity The reason the masses moved the sages to action is disorder Consequently the responses found in the Six Classics are only about governing  Therefore there is no word of the Buddha Liu Xiang says that the nine provinces mentioned in the Yugong ie the earliest known book of the geography of China probably follow what is recorded in the Book of Mountains and Seas which states Even though this is a barbarian region  countless domains spread out like stars in the sky Somewhat to our surprise we do not know which domain glory The exquisite people of this region used to cherish the Way at all times and Buddhist services existed too Even though they might have received the Dharmanature near the Yi and Luo Rivers or they might have experienced the ultimate reality near the Zhu and Si Rivers Shi Yi carelessly did not record because they had nothing to do with the way of governance and Bu Shang did not compile them because they go against the Confucian way Even if there were some in the nonBuddhist canon hidden in the double wall  they would have also been burned by the king of Qin ie the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty It is not yet necessarily known whether or not the Duke of Zhou and Confucius kept silent about reward and retribution in the next life There is no case where the way of the profound absolute vacancy and issues of the mysterious immortals have not been mentioned in worldly books The words of Confucius regarding the Way are found in chapters of Zhuangzis book of the remote age In that case through the Five Classics that are concerned with state administration we cannot yet ll in the wonderful edication beyond this world  You also say in your criticism Things are permanently empty and emptiness and things are the same If emptiness and existing objects are no different from each other why are the wise and the ignorant so called in different ways What Buddhist scriptures state is that form is empty there is nothing other than emptiness It is not said that there is no existence There is existence but it is simply empty the wise and the ignorant It is empty so all differences are altogether empty Form is naturally not form Even though form is empty conditions join together and become an existence All are just like those things that are produced by illusion or revealed in a dream They exist but they do not The future has not yet come the past has already gone and the present does not stay There is no xed existence either Generally these several principles are the laws all profound sages attained ultimately It is really difcult to make them clear by indicating them with language When I observe things from this point of view I truly realize it is evident Therefore I feel free from worries and petty thoughts and so I increase purity by washing away  Furthermore you say The body and the spirit mutually support each other People of ancient times compared them to a torch When rewood burns down the ame becomes weak When the rewood is completely burned the ame dies out Even though is subtle how could it alone be transmitted Well re is produced from rewood the spirit is not made from the body When the spirit reaches its acme it transcends the body and becomes independent of it There is no body but the spirit exists This is called the eternality of the dharmakāya Hence we begin as an ordinary person and will become a tathāgata at last Even though our life is coarse until now if we have a view that turns upward for countless kalpas without exhaustion we will certainly learn in order to ascend to the pure world It is said in the Book of Odes that A mulberry insect has a child which a wasp carries on its back  If we compare to those in the spiritual world where we will be sheltered under the jeweled canopy offered by Ratnaśikhi or we will ascend to the seat of Merupradīparāja  why would we have no hope In addition you have doubt and say  ākyamuni delivers people by means of expedients Why doesnt he value the several tens of millions of talks and yet is sparing of momentary supernatural light and  does he not show its mysterious transformation in order to cause people of evil views to understand  Although it is called expedient as a term of peoples receptivity and the Buddhas response either dim or apparent complies with evil acts and meritorious deeds variously In former times the Buddha expounded and emitted light for sentient beings they all usually accumulated wonderful sincerity Therefore even negligent people could hear them The light is emitted and it illuminates us through contemplation People of wrong views do not have the conditions to look at even if it envelops them Now if we see Buddhist scriptures and yet do not repent of our negligence even if we are enveloped by the light in advance how benecial would it be People such as wise men of sincere faith are able to clearly perceive supernatural illumination by themselves The regular stars are not visible yet it is a bright night When I examine what year and month  I see it corresponds to the night when the Buddha was born and emitted a light Guan Youan set sail on the sea on a windy night All his companions sank  but Youan saw a light in the darkness Heading toward the light he reached an island and only he and his entire family were saved The Buddha has no discrimination He responds only to good There are too many cases to mention in which the Buddhas responses were given to people like Wang Xiang or Guo Ju These are also auspicious omens of seeing the light Couldnt there be the Buddha even if you have not seen  In addition you explain the prosperity of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius which you compare to and consider to be greater than the teaching of the Buddha The regime of this country is however merely the prosperity of sovereigns In the disaster of the three superintendents the uncle and nephew distrusted each other and the brothers killed each other Even though among the seventytwo of disciples some ascended to the hall and some passed into the inner apartments  those who lived until the age of fty were few Yan died young Ran was aficted with disease You was cut apart  Yu was executed together with his relatives and Si lost his beard Was not the suffering of Confucius in the Kuang and Chen regions unspeakable He spread the teaching abroad while suffering hunger and wandered from state to state When we observe this alongside the Buddhist teaching we see only his lament there Isnt this the result of the congregation of causation from the previous existences of people of the world Moreover the truth spread by has not yet been deep and great at this point If we outwardly act in accordance with rites and music and cultivate inwardly with nonarising  purify the spirit in the state of nirvana and consider thousands of millions of kalpas to be bygone years  wouldnt it be really great Events are not transmitted to later generations and we have not been able to know the principles  I hope you will not say that based on crude evidence the Duke of Zhou and Confucius were not so All people say that the Buddha makes wild talk but the Book of Mountains and Seas says that those who died and who were reborn are very numerous In the immortal realm such as Mount Kunlun the eld of Guangdu  and the mound of Xuanyuan the weather is neither cold nor hot phoenixs eggs are eaten sweet dew is drunk the inhabitants are sheltered by jade trees they sip the water of the Zhu fountain and they do not die even though they reach a thousand years of age I can see that one who hears the Buddhist Dharma and straightens himself is indeed a daring soldier of Pucheng in presentday Shanxi  province Is it because what you have heard is not yet lofty If what you heard is lofty it is still possible to change your mind just as a leopard changes  Human beings are creatures of exquisite spirit If we however take refuge in the culmination of numinous beings ie the Buddhist Way and roughly receive the teaching and precepts it is enough to move even an insignicant amount of  If we move it we will rise higher In former days the fact that the spirit is immortal was just as the Buddha says but the spirit casts away the mind is wounded and we go against the government of the unseen world by ourselves How could we know that suffering and difculties in this existence would not be due to previous existences If we imprudently despise the teaching of the respectful spirit with our own view I am afraid that we may pass on this difculty to our next existence Once when ākyamuni was a bhikṣu of the Hinayana he slandered the Mahayana Because of this even he fully underwent hardships passing through hells for a very long time Even ākyamuni fell into Hell to say nothing of those who have no faith at all Moreover on what basis can we determine that this Buddhist scripture must be false The words used in your previous letter rebuking me are merely in accordance with Bhikṣu lins chapters and sentences My intention has already been roughly told I could not reply to each  but everything has already been thoroughly covered in my composition the Discourse to Clarify Buddhism Now I will attach it and send it to you I ask you to please do your best make a thorough investigation properly and tell me completely whether I am right or not I am old and about to die I would like only to continue this until my last day The tactical deployment you took up is just like what Xiang Ji ie Yu did  The testimonies and examples are solid and clear The language and expressions are erudite and rich You really wish to spread your benet and kindness and your instruction is extended to even ordinary people I deeply acknowledge that this is due to a gentlemans consideration Therefore I had better keep silent and help fulll your cherished hopes I however always think that foreign matters may not be what the Chinese are engaged in Thus I simply made the previous statement If China and foreign countries should now surely be the same I am simpleminded I venture to apologize for my slowness In spite of it I still have a thought Those who are versed in the nature of Heaven and Earth are not misled by unrealistic peculiar matters Those who discern the way to prosperity or decline do not employ their minds for unreasonable illogical matters Otherwise if your discussion is not on the basis of an expedient and the general instruction is entirely expressed from your feeling wouldnt this be the ignorance of a wellread experienced person I have not yet had a chance to meet and talk with you Yours truly He Cheng End of Fascicle Three of The Collection for the Propagation and Clarication The Discourse on the Full Understanding of Life by He Chengtian The two polarities were already positioned and a sovereign joined them In the universe there is nothing nobler than these three Heaven has two divisions People are born only when there is Heaven and Earth while Heaven and Earth become supernatural only when there are people The three powers are a single and interdependent unit Consequently the one who can receive the vapor that is pure and peaceful whose spiritual intelligence is particularly prominent whose feeling is in overall charge of all ages whose wisdom encompasses all things whose ingenious thought traces to the very source of the deep and dark world whose production is equal to that of Nature and who results in benevolence and capability is a sovereign When he nurtures the common people and helps Heaven in propagating virtue the sun and moon are clear and bright the four kinds of supernatural animals appear the auspicious wind has the same tune the four seasons are harmonious various types of foods including the nine kinds of grains animals that feed on grass or grain  products of the soil aquatic products and foods of various avors such as sour or salty are served at the table and a house a boat a vehicle things decorated with gold pottery and dark yellow fabrics made of silk or linen are supplied for equipment implements or clothes The culture follows rules of decorum and entertainment follows the eight kinds of musical sounds produced from the calabash and musical instruments made of earthenware stretched hides wood stone metal silk strings and bamboo All things are protected and living creatures reproduce a If people are careful in spending it is easy to be sufcient If it is easy to be sufcient there will be a surplus of power If there is a surplus of power the peoples will and feeling will become extravagant Then the mind delighted with governance will arise If things are concise nothing will be disturbed If nothing is disturbed the spiritual intelligence will be sharp If the spiritual intelligence is sharp one will make plans carefully Then the business to save and govern is accomplished Therefore Heaven and Earth instruct the people with thrift and simplicity The two diagrams qian and kun teach the people with ease and concision This is why instructions are attentive and generous like this How can be sentient beings on the same level with birds sh snakes and insects Sentient beings have appropriate seasons in which to be caught and of employment To start a re  we wait for a gale to blow For hunting and shing we inquire into the activities of the wolf and otter This is because we follow the seasons of nature A real man neither hunts a fawn nor takes eggs The song Rushes was composed We bestow good inuence even upon the sh This is because we love what we human beings use We are cautious not to commit the ve offenses in hunting Emperor of the Yin dynasty took a new prayer When Confucius shed he did not use a net All living things must die The physical body is destroyed and the spirit scatters just as become luxuriant in spring and decay in autumn and the four seasons change one after another How could there be further to receive another body The Book of Odes states that Happy and easygoing gentlemen seek a blessing by no crooked ways This means that the propagation of the Way lies in oneself The three sovereigns reside in Heaven This denotes that the exquisite spirits ascended far to  Nevertheless one harbors sensual desires in the mind while outwardly fearful of the expedient teaching  or one deeply considers his present life while giving donations in hopes of a reward in the next life Our predecessor Confucian masters in former times said nothing about these issues I am originally decient in intelligence and vigor and I do not know how to make it my business to practice  The Expatiation of the Discourse on the Full Understanding of Life of He of Hengyang by Yan Yanzhi I formerly obtained your discourse in which with deep views and extensive thought you take the human way to be lofty and degrade other living creatures The content is clear and subtle and the subject does not lose signicance This is really helpful for the teaching and good enough to wipe out the heretical school How could they forget what they rely upon I am merely concerned that if Chinese zithers is monotonous it will lose the clear harmony Thereupon I will briey and broadly write several articles and take all your responses receive later You say that he who is in one unit together with the two polarities and who becomes the three powers with them must be a name of the virtuous one but this is not a category of people in general Generally however various species are equally called sentient beings this is the name for those who bear consciousness How could it be the title for sages and wise people In that case to comment on the three powers has nothing to do with the masses How does calling them sentient beings abuse sages and wise people Even though I have the feeling to depend upon the importance of order I am not worried that causes disorder If both registers can be taught and all can be lifted up understand the principles thoroughly make a restriction to leave language behind adopt this and share reality then it is possible  just as when the notes of beil  Moreover the great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called life there is a common feature of all things which is the same as what differentiates all things How could it be distinguished to attain life The life that is not different for each living b creature should be sentient beings In the ranks of sentient beings however there are a great many differences between the ignorant and the wise People employ other living creatures in order to nourish themselves and other living creatures are put to work in order to support people Even though at the beginning may follow  they come to kill at last Sensual desires are not repressed Life is harmed in increasing and miserable ways The law of Heaven will be pent up and destroyed Emperors and sages lament this situation but they cannot suddenly take away remain entrenched  Therefore they set up the teaching to plan seasonal hunting and the scriptures to prudently follow the seasons It is simply to nourish those who bear consciousness by opening up benevolence and to gradually return to the cessation of extremities Furthermore you understand that in the great law of Nature the life and death are equal in rising and falling In the truth of spirits however the issue of remaining in existence or not might differ from the issue of the withering of grass or the fading away of  If is the same as trees and plants then it will disappear like smoke Moreover you say that the three sovereigns ascended far and their exquisite spirits reside in Heaven If the exquisite spirits indeed exist and they are surely different from trees and plants then there is nothing to support your opinion regarding the doctrine of receiving a body Is it that because the three sovereigns were purely good they were rewarded and reborn in Heaven You intended to denounce the doctrine of future life but on the contrary you established ascending far  If there is merely the exquisite spirit which does not have any form and appearance I have no idea what it relies upon to establish itself in Heaven Therefore I strive for and depend on your opinion So back and forth but I have not yet attained contentment Generally within fate there is nothing that does not move without response Even if it is said that they inevitably tally with each other why do you suspect we have hope  Consequently those who forget kindness have no demand and those who keep merit have hope  Cherishing merit while hoping is not yet wholesomeness There are wise people and those who are not so wise among human beings and then there are public and private in our thoughts In this physical world it cannot be said that since some people expect rewards those who establish their virtues all wish for  Would they never fail to have sensual desires when they take actions You have never been able to promote  and you always put it down Even though you deeply reproach correct and upbraid  please cease your arrogant speech and do not attack them You usually rmly entrench yourself in a castle and it is difcult to send a letter  Furthermore I have been cooped up with worries and distresses in my house and I had no chance to entrust my feelings and reasoning to you I wanted to express my intention and judge your former explanation I worry that it may not be worthy Sincerely yours Yan Yanzhi Response to Yan of Yongjia I respectfully read your esteemed letter and examined repeatedly your deep intention You draw a line between each of the three powers You declare your aspiration for the Way and praise and admire Buddhists You act in sincerity and reach out to things When you practice it in yourself it is excellent You have not yet understood completely Therefore I will relate my original intention once again You said  he who is in one unit together with the two polarities and who becomes the three powers with them must be a name of the virtuous one Why are sages and wise people also so I am afraid that you misunderstand my words The way of human beings was established incorporating various benevolences and righteousness Natural compassion is a manifestation of the virtuous To feel ashamed for evils is the beginning of a chivalrous mind the trees of Mount Niu were cut with scythes and axes and lost their beautiful nature A peaceful and quiet state of mind is put into disorder by the thought of interests Then can there be no mistake if it is said that a wholesome heart exists but it is not counted In addition you say To comment on the three powers has nothing to do with the masses Why does calling them sentient beings abuse sages and wise people I have already heard your instruction but I have still not understood on what basis the two roads are judged  If we people hope for tirelessly in order to dispel what we have not yet understood we certainly raise both registers  there is a common feature of all things which is the same as what differentiates all things How could it be distinguished to attain life I do not say that this is not so Even though people are born and equally placed under the great virtue  they cannot be called sentient beings It compares to the case that although sages equally receive the ve primary elements they cannot be called the people What merit is there in considering that the life that is not different from each other must be sentient beings In the letter received you say People employ other living creatures in order to nourish themselves and other living creatures are put to work in order to support people If you broadly judge like this then you have the same thought as my humble view As to passion and sensual desires if we do not restrain them we will destroy life and be brutal to other living creatures We will be the socalled one of excessive or the arrogant one Sages assuredly remove this Furthermore you say Those who take the Way to be the mind will probably stop before they come to like this I would like to ask you a question Are those who stop evils before they come to the worst like this not going to kill with their own hands Or do they make all equally receive the teaching  If you want to recommend it to families entered in the household registers  I see that your discussion does not hold water Moreover you say If is the same as trees and plants then it will disappear like smoke What does the exquisite spirit rely upon to establish itself in Heaven Well the disembodied spirits are dim and faint Zhongyou ie Zilu received when he wanted to know about death Si was also unsuccessful in getting an answer regarding the nature of human beings and the Way of Heaven As for the matter that we will never again receive a body I clearly stated this in my previous discussion Regarding Actions and the way of reward and retribution inevitably tally  I should say that the Yu family made a gate higher and waited for the merit of the accumulation of their a virtuous deeds and Lord Boyang who rescued Emperor Xuan when the emperor was still an infant did not attack yet he was blessed with the rank of marquis How are these concerned with the next life In addition you say According to the common talk of those who reign over the world people who giving donations have no recollection  and when government ofcials conduct righteousness they still show kindness to others without thinking that what they are doing is wholesome This statement is true To require kindness in order to plan for a reward is what a preacher exhorts To be kind in order to be delighted with a reward is a common affair of the world If one doubts scriptures he will suffer hardships for successive kalpas If he diligently makes donations he will obtain rewards accumulated many times over I know that you want to draw it to the upper stream This is also something for which I do not begrudge supporting immensely Therefore I do not draw Buddhism to the upper stream If donations are not made as aid in an emergency and if kindness is given merit and fame when these are all evaluated by a wise person  we feel ashamed Thus I have acted in accordance with my perseverance for a long time but I have never improved myself I feel inwardly ashamed at Boyu of Wei state who continually tried to practice good conduct I have not spared the time to censure others Sincerely He Chengtian The Second Expatiation to He of Hengyang I have been occupied in farming for a while In spare moments from my farming aged rustics are my companions The topic of our conversation is limited to crops My work is entirely to plow land and pasture animals I received a subtle argument from you by which I am brightly consoled The content of your letter is very detailed and I feel more ashamed of my obstinacy I now again forget and write to you of what I cherish in my mind in order to convey to you what I have not yet expressed The discussion on the three powers must be originally based on all three lines  When the three lines are displayed the middle line refers to the virtue of a sovereign Therefore it is so supernatural that it can reach the uppermost and so lofty that it can unite with the head of the state Consequently I said formerly that if one is not suitable to Heaven and Earth he has nothing with which to originally respond to the knowledge of these things You still take without discarding in  You carry them extensively without leaving anyone out Your resolution to be generous to people is really ample I am afraid that your arrangement of positions is disordered and consequently there will be numerous ambiguous issues If wherever natural compassion arises you exhaust the capacity of universal love and if wherever the feeling to be ashamed of evils arises you accomplish the righteousness of help for honest people you are the most benevolent and the most righteous Those people who possess their lot in advance and have not reached its apex simply cannot be a match for the two polarities ie Heaven and Earth  Why isnt the wholesome mind invoked Nevertheless you falsely accuse that a wholesome heart exists but it is not counted I have not yet evaluated your intention Even if the three powers are equally arranged in a line we cannot bring people of supercial talent into the line Therefore in this land those of humble birth are not counted in  and in that land sages and wise people are clearly distinguished The purpose of recommending all of both registers lies in this Regarding people like Qiao and zha their virtue is not able to be one with emperors and kings The judgment of the two paths is easier than giving instructions to ones servants by merely gesturing with ones chin Moreover I am aware that you say Even though people are born and equally placed under the great virtue they cannot be called sentient beings It is comparable to the case that although sages equally receive the ve primary elements they cannot be called people The reason cannot be called people is that are more vigorous than people in spiritual intelligence Certainly we must differentiate them on the basis of their extraordinary spirits but we should not distinguish them based on the life they received You avoid in vain the name of the people but the reality of the people is not damaged cannot help but resemble the case that if one is afraid of a singleplank bridge and tries to avoid it in the end he will not be able to avoid  As for my statement People employ other living creatures in order to nourish themselves and other living creatures are put to work in order to support people I intend to mean that the ignorant and the wise restrict each other and the confused and the intelligent control each other This matter the difference between human beings and animals derives from human intellect it does not derive from the laws of Heaven Therefore at the beginning we are compassionate to its emergence and lament its stagnation and disappearance in the end Would your various types of food including livestock serve the same purpose as this Generally moving and owing well are the nature of those of the lower stratum while making judgments in transformation and shaping is the work of sages of the upper stratum If one carefully builds a fence  he is still worried that a thief may come over the fence not to speak of he completely sets up everything in order to satisfy extravagant desires How could we discuss abandoning excessive  Therefore I know that in your discussion of to destroy life and be brutal to other living creatures I cannot share anxieties with heartless people  The intention to be fond of killing is found in some people but the feeling to love life is abundant Why would kindness be limited to just fawns and eggs Moreover this does not mean that outside of the market and the kitchen there is nothing to be offered to nourish us The writing of Shen Nong is explained by Zhongsan in the Discourse on Health Care  Gongli ie Zhong Changtong of the Later Han dynasty praised this matter  and Zhongyang ie Jiao Shen of the Later Han dynasty worked hard at the practice of guiding the breath  This shows exactly that formerly there was a biography of that person and we now hear of him If we can set forth a farreaching prospect and seek for a long period of time we will be able to fulll it in a short period of time and to expect merit in a long period of time If the exquisite spirit is exactly distinguished from grass and trees your answer Wandering spirits become evil spirits If that even though there are and they have no form then could there be beings without form in the world you have already accounted for their existence How could you align yourself with him in not giving an answer  Even though you are fond of studying I am afraid that you have not gotten to what you rely upon Otherwise this is because the paths of understanding and of obscurity are very much separate from each other and the mysterious issue and the evident are far removed from each other these facts consequently cause the bright moon to stop shining on the world and knowledge restricts your mind from understanding  Or a worldly person who has an unpolished gem and displays it in a market is censured reward and retribution and actions is primarily called fate I think that there are no absurd things Among those who are moved  the minds of human beings are the greatest The movement of ones thought cannot be perceived by servants practicing divination When it is extended to its accumulated point we are not competent enough to determine its origin and we must give up  Zhuangzhou says that if the land is tilled in a careless and haphazard manner the reward is poor too Lord Sun ie Xunzi says that the force of reward or retribution falls on a person according to each category These statements are set forth to admonish us for our future lives It brings about widespread blessings for everyone and is the highest of a hundred deities in nobility Why should it be merely that blessings are extended to ones descendants and happiness is limited to being ranked as a high ofcial or minister If we continuously save with good  a good will also follow It appears that this is because you verify the parsimonious feeling familiar to you and you doubt the virtuous teaching with which you are unfamiliar Consequently you just punish those who boast about achievements but are recklessly censured for forgetting about wise people You who thinks that those who place themselves in reality take the splendor to be vile tend to simply stay in kindness and leave behind coldheartedness If there are people like those who make donations not in order to give aid in an emergency or who are kind only expecting fame  then you will be ashamed of them and I will also be ashamed of them  The Second Response to Yan of Yongjia I have believed in my narrow view from the time I was young The older I grow the deeper becomes Hence I was hoping to oat relying on a stream or to soar entrusting myself to a female kylin when you expressed your thoughts with good intention and again kindly gave explanations If sometimes good jade has a aw even a humble person may point out the aw How could I such a person be fond of arguing Again I will take a step further and ask you questions to get  with which I will examine completely what brings me to a standstill In your letter you say The discussion on the three powers must be originally based on all three lines  When the three lines are displayed the middle line refers to the virtue of a sovereign Therefore it is so supernatural that it can reach the uppermost and so lofty that it can unite with the head of the state If just as your point of argument we consider the three lines of the Book of Changes to be the three powers the rst line is intended to be the line of Earth and the third line is said to be the rank of Heaven As a matter of fact as long as the two polarities have no consigning basis how can we take to designate the establishment of people Moreover you say  wherever natural compassion you exhaust the capacity of universal love and wherever the feeling to be ashamed of evils you accomplish the righteousness of help for honest people you are the most benevolent and the most righteous This indicates that you admit that those who practice benevolence and righteousness become the three powers Again you say that Zichang and zha cannot belong to the upper stratum and Yi and Yan ought to belong to the lower stratum People who are qualied to put on yellow lower garments ie ranking ofcials such as Zichang and Jizha still fall below  Although you said the judgment of the two paths of sages and ordinary people is easier than giving instructions to ones servants by merely gesturing with ones chin since there is no warrant for high and low ie sages and ordinary people a deluded one has not yet comprehended this Yin and yang nourish the vigor  while toughness and gentleness give them their natures They each have a round head and rectangular feet they do not differ in their appearance They have much natural compassion and the feeling to be ashamed of evil So does everyone For those who take part in and accept the two polarities in order to be in the three powers however it is necessary to hold benevolence and righteousness as the rst step Furthermore you say  are equally placed under the great virtue in the same way as people Certainly we must differentiate them on the basis of their extraordinary spirits but we should not distinguish them based on the life they received Such extraordinary spirits are already different from other living creatures Why would they all suddenly be the same under the law of receiving life Life is based on the law and the law differentiates between sages and other living creatures Then on what basis is the same name life given to other living creatures If you stick to this name life and  cause the people to certainly follow it then is something undened and complete  also included in this instance Again you say If one carefully builds a fence  he is still worried that a thief may come over the fence not to speak of his worry when he completely sets up everything in order to satisfy extravagant desires How could we discuss abandoning excessive  You said at the beginning that emperors and sages set up the teaching to plan seasonal hunting and the scriptures to prudently follow the seasons in this way to gradually return to the cessation of extremities Now you criticize with the statement This is precisely the beginning of extremities I have not known in detail whether this rebukes my view or ridicules sages Furthermore you say Outside of the market and the kitchen why can there be nothing to be offered to nourish us The writing of Shen Nong is explained by Zhongsan An old man of seventy years is not satised until he eats meat Why can you merely display herbs and medicines and reserve them as the best remedy The reason I am worried that does not stand up is not that it is difcult for me to support your great discussion but I take a step back and doubt this matter simply cannot be suddenly removed from the world This indeed is the question Just on the point in which you say that spiritual beings should have some substance isnt it possible you are confused since Indian books state that spiritual beings become other living creatures People of former days considered spiritual beings to be the teaching Moreover they wrote it down in books and scriptures and it is widely found in written materials Qiao of Zheng state and zha of Wu state considered this so too Therefore when music is played six times with the Chinese zithers made out of wood from Mount Yunhe the spirits of Heaven really descend  and when it is played nine times with the Chinese zithers made out of wood from Mount Longmen the manes of people all come and gather You often adhere to the Rites of Zhou  but recently you disregard this meaning Since merciful people deeply saw this fate they made the correct statement of its foundation You have not made it clear about socalled merciful people If you depend on the doctrine of reward and retribution in accordance with actions that is stated in books other than  it is entirely the teaching of expedients to which I refer In investigating the utmost doctrine you have not analyzed with the sages words and yet you have adopted many crafty and strange in order to support  Can it be to give the impression of rescuing by means of water from disasters caused by water Furthermore you say I think that there are no absurd things Each one is moved with good virtue and If we continuously save with good  a good will also follow Without any exercise of thought it will occur naturally If these words are certainly so those who are moved with good virtue must be equal in degree of seriousness just as the force of a sundial must have a certain extent in length Even though hunting is done according to the seasons the extremely cruel nature of human beings has not been uprooted For what is a person rewarded to ascend to Heaven which is splendid and joyful For what is one punished to fall into hell which is dark and full of suffering Why was it sealed in the ages of xi and Tang  In the beginning nets were made and this has given rise to a number of sins offering animal sacrices was established and opened the punishment of the long night Skt The heavenly kitchen is abandoned and those animals fed with grass and grain are considered delicious There has been no benevolence to save people from drowning in extreme misery The cruelty of putting people into a dry moat was carried out without restraint If you think that the intelligence of the exquisite spirit of sages is not yet complete in some points even though you are thoughtful and love strange ideas you have not come to disgrace the sages When you talk about benevolence and righteousness you say those who care about are few and those who use them for their own benet are many However when you speak of doing kindness you approve that men of virtue and talents who are left neglected forget a reward If you can encourage people who are willing to give  expect companions who want to be benevolent expound the meaning of forgetting reward and retribution and lead the people toward a mind of righteousness then righteousness is truly here and you are not far in seeking benevolence It brings about widespread blessings for everyone and is the highest of a hundred deities in nobility the intention of this is nonsense and it is not what I am concerned with in this discussion Isnt this like the case when the Qin army was about to escape and their messenger talked nonsense How could I continue to press you Sages are placed above and they do not have to strive for supremacy against a hundred deities If there is a beginning there is an end Therefore they cut off the intimacy and fame of being praised Nothing hurts the capacity of universal love By hunting and shing both the wise and ordinary people are nourished Game for its threefold use is served to guests as a practical matter Gold and precious stones illuminate splendidly Getting drunk and being satised with kindness one is beneted in this way for ten thousand years Recluses broaden new works every day while ofcials expound the teachings of ancient sage sovereigns Sincerity is apparent in bright rulers The dragon seal manifests views Musical stones create harmonious rhythms These are for the paradise of Yao and Confucius He kills chickens makes a variety of millet and entrusts somewhat his ambition or  just like Yi Yin he carries a heavy threelegged caldron on his back to cook becomes famous and immortalizes his fame or a man butchers sheep uses a knife  and lets his lofty aspiration ride the drifting clouds Why is it  necessary to consider the future blessings of the family that has accumulated enough good deeds to be vile to hope for the blessings of the next existence of which there is no proof to turn ones back on the real pleasures of ones own lifetime and to be tired of working in vain without a place to return to trying to harness wind or catch a shadow is not the grace of the golden mean of the Confucian school To admire a barbarian and to be confused by absurd things go against the goal of a masterly mind squatting or kneeling upright in worship and bowing complaisantly are inconsistent with each other after all I personally wish that you would give up practicing both and abide by alone Metaphors such as a singleplank bridge the two men shu and shu a person in the world who keeps an unpolished gem and displays it in a market and an ofcer in charge of translation have nothing to do with the original meanings The Third Expatiation to He of Hengyang Sacred thought is difcult to investigate and a mysterious response is unforeseen I vainly think that the cloth that could be washed in re  was engraved in stone but it was cut down in a later generation and Teng Xiu felt ashamed of himself throughout his life about the barbels of a shrimp Therefore I simply fear to judge with my own speculation anything outside my consideration The scriptures of doctrines are everlasting and their unique insights are strong durable and skillful It is difcult to have doubts about them I will write a little more about what I think and explain it itemizing in accordance with your responses Since fortune and misfortune are mingled in the matter and foreign and Chinese are mixed in the meaning although I tried to make a brief and concise statement it ended up becoming a petty composition You respond and say If just as your point of argument we consider the three lines to be the three powers the rst line is intended to be the line of Earth and the third line is said to be the rank of Heaven As a matter of fact as long as the two polarities have no consigning basis how can we take to designate the establishment of people According to former scholarship I have heard the simple symbol of the diagrams begins with three lines and the sixtyfour hexagrams end with six lines  With the three lines the foundation of the position of the three powers is set up before the six lines change what a group of dragons pass through Hence after the sixtyfour hexagrams the signicance of ones course of action is claried Therefore it is stated in the Explanation of the Words and Sentences in the Book of Changes that The one can live in seclusion   are active   lying hidden and  advance together with the movement of time These are the meanings for sages to adapt to the circumstances of their times and the way to unite  If we consider that the two polarities have no consigning basis and we do not take the second line to be designated for the establishment of people since the rst line is not intended for Earth and the third line is not positioned for Heaven then I do not understand on what basis your previous assertion that the three powers are one unit arises If you still accept the theory found in the Commentary of Appended Judgments and you do not surpass a the instruction received from your teachers why do you take only the meaning of the hexagrams correctly and decline the meaning of the simple symbol of the diagrams In addition I know you say Since the line is located between justice and harmony it is simply suitable to correspond to sovereign virtue If there are merely the lines for justice and harmony and rather unexpectedly there is no person of justice and harmony to what are the lines going to be applied If justice and harmony lie in virtue and all ordinary people cannot have justice and harmony my discussion that one is suitable to Heaven and Earth cannot be seen as extravagant You respond   wherever natural compassion you exhaust the capacity of universal love and wherever the feeling to be ashamed of evils you accomplish the righteousness of help for honest people you are the most benevolent and the most righteous This indicates that you admit that those who practice benevolence and righteousness become the three powers Again you say that Zichang and zha cannot belong to the upper stratum and Yi and Yan ought to belong to the lower stratum People who are qualied to put on yellow lower garments ie ranking ofcials such as Zichang and Jizha still fall below  Although you said the judgment of the two paths of sages and ordinary people is easier than giving instructions to ones servants by merely gesturing with ones chin since there is no warrant for high and low ie sages and ordinary people a deluded one has not yet comprehended this My explanation is this The socalled most benevolent and most righteous are designations only for those who have completely reached the acme of benevolence and righteousness and who can receive standing on an equal footing with Heaven and Earth I do not mean that anyone who has even a little bit of the feeling of shame for evils and of universal love is in the three powers As I have already explained this in my previous discussion I am surprised that you still have a question about this In the four of the universe only the sovereign is an entity  We know that those who make the two polarities the three are none other than sages According to the grading of the Eastern Lu where the Duke of Zhou and Confucius are from Qiao and zha do not fully equip righteousness Why are they placed higher to occupy the highest rank In the light of the basis of the western land  since Yi and Yan have not attained the dharmakāya they must be placed lower in the rank of living beings In the discussion you gave me you comment on ākyamunis with the view of the Duke of Zhou Therefore my intention was taken contradictorily I have become rather verbose Sages become sovereigns or teachers while wise people become subjects or assistants of the teachers When they approach supernatural achievement smoothly and are inuenced by the great work they can share the course of action and keeping silent and speaking are also achieved at the same time If one masters a part to this point how could he turn his back to become a ranking ofcial of the yellow lower garment You vainly see that there are those who cannot be ranked equally with sovereigns unreasonably and resentfully blame it on them and do not know to raise up to the highest point Furthermore it is not the feeling of sticking to principles If you pointed out and concluded like this why do you say there is no warrant ie sages and ordinary people You respond Yin and yang nourish the vapor  while toughness and gentleness give them their natures They each have a round head and rectangular feet they do not differ in their appearance They have much natural compassion and the feeling to be ashamed of evil So does everyone For those who take part in and accept the two polarities in order to be in the three powers however it is necessary to hold benevolence and righteousness as the rst step b My explanation is this If it is assumed that those who have a round head and rectangular feet and who most certainly have the sincerity of feeling shame for evils and natural compassion in the same way and who do not differ in their appearance can all take part in and accept the two polarities  then is a group of people like Jiao a younger brother of King Zhuang of Chu state and Zhi who are known as robbers reckoned among those in the three powers If this is actually impossible we cannot place them on the same level with great people if the only reason for this is that they are equally human It is difcult for ordinary people to become equal to in dignity and capacity It has already been stated that The benevolent rest in benevolence and the wise seek benevolence To practice energetically is close to benevolence and The one who is afraid of vice strives to be benevolent If we regard those who try to be benevolent for benet in the same light as the one of the principal seat truth and falsehood become mutually indistinguishable Zhuangzi says In the world the good people are few and those who are not good are many If are divided like this how can you say So does everyone Although they want to avail themselves of  what can be done about those who are suspicious or deceitful The symbolism of the hexagrams shows numinous beings  Such extraordinary spirits are already different from other living creatures Why would they all suddenly be the same under the law of receiving life Life is based on the law and the law differentiates between sages and other living creatures Then on what basis is the same name life given to other living creatures If you stick to this name life and cause the people to certainly follow it then is something undened and complete also included in this instance My explanation is this I said previously In life there is a common feature of all things which is the same as what differentiates all things How could it be distinguished to attain life You responded to this I do not say that this is not so Furthermore you asked What merit is there in considering that the life that is not different from each other must be sentient beings This indicates that you contradict my that are sentient beings yet you accept is not different Could there be anything that is not different and not sentient beings Therefore I again simply said Is it originally yin and yang I do not see the difference  but you said that you have suddenly not been the same If there are differences in the law isnt it that escape in vapor Then beyond yin and yang there is moreover a realm where one receives life How should the three periods be rmly founded If vainly in the name of life you do not see the truth of life it does not match your previous statement If you say that life is not life this means that people c are not people Venerable Sir Lis theory about this namely that something undened and complete that came into existence before Heaven and Earth probably has such meaning You respond  If one carefully builds a fence around a house and so on You said at the beginning that emperors and sages set up the teaching to plan seasonal hunting and the scriptures to prudently follow the seasons in this way to gradually return to the cessation of extremities Now you criticize with the statement This is precisely the beginning of extremities I have not known in detail whether this rebukes my view or ridicules sages My explanation is this Formerly I read your original discussion the Discourse on the Full Understanding of Life Regarding the section from the nine kinds of grains up to When Confucius shed he did not use a net I came to understand for the rst time that you meant in your discussion that whatever is governed and produced originates entirely from the sages who are personally good teachers in order to lead common people In my solitary humble and clumsy opinion I would say that whatever do there must be reasons for their actions Sages manage and control their actions and do not let them go to excess You however have not been aware in what way leave behind excessiveness Sages assuredly remove this I do not understand your intention here Therefore recently I asked you about the issue of excessiveness You replied and said I have not known in detail who is to be rebuked Probably you forgot what you said previously You responded  Outside of a market and a kitchen and so on Well in offering to Heaven and Earth calfs horns are used in the state offering the three domestic animals are sacriced and the thick soup of beef or pork is served in a wooden vessel on a painted wooden stand to offer to guests of honor An old man of seventy years is not satised until he eats meat Why can you merely display herbs and medicines and reserve them as the best remedy The reason I am worried that does not stand up is not that it is difcult for me to support your great discussion but I take a step back and suspect this matter simply cannot be suddenly removed from the world My explanation is this Shen Nong laid down how to live and the people of the Zhou dynasty provided the instruction  They already advocated a diet of grains In addition the best remedy was mentioned and sacrice was already offered I previously adduced that outside of the market and the kitchen there are other things that support and nourish us Even with the merit of eating the meat of domestic animals however it is rare to live a hundred years As a good aspect of taking divine herbs I often hear about a life span of a thousand years For this reason I say why is it necessary for an old man of seventy years to appreciate the great favor of eating meat If however one who sequesters himself completely in a closedin area gives up this meat diet he simply has no other means  I think that your statement  cannot be suddenly removed from the world is similar to They cannot suddenly take away remain entrenched  which I expressed in my previous expatiation Since you understand that these dietary habits cannot be suddenly removed from the world probably you do not think that the Way is complete in this  Just on the point in which you say that spiritual beings should have some substance a isnt it possible you are confused since Indian books state that spiritual beings become other living creatures People of former days considered spiritual beings to be the teaching Moreover they wrote it down in books and scriptures and it is widely found in written materials Lord Sun Qiao of Zheng state and zha of Wu state considered this so too Therefore when music is played six times with the Chinese zithers made out of wood from Mount Yunhe the spirits of Heaven really descend from Heaven and when it is played nine times with the Chinese zithers made out of wood from Mount Longmen the manes of people all come and gather You often adhere to the Rites of Zhou but recently you disregard this meaning It is not only that I do not reject that there are spiritual beings but also I think that if there are  they must have a form Please forget about the Indian theory and strictly comply with the Chinese classics Moreover put aside the issue that become other living creatures The appearance and the issue of existence or nonexistence should be assuredly reported and settled Spiritual beings are very often mentioned in stories and writings It is not that I do not understand their names and titles Recently I received three discussions  Every time I received a new discussion the number of increased A myriad of spirits have all gathered together but you have not answered even a part of the question  You vainly said that it is an incoherent argument and considered it a common opinion You have not made it clear about socalled merciful people If you depend on the doctrine of reward and retribution actions that is stated in books other than  it is entirely the teaching of expedients to which I refer In investigating the utmost doctrine you have not analyzed with the sages words and yet you have adopted many crafty and strange in order to support  Can it be to give the impression of rescuing by means of water from disasters caused by water My explanation is this Thinking about merciful people I hear for a long time that there are such people I know that you think the doctrine of reward and retribution is entirely the teaching of expedients The way of expedients is mysterious and deep only sages can accomplish it Even though you are procient in knowledge and understanding you have not seen its culmination If what the doctrine of expedients states is all deceptive and delusive there would be no reward and retribution in the Nature Again this is dreadful The spirit is lofty but the one who hears it is low How can you bring a false accusation I think that the sages words you mentioned must be the words of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius What we talk about now is entirely the issue of believing and following  Nevertheless you say that I have not analyzed  My answers do not go beyond your questions I do not feel that I have adopted many  You Yu and Ridi were not born in the Chinese region How can we specify that there is no one who has mastered the principles outside of the nine regions away from the royal domain If you believe your own criteria have only your ears and eyes to teach you and consider that everything except what you have already learned and known is crafty and strange then I will stop my argument b You responded Furthermore you say I think that there are no absurd things Even though hunting is done according to the seasons the extremely cruel nature has not been uprooted For what is a person rewarded to ascend to Heaven which is splendid and joyful For what is one punished to fall into Hell which is dark and full of suffering I spoke of a sundial in order to give evidence  The intention of your letter is to raise a doubt that it is not necessarily that actions and the way of reward and retribution correspond to each other and to suspect that there is no rule between them and then you again try to remove a fortunate response A fortunate response is nothing other than what is produced by fate If a fortunate response is extinguished there is no fate I think that one who keeps it in mind to believe in the Way must not come to this point If you think that decorations in building or construction are not initiated by a benevolent mind and it is worse than taking anothers life in accordance with seasons wouldnt it be seriously ungrateful to the mind of that man  The emperors vehicle and seal are not necessarily the sentiments of Yao and Shun Would respectful buildings and magnicent offerings be ākyamunis intention To demand the reward of rebirth in Heaven and to ask for punishment in Hell are very similar to the stories that the ancient questioned Yafu a general and minister of the Han dynasty who died of starvation as had been foretold by an elderly woman physiognomist about and that Ying asked a question to a guest who had foretold his future misfortune How tasteful these words are I will leave it out A good cook who wields a knife feels afraid whenever he comes to a complicated joint The Sage is as bright as the sun and moon and his edication can open the three powers If reward and retribution inevitably tally how is it hindered by the teaching Why was it sealed in the ages of xi and Tang  In the beginning nets to catch animals and sh were made and this gave rise to a number of sins offering animal sacrices was established and opened the punishment of the long night  The heavenly kitchen ie food naturally collected is abandoned and those animals fed grass and grain are considered delicious There has been no benevolence to save people from drowning  The cruelty of putting people into a dry moat was carried out without restraint If you think that the intelligence of the exquisite spirit is not yet complete in some points even though you are thoughtful and love strange ideas you have not come to disgrace sages My explanation is this I know that you think the meaning of reward and retribution was sealed in the times of xi and the Zhou dynasty The time of xi and Tang was long ago which no one knows fully The record in the Book of History comprises no more than a few sections When the merits of virtue and punishment were just mentioned they had no scope to record the origin of weal and woe Now in the writings on emperors and kings the issue of a persons life is still not written but taking the lack of a written record as evidence you consider that indeed it did not exist in ancient times This is again a fault caused by considering your mind as your teacher Moreover it is all displayed in the works of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius to believe and follow blessings and misfortune  Since there are familiar and unfamiliar c in language and shallow and deep in teaching is it to have the wise give this and snatch away that While we live we indeed have desires When we have desires we certainly ask for something If we ght we harm each other If we are peaceful we stabilize each other The reason a net was made is to remove harmful things in order to have peace Furthermore hunting and shing are no different from the sacrice of livestock In the previous reply you were already aware that sacrices of livestock could not suddenly be removed from the world you say Wasnt it possible to abandon at least hunting and shing in ancient times This has not yet been a coherent discussion Therefore to try to dispense with death is of following ones feeling and to take away other lives is of going against ones nature Why would he offend and go against the natural course From this we know that since we cannot suddenly remove longstanding customs simply set up a system to control them Even though the spirits of sages are vigorous they have nothing to make ignorant minds wise and clever The heavenly kitchen was involuntarily abandoned since matters are far away and difcult for us to reach Since substantial things are familiar and easy for us to indulge in domestic animals is always delicious saving a man from drowning and taking a man out of a dry moat are common to many wise people but to teach people differs  It is not that the Way itself differs Your reprimand that I think the intelligence of the exquisite spirit of the sages is not yet complete in some points also seems inappropriate You respond When you talk about benevolence and righteousness you say Those who care about are few and those who use them for their own benet are many However when you speak of doing kindness you approve that men of virtue and talents who are left neglected forget a reward Since those who use for their own benet are many how can you say to forget a reward If you can encourage people who are willing to give  expect companions who want to be benevolent expound the meaning of forgetting reward and retribution and lead the people toward a mind of righteousness then righteousness is truly here and you are not far in seeking benevolence My explanation is this Those who care about benevolence and righteousness are few and those who use them for their own benet are many I learned this from Zhuangzis book It is not my own statement You hastily impeached me before you made a complete examination Well Since those who care about are few and those who use them for their own benets are many no one is able to be a man of virtue and talents It is not something on which you should depend in order to show that your great discussion is correct If being willing to give and forgetting a reward are to master benevolence and if forgetting a reward and giving tally with righteousness we may leave behind the word want in the phrase in order to hope for companions who want to be benevolent and also remove the word toward from the phrase lead the people toward a mind of righteousness If here and you are not far  who would not long for these Isnt this like the case when the Qin army was about to escape and their messenger talked nonsense a My explanation is this Based on the views of this land you say that blessings rest with highranking ofcials These are controversial points in our discussion The foundation of the criticism of this discussion takes by turns to be the essence If every time it gets beyond your control you say that it is vast and preposterous then the road to look for principles is nearly blocked up Sages are placed above and they do not have to strive for supremacy against a hundred deities And so on My explanation is this The one who becomes a leader not only refrains from ghting but also certainly assumes a humble attitude When you see the phrase The highest in nobility among a hundred deities you may not think to contend with a hundred deities for supremacy Instead you take it as Lord Teng and Lord Xue who fought each other for supremacy and forget to master benevolence I am aware that you think there is a beginning and an end in things and that there is no land of eternal life If we look for it within our realm  it is true just as the purpose of your letter and it is just as I said in my previous expatiation Various existing things are really suitable for this ie in the great law of Nature life and death are the same in arising and falling As to illustrations in the Book of Mountains and Seas and records in the Biographies of Arrayed Transcendents these issues are concerned with this world but they can no longer be traced back not to mention the case where the Way separates from common practices and the principles separate from an ordinary pattern My explanation is this When I came to examine the section on this subject you enthusiastically relate successive generations Your writing is extensive the content is complete and you are very good at methods your teacher Your voice to sing for the world of sages is vigorous but you simply have not made a key remark in studying to nd the signicance of the Way I have been vaguely informed of the outline of the ways of emperors and kings and the traces of the virtuous and the intelligent I personally wish that you would give up practicing both and abide by alone and so on My explanation is this blessings that has accumulated are not considered to be vile was already explicated in the section of believing and following The issue about hoping thoroughly for the next existence was also completely when I spoke of perceiving reward or retribution Why wouldnt it be possible that squatting or kneeling upright in worship and bowing complaisantly are practiced together in the same world In principle it is possible to practice them concurrently These several passages in my latest letter arose somewhat from a joke When an arbitrary opinion has come to this point there is no help but it is just very strange Since you have never responded to this it is really promising  You are powerful as if allied nations follow you just like clouds and your great discourse has become popular I  live apart from society and every time I present my solitary opinion it is commented on in whispers I truly rely on a versatile scholar I abruptly forgot about the troublesomeness and have greedily written all to my hearts content End of Fascicle Four of The Collection for the Propagation and Clarication The Discourse on Regeneration by Luo Junzhang It is good that the scholar Xiang said What is Heaven It is the general name of all things What is Man It is one of the things in Heaven From this we may say that each thing has its own term of existence while Heaven and Earth are everlasting If all things did not regenerate Heaven and Earth would have an end Heaven and Earth are not supposed to have an end I seek in various ancient discussions In that case human beings and things have their xed terms It is impossible that existence extinguishes and becomes nonexistence It is impossible that you can transform to become me the wise the ignorant one who lives long or one who dies youngcircles round and returns to ones being spontaneously goes on consistently and there is not an iota of difference Its way is profound Even though Heaven and Earth are vast they are harmonious without disorder Although all things are numerous they are sorted according to their classes Each of them has its foundation There is the sequence in successive c ancestors In the direct line and the collateral branches for a hundred generations its longstanding is never lost Furthermore the spirit and the physical substance are a natural couple The natural couples separation and reunion are the change in birth and death There are gathering and scattering in the physical substance Therefore when each of them returns  there is a principle Even though things are confused and indistinguishable when they scatter they are not out of order when they gather The farther they go the closer they return In addition the spirit and the physical substance profoundly meet each other and spontaneously unite together exactly just as two pieces of a tally t together People of the world all lament that uniting leads to separation without fail yet no one consoles himself with that separation leads to uniting without fail as well All people know that gathering leads to scattering without fail but no one recognizes that scattering leads to gathering without fail as well They do not give much thought to this  How could there be distance  Generally since the present existence arises in conformity with the former existence affairs are in alignment with past affairs In the essence there is nothing disordered In the intention we are not aware that the one of the former life profoundly unites with  Now a talker merely knows that the one of the former life is not the present life but he simply does not know that the one of the present life is the one of the former life Those who have extensive views therefore see that life is equal to death and say that life and death are just like wakefulness and sleep How true this statement is Sun Changshas Letter by Anguo I have examined the Discourse on Regeneration in which you sum up the issue of changes and thoroughly analyze gathering and scattering This is a good discussion Nevertheless I still have a different opinion However it takes many years until what is hidden reveals itself When things exhaust the condition  they must go far off to an unseen place where our ears and eyes cannot perceive them They are disorderly confused and mixed and they transform into other substances They are not what they used to be This is the reason why all creatures that have feelings grieve If this is so you cannot console only yourself Response to Sun I received your letter Your composition is brief yet your purpose is expressed and the logic upholds actual facts Even though I am glad for your simple and easily understandable reply I have not yet appreciated it In the original I did not say that things do not change at all Those that decay do not lose their former essence Who takes charge of molding them namely mixing and making  If they are like this would regeneration occur only once arise endlessly and regenerate for a long time When they come to an end they return to the beginning While you are not able to know the present how can you know about regeneration How could it be said that I console only myself The Discourse on the Immortality of the Spirit by Zheng Daozi a Many think that body and spirit perish together and the function of the spirit and consciousness are extinguished along with them All people of the world already consider the Duke of Zhou and Confucius to be the culmination Benevolence righteousness and ethical education were rst formed in their minds The foundation of the spiritual intelligence is never mentioned in even a single word The Buddha speaks words of the utmost importance but ordinary people do not believe in him I fell into delusions when I was young but I thought to get out of the delusions I sought the profound purport and examined the essence of the spirit I realized that the principle is more exquisite than a physical body and the spirit is more subtle than the principle Entrusting what has appeared I will transmit my mind and briey adduce the testimony Even though they exist together while one lives with regard to the point that there is a difference between coarseness and subtlety in their origins there is a distinction between corporeality and incorporeality Why do I say this A body consists of the ve viscera  the six entrails ie gall stomach bladder the three parts of the abdominal cavity small intestine and lower intestine the limbs and the seven apertures in the head ie eyes ears nostrils and mouth Therefore one is alive At just the moment when people are born each one receives the ve primary elements in a different way  Hence some people suffer from being crippled in a limb or some part of the body or lack either ears or eyes but this does not prove fatal Even with the body it is like this not to mention with the spirit whose essence mysteriously shines Body and breath move together while the spirit and the wonderful realization ow in the same way Although motion and inactivity support each other exquisiteness and coarseness separate from each other in their origins Wouldnt it be because each has its origin and they depend on each other to function When you take a familiar example of this the reason is clear In what a body supports muscles and bones have sensations of pain and itching while nails and hair do not Why is this so Wouldnt it be because muscles and bones are the essence of life but nails and hair are not the foundation of life When life is in the foundation sensations exist For the function of a body it is still considered that the foundation and the periphery are concerned with rising and falling not to mention the spirit that is the foundation of life and whose origin is the most subtle How could wither along with a seven chitall and be exhausted together with doors and windows If you infer from this truth you can clearly understand that the spirit is immortal A guest criticizes Your argument on the body and spirit is complete Nevertheless even though the body and spirit have different origins is of coarse origin and is of subtle originboth consider existence to be their status The reason for being is that life is the foundation Why then is it possible that the foundation of existence has become exhausted and that which has depended on the foundation alone exists Since it is completely obscure it is not only that there is nothing to establish with words but also that there is nothing to extablish with consciousness If it is not established by the consciousness where does the spirit deposit itself It has not yet been based on the mind Is this why a criticism such as this comes up Now all changes are entirely existence Prospering declining rising falling dying or being born take the place of each other With regard to water and re they prevail over all sentient beings thoroughly and are abundant without deciency Wouldnt it be because the essence of re follows things the law of water annihilates and follows others both  re and water are not selfgenerated when they are generated they are what all sentient beings depend on they are useful in the light of  and therefore things cannot use them up Even exist in the same sphere of life are clever in this way not to mention the principle of the spirit that is singularly transcendent and unparalleled It is not on the same level with ordinary things but is it xed that since it is outside of life and is completely obscure the spirit has nothing into which to deposit itself If we carry out a discussion on this basis the Grand Terminus is the mother of the two elementary forms  and the two elementary forms are the foundation of all things The Grand Terminus is simply the vapor of Heaven and Earth It can still unite the roots of all these changes and it does not change that it is the root How much more can the spiritual intelligencethe apex of the numinous being that exhausts both existence and nonexistencedo You can comprehend that is immortal The critic says You infer that the function of the spirit is beyond the body and you indicate that the Grand Terminus comes before things This is really signicant It is however valuable that reason satises the minds of people Then a discussion can be carried out The spirit and the body have not been separate from each other even for a moment If they were separate from each other there would be no spirit There is no spirit in trees and plants because they do not have consciousness If it is able to be immortal it rides on the numinous being without availing itself of a body Since it does not avail itself of a body why does it exist with a body If the spirit and the body cannot be separated from each other it can certainly be understood that the foundation of life is the same I respond There is a criticism of this The body and the spirit have their own origins As to re there is re on the basis of rewood If there is no rewood there is no re Even though rewood is a device to make re it is not the foundation of re The foundation of re spontaneously exists and simply comes to function complying with rewood If rewood came before re would it be reasonable to say that there was no re before Suiren a legendary ruler who rst discovered re The foundation of re is the utmost degree of yang and yang is the culmination of re Therefore rewood is what re deposits itself into but it is not the foundation  That the spirit and the body avail of each other is also like this Availing of and complying with each other are merely the cause of the path of birth and death Why could it be that if there is a body the spirit exists and if there is no body the spirit is exhausted Its foundation is entranced unconscious and indescribable Let me extensively give an example in order to clarify this for you When rewood is in water re is dead When rewood is out of water it makes re The rewood remains the same but re is designated beforehand  That the spirit does not rely on a body is also like this If does not need a body as you said what avails itself of a body and what shines alone are usually the same in the principles Even though avail themselves of each other this is not interdependence in the foundation According to what the Buddhist doctrine claries we must educate and mold this spirit in order to save that body This is what ordinary people are deluded by because they have not reached the foundation Although the spirit does not need a body that body is surely produced In the body that is surely produced this spirit certainly dwells If certainly dwells in that is surely produced the function and the perception become one and they are spontaneously benecial to each other If it is fruitful the Way is practiced This can be compared to the four seasons and all things It is what the principles follow and what is naturally reached The critic says I have respectfully heard that although the body and the spirit are different from each other they are mutually benecial You  have already compared the spirit in the body to re in rewood Firewood has no intention to make re and re has no frame of mind to deposit itself into rewood Therefore they can collaborate endlessly It is not that the re of this rewood moves to that rewood and becomes re Nevertheless in Buddhist doctrine on the basis that after the body is exhausted further dwells in that body the coming into and going out of the spirit and the body originate in evil acts and meritorious deeds Let me ask you If this body performs evil acts are evil acts done by the physical body or by the spirit If the body  is merely one of all things created by the Great Founder If the spirit  since the spirit does not act independently and is tied to something else namely the body your assertion that the body and spirit do not avail themselves of each other fails in this point I respond It is good to have this question so that I can explain the reason thoroughly I said that body and spirit do not avail themselves of each other by which I simply meant that they have different foundations Once they come into life in the endless transmigration of birth and death each of them pervades its function If this life is used in order to commit evil acts and perform meritorious deeds could it be possible that the spirit performs its function subtly by itself and does not do anything for the function of the body If this is so it would be intentional to be wise or ignorant It is not that neglects the function and mysteriously meets with a body It is logical that meets mysteriously with  and it is logical that the body is exhausted The spirit that was educated dwells in a body This is exactly so Since realization derives from the spirit delusion lies in the spirit as well The spirit follows the body Therefore there are the wise and the ignorant Being wise or ignorant is not the spirit but the spirit does something in the functioning of the body revolves in the three periods for a very long time beyond calculation Being wise or ignorant has no beginning and the potency of being wise or ignorant becomes evident midway through the course of the transmigration of birth and death The law of nonbeginning is profound while the potency midway is immature In the principles there is neither beginning nor end Once we have already been born or transformed continuously committing evil acts or performing meritorious deeds simply takes place naturally Socalled sagacity truly derives from the ears and eyes but the foundation of the ears and eyes is not sagacity What is called being wise or ignorant really ought to have a beginning If there is already being wise or ignorant nothing about the beginning can be known There is something but it cannot control things There is only nothing that is later able to become to what things return If there is a beginning it is impossible to have no end Only when there is nonbeginning do beginning and end become inexhaustible It is impossible  Based on the assumption that things have a beginning you cannot demand that the spirit is the same as things The Way of the Spirit is abstruse and subtle The ultimate principle is unspeakable As the principle is indicated indistinctly we come to understand it together If we seek for the foundation from the end we are apt to fail to catch its entirety If you were to continue to indulge in arguing and competing in compositions I know that you should cease The Hongfan chapter speaks of the foundation of living On this point it is the same as Buddhism As to the matter that in what the Buddha expounds there are many the Milky Way  this is simply because you indulge in daily matters Shangchen extremely transgressed against  but his descendants made the state prosperous Yan and Ran were virtuous but they were not well known because they died young The teaching of the  Duke of Zhou and Confucius is for matters of this world  If this reason is inferred it can be understood Let me extend the testimony in order to examine it in more detail Yao begat Danzhu who was stupid and evil who had no sense of order and who did not know benevolence and righteousness Gusou begat Shun When we trace the origin of birth was not a man who could raise  You however said that the Buddhist doctrine is unrealistic Shouldnt you realize  The New Discourse on Body and Spirit by Huan Junshan I Cheng  think that Junshan had never heard ākyamunis teaching but he already excerpted the simile of rewood and re when he discussed body and spirit In the later disputants statement there is a point that obscurely matches with  Accordingly I carry on here I saw that he was reading Laozis book He said Laozi preserved his health by a tranquil life without worldly desires and enjoyed his life for as long as several hundred years Today if we practice the way he did would we be able to prolong life and stay young I responded Even though are the same in form and name each has a different degree in their temperament nature and ability By loving cultivating and appropriately using our natures and abilities we can simply alleviate our aging It is just like if we take good care of clothes footwear and utensils they remain in good condition and last long Nearby I saw the embers of a axen torch that hung down one chi On the basis of this I then made the analogy  of the spirit dwelling in a body is similar to that of a re burning a torch If we are good at holding it and shifting its position in accordance with the ame it is possible that the re will not go out until the torch fuel is entirely consumed Without the torch no re can be produced by itself in emptiness Moreover it is impossible for the embers to burn after  When teeth fall out hair turns grey and muscles lose their vigor the spirit cannot invigorate  When completely cover the inside and outside of the body the vapor is exhausted and we die It is just as the ame and the torch come to an end together a man encounters an evil thing and is injured or falls ill If he does not receive treatment or meet a good doctor he will probably die an unnatural death If he dies  his muscles and bones are usually just like ames that are fanned by a strong wind which are not protected from  and which die out Once while sitting and drinking in my inner chamber at night I lit a axen torch In the midst of burning the torch was crushed and about to go out I closely inspected it by myself and found that the bark covered like a scab So I supported and shifted its position Furthermore no one can know the beginning of the time of his birth and even when he gets old he ought not to know when he will die either In ancient times when it was a peaceful world people were born under goodness and prosperity All were strong and enjoyed longevity They lived for about a hundred years and died When they died they looked like they were sleeping and suddenly left  It is just like fruits and grains that fully ripen and naturally fall  People of later ages are victimized by the vicious vapors of declining and waning Moreover they lose a timely marriage and work excessively and diligently despite hardships Hence even if they give birth both parents and children are impaired and their bones muscles blood and breath are not strong enough Therefore many people die of misfortune that shortens their  life or while still young in midlife When they fall ill they may suffer from pain sadness and worry and later they pass away Therefore we sigh we hate death and we consider it to be a great  If they have a long life only coveting prot and still seek to prolong their life they are deluded and do not understand  Someone criticized this When the body and spirit are compared to a torch and re it appears that there is a parallel point but I am afraid that there is not The reason human skin and esh are healed spontaneously when they are ayed or injured is that the blood and breath circulate When the axen torch is damaged although it burns it cannot completely recover its original force Hence grow with the spiritual breath If the torch is unable to recover by itself this is probably what is considered different  Why do you assert that are the same I responded A re begins from the edge  but the spiritual vapor of a human being is within the body Even if it moves from the exterior toward the interior assuredly it is not necessary to go in from an edge This is similar to a redhot charcoal re This is the same as the case where the human blood and breath stimulate the growth of skin and esh When we look at that some parts become ashes and other parts become embers Why is it impossible to compare this to  On another night I was talking with Boshi sitting face to face burning the oil of a lamp Since the oil in the lamp was exhausted and the wick was bare the light was going out Then showing this to Boshi I said Human aging is also like the bare the lamp Furthermore I spoke of the matter of the axen torch that I previously  Boshi said When the lamp and the torch burn out we must add oil or switch to a torch When a man becomes old he should quickly pour blood and breath in his body in order to sustain his life I responded A man has already received a body and formed himself This is just like holding that lamp or torch When the lamp and torch are exhausted how can they change themselves since they have been exhausted That which quickly pours blood and breath in a human body in order to sustain its life is Heaven If Heaven is able to do well for human beings and ll up their bodies with blood and breath and strengthen their muscles and bones then their bodies and spirits become vigorous even to the extremities and they live for a long time It is just as a ame lasts a short or long time according to the quality of the oil or the length of the torch Just by collecting nearby oil in order to soak the tip of  or shifting the position of the main part of a torch in order to make the ame stable their brightness can be recovered Now regarding the preservation of our health we may be able to replace a lost tooth dye gray hair black or regain lustrous skin and face just as in the case of collecting oil or shifting a torch Since intelligent people are aware that it is difcult to seek  they do not trouble themselves about that Ignorant people are deluded and hope to gain the power to add oil or replace a torch Therefore they are anxious and restless Moreover trees plants and the ve kinds of grains spring up on the earth by the vapor of yin and yang and produce fruits and seeds when they mature The fruits and seeds go back into the earth and are later reborn This is compared to human beings birds beasts and insects all are born through the union of male and female When they are born they grow up when they grow up they become old and when they are  old they die It is similar to the changes of the four seasons To attempt to change its nature and seek to practice a peculiar way are done only by those who are deluded and who do not understand  The Discourse on Why ramaṇas Do Not Bow to the Sovereign by Dharma Teacher yuan a During the reign of Emperor Cheng and of Emperor Kang of the Jin dynasty Chariot and Horse General Yu Bing had doubts about why śramaṇas treat the emperor as equal to themselves without regard to formalities claried the reason and Cavalry General He responded to this Later in the Yuanxing era  DefenderinChief Lord Huan agreed with  but he thought that Yus argument was not complete Even though the Buddhas edication is endlessly vast and infers the world beyond the visual and aural senses respect is considered to be its foundation I assume that what they aspire for differ but this does not mean that respect should be abolished In the Laozi  princes are considered equal to the three great elements  When why they are considered so important entirely lies in that they support to grow and to move smoothly how could they be referred to be equal to the two polarities only for the reason that sages are on the throne As the Book of Changes says The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called life to make life all over the country and arrange all things lies in sovereigns Therefore we respect the throne and we are gloriously courteous to it The reason śramaṇas are born in succession and live with supports is also that they are every day under the government ordinance  How could it be that enjoy the virtue and abandon courtesy  or benet from kindness but reject paying respect to them At that time many people of distinction both in and out of the government responded  Although their statements did not awaken of that time they all made good points generally consisted only of what these people expressed from their hearts and truth was hidden by feelings Consequently this caused the supreme monks robes to be damaged by earthly affairs The mind that brightly aspires gave way to human customs It is sad This is precisely a cause for the case that The world and the Way were lost to each other or the bad luck that happens every thousand years I am deeply afraid that the Great Dharma is going to ruin and I am impressed with that Not to forget that previous lessons are  Hence I wrote a discourse of ve sections in which I actually expressed my humble intention How could it be said that  which is as deep as a gully needs my humble statement that is as powerless as the morning dew Generally there are four different classes for those who have renounced the world In propagating the teaching and educating the people their achievement is equivalent to that of sovereigns and their edication concurrently takes the way of statecraft Regarding the time to awaken people there is no time not to do so ie people may be awakened anytime but according to the period in which Buddhism is encountered go out or retreat  Therefore following the rise and fall of the world the teaching simply becomes evident or not evident Let me briey mention here what among the issues can be discussed Those who remain householders and respectfully perform the Dharma are the people who obey the edication whose feelings are no different from those of people in general and whose lifestyle is the same as that of nonBuddhists Accordingly they have attachment to their families and relatives and offer courtesy to their rulers Courtesy and respect lie in the foundation  Consequently on the basis of the foundation the teaching is established When we the origin of we nd that the accomplishment is derived from the world of antiquity Therefore By teaching love on the basis of the feeling of intimacy we cause the people to become aware that there is spontaneous kindness One must inquire into their origins Therefore retribution for a sin is considered punishment and makes people fear and exercise caution for their later  Heaven is considered to be a noble reward and makes the people happy and has them perform acts for their later  These all clarify the teaching with the law of reward and retribution just as the shadow responds to the form and the sound  This is because if one treats oneself generously to maintain his life he sticks to the confrontation between himself and others and has confusion a nuisance roots deeply and he assuredly never misses maintaining his life He is addicted to worldly pleasures from which he is unable to escape by his own effort Accordingly for the teaching to restrict sensual desires the law of reward and retribution is expounded and taken as the limit of the teaching for lay Buddhists and nothing more than this is claried Since nothing more than this is claried  generally are very much the same in obeying the law  Therefore it is impossible for them to receive the virtue from their parents and the sovereign and yet fail to show courtesy toward them or to benet from the favor and yet reject paying respect to them Consequently who are delighted with the teaching style of ākyamuni always rst admire their parents and respect their sovereign When one abandons secular and takes the tonsure he must await the orders and take action following their orders If the sovereign and the parents have doubts about his determination to abandon secular life he should retreat ask their intentions and wait for the time when they have the same state of mind as his This is precisely the reason why Buddhism values supporting daily lives and helps the sovereign educate in the way of administration The purpose of statements made by the advocates appears to be the same  Therefore I have posited the distinction between Buddhist clergy and laypeople in order to clarify the purpose regarding the three most revered people I have briey narrated the tenor of Buddhist scriptures and pronounced my thoughts The teaching for them is to master that afiction is caused by having a body and that afiction is ended through not preserving the body to know that life after life is derived from receiving the principle of the mutation of birth and death in the phenomenal world and to seek the ultimate law of Nature through not following the principle of the mutation  Since they seek the ultimate law of Nature through not following the principle of the mutation  they do not value the support of a sovereign who manages the movement of  Since they bring an end to afiction through not preserving the body they do not esteem the advantage of welfare  This kind of person makes a vow for himself by taking the tonsure at the beginning and shows in changing his ordinary clothes  Accordingly in general all members of the clergy renounce the world in order to pursue their aspiration and they become different from  secular people in order to realize their way Since they become different from secular people their clothing code must not be the same as the secular rule Therefore they are able to save secular people who are drowning in the deep stream  uproot their deep roots for numerous kalpas profoundly lead to the ferry of the three vehicles and open widely the passes to the realms of heavenly beings and human beings If a person completes the virtue  the Buddhist Way diffuses over his family members of the six relations and the benet spreads to all people Even though are not placed in the rank of princes is already compatible with the fundamental way the emperor rules over the world and they can let the people be as they are Consequently while privately they oppose their familys valuable attachment to him and become a monk they do not go against lial piety While they may lack the courtesy of paying respect to the ruler in public they are not impolite  Judging from this point of view you know that if you go outside beyond the principle of the mutation in order to seek the ultimate law of Nature the principles is profound and the signicance is great It is clear that the Confucian benevolence spoken of  heaving a sigh is insignicant in merit and of little benet If that is the case are still ashamed to hear the teaching of those who are about to face toward Mount Ming ie those who aspire to the way of Laozi and Zhuangzi beyond the Confucian ethics and turn back How could be compared with those who follow the education and the wise men who receive a stipend without rendering any service and be the same as them in regard to showing lial piety and respect for their parents and the sovereign When we look to Laozis thought we nd he means that Heaven and Earth are considered to be great because of their attainment of the One  princes and kings are considered to be noble since they master to follow  since attain the One they are the foundation of myriad changes and since master to follow  they have the function of leading the movement of Heaven and Earth If this is so to clarify the ultimate law of Nature must lie in mastering the root  To master the root must be due to following the principle of the mutation of birth and death in the phenomenal world Therefore wise people of former times thought that is good It is impossible that many other theories differ from this If a theory that differs from these many theories is established it is unworthy of serious consideration Even though a large number of individuals are multifarious and there is a difference between the exquisite and the coarse generally speaking in the long run they are simply divided into those who have a mental function and those who do not Those who have give rise to a feeling for change and those who have no feeling for change Since they do not have a feeling for change when the change ends their life is completed those who give rise to a feeling for change respond to things and are moved Since this movement must be caused by the feeling their life does not cease Since their life does not cease the change becomes broader the form goes through the transmigration of birth and death more and more the feeling is more pentup and the afiction gets deeper Therefore a sutra states Nirvana is the state of no change The three realms of existence are the state of owing motion Thereby they are places full of sin and suffering When the change comes to an end causes and conditions cease eternally When is in owing motion we receive suffering forever How can this be claried When give rise to a feeling for change  the spirit is tied to its foundation and the intelligence becomes dull When is rmly blocked  one tries to preserve only himself and gets involved only in the state of motion Then the reins of mental function lose control the path to birth and death is daily opened and one just follows greed and clinging in the long ow  Consequently those who turn back to the origin and seek the ultimate law of Nature do not toil their spirits with life Those who transcend the mundane world do not trouble their life with feelings If we do not trouble our life with feelings it is possible to sever birth and death If we do not trouble our spirits with life it is possible that the spirit profoundly unites with  Since the spirit profoundly unites with the transcendental world it is called nirvana Even though Heaven and Earth are great for producing and raising all things they cannot make living creatures immortal Although princes and kings consider causing all beings to survive to be their achievement they cannot cause them all to be free of afiction Therefore in the previous discussion I said The teaching for Buddhist monks is to master that afiction is caused by having a body and that afiction is ended through not preserving the body to know that the operation of life after life is derived from receiving the principle of the mutation  and to seek the ultimate law of Nature through not following the principle of the mutation of birth and death The meaning lies in this Since the meaning lies herein this is why śramaṇas treat sovereigns as equal without regard to formalities they exalt their tasks they are not graced with a title of nobility from princes and kings and yet they benet from the kindness of  Section Four Looking at all previous histories from the time of the earlier emperors on those who occupy the throne and are united with the fundamental ways do not necessarily differ from each other in the original base Since the original base cannot be dual through all the generations ceremonial forms are the same and the system is consistent It is Only Heaven is great and Yao solely modeled after it If it is like this it is not the case that the wisdom has nothing to illuminate and there is nothing else that can be illuminated Inferring from this beyond what we see and hear is empty there is nothing to ascertain about it Since there is nothing to ascertain in reason  it can be clear what are the ultimate law of Nature and the ultimate Way  Today all śramaṇas do not understand the meaning beyond writings and they are puzzled about purpose that is beyond the teaching The mysterious ultimate law of Nature is vast and remote The Way of the Spirit is profound It can be sought with principles but it is difcult to crossexamine with phenomenal facts Once the Way of the Spirit is established as a teaching the teaching aims at following the fashion of the day The capacity according to varies between superiority and inferiority but regarding the fact that the teaching completes all things it lies in using the function of human receptivity of mysterious responsive activity conforming to peoples minds and leading their endowments When their endowments reach the utmost limits the knowledge stops at what it does not know and does not participate in more than that If this is so it is not that those who have mastered the ultimate Way do not comprehend both  they comprehend both but they simply cannot manage both simultaneously As for the statement  Outside the six conjunctions ie the limits of the world of humans literally the four cardinal directions plus zenith and nadir keeps it in mind but does not discuss  this does not mean that it is impossible to discuss it but that if the sage dares to discuss it he may be at variance  The statement The spring and autumn manages the affairs of the former kings designs debates these but does not criticize them does not mean that cannot criticize them but that if he criticizes he may to be confused These three manners ie not discussing not debating and not criticizing are all based on the fact that our visualauditory senses are limited and place restrictions on our behaviors and do not get involved in the world beyond our visualauditory senses If we seek the sages purport on this basis the ways inside and outside the limits of the world of humans can be united and claried I always think that the Buddhist and Confucian teachings and that the Tathāgata and Yao and Confucius secretly have a close relationship with each other even though they differ from each other in establishing their teaching Debating it in detail we will be able to see a main theme that the two ways are the same In reason there may be those that are united at the beginning and separate later and those that are separate at the beginning and become united later Those that are rst united and later separate are none other than all buddhas and tathāgatas while those who are rst separate and later united are successive sovereigns who have not mastered the ultimate Way they are in the group Why is this made clear A sutra says The Buddha mastered the spontaneous marvelous Dharma Following the revealed world extensively he becomes an immortal the wheelturning noble king a highranking ofcial a minister the most reverend priest or a monk As these he transforms and manifests himself everywhere No one among all the kings and virtuous men knows who he is This case is that of the socalled one that is rst united and later separate On the other hand there are who began a great enterprise but have not yet achieved the meritorious education Since the form varies what receive is uneven Some expect achievement after death or some have the testimony that responds to revealed in their lifetimes Among sage kings those who have accomplished the teaching based on are countless Even though is that of the stick and carrot and has no set rules their goals must converge This case is that of the socalled ones that are rst separate and later united If are now separate and later united those who intend to walk on a road leading everywhere will assuredly not limit themselves to only one passage If are united now and later separate it can be certainly known that the conclusive point of ākyamuni and that of Yao and Confucius are no different from each other Hence if we seek unication from separation we will know that must arrive at the same truth Those who only look at phenomena however do not understand that both are one Therefore they are merely confused by the many ways and surprised by their differences Observing on this basis the merit of the way of Heaven and Earth is nothing more than operating and producing and nourishing all things The virtue of emperors and kings is nothing more than following the way and helping it in nourishing and leading  If we compare them ie the merit of the way of Heaven and Earth and the virtue of emperors and kings with  the singularly transcendent teaching and the immutable religion it is already clear that it is doubtlessly impossible to talk about its superiority and inferiority in the same breath Section Five Hence those who want  to reach the utmost supremacy must go against the mutation of birth and death and seek the ultimate law of Nature Since in order to seek the ultimate law of Nature one does not go through following the mutation of birth and death you refer to successive sovereigns and equate with Buddhism and take the one who has mastered the utmost supremacy to be a sovereign who rules with expedients This is what your discussion entails You must believe that it is the Great Pervader When I inquire whether or not this conforms to reality it is not so in reason A person receiving the vapor  which lasts only for his lifetime When his life comes to an end he will vanish and return to nothing Even though the spirit is the most mysterious of a myriad of things this is originally just what yin and yang transform into By a transformation a person is born By another transformation a person dies Since is collected there is a beginning when it is dispersed there is an end Inferring from this basis it is assuredly known that spirit and body altogether transform they are originally not in different lines from each other the exquisite and the coarse are the same and are one unit from beginning to end When the body is complete the vapor is collected and the spirit comes to exist When the body is destroyed the vapor is dispersed and the function of the spirit extinguishes When the function of the spirit is extinguished it returns and becomes nothing What else could do this If are fundamentally different from each other these two different kinds of vapor are united in the law  In addition the spirit that dwells in the body is compared to a re that burns wood When is destroyed must be extinguished When the body is broken up the spirit is dispersed as it no longer has to rely on When the the wood is lost the re goes out as it no longer has to rely on It stands to reason Even if it is difcult to distinguish and clarify whether or not spirit and body are homogeneous it can be said that existence and nonexistence are certainly due to the collection and dispersion  The phrase collection and dispersion is the general term for the change of the vapor  and for birth and death of myriad transformations Accordingly the Zhuangzi says Human life is due to the collection of the vapor When is collected there is life When it is dispersed there is death If death and life are in the same category what is there to worry about The ancients who were good at speaking of the Way must have the idea that life and death are due to the collection and dispersion of the vapor If that is so the highest truth terminates in ones lifetime Whatever can the spirit be Since it is the highest exquisiteness it cannot be illustrated with the symbols  For that reason sages call it the most subtle  Even the most intelligent person cannot dene its form and cannot trace the very source of its profound purpose Nevertheless you the speaker have doubts based on general knowledge join many others  and make yourself confused Your false accusation is already serious You intend to talk about  This is to speak of an unspeakable matter Here within unspeakableness I would like to draw an outline of it for you The spirit perfectly complies with  being free from anything and it is extremely mysterious and indescribable It is moved by objects but since it is not a thing when the thing changes is not extinguished along with the thing Since we have feelings we can be moved by objects Since we have consciousness we can seek with the law Hence the nature varies In intelligence there are sharp and dull Therefore the function varies Carrying out the discussion inferring from this point of view ie that feeling and consciousness form the phenomenal world it is known that the  mutation is affected by feeling and the spirit is transmitted by the mutation  Feeling is the mother of the mutation  Spirit is the root of feeling For feeling there is the law of encountering objects while for spirit there is the function of moving into the unseen world The ancients who discussed the Way did not come to agreement  Let me cite and clarify the matter Zhuangzi in the chapter on the Great and Most Honored Master  pronounces profoundly that the great mass of Nature gives us life so that we toil and grants us death so that we can rest Moreover he says Life is considered as being a human Death is to return to the truth This is as they say to know that life is a great calamity and nonlife is considered as returning to the origin Wenzi quotes the words of the Yellow Emperor Although the body is dispersed the spirit does not change itself Based on the fact that it does not change itself takes advantage of change  Therefore its change is boundless Zhuangzi furthermore says When we take only the body of a human being  we still have joy This body undergoes myriad changes endlessly These words are as they say to know that human life is not exhausted only in one mutation  but follows the changes of various things and never returns  You the disputant have not examined theory that birth and death simultaneously exist side by side and you are deluded by the idea that is collected and dispersed just in one mutation  You do not think that in the Way of the Spirit there exist numinous beings that are more mysterious than anything else and you say that the exquisite vapor and the coarse vapor are equally exhausted How sad would this be The metaphor of re and wood is originally derived from a sacred scripture Since its transmission was lost the deep purport has not been investigated and the subtle words thereupon sank into a secular teaching It causes you to avail yourself of it and yet to have doubt If until now there was no chance for a leader who was awakened to the ultimate law of Nature we would not know that there was a pioneer who had insight into this law and the function that transmigrates in the unseen world would never reach until the end of their lives When feeling and consciousness move each other the mutation  which is endless That a re is passed on to rewood is similar to the spirit transmigrating to the body The former body is different from the latter so we realize the profound response between feeling and consciousness Deluded people see the body decay in one existence and then they think that the spirit feeling die together with  Now as you say in the discussion if spirit and body altogether transform  then begins from the original place of Heaven and ones disposition of being dull or intelligent is the same as the natural endowments he receives  If he receives it in the body since the disposition of being dull or intelligent is an attribute of the spirit everyone who has a body would all change and become spirit If he receives it in the spirit since the spirit is  not exhausted it would be passed on from spirit to spirit If this were the case then the Danzhu would have been as holy as his father Emperor Yao and Zhonghua would have had as a function of a spirit as Gusou If it is impossible we assuredly know that the unseen condition was apparently established in the longdistant past and the distinction of being intelligent or dull is destined before the body  Although the marvelous lathe ie the movement of Nature revolves well it still cannot change the character of Nature not to mention that of are more humble than  If we examine logically it is sublime language and has a verication We all gathered at the Dharma hall One day when I tried to study it again I found there is a certain point that I do not understand thoroughly You think that the śramaṇas system of deportment is a special regulation that differs from the secular system and which is an excellent tool for those who cultivate the Way therefore they certainly should omit making perfunctory respect to their sovereigns and parents My present question is this The reward and retribution for the next existence is profound and has not appeared responding to what one does in this existence Nevertheless they cause princes to offer various things to them and nobles who believe to kneel down to worship them Shouldnt they be censured for receiving kindness from others for doing nothing and being too hasty Should they not be chastised for beneting from others favors in vain just like a parasite I the host answered after awhile Let me take an example from familiar matters for you all wise people suppose here is someone who in order to announce an order he had received from the of that time is traveling to a remote place where the customs are different and where he needs nine different translators  The question is whether or not the king must provide him provisions and bestow upon him a carriage and clothes replied Yes he must do so I said We can discover the case from this example What kind of person is called a śramaṇa They are those who uncover the obscurity and confusion that cover common people who open the profound path to the world beyond the mutation  who together with the people of the world follow the way of forgetting both  who cause those who wish for loftiness to take the custom handed down  and who have those who rinse their mouths in a stream taste its surplus drops If they are so even though the great achievement has not yet been accomplished when we see the trace of their superb footsteps what we realize will indeed be magnanimous Needless to say do not match toil to practice the three kinds of acts  In addition although these people need their bodies they feel no inclination toward secular matters They consider that to receive offerings of the four things clothing food shelter and medicine is just as if a horsey or a mosquito were to y in front of them Then they were happy their minds at peace and they all left exclaiming This was the third year of the Yuanxing era of the Jin dynasty  the year of efeng At that time Emperor ed from the capital and the people were all anxious  Consequently based on  I set forth this discourse The Discourse on the ramaṇas Robe Worn with a Bared Shoulder by Dharma Teacher yuan Someone asked The śramaṇas robe that shows a bared right shoulder is derived from the Buddhas teaching Does it conform with decorum I answered Yes it does He asked  The three dynasties had different systems from each other and the decorum of each was not the same simple and embellished These changes are detailed in ancient books but Buddhism is excluded from those  All the debaters have doubts about this Since the three kings ie King Yu of Xia King Tang of Yin and King Wu of Zhou appeared in the world  changed in accordance with the times Seen from this basis what you the debaters maintain is simply the word regulated in the secular world  How do I know this is so Since the people there have been without changes their way has not been ruined The Buddha rose in the world and based on he established the teaching He claried that since are not evil they should bare the right shoulder Why is this It is because the noble and the humble must be distinguished in their ranking if virtuous ones are promoted by a high rank the mind to uphold the virtuous ones will arise Therefore śramaṇas go beyond fame and rank in order to cast away the times They withdraw and never desire to take the initiative  Moreover people are generally righthanded If we do not follow in doing something we will have difculties in everything If we commit a blunder although we may try to recover it is not easy even for the middle level of wise people  not to speak of those who are below this level Let me try to explain this The body consists of right and left and the function of principles consists of right and wrong To make up these two issues ie right and left in the body and right and wrong in principles each one avails itself of the foundation If the foundation is blocked and is not uprooted responds more and more to the demands of the phenomenal world Accordingly if the body and principles help each other the way will be subtle and clear if the customs of the world do not change to respond to the subtle is difcult to manage Once a robe with one shoulder bared is made known we will follow the practice in the body be moved with the principles and comprehend it in the mind Thus we control the vapor of following the nature and show the form of sincerity Hence by wearing a robe with one shoulder bared the Worldhonored One consolidated sincerity and shut off evil he made the name and reality well matched and he caused reverence and laxity to not mix with each other Later he opened the path to seek  He leads those who have been deluded for a long time to the true nature he causes the wise who are stranded in the world to not despair by thinking that they have no hope  and he causes those who hope to advance to not turn back by being deluded in the path If we act in this way our feeling is edied we earnestly approach the Buddhist Way and we do not tire of practicing  Our acts must follow  and our appearance unconsciously becomes respectful This is indeed the external cause that the Tathāgata invites people to Buddhism and his wonderful method to teach ordinary people and to lead  Nevertheless many debaters have not been instructed  and some people want to eliminate  How serious this problem is A Criticism by He  Zhennan I received your response to my question regarding the monks robe with one shoulder bared You connect the simplicity with primitive times take the body and principles from familiar matters distinguish respect from laxity and completely explain both sincerity and clothing Hence there are inside and outside in the phenomenal world and then can be established roughly or minutely according to them Regarding Li  ākyamuni the Duke of Zhou and Confucius there are those who live in the secular world and those who leave the secular world behind They are not the same in following their traditions but it is clear that there is no difference between one who goes against and one who follows it Therefore Laozi claries to make much use of the right side in military honors and unfortunate rites and in the Book of Rites it is instituted not to use the left in funeral rites Moreover the four immeasurable minds thoroughly refer to the most sincere mind to respect ones parents and the method of hunting called sanqu ie driving game from three directions leaving one side open for some to escape shows the benevolence of the kings acts When we examine in later ages the purpose of those events can be seen Would we rather entrust the utmost way of following to inauspicious incidents and show the auspicious sincerity in funeral rites The reason that Zheng state stripped off the upper garment is similar to the reason that Xi of Xu loaded a cofn on his carriage to meet the king of Chu state All these because they thought that if what they availed themselves of went against  they would assuredly receive an unexpected punishment Testifying from this where does following exist Therefore I act in accordance with what I have in my mind hoping you will explain more thoroughly and cause the inside and the outside to be united into one Dharma Teacher yuans Response I respectfully inquired into the purpose of your question I always think that in the teaching of the Way and the teaching on social relationships  or in ākyamuni the Duke of Zhou and Confucius although the method of establishing their teachings differs they secretly have a close relationship with each other The trace of the wonderful  however is hidden in daily use Consequently words of utmost were blocked  by scriptures of worldly teaching and this caused those who speak of Buddhism and Confucianism to regard them as separate from each other The reason I know this is so is that sages teach based on the idea of shing and shooting at game excepting those in nests to remove the extremities  to lessen taking excessive catches by hunting in accordance with the four seasons to not be stingy by letting some animals escape through the politeness of the method of hunting called sanqu and to be sure to wait until have grown to maturity before shing for them and hunting them with nets is thorough to benevolence for the grass at the roadside in remote ages Its tenor is a match for ākyamunis compassion If we think everything that exists in the world is equal to us and if we see ourselves as the same as others lls the arms and the ne hair of an animal are the same Would there be a difference between superior and inferior or would they not be all of a sort Accordingly in the Chinese sages teaching we progress in virtue along with  and make our duties clear for our superiors and parents The teachings in Buddhism and Confucianism can be understood from this viewpoint The Chinese sages intention can be known Therefore I would like to examine and express again my longcherished thoughts When we seek how one takes a body that goes through changes we nd that the body is molded by yin and yang and we receive a body that consists of a right side and a left side With the shift of day and night the change of life and death is explained In human feelings everyone is delighted with living and afraid of dying and everyone is fond of advancing but detests retreating For this reason former monarchs followed the peoples nature Comforming to the nature they distinguished the system for auspicious from that for inauspicious  and set up different positions the left and the right Hence on auspicious occasions the left is esteemed one is promoted in the peerage and he lives in comfort while on inauspicious occasions the right is honored and one expresses grief in order to dissolve the nature  These are all based on what we receive  We follow it in order to understand the teaching thoroughly respond to the changes of the times and recollect the virtue of our predecessors What people of the world value is nothing more than survival The concept that The system of decorum and clothing can be established roughly or minutely according to lies here ramaṇas are not like this They put their own persons last withdraw  and yet do not detest being humble If the time is not for them they are resigned to the humble position To govern oneself by being in the humble position is called modesty To stay in the low place which many people dislike is called obedience If we do not lose modesty and obedience as the base it is easy to accumulate the merit of reducing day by day  and it is possible to nd joy on the path to escape from and to attain  Hence lives in seclusion forgets glory and conducts himself contrary to the secular world Those who conduct themelves contrary to the secular world are different in reality from wise people who live in the world of ethical education even though they may resemble each other in appearance How can I clarify this Generally speaking those who have renounced the world understand thoroughly that suffering is caused by having a physical body and it can be stopped by not keeping the body They know that the endless succession of life after life is derived from receiving the mutation  and they can seek the ultimate law of Nature by not following that mutation Inferring from this point we certainly know that those who aspire to the ultimate stage do not trouble their spirit by living and those  who are far beyond worldly affairs do not trouble their life by feelings If we do not trouble our life by feelings life can be cut off In that case regarding the establishment of ceremonies for auspicious and inauspicious occasions admiring parents and serving a monarch as mentioned above these are probably just statements for a limited world They are what have not been out from the closed world from the beginning If we do not go out of the closed world we will just play with our writings and will not thoroughly understand the change If that is the case just remain in Confucianism and lose themselves in their lives they avail themselves of myriad changes and go against the ultimate law of Nature Seen from the position of utmost obedience couldnt it be said that this is contrary to  In Buddhist scriptures the destruction of life is considered to be a grave offense will be punished in Hell retribution meted out by the ofcials of Hell according to the laws of Hell is just as a shadow or a sound responds to its voice I have a doubt about this The substances of the four great elements are merely earth water re and wind They gather together and result in a physical body in which the spirit dwells life lodges and the mental function settles Certainly unlike the body there is no situation in which gets injured When is destroyed there is no harm to the spirit at all is simply as if the water and re between Heaven and Earth were destroyed Second question In the mind of all people affection and desire are luxuriant there is just the self and emotion and anxieties are deep If a persons reward or retribution is brought about based on feelings and if based on affections of the mind a response is produced in what does the reason of following nature have its foundation Answer I think these two issues are a key point of your questions and the pivot of your argument If the pivot is cleared myriad doubts will be dispelled in the same way It can be said that you clarify stagnant feelings in the realm beyond common knowledge and offer unexplored wonderful advocacy Nevertheless Buddhism is deep and profound It is hard to talk about its subtle language If we do not the fundamental purport wholly how can we speak of its profound purpose If the fundamental reason why human beings receive a body is claried through inferring from the nature of the four great elements they borrow different substances and pretend that the common form of the body is composed of them Life is just like a particle of dust that is easily brushed away So if we take advantage of the movement the coming and going of nature even though gather together or scatter  this has nothing to do with the self a large number of bodies temporarily dwelling in a great dream they are actually in the realm of existence but it is the same as if they were in the realm of nonexistence If one comprehends this reason in ones mind and yet other people have not understood it he feels sad about the fact that he alone has attained the truth without having achieved  he is grateful to have become awakened before others and gives rise to the thought of leading others to Buddhism If both others and  myself attain equally there is no opposition in our minds Then when we freely wield a sword we will unite ourselves with the Buddhist Way and observe with the tranquil mind even when we engage in battle all whom we encounter are friends since we have no opposition in our minds This is exactly when Mañjuśrī placed his hand on a sword the action is wrong but the principle is right and although he brandished his weapon all day long there was no place to catch the sword Why are sin and punishment brought into question If we return to this point ie that those who realize the Way go beyond reward or retribution and look for the fundamental  then we will be able to clarify reward and retribution  If we analyze from the phenomenal world and seek the ultimate law of Nature then we will be able to discuss sin and punishment  I will try to explain this more Ignorance is an abyss of delusion Greed and attachment is a mansion of numerous sufferings When these two work together supernatural effects occur in the unseen world Since greed and attachment wash away nature the four great elements unite and form a physical body When feelings stick to  there is subjective between good and evil When there is subjective between good and evil we feel a persistent attachment to life and birth never ceases Thereafter we sleep soundly in a great dream we are confused in the midst of delusions we suffer doubts in the long night of spiritual darkness and we cling to whatever exists Therefore loss and gain come alternately and weal and woe visit us one after another For accumulated evils disasters spontaneously come from Heaven for committed sins punishments in Hell This is precisely an inevitable destiny and it leaves no room for doubt Why is this so There is the foundation to understand it that is to say in the law spontaneously cope with each other in the unseen world Even though its sign is obscure when its force reaches an extreme point it becomes evident Consequently good and evil in the mind are considered to be a form and a voice and happiness and suffering as reward and retribution are considered to be the shadow and the sound  The foundation is moved by feelings and then the response spontaneously arises Would there be ofcials of Hell It is because mismanage and lose the way What achievement would even a Creator of the Universe have  In the purpose of your criticism you completely agree that earth water re and wind unite and form a physical body which is taken as a dwelling of the spirit This precisely means that there is a master in the house If your answer is no he does not the uniting of the four great elements is not due to the master of the house having been moved If lives without feelings since is not derived from the result of the master having been moved even if the spirit dwells in a physical body he has no feeling and no perception such as a pain or an itch If the spirit has no perception and the house has no pain or itchiness either when it makes contact with other things is like mowing grass or cutting trees If has feelings the uniting of the four great elements is due to the fact that the master was moved  If stays with feelings since is due to the fact that he was moved while the spirit dwells in the house it must have perception of pain or itchiness The spirit has perception and the house feels pain and itchiness as well When it makes contact with other things it certainly cannot be the same as water and re in the realm of nature Speaking from this basis spirit and body differ from each other but they change together They really differ from each other in the fact that the spirit is inside and is outside but they are joined together Except for those who reach the point of view  who could discern the relation between  If one cannot discern this simply the more time passes the more deluded he will be If the root of the blockage is not pulled out the way to continue to exist will become rmer If the origin of the persistent attachment is not removed to maintain will become deeper as well In the case where a thing goes athwart  the mind becomes deranged not to mention the case where the whole body is totally lost Even if one has exhausted happiness receives annoyance and has no regret in the mind since a form and a voice ie ones acts are set forth their shadow and sound spontaneously manifest There is nothing xed beforehand in reason but the laws come together and make it so Even though we want to escape from it how can we do so This is exactly to invite reward and retribution in accordance with feelings or to produce responses by availing oneself of being moved fundamentally differ from each other in the purpose of our arguments Therefore we are simply not the same in understanding  Question If since peoples feelings cling to life and cannot cause death then that feelings are brought into existence is simply derived from the delusion of egoistic attachment Could it be possible to conform to delusion and consider as the object of retribution Answer That phenomena arise is indeed derived from the mind Retribution must be derived from the phenomena that are derived from the mind Hence if we observe phenomena through retribution the phenomena can be changed Inferring from this point of view we know that the Sage claries the object of retribution based on delusion and obstruction it is not to conform to delusion and consider as the object of retribution  Why is this so It is difcult for people to be awakened and has indeed existed for a long time For this reason in Buddhism on the basis of what it is derived from the teaching is certainly given little by little Since the Buddha knows that longtime habits cannot be given up immediately he rst teaches that evil acts and meritorious deeds evil acts and meritorious deeds cannot be totally forgotten Therefore he has weigh the value of retribution and reward If they assess which is valuable meritorious deeds or evil acts they examine good and evil and place their mind  If they know good and evil are blocked by egoistic attachment they abandon the egoistic attachment and advance the ego a step further in order to lead other people to  If these two issues ie examining good and evil and advancing the ego a step further in order to lead others to salvation are concurrently developed nothing binds the feelings Accordingly we will be able to honor the talented and virtuous bear with all people be benevolent to ourselves give peace  and ponder far ahead the reward and retribution that are like shadow and sound in order to relieve ourselves from the delusive realm of transmigration of birth and death Once delusive feelings b are dispelled later words about the right path can be understood and the delement to maintain life can be cut off Since even wise people of the middle class cannot cut off the delement to maintain life how would people of ordinary intelligence be able to accomplish this The Discourse on Three Periods of Reward and Retribution  Composed for Those Who Doubt That There is No Testimony Corresponding to Good or Bad Conduct by Dharma Teacher yuan It is stated in a Buddhist scripture that there are three different periods in which actions mature and bring about  reward or retribution the rst is reward or retribution of the present existence the second is that of the next existence and the last is that of an existence after the next The reward or retribution of the present existence refers to that for a good or evil begun in ones present life is given to him in the present existence The reward or retribution of the next existence refers to that for a good or evil act begun in ones present life reward or retribution is given in ones next existence The reward or retribution of an existence after the next refers to that for a good or evil act begun in ones present life reward or retribution is given after the second the third the hundredth or the thousandth existence from the present existence There is no subject that receives reward or retribution other than the mind receiving must be due to the mind The mind has no xed task it is moved by phenomena and responds to them Since in its response there is  fast and slow reward or retribution comes early or later Even though there is variation in the time of its occurrence following what the mind encounters all reward and retribution respond to it Since there is variation in the strength of response of reward or retribution are not the same in relative gravity This is exactly natural reward and punishment and the outline of the three periods of reward or retribution Unless people have the allaround talent intelligence and brightness to reach the essential point  it is rare to be able to enter the gate  Let me try to discuss it Good and evil arise through being gradually fostered  When they are gradually reach an extreme they become evident There is theory on the nine grades of  Generally what is included in the nine grades is not what reward or retribution of the present existence regulates In that case it can be known that reward or retribution of the present existence is beyond the ordinary classication and the classications other than the nine grades are not what the three periods of reward or retribution regulate Why is this so If advantages and disadvantages intersect in front of ones eyes and suddenly a dispute arises between them the mechanics of the spirit spontaneously move and take action before thinking If it takes action before thinking reward or retribution responds to immediately This is one example of reward or retribution of the present existence that is beyond the theory of the nine grades Moreover the three kinds of acts are different from each other in essence but the same in regard to having xed  Since reward or retribution is xed people must receive them when the time comes This is not something we can remove by prayer or avoid through intellectual power When we infer and investigate this thoroughly the signicance is deep and the law is extensive Through this those who participate in Buddhism will be able to understand  There are people in the world who encounter misfortunes even though they accumulate good deeds and there are people who do evil deeds and yet are happy These are all cases in which the reward or retribution of the present existence has not yet come and the response to actions one took in a previous existence has begun to manifest Therefore it is said that a person of a good c omen encounters a disaster while someone of an unlucky omen meets happiness A suspicion regarding the ambiguous issue arises here Why is this so There are those who intend to lend a helping hand to the monarch aid the conditions of the times save other people model themselves after the lofty traces  and make up their minds to render a achievement and yet who collapse in the middle of a great enterprise and are suddenly visited by heavenly disasters or there are those who live leisurely in a gate made out of only one beam who have no attachment to the secular world who consider a peaceful walk to be a carriage who live in comfort and yet who encounter an undesirable fate unexpectedly when the destined time comes who come to associate with and fall into secular ways and secular customs and who become accustomed to  or there are those whose names are known to be among the top of the four subjects ie virtuous principles and practice ability of speech administrative talents and literary acquirements  who have mastered the heart of the Way who have perfect love who have realized benevolence and who develop virtue through cherishing the highest wholesomeness These are all cases in which people encountered misfortune while they were achieving merit or virtue and this causes to doubt  Since the fundamental reason is clear we should examine the responses Each response has its base  which moves by  The reason for this is that the situation in which stands close to is lurking behind  was settled a very long time ago and the auspicious omen declared in the unseen world secretly keeps recurring Therefore the vapor of happiness and the vapor of misfortune alternately shift while the six realms of existence Reward and retribution for good or evil acts appear to be very disordered but they work simultaneously This causes both the ignorant and the wise to be equally confused when the response manifests as phenomena to think that even though they accumulate good deeds there is no blessing or if they accumulate evil deeds there is no misfortune to be moved by the gods and yet grieve at misfortune and to lament that a heavenly disaster befalls a good person All think that Confucianism covers everything completely and there is no ultimate law of Nature above it and consequently this causes the Great Way to become obscured by the minor way If we consider the correct words to be good guidance and seek the true responding to the mind we must arrive at that there is no such case in the law of Nature When we trace back to what causes it according to secular books is considered to be concerned with a single lifetime anything beyond is not claried Since beyond has not been claried people who seek the law of Nature limit it to within the sensual world where they can see and hear This is because monarchs of former times conformed to the peoples minds understood their temperaments and took ears and eyes to be within a boundary  If we now combine the way for outside and the way for inside and seek the intention to propagate their teachings we will know that must be the same in the ultimate law and we will not be confused by many different paths and frightened at the differences between them If we can look into the three periods of reward and retribution and view the distinction between those who are distressed and those who go smoothly it will be entirely understandable why Confucius did not answer Zhong Yous question about serving spirits and Yan and Ran were like ignorant people when they faced their sage teacher  It is also because there is the law of dependent arising from causation and the law of existence arising from causation  Even though they were bright enough to be ready to enter the truth  they still did not forget benevolence bequeathed by monarchs of former times and they still considered the three periods of reward and retribution to be a beautiful garden or they made rapid progress to the lofty state of the mind and yet did not leave behind the abyss ie the realm of the three periods of reward and retribution From the viewpoint of inferring in this way it is known that if the guests beyond the secular world keep the wondrous Dharma in mind cleanse their minds in the profound gate  and obtain by inspiration at once they can transcend to the uppermost state  Speaking from this basis of why Buddhist scriptures surpasses Confucianism and is beyond of the nine philosophical schools  would it not be because to reach the essence through governing the spirit to train the mind to trace completely the very source of the change and to mirror myriad phenomena upon no phenomena  End of Fascicle Five of The Collection for the Propagation and Clarication The Discourse to Elucidate the Refutation by Shi Daoheng During the Yixi era of the Jin dynasty according to what I have heard the two wise men of the Jiangsu area Yuan and He got together to make a discourse on statecraft and satirized the current administration Even though I have not read this composition its intention seems to be to ridicule the pitfalls of the world modeling itself after the chapter on the Five Kinds of Vermin in the Han Feizi and they issued the Discourse on the Five Kinds of Perversions ramaṇas however took no action and it vulgarly lowers their case I am afraid that misleads people of the world and causes them to fall into vicious delusion eternally I cannot stand the extremity of resentfulness and regret Therefore I would like to elucidate this through a discussion in the form of the guest and the host There was a gentleman who was controlled by Confucianism in a metropolis in the east who crossquestioned an impudent rustic in an outoftheway place in the west He said I have heard that the Buddhist teaching is too deep to discuss on the basis of Confucianism the style of the teaching is too profound to determine by physical methods it is too rened nonaggressive simple and distinctive to get involved in with common knowledge it is too wondrous and beyond all existences and it cannot be fathomed by ordinary thought Consequently is often respectfully followed by sovereigns of the times and admired by the nobles and then the common people crowd together plight their faith chime in and quickly head  When we submerge in the true essence  even yi and qi would have no chance to surpass us in keeping integrity When we abandon glorious favor even Chaofu a recluse during the time of Emperor Yao and Xu You a philosopher during the time of Emperor Yao would have no chance to go beyond us in determination When we taste the profound tenet  even Yan and Ran would have no chance to join us in the practice When we leave behind disorder and impurity even song and qiao could not compare with us in purity If things are truly just as have been spoken there is no aw in reason Now however when I observe all śramaṇas they are all lacking in talent they live gregariously and they are vulgar They are confused and indistinguishable just like a river in which the water of the Jing River and the water of the Wei River have merged They are disordered just as if perfume and you  are put in the same box If the source of the water is clean the stream must be clear If the root is deep its branches and leaves will certainly be luxuriant Examining the speech and behavior  they are not logical all the time The reason I am surprised at them is precisely derived from these points Just as the Emperor forgot that he is intelligent and Ju Liang forgot that he has physical strength  they all became sages by being forged in a furnace and hammered or molded If the Way is not to be practiced in vain  the talent for propagating Buddhism must correspond to the capacity  Why is their behavior contemptible and ignoble while they have such lofty  They never weary in seeking  they are anxious lacking even temporary peaceful relaxation Some reclaim land and cultivate it in agriculture living like farmers Some peddle or engage in trade widely and compete with many others for prot Some conduct medical practice and hastily treat illness with cold or heat Some devise tactics with heretics in order to benet their occupation Some practice divination by directions and time and speak recklessly about the auspicious and the inauspicious Some go against the Way avail themselves of authority and skillfully curry favor of the time Some hoard and save to nourish themselves excessively Some talk idly pointing at their palms and consume the common peoples labors without moving from their own place Even if they may temporarily have a good point how much could it help to elevate their reputation They should abolish these by themselves and standardize their customs This is what people who lead a virtuous life detest deeply and what concerns greatly those who rule over the state Moreover there are ve kinds of perversions in the world and śramaṇas are included among them The basis to clarify this is that śramaṇas skillfully devise expedients and instigate ignorant secular people one way they do this is to give parables to induce the people and the other is to coerce them say If you do evil deeds you will certainly have misfortune for successive kalpas if you cultivate good deeds you will have eternal blessing They say that those who are sinful will be investigated in Hell and those who have merit will be helped by deities They earnestly encourage and lead the people exhorting them to do what they ordinarily cannot do They force people to improve themselves and urge them to do what they usually cannot do in the worst case one will reduce support for ones parents and the least bad case is that one will decrease the share for ones wife and children Buddhist temples run the gamut of splendor  make off with peoples valuable items they waste more money on useless things they use up others personal annual savings and they cause a deciency of funds for the state and military In vain they raise their voice for the future they pursue the formless before it shows a sign of manifestation When we listen to their statements they sound great and ll our ears When we look at their appearance they look aloof and ll our eyes if I seek evidence through examining actual facts I have not seen any indication of it at all Even though one tries to keep his shadow tied up he catches the wind I have no clue to  If you have good information on  please let me humbly receive it If I attain realization even for the time being I will be able to leave behind this hindrance eternally The host was disappointed  How vile your account is The reason it is impossible for a vulgar to talk about the Great Way is that he is hampered by the appearance of things and the reason it is impossible to explain the ultimate way to obscure people is that they adhere to the letter Here I will briey illustrate one corner for you so that you can think and return to the ultimate Way Now when the Sage teaches he gives the Dharma according to the capacity  Since there is a limit to peoples capacity to accept  edication is given gradually Conscience is recorded even if it is the tip of a hair A mean and stingy frame is omitted even if it is a hill or a ravine Even a very minor virtuous act becomes eternally ones own property When one begins turning over a bamboo basket of earth we cannot blame him he aims to achieve the making of a mountain When one is about to proceed to the ultimate state of mind  we cannot slander him the fact he ties up a sack On the other hand the reason a sea is said to be great is because there is no clamor for excessive cleanliness The reason the Way is said to be obscure in trace is because there is no astonishing appearance Loving parents and being affectionate to a wife and children are attachments of the people who possess a mind but śramaṇas abandon these just as they take off their shoes Fame social status wealth and carnal pleasure are what people of the world value but śramaṇas regard those things as being as insubstantial as rice bran It can be said that they put up with what people cannot leave behind This indicates the lofty and rened taste and the excellent task to propagate the Way yet you say that are dark  Isnt this a statement of very good appreciation Moreover if your ambition and actions are not the same as those of śramaṇas your course to proceed differs from  wheel tracks separate at the fork in the road Since you have not seen any outstanding points of śramaṇas is simply a natural consequence It is quite natural that the ancients often lamented that it is difcult people of talent The Zhou dynasty is known for having many scholars there were ten talented vassals who helped their monarch in administration During the halcyon days of Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun there were eight virtuous men and eight gentlemen  Confucius had three thousand  They were all of outstanding ability in the country but those who were selected to become procient in the four subjects were less than ten people The people admire their footsteps for a hundred generations and revere their great conduct for a thousand years With regard to śramaṇas they torture themselves as if their muscles were to drop off and cruelly treat themselves like worthless things Would this be the way widely practiced and a wellintentioned argument for gentlemen It can truly be said that such a person stoops to vulgar thought and has a base frame of mind Formerly a prime minister asked a guest It is commonly said that an owl eats its mother Could such a thing occur The guest replied I have heard only that a benevolent crow repays raising it The prime minister felt sorry and ashamed of his improper question Isnt your present state of mind similar to that of the prime minister who asked the question Gentlemen refrain from evildoing but cite his good points On the contrary what have you said Furthermore you said  sit easily stretching out their legs Since the forest and countryside are deserted they often have to worry about insurgents a bustling city they are often inicted with the carping criticism of companionship  If they stay in an inappropriate place they invite the nuisances of the secular world Even though the universe is vast they do not know where to stay When they take just a necessary amount of food they once again use it in accordance with the Dharma Even at the dignied time of sages there were people ie Boyi and Shuqi who starved to death at Mount Shouyang When the world was peaceful and brilliant people were promoted there was a man who went to the sea and died there What do you think  Furthermore since śramaṇas have no feathers on their bodies they cannot live being naked without clothes and since their bellies are not gourds they cannot let them hang down  without eating As long as their desire for food and clothes does not reach the extreme they must have support When the harvest is good they can take enough from the common people This is really not proper but it cannot be helped Consequently if a viper bites ones hand is cut off in order to save the body Even though one may make a living for himself if he does not seek anything he has nothing to obtain and if he seeks something it is not necessarily that he uses only one method  consider that everything within the boundary of desires is troublesome and vile and cause to not move recklessly Why is it said that they exceedingly attach  Long ago Bocheng reclaimed land and cultivated it by himself Ju and Ni ploughed side by side and practiced agriculture Tao Zhu engaged in trade and made a living Yuling irrigated a vegetable garden in order to support himself Cui Wen sold medicines and led a life of poverty Junping used to practice divination to augment his insufcent income Zhang Heng won fame for the art of divination and Ma Jun gave full display to his achievement ie making a compass chariot which shows the correct direction of marvelous skills These are simply people who went against the secular world and led the life of recluses Nevertheless it often happens that among śramaṇas those whose conduct surpasses that of many people and who feel shame at associating with fellows of a sort are numerous b You however have not mentioned anything  Why do you have a partial view You should view based on inspecting the facts You cannot make a discussion separating the present from the past and you cannot make an expression dividing a small number from the larger number The rare and the simple are noble while the numerous and the lewd are humble This is I am afraid not a discussion intended to seek the essence and examine a theorem The sage ie Confucius did not deceive us regarding the fact that there was one sincere person in a hamlet of ten families If you do something with two others they must serve you as your teachers When fragrant orchids are completely luxuriant if you were to collect pile up and burn them wouldnt this too be atrocious Among  there are spontaneously those whose virtue is profound and whose capacity is expected by the times Some are outstandingly pure and live uprightly some contemplate enter into subtlety and pacify their spirits in the absolute state  some expound subtle words clarify obscurity and explain problematic points and some diligently devote themselves to meritorious deeds exhort for the edication  and esteem wholesomeness Generally the foundation of the Buddhist monastic life lies in the day of tonsure when they all individually make an oath in mind and in words with genuine feelings and the highest sincerity Even though life and death are completely associated and the profound path is long and far must urge themselves  Then they will certainly be on the way leading to  the glory of the golden wheelturning king who rules the four continents of the world will be disregarded as if it were dust and dirt and the importance of akradevendra will be slighted as if it were rice bran Everyone is earnest and sincere at the beginning and has reasons of his own Naturally is neither suddenly attained at a stroke nor perfectly mastered How could there not be a minor fault in the course of time We cannot execute the entire Ji clan of the Zhou dynasty because of the fault made by Guan and Cai and we cannot exile all the men of the court because of the four villains who committed cruel conduct This is no different from the case where a man who suffers from head lice wants to burn his own head along with the lice or the case of a man who is troubled by irritation on his legs consequently wants to remove all the parts of his body below the hips Isnt this also excessive You said  is futile for the political affairs of the times and harmful to the study of the Way When those who propagate the Way benet the world common people act daily according to it yet have no knowledge of it Hence gan Mu slept peacefully and yet Wei state was well governed Gengsang was good at instructing and the people in the area of Mount Weilei submitted themselves to his virtue Presently in their lifetimes śramaṇas really have no achievements for which the government could assess value but they do in fact confer an invisible benet in the sphere beyond Confucianism Taking a familiar  to instruct the people through the ve precepts is not on the same level of the Six Classics  Taking profound  the hidden severity of the eight difculties is not equal to the criminal code to engage in evaluating sins according to the Buddhist canon is not the same as the laws and regulations  to speak of delusions with transcendental wisdom is not the same sense as do Laozi and Zhuangzi Regarding the cause and condition of purity and uprooting suffering in the elements to attain enlightenment  we occupy our thoughts but do not discuss anything In the teaching of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius the doctrine is put to the best use in appearance while in the highest level of the ultimate Dharma the issue about the spirit is simultaneously managed in detail Regarding quality and ranking cannot be spoken of in the same breath in terms of which is superior and which is inferior In ancient times Bei helped with the edication and assisted in governing the state by means of the Way the c border regions of the state were peaceful the people knew righteousness that they had to follow the harvest was rich and preserved and there was no disaster What do you mean by saying that does not benet  You said There are ve kinds of perversions in the world and śramaṇas account for one of them Generally what perversion means is to have no will to work to be unspeakably selfindulgent to gamble dissipating ones fortune and ruining ones family property to register ones name in the household register and yet wander around at all times of the year to neglect the duties of ofce while receiving pay and not be willing to apply ones mind to anything to hold the reins of government and be in power and yet exploit the common people to compete for promotion and incur both public and private losses or to indulge in violence vice and cruelty and engage in conspiracy All of these damage the teaching disturb order and greatly harm the customs of the world As a result of this Xun Yue wielded his pen and his discourse on the chivalrous came into existence Han Fei took up a brush and the composition on the Five Kinds of Vermin was completed It is therefore suitable to consider these to be perversions but isnt it a false accusation to apply this to śramaṇas Our nation is just now competing with the times of Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun for lofty virtue as the primary goal and trying to equal the Yin and Zhou dynasties in elegant education as the secondary goal When I examine what you think as regards managing and operating the government of the time you want to follow mean and crafty methods like those of the tiger and the wolf which were employed by the ruined Qin dynasty and you want to inherit the cruel and harmful pattern that Shangjun carried out They burned the books on the Chinese classics and buried Confucian scholars alive they did not have the discipline to rule the country By establishing very heavy taxation each household had no unbudgeted extra money and by setting up prohibitions for miscellaneous minor matters they treated the people as if they were bandits the world became unhappy and the people felt no interest in their lives caused the Ying family ie the royal family of the Qin dynasty to come to an end in three generations The disaster caused by the two men was ended during their lifetimes On the very day they were being punished they repented for the rst time that the law they had established was wrong Originally they wanted to pacify the country and make the people harmonious They did not expect that the bank they had built was too high and harsh and did not hold living space for themselves to the contrary of  What did they attain by their grief In understanding there are difculty and ease In practices there are shallowness and depth The causes to inspire beings to awaken differ They melodiously try to cause them to follow wholesomeness This is precisely a key phrase in the use of schemes and power and a bridge for a marvelous salvation It really does not mean to induce and coerce the people You said  those who are sinful will be investigated in Hell and those who have merit will be helped by deities All wholesomeness belongs to those who possess virtue and who are the most sincere There will be good fortune advantage in every respect Furthermore it is said that if those who do what is not good in darkness and secrecy spirits will inict the punishment Wouldnt this mean to be investigated in Hell and helped by deities Regarding reward or retribution for good or evil there are indeed testimonies in Buddhist scriptures I will not enumerate them here Buddhist temples run the gamut of splendor This is due to families who make good deeds  they merely expend their wealth in order a to prepare for future help and they use up simply because they are making longrange plans for themselves It does not seem that deities are delighted with the splendor and that all monks wish for delicious food This is compared to when a farmer sows seed he is keen in selecting seeds in order to reap goodquality grain or when a carpenter makes a building he hopes to choose good timber when seeking the adornments of the building Therefore in agricultural operations it is necessary to plant in fertile soil and in selecting a site for a residence it is important to choose high and dry ground Hence we know that the three revered ones are elds of merit for sentient beings and it is said that making offerings to them simply results in merit in the course of cultivating oneself You said  make off with peoples valuable items they waste more money on useless things To extensively confer benets to others and love without distinction are great virtues of benevolent people To respect and adorn the ancestral temple is the most sincere heart showing lial piety and respect  Since in the worldly teaching things are like this in the Way things are like this as well Things are increased by being diminished If we do something we must obtain  Moreover the wealth of this transitory is just like impure soil but to give it graciously is a marvelous faculty It is compared to the case that even a boat made of decayed wood is essential for ferrying people over  Why is this seen as a waste of money To intend to sit upright viewing nature  or to hope for comfort in silence with ones arms folded is similar to wishing to cut wood without an ax or hoping to feel full without eating If one does not lead a virtuous life that is his own problem Why is it necessary to cover the common peoples ears and eyes and conceal the great virtue of the world You have already drunk poison and now you want to poison others Why are you so cruel It can be said that you ruin yourself entrap others and cause everyone to suffer from disasters Therefore for the blind the deaf and the dumb there is the disaster of being in a place without sight or sound for the completion of one whole kalpa and as retribution to Devadatta there is the experience of suffering in Avīci Hell Isnt this also a gross fault There is a saying that when a ranking ofcial who is quite stingy and whose mouth is swollen faces the blue sea since he cannot drink the seawater because of his swollen mouth he just holds his stomach This truly refers to you Even though one tries to keep his shadow tied up he catches the wind I have no clue to understanding them To disorder truth by using sophistry is something that the great sages lament since the people did not recognize it is a precious stone and thought that he was trying to deceive them Bian He wept bitterly Nevertheless the subtle purpose is delicate and those who master it reach the Way is lofty and simple and those who comprehend it attain employs deep competence and functions as a bridge for ruined or drowned people to cross over to  The excellence of the b teaching is always on a level to that of the time when the Buddha resided in this world and the edication has spread boundlessly Hence akradevendra and the king of the Brahmā Heaven realized the deep purpose and reverted to sincerity Emperors and kings hope for the profound belief and consign themselves  The eight kinds of gods and demigods take the spiritual edication and reform themselves The common people come in a hurry to observe the real deportment Since is lofty it is not the same as Confucianism the teaching for the secular world and since it is so solemn it is the profound path to transcend the secular world Nevertheless since the fence is steep and high it is seldom that one can pass through the gate and since the house is dark and deep it is rare for people to enter its rooms Therefore the Way saves those who are completely sunk in  but the doctrine is at variance with this The virtue envelops all endlessly but the fact is at a distance from this Even though the sun and moon ride in the sky a blind man is not able to see the brightness Even if thunder shakes the earth a deaf man is unable to hear the rumbling Whose fault is this In ancient times King Mucalinda recovered his eyesight as the rst disciple  Subhadra listened to as his last disciple What sin causes you to be so unfortunate as to harbor only suspicion throughout your life Compared to what many people feel sad about your case is the biggest problem Hereupon withdrew in a hesitant manner He was in low spirits and disoriented After a while he said I have just heard the doctrine of the Great Way which completely follows in a continuous line from ancient times to the present which greatly establishes the law of cause and condition and which probes into the very point of principles and completely understands every nature It can be said that one traces things to their beginning understands them to their end and returns to life I have really been asleep at a standstill for the long night  Now fortunately I have heard your discussion My delements have been dispersed and my doubts have been scattered I have awakened all of a sudden as if I had opened the layers of clouds and seen the bright sun or as if I had taken off something that had covered me and realized true wisdom I am truly not intelligent but I will respectfully follow the excellent teaching The Discourse to Rectify the Two Teachings by Ming Zhengjun There is a Daoist monk who composed the Discourse on the NonChinese and the Chinese Since I am afraid that the Sage will be falsely accused and I would like to clarify the goals of Buddhism and Daoism I will rst explain the phrases from two scriptures that the Daoist monk cited and correct  The Discourse states As was napping Laozi availed of the essence of the sun and entered into Māyās mouth At midnight on the eighth day of the fourth month of the next year he cut right armpit open and was born He landed on the earth and took seven steps forward Then he raised his hand and pointed to the sky saying Holy am I alone throughout Heaven and Earth The three realms of c existence are full of suffering How could we be happy Thereupon the Buddhist Way arose This event is found in the Inner Section of the Mysterious and Sublime  which is an authentic scripture composed during the Han dynasty not a farfetched book I corrected this saying The Daoist purpose of this is based on Laozis scripture of two  The explanation about the mysterious and sublime is provided in seven chapters of Zhuangzi and to attain the One and master the void thoroughly There is nothing to hear regarding the wonders of the transformation of a body Peng a legendary ofcial who was said to have lived eight hundred years is equal in life span to a child who dies prematurely I have never seen that this text advocates immortality Therefore those who are in harmony with Heaven do not engage in changing normal ways and they are content with their time and place themselves in order If availed of the essence of the sun entered into mouth cut right armpit open there is discrepancy between the time and the event Absurd statements made during the Qin and Han dynasties extend to Wei and Jin times How can you say that it is an authentic scripture The Discourse states It is said in Buddhist scriptures that it has already been an immeasurably long time since the time the Buddha attained buddhahood or that once the leader of the circle of Confucian scholars the most reverend priest of the country or a monk These are all derived from actual Buddhist scriptures not expedient talks I corrected this saying The foundation of Buddhism takes root in clarifying the ultimate teaching and regarding the issue of three periods past present and future there is nothing that can testify to it in secular ways Nevertheless at the point where the exquisite and the profound meet there are internally signs of meditation and wisdom When there is a reaction between condition and sensation the law of causation has nothing wrong externally ākyamuni gave the very fundamental cry of truth and claried the goal to which the Way of the Spirit leads Consequently to train ones essential and to examine the function of ones intelligence are not the merit of preserving ones righteousness Salvation in the Way lies in neglecting the physical body and what is valued is not to complete life Since living life is not valued what merit is there in keeping existing things In the tranquil state of complete extinction  there is the regular course of the Way comes out of nonbeginning and enters into nonending This is the teaching that regards as  The Discourse states The tenets of the two teachings ie Buddhism and Daoism are as if a tally are matched I corrected this saying Since the Buddha explains the three periods completely complies with all things boundlessly Laozi only nourishes our physical body and his teaching dampens enthusiasm to the utmost Therefore in the teaching that is conned to issues about the physical body does not discuss life in the other world The Duke of Zhou Confucius Laozi and Zhuangzi are truly teachers of emperors and kings but they cannot provide testimony for the opinion we formerly read Daoism is precisely Buddhism Buddhism is none other than Daoism I corrected this saying Since there is a difference between the teachings just as there is between a square and a circle how could we see them as the same Those who follow Buddhism can rmly weigh Laozi but how can those who learn Laozi take it to be the same as the Buddha Some clarify the Five Classics and some spread the three vehicles and They teach Chinese people in the Chinese language and edify nonChinese in their native languages In addition it states Buddhism and Daoism are equal in universally edifying but there is a difference between the Chinese and the nonChinese  I corrected these saying He who is quietly inspired and attains thorough understanding must do everything smoothly By a single voice the Buddha lets receive awakening complying with each of their species Would the teaching of the three vehicles be necessary to edify the nonChinese Why does the Chinese way require strict adherence to the teaching of the Five Classics In emptying ones mind and exerting oneself in accordance with affections of his mind there is no difference between Chinese people and nonChinese How could differences in customs contradict the Sage  There are differences in the way to follow a tradition Therefore the gentleman makes achievements beautifully just as the leopards spots become more beautiful  and the peoples culture is rst reformed Zhuan Sun received an instruction  and lost his determination to learn about the Yin dynasty Regarding the virtue of Emperor Shun and Emperor Wu  Yao abdicated the throne  and expelled from the throne by force of arms and made a different statute Sages of later generations had achievements Could there be a boundary between Chinese people and the nonChinese Moreover is it necessary to adhere to the national dress in thinking through the ultimate teaching Therefore when we link to unchangeable sorts of things our delusion becomes deep and our actions are stymied Since water and land differ from each other there are methods of sending things to a distant place The example of the boat and the carriage cannot be considered well done Moreover the one who carved a mark on the side of his boat to indicate the place where he dropped his sword into water and Daoist monks like the one who waited by the stump where he previously had caught a hare in the hope that other hares would come by that spot assuredly show two points to which we are led The Discourse says  abandon their wives and children in token of a minor degree and discontinue their ancestor worship in token of a major degree go against virtue and offend the order and yet they have been unaware of this Moreover it states To maintain completely ones body and to abide by ancestor worship are in the teaching to continue wholesomeness To damage ones physical form and change ones family name are in the learning to cut off evil What should be valued in the ultimate principle of the universe is the Way and what should be despised in phenomena is secularity I corrected this saying Now takes rejecting ancestor worship as offending order they  retain desires and expand politeness Secularity is not necessarily despised To damage ones physical form and change ones family name to cut off evil are despicable from the Confucian viewpoint but their way is not necessarily noble He turns the noble and the humble upside down and falsely makes selfsatised talk He vainly wishes to be a vermin and drowns in ordinary views How could he expect the fundamental principle in the words of the Sage  The Discourse states In Buddhism it is called right and true  while in Daoism it is called right and One  The term One means to return to nondeath and the term true means to meet nonarising I corrected this  Princes and kings attain the One and become the head of the world He does not talk about the transformation of becoming a Transcendent Since The one who does not lose when he dies is of longevity he does not discuss the issue of nondeath The Great Way has already been obscured and small comprehensions of the mind have risen one after another How true this saying is All those who make false accusations and deceptions and who are too arrogant intend to look for sages words in order to illicitly make up for their faults The Daoist teaching today merely takes long life to be a belief and immortality to be the main goal Alchemy golden elixir eating clouds taking jade as food mysteriously ying up sprouting wings or exuviating to ascend to Heaven deliverance through the corpse and transformation are the methods with which they entrust themselves when we try to verify these things no such things can be seen after all Furthermore claims that if one does not ascend to immortals he will become a ghost after he dies or he will be summoned and appointed an ofcer of Heaven according to his original merit Even though these are greatly against the worthy writings left by Laozi and Zhuangzi in the fundamental principles they still have nothing wrong in the worldly teaching If one loses desires directs his course to wholesomeness avails himself of edication goes at will and forgets the purpose of multiplying endlessly truth results in absurdity but does not throw a normal into disorder Regarding like Zhang and Ge  all of them additionally concocted supernatural transformation to educate the common people they concocted weird accounts and misled the people of the world Moreover they have gradually expanded  Then they quote Buddhism which is far away  and try to testify that consists of forgeries Their argument is confused and there is no model of scholarship on which they base  When we examine against the meanings of texts we cannot nd anything similar They cause the true and the absurd to be mixed up people who wish for awakening to be deluded eternally and no one to be able to dispute it You are already fully aware that the Buddha and Laozi are right but you have not yet encountered a ferry  Now I would like to briey explain a corner and cause you to have selfintrospection The two teachings possess both the study of the truth and the examination of the mind Therefore can avail themselves of all states of things whenever they encounter them The teaching of Laozi consists of moral training statecraft cutting off and abandoning the honor of high rank and things to rectify their nature It takes the absolute vacancy as the foundation and softness and meekness as the function This is why scholars truly admire even the branch stream and why the teaching exists Why do they take up the issues that deication has no set pattern of beneting the world and of immortality As for collecting clouds sprouting wings or exuviating to ascend as a Transcendent changing the spirit and tracing to the very source of the numinous being these are from a teaching of a different vapor which was created through mending and accumulating that were formerly completed Therefore although there are records of strange matters what are called the principles do not follow them When we investigate supernatural accomplishments we reach all things accordingly the large are extraordinary auspicious cases such as a female kylin or a male phoenix and the small is the transformation of sparrows or pheasants Once we have received a physical body we wish for learning So Yan and Confucius are contiguous to each other in their ways and they are close to the apex of natural endowments and learnedness If we indeed admire the mysterious trace and yet stop it or if we desire to follow and yet there is nothing to follow to be contented with our fate is not reckless delement Therefore Confucius esteemed to know the decrees and he certainly had something he did not say Boyang left behind strangeness and honor and he rmly abided by wuwei In accomplishing the Way and attaining things there is the origin that we realize in each of them Actions manifest in ones previous existence but you seek merit through forcing yourself to learn A deeprooted practice is accomplished habitually but you perversely long for absurd desires and change them to the highest priority If Yan state yet desires Yue state  what could make his desire come true Therefore in learning we rst nd what learned and then learn it in order to accomplish it To do what can be done is to do what can be achieved In order to study and clarify about the people the teaching was established in the middle of Heaven This is the profundity in managing the affairs of the secular world and the ultimate of Confucius and Laozi To do what has not happened to complete the function of intelligence to trace to the very source of causality to share reason among living creatures who are different from each other to have a thorough of falsehood and return to truth and the authentic supernatural accomplishments all the greatness of Buddhism Hereupon the Buddha precisely claries the ultimate law of Nature Those who stick to life are blocked and those who clarify the ultimate law of Nature reach it Nevertheless if one quietly rests in the right path even if he is blocked he is not deluded If he actively follows the ultimate law of Nature he will reach reason and illuminate the ultimate Way Therefore people of virtue certainly esteem to complete the pure nature given by Heaven and seek the Way by themselves They respect the foundation help understand thoroughly and return the merit to the four great elements If one does not try to do things that are not so abides by the teaching and maintains the constant Way he can learn the purity of the teachings of Confucius and Laozi He searches the stream of the teaching looks into the origin and considers life to be dust and poison When accumulated merits are revealed and the important comes the essence of Buddhism is clear in our actions Consequently if in learning we nd what learned it is possible to support all the people and the teaching is revered in the world If actions become clear in the doing of them we will exterminate delements return to the stream  and go far away from heavenly and human beings Anything beyond this point has probably not been known When one is inspired he is successful in understanding thoroughly When we come across traces of the teachings we may nd that they become different from each other This is comparable to the case where although the music was not handed down we are not far from the mystery of the Five Thearchs or the case where although the ceremony was not transmitted the holiness of the Three Augusts is not suspended The times of the Three Augusts and the Five Thearchs were different Therefore their customs were not the same They belonged to different ages I see that Daoist monks ght Buddhist monks Confucianists Mohists and that Buddhist monks judge the rights or wrongs of Daoist monks and vice versa Once upon a time there was a wild goose that ew in the Way of Heaven Since it was far it was difcult to see clearly The people of Yue thought the goose was a wild duck while the people of Chu thought it was a swallow is simply due to people lived in either Yue or Chu You may wholeheartedly follow in the footprints of the Buddha without disgracing the foundation of Daoism A bird cries mournfully when it is going to die A man speaks good words when he is approaching the end of his life Recently my disease has worsened and my vitality has weakened In this condition I how many times I can breathe while my spirit stays  If I do not stitch  it drifts away I would like to make my lingering intention of the afterlife the rules of conduct for my brothers and nieces Now I am reporting this to you gentlemen Response to Zhangs Letter Together with Questions to Zhang I Zhou Shan Shanci wrote back to you Shaozi and stated I Zhou Yong bow to you with my head to the ground When I respectfully examine the same foundation there is something to measure your lofty mind Even though I know the primary to which the Way of the Spirit returns in addition to Buddhism the principle of Confucianism is magnanimous This teaching has gradually spread  It is not that there is not anything perverse in the teaching In its basic principle simplicity there is something respectable I just have held these thoughts in mind and have not yet expressed them In any system there is order and disorder and we cannot make a mistake in distinguishing the similarities from the differences We should make a conclusion in written form Discerning the intention of your writing you said that are fundamentally the same It appears that is not I think It has been my longcherished desire to put in order some of my thoughts on this point Fortunately in the light of your opinion I would like to try to articulate my view together with you I look forward to hearing your profound instruction In the Discourse on the Way to Reach the Origin you say Daoism and Buddhism are not dual in the nal consequence both teachings aim toward tranquility and stability and they are the same in their foundation When we come across traces of the teachings we may nd that they become different from each other Zhou says You mention in your discussion that they are the same in their foundation Please let me ask you What is the meaning of the foundation to which you refer here Wouldnt it be that those who speak of Daoism consider the twochapter text to be primary and those who speak of Buddhism should take prajñā to be the ultimate law of Nature The reason why the twochapter text is esteemed is that the signicance reaches the absolute vacancy at the extreme point With prajñā one observes that the extremity of the spiritual function is the Dharmanature Even though the absolute vacancy and the Dharmanature are the same in respect to tranquility they differ from each other in the purport of the way to position tranquility As for your statement in the discussion  are not dual in the nal consequence do you mean that settle in the absolute vacancy or that they are not dual in the Dharmanature If there is another foundation please tell me about it in detail If are not different from each other I wish to hear your explanation of why they are not In the Discourse on the Way to Reach the Origin you say that The times were different Therefore their customs were not the same Hence their righteousness varied I see that Daoist monks ght Buddhist monks Confucianists Mohists and that Buddhist monks judge the rights or wrongs of Daoist monks and vice versa Once upon a time there was a wild goose that ew in the Way of Heaven Since it was far it was difcult to see clearly The people of Yue thought the goose was a wild duck while the people of Chu thought it was a swallow is simply due to people lived in either Yue or Chu Therefore their customs were not the same This means that Buddhism is different from Daoism Hence their righteousness varied refers to the Daoist teaching being separate from the Buddhist  This means only that the foundation in which you believe is just one a wild goose If you run about busily Buddhism and Daoism you will have neither of them In your lofty examination you have not been aware of what you are following in order to discern the foundation Is there any purpose in doing so If you still take hold of the two teachings and position their foundations I am afraid that ghting and judging will just begin and you will not be able to pass good judgment on anything If we survey equally the origin of teaching on the basis of the two teachings the origin of each teaching always reveals itself along with the teaching itself We should put on a deerskin cap and hold a staff with rings just as a hermit does and see in a leisurely manner If the origin in which are well matched is correct and the traces that separated are wrong the functions of the two traces should be all removed Why do you go in the direction to soar in the essence  while diligently engaged only in Buddhism concentrate your vapor hold the One fast in your embrace and yet have no respect for Daoism Your words are deep and your purpose is profound I hope to hear your later account  In the Discourse on the Way to Reach the Origin you say You may wholeheartedly follow in the footprints of the Buddha without disgracing the foundation of Daoism Zhou says You wholeheartedly follow in the footprints of the Buddha without disgracing the foundation of Daoism Do you think that they are one in the foundation and differ in their later development or are they different both in the foundation and in later development Since I wish to thoroughly inquire about this or that and investigate exhaustively issues related to the principles I cannot help but to ask you  The Second Letter Given to Zhou with Answers to His Questions I Zhang Rong say Since I have still been unable to forget myself I have attachment to my family I do not want to cause my mind to be deserted day and night like the former capitol and what I have troubled with throughout my life to run wild For that reason I created this Family Law in order to regulate the family If Buddhism and Daoism are not employed by what means would my family be regulated Therefore I try to postpone my last day depending on my vital breath and to extend my life span relying on animation I truly wanted you to give me a wonderful opinion Sure enough you wrote back in this way and gave me your thoughts clever views and correct analysis Since you have given me your thoughts I now speak for you Zhou says You mention in your discussion that they are the same in their foundation Please let me ask you What is the meaning of the foundation to which you refer here I respond to Zhou The nature of the mind is the capability to know The way of morality is what can be known If one has the capability to know and yet he does not know what can be known this does not mean that he has the capability to know If there is what can be known and yet it is not known by one who has the capability to know it is not what can be known Hence we see that one who has the capability to know must go to the way and what can be known must know what it goes to Nevertheless an ordinary person trembles with feeling disturbs the function of intelligence stirs up desires agitates the spirit drives his sharpness out and clouds the function of recognition Therefore the mind goes in the wrong direction and ows downward and the function of intelligence separates from the way  As to Boyang  giving undivided attention to the breath and bringing it to the utmost degree of pliancy staying in the void to let the animation act at will putting the restless at ease and holding all together in one embrace one stays put as if frozen and understands tranquility thoroughly If you want to have Boyang not be tranquil how could this be possible If you would have him be tranquil and not anchored in the Way how could this be possible either Now that it is tranquil and has two spirits the spirits are tranquil and there are two ways I have never heard this Consequently at the nal point it is one Nevertheless an ordinary person whose nature is restless and too hasty and whose appearance is wild is unable to widely practice further I hope you may become free from all thoughts and hold the pearl  Hence although there are ve people who are categorized as a Thearch the spirit is always one There are three people who have the title August but the Way is not more than one This is why I straighten rope Zhou says Wouldnt it be that those who speak of Daoism consider the twochapter text to be primary and those who speak of Buddhism should take prajñā to be the ultimate law of Nature The reason why the twochapter text is esteemed is that the signicance reaches the absolute vacancy at the extreme point With prajñā one observes that the extremity of  the spiritual function is the Dharmanature Even though the absolute vacancy and the Dharmanature are the same in respect to tranquility they differ from each other in the purport of the way to position tranquility I respond to Zhou Even though the Dharmanature seeks emptiness by means of is precisely form in the phenomenal world the absolute vacancy actually extends the meaning beyond the phenomenal world When I ascend to this state  I do not see a Buddhist and a Daoist Since what people sense varies it is hard to come to an agreement in responding to things When they adhere to each other they are already profound Hence the old man in Ku ie Laozi concealed precisely form for the time being he followed what exists without agitating the feeling and he respected what does not exist and imbued the mind with what it follows Things having been hidden away the people then wish for nonexistence Since it is possible that the wind from the west rose in the daytime and reached the essence of the south  wouldnt it be possible to dream of the spirit of China while asleep at night If you think that Laozi did not accomplish anything about nonexistence I do not expect you to grasp the meaning If you think that accomplished something about nonexistence and yet did not accomplish anything about existence what you understand differs from what I expect If you have doubt because Laozi accomplished something about existence and yet did not clarify it in his teaching why do Buddhists who accomplished something make the traces high At such a time if you think that Buddhists had better make the traces high sometimes this is comparable to the case where Laozi made the traces high occasionally Therefore their customs were not the same This means that Buddhism is different from Daoism Hence their righteousness varied refers to the Daoist teaching being separate from the Buddhist  The trace is assuredly so Why do you extend your effort to take the teaching if you have attained the foundation  b Zhou says If we survey equally the origin of teaching on the basis of the two teachings the origin of each teaching always reveals itself along with the teaching itself I respond to Zhou You are correct indeed why they formerly competed I respond to Zhou The two states of Yu and Rui had legal struggles over farmland but this is something with which King Wen did not have to be concerned Even if the natural jade is broken into pieces in order to put an end to a ght over the jade is this particularly respectful Moreover we are ghting for a wild goose at night but you recklessly have a wild duck and swallow ght each other This means to put a deerskin cap on the head in vain and to hold a staff with rings in the hand to fabricate oneself Why do you go in the direction to soar in the essence  while diligently engaged only in Buddhism concentrate your vapor hold the One fast in your embrace and yet have no respect for Daoism I respond to Zhou The movements of the mind responding to eternal objects are diverse and ones feelings are various Although I do not y with a ap of the wings up to the four fruits  you have no doubt that I abide in Buddhism Even though I do not y with a ap of the wings up to the ve supernatural powers  what regret would I have in abiding in Daoism Moreover the honorable sacredness should be the foundation I do not worry about the traces Would I now change to which I am ying Do you think that they are one in the foundation and differ in their later development or are they different both in the foundation and in later development I respond to Zhou I originally blend a hundred sages together and throw them equally into the One the ultimate Recently I discussed this in the Discourse on the Way to Reach the Origin  but Confucianism was not included in the discussion Now you carry Confucianism to an extreme and you precisely want to arrange Confucianism in a line and encircle Daoism Therefore you act as if you rst prick up your ears think of causing a war and then plan to mount a surprise attack on the heavenly city at night but I am afraid that it is difcult to ascend there it is too precipitous for you to ascend there Even if I see the troops going out I will not see them return I have already said that a hundred sages are thrown into the same place Why would I allow that differ both in the foundation and in later development Moreover you oppose me with all your force displaying your intelligence and bravery willfully As for what can move the mind and to what we consign our mind what other than truth can be our teacher Edications in China and foreign countries are what the practitioners dedicate but if we distinguish between these ie edications in China and foreign countries and make our choice clear this causes me to become discontented and lost You virtuously wish to say it and I have not stopped speaking either That is to say I will send this letter to examine furthermore You say in the Discourse on the Way to Reach the Origin of the Two Teachings Even though the Dharmanature seeks emptiness by means of is precisely form  the absolute vacancy actually extends the meaning beyond the c phenomenal world and Hence the old man in Ku concealed precisely form for the time being he followed what exists without agitating the feeling and he respected what does not exist and imbued the mind with what it follows Zhou says It is true that in Ku concealed precisely form but I am afraid that in this statement you have not reached precisely form If you make a pretext of being able to conceal  those who can conceal it are many and probably there is not only the man from Li village  When existence is existence people perceive existence When nonexistence is nonexistence people recognize nonexistence Laozi dealt with existence and wrote on nonexistence but he did not go beyond this boundary This is what I stated in my shallow discussion the Discourse on Three Sects  If we select and run about busily no one has been able to go beyond that level In Buddhism the reason why worldlymindedness is left behind in theory and why the rules governing the rhythm of words go against the norm is probably because precisely form means that form in the phenomenal world is not existence In going against the Way or being drowned in secular  here is the trouble Since the trouble is due to adhering to existence and the nature of existence has not been claried the school that recties existence follows and respects the art of nonexistence If the nature of existence is not clear even though this is a big problem whom do we go against in esteeming tranquility This is why the Daoist teaching is added to the propagation of the teaching and why I said in my previous letter that the teaching of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi is truly majestic All the former opinions by Wang and He indicate that Laozi is no match for the sage  If was just as he is presented in this view could not inuence ākyamunis teaching This is the established dogma found in Buddhist scripture Sometimes he appears even in the guise of a prime minister or a wealthy man Why wouldnt Laozis life be only one track  It is only because we have not known the depth of observation and the level of nobility This is all because the great brightness has not been opened and for the time being we have received only one side  When the sun or moon comes out the torch should be put out Since no remaining is expounded many interim will spontaneously cease You still want to resist in order to save the brightness even under the sun and moon and to clarify that this and the sun and moon are of common origin You already worship the sun and moon in your mind and you have no intention of disgracing the foundation of the torch but you have not been aware of what the foundation of this torch is Is it a name or reality If you say you want it to be reality the sun and moon are reality This means that the issue comes to an end with a buddha and you do not understand the Way In the purport of the Discourse on the Way to Reach the Origin of the Two Teachings whom does the origin reach the animation halts in the void  a Zhou says You state that Even though the Dharmanature seeks emptiness by means of is precisely form  the absolute vacancy actually extends the meaning beyond the phenomenal world I think personally that Laozi and ākyamuni came about the same time and took charge of their own elds and about their spheres there is nothing better than statement of this If we ascend to the state of Laozis mind Laozi differs from ākyamuni if we experience ākyamunis intentions we will know that ākyamuni differs from Laozi Since the spirits are in tranquility they are two and there are two ways Even though you had not heard this before I have previously heard it If this is so the animation that halts in the void is spontaneously void it is in the void that you mentioned and to direct oneself joyfully is not the way I mean either Regarding the statement In regard to brushing off the dust of the mind by oneself  You say in the Discourse on the Way to Reach the Origin of the Two Teachings If you want to have Boyang not be tranquil how could this be possible If you would have him be tranquil and not anchored in the Way how could this be possible either Zhou says Your statement is very apt but I am still worried that have not yet reached the utmost mastery In what you say here you hit the mark in regard to the tranquility of the spirit but you miss the point as to the void of things If you think that tranquility is tranquility and you do not mean that it is the ultimate tranquility and if you think that the animation is animation and you do not say it is the complete animation I approve of this You say in the Discourse on the Way to Reach the Origin of the Two Teachings If you think that Laozi did not accomplish anything about nonexistence I do not expect you to grasp the meaning If you think that accomplished something about nonexistence and yet did not accomplish anything about existence what you understand differs from what I expect Zhou says As for the accomplishments about existence and nonexistence if we do not the apex we are not ready to know them In knowing nonexistence and knowing existence I approve of the Daoist  Daoist words however simply do not reach the state of neither existence nor nonexistence Neither existence nor nonexistence is what Three Sects has in store If you reverence additional thought you may just take a look at  You say in the Discourse on the Way to Reach the Origin of the Two Teachings If it is not a wild duck it is a swallow The trace is assuredly so This is why I see the derivation of Daoism as the same as that of Buddhism Zhou says Regarding your statement When I see with my own eyes the Way exists there and In grasping the meaning there is the foundation I think that the true meaning of the Dharmanature is precisely this state of mind Buddhism has it but what you obtained does not have the reason The foundation of what you see with your own eyes exists in the traces of the teaching As for the true nature of all dharmas Laozis does not have the purpose Even if you try to see the lofty nature with your own eyes there is no such thing in Laozis traces b Your discussion says You may wholeheartedly follow in the footprints of the Buddha without disgracing the foundation of Daoism On what point must we bring no disgrace If when you search the traces of Daoists you think you nd that its derivation is the same as that of Buddhism the real meaning of the ultimate truth can be found in writings Do we ascertain in the Dao chapter or do we encounter it in the De chapter If both chapters are not what you follow and you attain the profound in your mind this is naturally your subjective point of view and it is simply the third  following Laozi and ākyamuni This is not what I dare to bring up here You say in the Discourse on the Way to Reach the Origin of the Two Teachings The two states of Yu and Rui had legal struggles over farmland but this is something with which King Wen did not have to be concerned This means to put a deerskin cap on the head in vain and to hold a staff with rings in the hand to fabricate oneself You said that The Dharmanature seeks emptiness by means of the doctrine that emptiness is precisely form If this is so the Dharmanature is perfect Now here is a man who talks about the Dharmanature holding a staff with rings I will ght against you You serenely lean against a thorny tree in ancient times a place where lawsuits would be heard and pass judgment after hearing the argument between them You say that neither of them is good and you comment that one of them wears a deerskin cap on his head in vain and the other holds a staff with rings in his hand in order to fabricate himself You say in the Discourse on the Way to Reach the Origin of the Two Teachings Although I do not y with a ap of the wings up to the four fruits  you have no doubt that I abide in Buddhism Even though I do not y with a ap of the wings up to the ve supernatural powers what regret would I have in abiding in Daoism Zhou says You said I do not y with a ap of the wings up to the four fruits but still you diligently abide in Buddhism You said I do not y with a ap of the wings up to the ve supernatural powers Why do you cast aside only the Daoist trace Since this is illogical I have just made such a complaint You say in the Discourse on the Way to Reach the Origin of the Two Teachings You precisely want to arrange Confucianism in a line and encircle Daoism Since I have doubts about this lack I inquired about it to you Is it possible that he directs himself joyfully while cultivating in Confucianism Even though this is not the main point of our discussion if I speak freely I must come to  Therefore I omitted their later writings My purpose is to keep to the main point of the discussion Letter to the Daoist Gu by Xie Zhenzhi I Xie Zhenzhi say I respectfully read the Discourse on the NonChinese and the Chinese You argue and discuss the origin in detail on the basis of the scriptures of these two teachings I painstakingly explore what is profound but I have nothing at all on which to rely I however have tried to take a lesson and read it more than three times but my humble doubts have not yet been resolved At the beginning of the Discourse you state that the Buddha is precisely Laozi and Laozi is none other than the Buddha Moreover you compare the transformation of becoming a Transcendent with nirvana and see that longevity is equal to no death in Buddhism Accordingly you refer to the worldly instructions in order to tally them with the profound teaching  When I collect examples of these words they probably appear equal to  In addition you say that the foreign language used by Buddhists is similar to the noisy chirps of insects or birds and that it is not something we should follow Please let me try to speak about these issues The Duke of Zhou and Confucius took Confucianism and Mozis teaching as a model to be followed Laozi and Zhuangzi spoke about the teaching and claried a method to lead to  Moreover insects and birds are different species  The edication originally separates from the Way When we want to say something about this we must rst investigate the reasons Originally when a person participates in the two polarities ie Heaven and Earth this is called the three powers  How could the foreign country and China be divided in a place governed by the three powers Then we know that a person must be part of the human species and an animal must belong to groups of animals Let us seek in familiar matters The seven treasures are what people love Consequently Chinese and nonChinese people equally value them Since being respectful is what people honor people of the world are sincerely concerned with this Hence perfect marital relations were practiced in the four states not to mention the inuences of the great edication Wouldnt it then be diffused throughout the trichiliocosm Speaking on the basis of Buddhist scriptures you perhaps have heard that the Buddha appeared in the world He united all traditional teachings into one the world was placed in one orbit At the time ākyamuni was rst cultivating as a bodhisattva he extensively edied people Those who lived in that land when he attained buddhahood were granted special benevolences and favors and they were all reborn in our domain however have been deluded for a long time in birth and death they have followed and been imbued with secular customs they temporarily lose the right path and they simply have not been aware of the present enlightenment I think that the Sage looks down upon all with the wisdom of the three transcendental knowledges observes the faculties of each person and understands that vary from person to person Therefore he expounded the three vehicles and spread it First of all the true Way is only one and the Dharma is nondual too Now for the time being the three vehicles is expounded and there are different ways to guide  but the place to which all return is one Hence when traveled about gathered people and expounded the teaching those who attained awakening were as numerous as grains of sand In saving from drowning and delivering them from delusions there is nothing to surpass this teaching Therefore the boundless world including the present the future and the past is collectively here We know that the ninetyve schools are clearly not branches  At the beginning they said that their teaching is the same  but in the end they said that it is different  Consequently we know that what is the same at the beginning is not the same and what is different is in the end no different either Isnt this like absurdly beating an earthen pot and recklessly trying to harmonize with the basic sound huangzhong Wouldnt this be a deception Now we see that a bird sings in the world of birds and an animal roars in the world of beasts If we truly hold one of many sounds and feel that it is different from all other sounds we respond to it in a different manner In this case if the foreign country differs from China in the way to edify  why do you mix everything up if a boat it will be dried out and if a carriage it will be submerged can be compared to this case Propriety of the secular customs is the attenuated form of loyalty and good faith it is not the purity of the Way Those who cultivate the purity of the Way strive to go against secular customs When secular customs can be deed the Way can be pure It is difcult to defy secular customs Hence we ought to leave behind extremes In order to leave behind extremes you must rst take off the crown shave your head put on a Buddhist monks robe and abstain from a diet If we take off the crown we need no expense for worldly ornamentation When we shave the head we need not trouble with hairpins and combs When we put on a Buddhist monks robe we do not bother tailors to make our clothes When we abstain from a diet we stop thinking about our favorite foods Regarding writings and subtle books such as the Tripiṭaka and the four gama sutras they are exactly what Laozi said Those who devote themselves to learning from day to day to increase  How could this be what Chinese customs could create Moreover you say Buddhist scriptures are complicated and illustrious while Daoist scriptures are concise and profound Inferring from this this means that if are profound it is difcult to hope to study them intensively and to rely on them if they are illustrious it is easy to hope to seek them carefully if they are concise they must be insufcient in indicating the reasons and if they are complicated they are a collection of interesting points and there are many keys to the way  In the Buddhist teaching anything that has a form is considered to be illusory Therefore forget themselves in order to save sentient beings In the Daoist teaching ones self is considered to be true Hence take medicine and food in order to preserve their lives This is certainly impossible If we deeply realize that the three realms of existence are abodes for the long night of spiritual darkness and life is a master of the great dream we long for the Way to awakening Even if our body could be rened and we could live without death this originally differs from Laozis fundamental way and it is not the same as the Buddhist principle Why do you make such a statement The spirit dwells in a body similar to at an inn If we go to an inn why should we feel a persistent attachment to the eaves The perception of the sensory perception and the form of what can be formed are not the substance of sacredness Even the life spans of Yao and Confucius were less than a hundred years Hence from an eternal kalpa ago the spiritual intelligence has been puried and rened As the spiritual intelligence has been puried  its function severs existence and nonexistence it brilliantly transcends with the wisdom of the four phrases ie existence emptiness existence and emptiness and neither existence nor emptiness Furthermore those who carve a mark on the side of a boat ie Buddhist monks pray to a golden  while those who wait by the stump b harbor the hope to ascend to Heaven as a Transcendent sprouting wings Consequently practice the six pāramitās in the phenomenal world while are hindered by delusion and eat numinous mushrooms  When we seek some traces of the origins of two teachings ie Buddhism and Daoism there are different views the broad and the narrow and there is an apparent difference between superior and inferior They have entirely an intimate feeling of self it is not the universal great knowledge Then it is known that they can discern differences in the secular customs by the teachings brilliantly have arisen competing with each other It can be said that pointing to the trails made by an insect and considering them to be the Chinese written language invented by Cang  or like drinking the milk of a poisonous insect and thinking that it is claried butter This is very sad The Buddhist Way is vast and extensive The capacity of wisdom cannot be completely expressed It is difcult to survey the traces of responses by form When we analyze nonexistence even Mount Tai is exhausted in vain it scatters along with an autumn down We make use of the ten powers in order to destroy devils  and promote the four immeasurable minds in order to deliver secular people When we raise the Dharma torch of prajñā what dark place would we be unable to illuminate If we concentrate with the Dharma might of samādhi what distant place would we be unable to subdue Why should we doubt that is not effective in both the foreign country and in China The Second Letter Given to the Daoist Gu I Xie Zhenzhi address myself to you Thank you very much for your response and explanation I exhaustively examined the profound situation You already have harmonized smoothly Daoism and Buddhism and yet ākyamuni from Li just as separating the Jing River from the Wei River If we prolonged each by the addition of the proper lines then all events possible under the sky might have their representation They will accordingly become games or gambles  The more you explain about the Buddha the more obscure the exquisite purpose becomes When we decorate a shop counter in order to trade valuables we do not sell them on a bright night is like as says trying to erase your footprints by running around or trying to stop casting a shadow by jumping How could you avoid  According to on what your discourse is grounded you think that insects and birds are different species and that the nonChinese and the Chinese differ from each other in manners and customs I think that the three powers equally unite the human reason is one there are minor differences in secular teachings and the teaching of the Dharma is almost the same for nonChinese and Chinese The Grand Terminus is divided into the two polarities ie yin and yang which are intertwined in vain When the ve skandhas get together the body and consciousness unreasonably manifest Consciousness is formed on the basis of delements while the body arises from the condition of attachment and hindrance Before the time of Fuxi many people were basically c foolish Since they were basically foolish they lived in trees or dwelled in caves and drinking their blood and swallowing the hair and feathers Sovereign and subject father and son saw each other just as people of the northern tribes and those of Yue state saw each other They were still like beasts It was not the world into which Daoism was introduced and where love and justice had inuenced the people When the people became bogged down in desires and lost themselves in waves they thought to deliver themselves by clinging to a precipice When we deliver ourselves we pray for wholesomeness When we pray for wholesomeness sacredness responds to us What is sacredness It is what we communicate with through our receptivity to things Communicating is not selfcommunication and receptivity is not selfreceptivity either Receptivity is constantly on this side while communication comes always from that side Speaking from that side it is like a mirror hung in a lofty hall Speaking of this side all images coming back to this side Since the sacredness responded to that land  the voice spreads in this land  When we see the brightness of the sun and moon why do we have to borrow the observation of Li Zhu  When we hear wrathful thunder why do we have to have Ziye ie music master Kuang a blind musician of the Spring and Autumn period hear it Consequently it does not matter that different things such as the humble and the noble go with each other in the same way and in the difference between the two polarities of left and right there is no harm in natural relations Since there is no harm in natural relations clouds and practice the Dharma teaching The Way is one while form is dual The Way is truth and form is worldliness Since truth is still one worldliness is still dual We make a thorough investigation of duality to attain unity we ought to unify the law If we eliminate worldliness and return to truth we will certainly go against worldliness For this reason the Tathāgata established the model and made various teachings the same in the eternal past If Confucius and Laozi were the Buddha they would dim the light secretly lead  rectify their prejudice to deliver them establish benevolence create righteousness and conform to secular peoples feelings Hence maintain their bodies to be complete continue worship extend their kindness to their family members of the six relations attend to their health nourish their natures themselves and other things However while these are considered to be very good they are not considered to be perfect Probably this is for a limited system whip up their lagging  How is it possible to compare the Way with supreme enlightenment  and to compare the sages with ākyamuni When Buddhism is expounded clearly it has essential points and it is competent and extensive Since exquisite and those of coarse fathom it strongness and weakness agree with each other It is easy to draw a circle by using a pair of compasses but difcult to do this only by hand Daoist scriptures are simple and crude Many are composed in a farfetched manner Regarding scriptures such as the Wonderful Scripture of the Truth of the Numinous Jewel  adopted the Lotus Sutra for it to chew rocks and eat clouds It is not simply that their law cannot be followed it is also difcult to consider that their way is the same as that of Buddhists Yet to completely employ wuwei has not been able to remove existence The nine philosophical schools are even closer to what the teaching of the three vehicles of the Buddhist school leads to Since the nine philosophical schools are even closer to what the Buddhist teaching of the three vehicles leads to we attain motion and rest here The noumenal principle of meditative power is merely part of the teaching of the three  it is not the culmination Meditation sutras are subtle The characteristics of the objective world are exquisite and profound Even if we try to become united in truth with these it is still impossible to accomplish it Now you say The Way lies in wuwei and is simply to attain the One It lies in wuwei and is simply to attain the One means to commune with what is profound for a thousand years If one were to reject studying and rening his thought would this not be negligence How could it be a tentative method to lead to Daoism Examining respectfully what you said not only do you not understand Buddhism you do not understand Daoism either The profound Sage concealed himself  The long night drifts slowly Many stars shine brightly When the sun luminously rises and shines the lunar mansions rapidly disappear Round and square should be uniform for use as construction materials Even though they are different from each other as raw materials If one is solely deluded he is not awakened The bigheaded fellows are surprised that departs far away Even if a good grasscutter slights prajñā How could we censure transcendental wisdom End of Fascicle Six of The Collection for the Propagation and Clarication Critique of the Daoist Gus Discourse on the NonChinese and the Chinese by Zhu Zhaozhi AttendantinOrdinary I read your lofty talk on the nonChinese and the Chinese You discuss the two teachings and present the purposes of each of the scriptures deeply accords with what is profound and your wonderful words are virtuous and pleasant The distinct paths for all ages are united into one path in the present dynasty Questions and disputes for successive generations are happily today There are many people who are cleansed and comforted There is no discussion more benecial to the world than this This is because it is not understood that although there are two different tastes sweet and bitter they must be the same in nature in order to make a body Therefore Buddhists and Daoists attack each other and then strange doctrines arise are repeated and become complicated This causes quite a lot of harm is at the beginning just as rises in the sky and the light covers the outside of this world and yet in the end just as sets in an abyss the light is obscured and the brightness is lost If a spiritual guide loses himself many others are also lost Therefore I forget that I am shallow and ignorant and then lead and deliver  Now I will rst express my thoughts and later I will speak of what I nd regrettable I think that since it is right to follow the good as on the course of a stream it is not regrettable merely to go against traditional  So I send this to you for the time being in order to temporarily substitute it for a meeting b Since the sacred Way is void and tranquil it perfectly responds to anything with no set pattern because of its response with no set pattern it responds to everything Therefore if we inspect the mind from the point of sacredness originally there is no name in a myriad of understandings When things are spontaneously understood and named with the names they are considered to be evident Hence those who have complete intelligence are called ones of right perfect enlightenment  those who smoothly and thoroughly understand are called sages and what opens up the knowledge of the issues of things and accomplishes the undertakings is called the Way In this case a sage is merely the one of right perfect enlightenment and the one of right perfect enlightenment is nothing other than the Way You should understand this Why is it necessary to seek it in a distant place Nevertheless rules of propriety and the pure precepts have three hundred rules they are equal in number and there are equally three thousand deportment or formal manners  What may differ between lies only in the names Buddhism and Daoism and in their appearances A mastermind still considers the physical body to be like an inn  How would it be worthwhile for him to discuss the Chinese formal dress called gunmian What may be questioned lies only in the beginning of establishing teachings in which China and the nonChinese country differ from each other in their function It is proper to argue the point that present manners and customs are managed concurrently and will change according to the current of the times Now I will speak about this point In a sages instruction action is certainly based on the right order In the eastern country  where splendor is valued there is the Chinese formal dress called gunmian the formal manners of ceremonies and music rules for deportment and decorations such as full court dress a formal gown a crown and hairpins in order to propagate the way it is probably to lead to become close to  Since simplicity is valued in nonChinese manners and customs the people are instructed with extreme plainness a shaved head is a beautiful appearance clothing is made without cutting to shape emotions are calmed the intellectual function is opened and the spirit is expected to be free from anxiety and agitation for kalpas in order to develop the minds it is to recommend to keep away from  The Daoist teaching is to take transcendent elixirs called zhiying to eat clouds to take elixir to breathe in the Grand One  to exhale the old and to inhale the new The great is that the spirit ies  sprouting wings  The minor is that the body becomes light and strong and has no illness that is to say maintaining the body one can expect the efcacies All three teachings have one function of being moved by something and responding to it but this is not what I think is the culmination  This is tentatively called nonexistence How is it different from this Therefore from the time of the Han dynasty on simple customs have degenerated benevolence and righteousness have gradually declined the rules of the Great Way have not been transmitted studies of the Five Classics have declined even more great justice has already become perversely bad and sublime and profound words have vanished as well No one roams at the gate of many wonders  c deportment based on the golden mean is not observed the art of courtesy is already ruined Chinese ceremonial music falls as well manners and customs come to an end there is no division between sovereign and subject the authentic teaching has deteriorated and human ethics have become disordered Thereupon the sacred way completely governs all things and reaches distant lands as time goes by The profound edication was transmitted to the eastern land and granted benevolence to this world and kindness to sentient beings The essential signicance has been revived Consequently houses of sublime and profound words were built here and there and there are guests who chant the profound words all around This can be observed in reality it is not merely empty talk a series of vain words When begins to eat she feeds the baby tasty meat when becomes bored of the tasty meat she changes to tallow and honey and when is tired of tallow and honey she lets the whole body rest peacefully It is extremely benecial to the baby to be peaceful and comfortable both on the inside and on the outside isnt it Reason is just like this Nevertheless if one unrestrainedly slanders and recklessly separates it from Confucianism and Daoism he has not realized the center of the ring ie the absolute state beyond the judgment of right or wrong I cannot discuss  Correspondence exchanged between you two wise men pushes and swings me it is as powerful as breaking timber If we analyze it with reason would it be necessary to push and swing people with such powerful correspondence You began with the clear that Confucius and Laozi are the Buddha but at the conclusion of the writing your discussion is desultory Why Chinese government ofcials ceremonial robes and the manner of raising and kneeling on the ground are all types of Chinese deportment and slanderingly say that the worship of putting ones head on the Buddhas feet is just like when a fox squats down Why Chinese ceremonial dress and bowing by completely bending the body are respectful manners in the region near the imperial capital and increase humiliation by saying that the practice of kneeling with ones right knee on the ground is just like a crouching dog Let me ask you a question If Confucius is one of right perfect enlightenment and ākyamuni is one of wrong views I cannot tolerate to hear this talk If you approve of as one of rightness and truth for what reason do you despise and reproach him You have already lost the intention to stand in awe of the admonitions of sages Moreover you have forgotten the courtesy of not having ones own way This is the rst thing I nd regrettable Futhermore you say To maintain completely ones body and to abide by ancestor worship are in the teaching to continue wholesomeness To damage ones physical form and change ones family name are in the learning to cut off evil This means that son of Shangchen King Mu of Chu state who killed his father and usurped the throne would have had the achievement of carrying on wholesomeness  and that Rāhula who became a Buddhist monk would have had the determination to cut off evils Again you say  abandon their wives and children in token of a minor degree and discontinue their ancestor worship in token of a major degree The law of spiritall beings is obscure and vast it is difcult to clarify Therefore when Zilu asked a question  Confucius did not explain It must be because life and death belong to different paths and the condition of spirits are hard to understand Would it be because the sage was unable to explain it In fact was afraid that the wise would not be able to understand this You already accept that the spiritual edication was transmitted a to the east and yet you also say that took the tide with funeral services This is the third point I nd regrettable Moreover you say The direct teaching can promote modesty and suppleness  while the indirect teaching ie Buddhism can restrain arrogance and toughness I read this statement three times and it is egregiously disordered Since modesty and suppleness are easily contravened we should promote them harmoniously with the indirect  Since arrogance and toughness are difcult to edify we need to restrain them diligently with the direct  When we examine the mind and inspect these matters isnt this indeed the case If rice bran gets in your eye you cannot tell east from west If you are attached to your biased view you are confused about the meaning of an expression Your statement misses the mark This is the fourth point I nd regrettable In addition you say Since humble themselves only the intelligent advance and since the words of the Buddhist teaching promote  the ignorant vie with each other in moving forward Your statement about the words of the Daoist teaching is true It covers and carries all things It raises and educates all things that have a form Once the Buddhas voice sounds those who practice the four immeasurable minds are equally in line the three vehicles equally follow him obediently and heavenly beings and dragons altogether submit themselves to him Your statement The ignorant vie with each other in moving forward appears to be a false accusation as well Furthermore you say Buddhism is the way to destroy evils while Daoism is the way to give rise to wholesomeness Regarding the way to destroy evils I can nd no fault Stopping evils and performing good deeds are the reasons why teachings arise I have not understood about the way to give rise to wholesomeness Who has the way  If wholesomeness is already wholesomeness why is it necessary to give rise to it If wholesomeness is not wholesomeness it does not mean to give rise to wholesomeness Then the outward reason for giving rise to wholesomeness has no entrustment The Way is wholesomeness If it cannot shake off evils it is distorted as a teaching The Great Way is equally broad for all but you want to limit it  This is the sixth point I nd regrettable Moreover you say For those who are brutal and stubborn it is the best to be taught by the Buddha For those who are kind and gentle and who keep their minds free from preoccupation and open to receive  it is the utmost to follow the way To beat and bring a man who is brave and erce to submission and to have a man who is brutal and tyrannical become peaceful are really ākyamunis great achievements I am not against your bright purpose  Nevertheless the power of the Way is strong and brilliant and the merit of its edication reaches fardistant places makes the nature complete and preserves what exists continually There is nothing that is not placed under its favor You unconsciously fall into a persistent biased view Dont you realize that being narrowminded and inferior impedes the Way When I open and examine the heading of your Discourse I see that you rst admonish ones personal assumption but while making a statement and presenting a discussion you unconsciously change your mind and you have difculty in maintaining both your claim and nominal denition This is the seventh point I nd regrettable You say furthermore The eight represent all foreign scriptures of the western region and describe both extensive things and small things The Diamond Sutra consists of less than a thousand sentences There are minute teachings and detailed precepts  and ritual codes go into particulars as well This statement goes against reality This is the eighth point I nd regrettable Moreover you say Observing each country the nonChinese country is of a cruel nature while China is of a mild nature Let me ask you a question You unfoundedly think that is mild while is harsh This is the ninth point I nd regrettable Moreover you say One who plays the go game is wiser than one who travels around One who expounds and chants is better than one who makes quips and jokes Thinking this over the reasons why the rened taste could be transmitted and why the scriptures and writings were not abandoned are really due to to make people understand by expounding and chanting and to attain enlightenment through inquiring and seeking Therefore said Not thoroughly discussing what is learned is the thing that occasions me solicitude You however compare expounding and chanting Buddhist scriptures with making quips and jokes Let me ask you a question First of all you want to forget the words before you apprehend the ideas This is the tenth point I nd regrettable has these ten points that I nd regrettable I cannot resolve them myself I hope that you a gentleman will explain them further for me Xie had a criticism and a different view as well I have had a look at the correspondence between you and Xie  AttendantinOrdinary regarding the Discourse on the NonChinese and the Chinese in which you clarify the meaning that are united into one It can be said that they are concise detailed and rene discussions With regard to deeply honoring the decorations of Chinese ceremonial robes and crowns rejecting the simplicity of taking the tonsure stating that the manner of raising and kneeling on the ground is respectful and disgracing the manner of sitting like a squatting fox they conne the Chinese people and cut off their adoption of foreign methods Even though the metaphor of a boat and a carriage is skillful the feeling of impartiality and benevolence is not enough You already leveled the origin reach and meet but the way with which the tool entrusts itself is blocked In this case we only get a distant view of the awakening of the three vehicles in this land and the ferry of the six pāramitas is a long way off from us at the present point Those who open Buddhist scriptures and play with the doctrines are greatly disappointed and discontented Xie looks down on the Way of Transcendents and praises Buddhism he considers the art of sprouting wings and ascending to Heaven as a Transcendent to be a groundless doctrine and takes the assertion of becoming a Buddhist monk as following the authentic text It is as if one knows his ngers are ngers and does not know there is no difference from other peoples ngers Is this the reason to reach all aspects to grasp the meaning or the thought that are virtuously the same  I was gradually educated in the Dharma early in my life and later enjoyed the taste of Daoism I always think that respecting the emptiness and valuing the nothingness are the same in the ultimate purport Both a snare and a net are laid in principle there is no prejudice Each person should follow whichever teaching he can best understand and enter that way Why is it necessary to be able to inherit the emperors upper robe with the dragon gures and yet be unable to ride on precious stones I have to work a lot because of my poverty I am behind in my studies It has been more than ten years since I covered the boxes of my books and writings What I learned in my childhood and what I heard previously are now all forgotten I have spent years in idleness having a willful mind Every day I lament by myself through the long night Hence I am writing down my humble opinion exhausting my poor ability I hope you will again give instruction for me and give guidance on the points about which I am doubtful I Guangzhi bow with my head to the ground The Discourse says Raising a ceremonial tablet kneeling on the ground and bowing by completely bending the body are respectful manners in the region near the imperial capital while squatting like a fox and crouching like a dog are reverential manners in uncivilized places My question is this Regarding the point that each person attains what he is content with there is originally nothing with which to argue  The Discourse says Even if it is said that since the united point of the teachings is equal and that the teachings are interchangeable is it possible to wade across the river by carriage or travel on land by boat It is certainly impossible My question is this Teaching is intended to follow human feelings but human feelings are not a teaching Teaching has no xed pattern because human feelings are not unied What human feelings which are not unied proceed to varies In a prairie to a remote land why would we take that  Why is it impossible to use both forms of transportation both boat and carriage The Discourse says  is neither completely the same nor completely different abandon their wives and children in token of a minor degree and discontinue their ancestor worship in token of a major degree My question is this It is not a fault of being the same Would an ox used to plough a eld rather be forever released from sacricial use since it is useless for an ancestral temple If go against virtue and offend the order they should make no action Therefore having a simple meal and practicing the Way are not unfortunate signs and being in full dress and eating the bread of idleness are not the ways to cultivate the right  The Discourse says What should be valued in the ultimate principle of the universe is the Way and what should be despised in phenomena is  secularity If it is because of the Way the Way is originally one If it is because of secular  the secular customs of Chinese and nonChinese are completely different  My question is this Since the ultimate Way is void and comprehended it is honorable even without having a rank of nobility Since secular have nothing that is not stagnant they are humble even if they are not rejected The humble is unable to have no trouble The honored is naturally content with itself The sphere of secular troubles is also equal If the Way is one and troubles is equal what is good and what is bad Ie there is no distinction between good and bad Therefore they are all edication by sages When delusion is exhausted and intelligence arises oneself and others is spontaneously forgotten The Discourse says The teaching of nonarising is indirect while the teaching of immortality is direct The direct teaching can promote modesty and suppleness  while the indirect teaching can restrain arrogance and toughness My question is this Nonarising is precisely immortality and immortality is nothing other than nonarising The names differ but the contents are the same Is it possible to hold the distinction between the direct and the indirect If we separate the superior from the inferior because of the difference of their later development we should restrain toughness by the direct and promote suppleness by the indirect  Therefore Confucius said Since Qiu withdraws I urge him forward You is busy with other peoples affairs The Discourse says Buddhism is elegant and extensive while Daoism is simple and exquisite What is exquisite is not something in which clumsy people believe and what is extensive is not something that exquisite people can handle My question is this One who acquires extensive information and a retentive memory must go along with the mental function that is profound and broad If he sincerely cultivates good conduct he must follow the principles and reach the subtle  If his principles are exquisite he has nothing that is not exhausted in intelligence In that case what is exquisite and what is extensive are equally meritorious and mutually make use of each other The Discourse says The words of the Buddhist teaching are splendid and they promote  while the words of the Daoist teaching are sincere and cause to humble themselves Since the words of the Daoist teaching cause to humble themselves only the intelligent advance and since the words of the Buddhist teaching promote people to feel better the ignorant vie with each other in moving forward My question is this are splendid but they are not apart from the principles are sincere but they have not reached the void There is order in the relation between being molded and crafted If the teachings are aimed at those whose natural disposition is ignorant then not only the intelligent advance If certainly aimed at those who possess intelligence the ignorant are unable to go forward If both the intelligent and the ignorant can  why is it necessary to promote them to feel better or to humble themselves This is something about which you ought to make a further argument The Discourse says Buddhist scriptures are complicated and illustrious while Daoist scriptures are concise and profound Since are profound it is hard to discern the gate to the subtle  Since Buddhist scriptures are apparent it is easy to follow the road to true  If we follow true  we will not get lost on our way  home  If we discern the subtle  we will completely attain all thoughts My question is this Since are concise it is easy to follow them If are complicated it would be difcult to follow them logically How could you easily follow  If we follow true  we will not get lost on our way home We will be able to be led to the culmination of the Way Even though are not profound and concise we will spontaneously reach there deeply The Discourse says For those who are brutal and stubborn it is the best to be taught by the Buddha For those who are kind and gentle and who keep their minds free from preoccupation and open to receive  it is the utmost to follow Daoism My question is this Wrong views and the distortion of truth are what the Dharma does not allow Making other people happy means to be able to accept anything The meaning of to keep ones mind free from preoccupation and open to receive mysteriously matches the meaning of the Buddhist tenet to make other people happy and give up all attachments I do not know on what teaching brutal and stubborn people rely If you say that receive varies you are rather like the one who carved a mark on the side of his boat to indicate the place where he dropped his sword into the water How could there be a case in which Buddhism and Daoism tally with each other The Discourse says Buddhism is the way to destroy evils while Daoism is the way to give rise to wholesomeness Moreover we should not imitate the teaching of the western tribes with the nature of the Chinese people My question is this Your saying that is the way to give rise to wholesomeness is very good but your statement We should not imitate  is disgraceful  I am unconvinced Let me ask you a question about the nature of the Chinese people and the nature of the western tribesmen You consider the nature of the Chinese people to be purely good and that of the western tribesmen to be fundamentally evil If the nature of the western tribesmen was fundamentally evil how could it be broken by reason If was purely good what signicance would there be in giving rise to wholesomeness Therefore we know that if have evil which can be broken they have not left behind wholesomeness and if have wholesomeness which can arise they have not escaped from evil In that case wholesomeness and evil go together and mutually align as deep or shallow Accordingly the fact that Rāhula was benevolent and gentle is not the inuence of the light from the east  King Jie and the robber Zhi were erce and cruel was this caused by a concentration of the vapors of the west If the wholesomeness of this is different from the wholesomeness of that land of the western tribes and if the evil of that differs from the evil of this  in wholesomeness and evil the Chinese people and the western tribesmen would be essentially against each other could there then be a case where they reach the same point The Discourse says Regarding the manner of squatting and the incomprehensible foreign language that can be compared to the noisy chirping of insects and birds why is it worthy to imitate them My question is this Even though the respectful mind is developed through rites rites are not the same as the respectful mind Consequently when a ruler sets at ease and the people obey him the gems and silk are kept in a bamboo chest  When manners and customs are simple sincere and peaceful bells and drums are no longer sounded Moreover the use of bells and drums is not on the same level of that of the two polarities  probably because bells and drums are used as tentative expedients from necessity in order to rescue   If we return  we do not mind whether are the same as or different from  Now as for squatting like a fox and crouching like a dog who says are not respectful With respect one straightens his mind Who says are impolite Among groups of those who bear consciousness human beings show their nobility The nobility does not consist in language language lies in treasuring principles Therefore since the kylin and the male phoenix harbor benevolence in mind they are valued in sages books The chimpanzee can speak but he does not know principles If one sticks to language and removes principles this is not what the wise depend on Accordingly even the unchanging the elder Li is beyond the desire for fame Vimalakīrtis silence is not superceded by skillful speeches If we inspect the words  both his and mine have aspects to be driven away When the aspects of both Buddhism and Daoism are driven away trying to moisten something with tiny bubbles should be rejected If there is no boundary between Laozis purpose and that of ākyamuni neither goes against nobility Why do you view prajñā from a distance and say that it is not wisdom Why do you humiliate and rigorously compare them to insects and birds I carefully examined your discussion repeatedly day after day I have not yet been satised Moreover according to regional custom there are different languages Taking only China as a familiar example Qi state and Lu state are not the same  The use of the terms that mean to begin quanyu and chuluo has also changed from ancient times to the present If that is wrong this is not right either If this is right that alone cannot be wrong Since both cannot be right they are equally wrong Imagine a case in which our Chinese spoken language ows into that country When we solely clarify this point beams and pillars become equal  If the biased views of both sides are concurrently removed wouldnt they then understand each other Principles are inmost deep and subtle they are not what we ought to take part in I sincerely wish to discern the right profound teaching and for the time being I simply express in a straightforward manner The Disputation on the Daoist Gus Discourse on the NonChinese and the Chinese by Huitong at Yecheng I was at leisure at the beginning of the summer with nothing particular to do and I forgot the time passing by when I opened Mr Gus discourse which is so bright to inspire the ignorant I saw that it discusses the origin of the differences and similarities and claries the purport of right and wrong The expressions are rich the principles are evident the writing is splendid and is truly profound Every time I closely read it I forget my fatigue It is really the socalled rened work by a distinguished literary person Nevertheless when I examine the ultimate purpose there are many points that make me doubt and laugh It is like the story of the blind man who went to collect pearls and returned home with red beans thinking that he had obtained treasures or the story of the deaf man who wanted to listen to musiche hears a donkey braying is delighted by it and thinks that he  understands music When I saw that you refer to Daoist scriptures in your discussion I became more confused What Laozi composed in ancient times is only the Five Thousand Words Everything else is miscellaneous and they are dissolutely fallacious doctrines yet you distinguish and call them Daoist scriptures On what basis does this happen I hope you will examine this point thrice and remove the delusion soon The Discourse says If Confucius and Laozi were not the Buddha who else would this be applicable to Daoism is precisely Buddhism Buddhism is none other than Daoism Speaking about this statement I am afraid that you are completely confused scriptures state Mahākāśyapa is called Laozi and Kumāra Guangjing is called Confucius over there We know that Laozi is not the Buddha In fact your views about principles have not yet been great They moreover propagated the virtue  and showed merit and demerit of beings Later Buddhism was transmitted Nevertheless it is difcult to observe the Great Way while it is easy to follow small comprehensions  This is a lamentation from ancient times and not a lamentation with signs originated today Laozi composed the Five Thousand Words but many people offer dubious explanations Some people set forth fallacies to confuse peoples minds and some pass on licentious and cruel stories to arouse peoples nature Hence those who perform good deeds are few while those who are steeped in vice are many I think that the decorative adornments of the ofcial class the respectful manner of bowing by completely bending the body the funeral ritethese were probably when the Great Way declined Knowledge and desires arose and dishonest practices increased day after day Sages accordingly prohibited these by ethical education and controlled them through laws and institutions Therefore propriety was established when faith and honesty became weak it was the commencement of disorder We have already lost wuwei and esteem phenomena youwei Skt Regarding the appearance of shaving ones head bowing down to squat like a fox and the custom of burial I think that these are insufcient in splendor they are parsimonious it is already true that wealth cannot be maintained Laozi said that the ve colors consequently cause people to become blind and that even if one amasses a lot of wealth he will certainly lose it later Accordingly it is the highest degree of modesty to take the tonsure put on a black robe abandon ones wealth and leave behind the secular world India is the center of the world where Buddhism originated This indicates the good order and solemnity of the Great Dharma and the gravity and reverence of the highest teaching You compare it to a foxs squatting Hence evil spirits assist vice and violent devils destroy what is right This refers to you is similar to using a ladle to attempt to reduce a large river or the sea or raising a hand to block the light of the sun and moon Although you may do these things you can neither reduce the water in a large river or the sea nor shield the brightness of the sun and moon In early antiquity the nature of the people was still pure People could be bright without availing themselves of ethical education and they were spontaneously well governed without being inicted with punishment When a man died was laid in an open eld No mound was raised over it nor were trees planted around it nor was there any xed period of mourning whenever the people grieved they cried This is the pure practice of ancient times Furthermore you compare the two teachings of Daoism and Buddhism to a boat and carriage If knowledgeable people hear this there is no one who would not smile  I think that the Way of  Heaven keeps silent and sages have no attachment Therefore the Way is enlarged by people it is not that the Way enlarges people In that case the Sages spiritual mirror is procient in everything Nevertheless referring exclusively to one  you say that it is impossible to practice both for salvation It is just as when the wonderful sunshine appears in the morning it offers illumination according to each thing and when timely wind blows unceasingly in the evening things produce various sounds according to their shapes Accordingly just as there are differences in shapes the sounds are not the same and since things differ from each other the way illuminates them also varies The sun does not illuminate differently in accordance with each thing The wind does not cause things of various shapes to produce sound differently in accordance with each shape It is simply known that the sun is one and the wind is one but the things that receive them vary You take up the metaphor of a boat and carriage The great teaching is impartial and the highest virtue is unbiased There is a common purport in educating sentient beings and the same destination toward which to lead people They have the same voice in the foreign land and in China Could there be a teaching and an edication only for the Chinese In the past when Gongming Yi played the musical piece Cao in the note qingjue for a cow just lowered her head and ate as before This does not mean that she did not listen to  but did not meet her ears On the other hand if there were the buzz of a mosquito or gady or the lowing of an orphaned calf she would promptly prick up her ears swish her tail and stamp on the ground listening to it What you hear now is probably something like the buzz of a mosquito or a gady Furthermore you say  abandon their wives and children in token of a minor degree and discontinue their ancestor worship in token of a major degree The inner is different from the outer  just as speech differs from silence If one burns incense at the altar in the evening intones a Buddhist scripture at the temple in the morning worships repents and entreats unceasingly will reach his relatives in successive kalpas as a token of the great degree and all people of the world as a token of the minor degree The immensity of lial piety and benevolence like this cannot be surmised by the ignorant The nation avails of the people and takes them as the foundation and the ruler establishes depending on the people I infer that your discussion seems to be an empty scheme In addition you say that śramaṇas carved a mark on the side of the boat to indicate the place where he dropped his sword into the water and Daoists waited by the stump hoping that other hares would come to the place where he had previously caught a hare ght each other in vain for supremacy they impeach each other I pondered the sentences and looked for the meanings People of the heretical way have been wanton for a very long time They have been submerged in darkness and do not move from there They roam around small villages and insincerely go beyond the border villages In public they follow the sacred practice but in private they conduct debauchery If attainment of the Way is like this how shameful it would be  In former times a man of Qi state was fond of hunting but he did not have a dog or a deer at home Even though he rushed around for many years he could not catch even a single animal Thereafter he withdrew and returned to tilling the land Moreover you say The Great Way has already been obscured and small comprehensions have risen one after another Who can correct them The right path is difcult to destroy while wrong principles are easy to reject For instance it is just as when light feathers meet with wind high above they are blown away or when ne stones enter the ow of water from a mountain stream they roll down  yet Mount Tai remains unmoved in a whirlwind and massive rocks are not swept away even by a rapid current Hence it is true that when plum trees are nipped by the frost they become leafless but pines and cypresses are hardly withered even in the coldest season of the year When a wicked method contacts a right  it is defeated If you have the Great Way then who would have small comprehensions of the mind I think I will talk about this more and later I will make a judgment A fellow like Yan Hui observed Dongye Bis way of handling the horses and he predicted would break down Zigong witnessed the manners of Zhu state and Lu state and discerned that would certainly die Why are you as ignorant as this Therefore I will indicate the difference between the ignorant and the intelligent make clear that the wise differs from the mean and show you by presenting one corner of the subject for the time being I hope you will be able to reply to me about the other three  Moreover you say Either nirvana or the transformation of becoming a Transcendent is a method  In Buddhism it is called right and true  while in Daoism it is called right and one  The term one means to return to nondeath and the term true means to meet nonarising and The teaching of nonarising is indirect while the teaching of immortality is direct These were probably made because you are astute skillful in debate and eloquent In that case the doctrine of nirvana extinguishing and crossing over  is written in authentic Buddhist scriptures As for the assertion of the transformation of becoming a Transcendent and entering the way however on what doctrine is it based Laozi said that those who endeavor excessively to perpetuate life must nonetheless enter the jaws of death He also said The reason why Heaven and Earth endure and continue thus long is because they do not live of or for themselves Those who forget life survive while those who try to sustain life must die Since you are approaching death you think that the teaching of nondeath is urgent It is indeed urgent As the saying goes Pointing to the south which is in fact the north one says to himself that he is not confused Pointing to the west which is in fact east he says to himself that he is not stupid You take mortality as going to be born Why do you have such contrary thoughts Therefore you live in seclusion and abstain from food in order to cultivate the art of the Transcendents I have heard that Laozi has the admonition against the ve avors ie sweet sour bitter pungent and salty but gives no instruction about abstaining from grain For this reason even though a cicada and a moth do not eat who among gentlemen values them Although a frog and a python live in burrows why would sages attach importance to them Moreover since ancient times there is no one among the sages and wise people who has not died in the end Only you speak of immortality Why are you so reckless Do they sound absurd to you Formerly a person who had not seen a kylin asked a person who had seen one What kind is a kylin The one answered A kylin is just like a kylin The man who had asked then said If I had seen a kylin then I would not have asked you the question Nevertheless you said that a kylin is just like a kylin How can I understand this A kylin has a body like a roe deer a  tail like a cow hooves like a deer and a back like a horse The man who had asked the question then clearly understood Now do you want to see a kylin Are you telling me without ever having seen one In addition you say Daoist scriptures are concise and profound Since are profound it is hard to discern the gate to the subtle  I think Laozis teaching is contained in the Five Thousand Words and anything other than this is not an authentic scripture The more Daoist scriptures appear the deeper my suspicions Most falsely consign beautiful expressions and vainly marshal owery words This is similar to the story that a man of Zhou held out a mouse in order to sell it as uncarved jade but a man of Zheng saw it and just withdrew This is what it means Speaking from this viewpoint how can be appropriate Again you say For those who are brutal and stubborn it is the best to be taught by the Buddha For those who are kind and gentle and who keep their minds free from preoccupation and open to receive  it is the utmost to follow the way Formerly Laozi said Violent and strong men do not die a natural death I will make this the basis of my teaching Therefore the reason people widely circulate books of admonitions and make culture and education known is for the sake of the ignorant they do not do such things for those of outstanding virtue and learning When people go against there must be misfortune and when they follow them there must be fortune People who are violent strong and stubborn are a group of the low and the stupid The great teaching shows benevolence and compassion and saves such people with expedients Regarding Those who are kind and gentle and who keep their minds free from preoccupation and open to receive others inuences I think that this should be considered empty talk People who learn Daoism today are against  Some Daoists pray for longevity by ingesting drugs some try to cure diseases by licentious means Moreover The trace of Daoist teaching is esoteric and sublime  places himself behind everyone and yet he is always in the foremost position he treats his body as if it were foreign to him and yet it is preserved You merely say The proper implements for use of the Daoist teaching lie in oneself I do not know on what basis you make this statement They understand it but it sounds similar to the noisy chirping of insects and birds Why is it worthy of imitation I think that those who eat bitter food do not know that bitter is bitter and they do not covet sweet and fragrant food those who are delighted with malodorous things are not aware that stinky and they are not addicted to pepper and orchids How could you have a thought about the Great Dharma The sacred teaching is subtle and unobstructed and the ultimate Way is profound and extensive It can be said that they are neither existence nor nonexistence there is neither the meaning of a confrontation between self and other nor a view between dissimilarity and similarity Speaking is similar to shooting You say that the incomprehensible foreign language sounds similar to the noisy chirping of insects and birds What do you mean Recently Sun went mad and openly acted outrageously His cruel and disordered rejects righteousness Only when people of high moral standing are united in common determination will ignorant people stop falsehoods and reform themselves Vicious fellows lled a room and evil people overran the gates There were grievous sorrows in the towns and grudges about disastrous sufferings on the streets The Way of Heaven brings disaster to those who are arrrogant and spiritual beings bless those who are humble Later brought ruin down upon himself The Discourse on the Western Tribe and China  Breaking the Daoist Gus Discourse on the NonChinese and the Chinese by Shi Sengmin at Guangling Formerly Vimalakīrti availed himself of the lofty path in this world and displayed his merits outside of the phenomenal world Therefore his trace appeared in the western land where he joined others in the profound teaching If we speak of his mysterious supernatural powers he was able to make Heaven and Earth turn upside down or expand or contract things as he pleased People like this person can be called a Buddhist layperson  I have not understood the intention behind your calling yourself a Buddhist layman You have not destroyed the high mountain of the seven kinds of selfconceit you have not lled in the gorge of the ve desires the sunlight of wisdom has not shone  you have not cleared up the clouds of ignorance you have not stopped the winds of eternal darkness and you have not returned from the delusion of nocturnal roaming Yet you still put on airs and call yourself a Buddhist layman I one who has poor Way and who appreciates your ability from afar have come to know that you are not yet qualied to take possession of  Even though this is the entry level in the Great Dharma it cannot be easily assumed I examined the intention of your Discourse on the NonChinese and the Chinese which completely illuminated your mind I tried to fulll my learning at the altar to Heaven hoping you would instruct on this issue Regarding your discussion however there is no natural ability to enjoy the elegance of the writing there is no knowledge to examine the efcacy of profound issues there is not even a very small light in intellectual function and the amount of benet is less than the moisture in a dewdrop It is decient in myriads of ways What signicance would there be A bitter plum tree is overburdened with fruit and its branches break Luan Da talked wildly and was decapitated These are entirely the established system of the prehistoric times and the beacon of the Yin dynasty for the wise of later generations I will now tell you the differences between Daoism and Buddhism in both names and meanings The Buddha is the other name for the numinous being of right perfect enlightenment the Way is a general term for a hundred paths Laozi is a sage who expounded one aspect  while the Buddha depended on the foundation of myriad deities In Daoism a Transcendent is considered to be noble but in Buddhism the exhaustion of delement is taken as good In the Way of Transcendents there is a thousandyear life span In the exhaustion of delement on the other hand there is a numinous eternal being Because has a thousandyear life span he rides on a dragon and controls the clouds To control the clouds and to ride on a dragon is the way of birth and death The profound numinous being is permanently happy and eternally pure Now that it is like this the movement of Heaven completely responded and the trace descended to the imperial capital He quietly disliked the palace surrounded by watchtowers  and completely abandoned the palace Therefore he let go of his worldly nations and made a vow to go beyond to the three kinds of emptiness He ew like a dragon to the splendid house and readied a vehicle the place where he attained enlightenment Thereupon he rst expounded at the Deer Park  then he had an assembly at the palace of the Heaven then he propagated at Vulture Peak  and later gloried it near the Hiraṇyavatī River Consequently the great light of Dharma illuminated even distant areas the sun rest from shining the splendid carriages covered the four directions a vehicle of the king of the Brahmā Heaven descended from heaven beings of the nine heavens together sang  many hermits had an opportunity for realization among those who made bold to have a relationship  there was none who did not gather together like clouds and take refuge in it Therefore the Tathāgata caused Samantabhadra to practice authority at the western road and all of the three sages to lead the people in the eastern metropolis ie China Therefore a Buddhist scripture states Great being kāśyapa is none other than Laozi Hence assisted and supported the world of the Zhou period by means of the sophisticated teaching of the Five Thousand Words and then returned to India since his relationship to the edication had been used up This is why there is left Guan for the faraway west Based on  the Chinese composed the Scripture on Laozi who Edied the Barbarians  which makes those of little knowledge sigh in admiration for China You have not yet known the details of the profound purport Why then do you insist that Laozi and the Buddha are the same When people hear that the Great Sage has manifested as the leader of the circle of Confucian scholars they take Zhuangzi Confucius the Duke of Zhou and Laozi to all be the Buddha If this were the case is it possible that you are none other than Laozi as well among sentient beings who transmigrate in the ve realms of existence there is no one who is not the Buddha What do you mean by this is really when Kuafu chased after the sun and surely died from thirst You say in the Discourse on the NonChinese and the Chinese that there are abominable people of Koguryo and Paekche to the east tribal people of Qiang and Rong to the west unkempt people to the north and people who cut their hair and have tattoos on their bodies to the south on the other hand since the Duke of Zhou and Confucius created rules of decorum in China there is a distinction between the nonChinese and the Chinese the Western Tribe and China advocates that the east ends at a place where no one lives the west ends at a solitary village the north goes beyond the sea and the south comes to an end at the gate of a village with no inhabitants Since the Tathāgata enhanced the edication in China there is a difference between the western tribespeople and the people of China You condemn those who have the nature of the Chinese for learning the teaching of the western tribes This is because you have come out of the deep pit of a well and have not yet seen a view of rivers and lakes As a Buddhist scripture says The Buddha occupies the center of the world and leads the people of the ten directions to purity therefore we know that the land of India is the central kingdom The Duke of Zhou and Confucius have the graceful and upright system  while the Tathāgata has the law to transcend the secular world Since the graceful and upright system  they are different from the tribal people of the four directions Since the Tathāgata has the law to transcend the secular world he is not the same as the Duke of Zhou and Confucius Since the system diffuses to the tribal people of the four directions the tribal people of every direction praise the virtue  Since the law was appended to the Duke of Zhou and Confucius Laozi returned to the west  Since Laozi returned to the west a large number of tribal people have arisen Since the tribal people of the four directions praise the virtue of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius they excessively increase confusion  The upright decorum is unable to be changed and the true Dharma does not change Since the upright decorum cannot be changed Taibo straightened his clothes even in Wu and Yue Since the true Dharma does not change Buddhism was transmitted to the east without alteration Since straightened his clothes he caused the people in the land where they barely clothed themselves to follow the custom of appreciating clothing Since the Dharma does not change it causes Chinese people of talent and virtue to take the tonsure Since had the custom of appreciating clothing it made their appearance closer to that of the people of the Zhou dynasty Since take the tonsure it makes them respectfully equal to the western tribal people in customs Since talented and virtuous Chinese people who took tonsure are equal to the faraway western tribal people in customs it makes all those who see them at close range believe  If you think that there is no xed rule in the Sages path and his response varies according to each locale then Taibo should have walked naked in the lower reaches of the Yangzi River  and it is possible that even today you do not wear clothes either Hence even though locality and race differ the sacred Dharma does not You might say that you rely on the right way Laozi considers the Grand Void to be the essence while the Buddha thinks that conforming to present affairs is profound Laozi thinks that nature gives rise to  while the Buddha considers that the unity of condition gives rise to  Daoism takes talismans to be effective while Buddhism takes leading through explaining to be exquisite Since the Grand Void is considered to be the essence there are things to produce all things  Since conforming to the present affairs is profound all things are essential Since Nature gives rise to  there is no heavenly hall to which to ascend Since the unity of condition gives rise to  there are noble stages to which one can ascend Since talismans are considered to be effective there is no efcacious god in Daoism Since leading through explaining is considered to be exquisite people study the mind of the Sage Since there are things to produce all things  Daoism is not great Since all things are essential  the path of the Sage is lofty and vast Since there are noble stages to which one may ascend intelligent people throw themselves into  There is no efcacious god  Therefore what are you fascinated by and what do you seek Ever since people began to study the mind of the Sage  śramaṇas have arisen like clouds Therefore we know that the Daoist scriptures are minor and shallow while the Buddhist scriptures are extensive and deep the Daoist scriptures are few and vile while the Buddhist scriptures are magnanimous and clean the Daoist scriptures are disordered and lacking while the Buddhist scriptures are simple and pure and the Daoist scriptures are approachable and yet obscure while the Buddhist scriptures are profound and yet clear You should change your polluted robe to a simple one and faithfully take part in the lofty teaching of Buddhism Those who wear a yellow turban on the head look depraved Wearing a cap made of leather is really not a Chinese style Selling talismans and registers is an evil custom that deceives people of the world Patting the cheeks with both hands and grinding the teeth are the extremity of confusion Binding ones hands behind ones back and rolling on the ground is a manner of hell Talismans and the union of vapors ie the art of the inner chamber sexual practices are the most cunning craft In this way light and darkness are already evident and truth and falsehood are already obvious You should lead your friends in an orderly manner and walk across to the pure path ie a Buddhism I look after the graceful virtue in my mind and at the same time I receive with respect the truth of the Sage Would this be bad People temporarily nd their enjoyment in the dreamland infected and misled by worldly fame If the perception of objects increases like mist how can they discern the brilliant right  The weakening of simple and sincere customs causes all the devils to compete with each other in confusion When one seeks glory by means of falsehood and deception he will assuredly commit the ve rebellious acts When he leads ignorant people by force he must apply the six atrocious methods Then he is lled with the pestilent force like dust in a dust storm and brings various troubles upon himself I remember that the eastern Wu region suffered from hardships caused by the Water Transcendents  in the western tribal land gave the title spiritual soldier  in the groves of the Minyue region the obscene ways of seed people remain and in the time of the Han dynasty the people were moved by the mourning song for the son  Loyal wise men sigh in disappointment The government has been maltreated and is about to come to an end Even if we were to pick up sand and grasses from the ground how could we count the sins we have committed People of insignicant and supercial learning do not know the foundation of the teaching The erroneous words of the worldly teaching defy and conceal the Three Treasures ie Buddha Dharma and Sangha The streets are full of resentment of our dear spiritual people guimin ie followers of the Way of the Five Pecks of Grain All of this is none other than the ashes of Mount Yan and the dregs of the Yellow and Luo Rivers and is together submerged in dangerous difculty I am very sorrowful about it I will illuminate the profound native land for children who are confused in foreign lands and who do not know the way to go home expose the subtle purport beyond this world secretly spread a happy breeze and judge situations of self and other Is this something that can be presented and copied in words b To Ban Scriptures and to Raise their Price The First Rebellious Act The profound scriptures unfold like clouds and pierce through the beautiful world of emptiness and existence are really the deep sea for those who learn and the sun and moon for sentient beings Therefore Sadāprarudita Bodhisattva illuminates equally with benevolence makes a ash of lightning in the nether world puts an end to devils in a dangerous marsh sets a divine boat aoat with the winds of faith and delivers this eeting world from the sea of suffering I have heard that when Daoist scriptures are composed worldly ideas are blended into them It is strange that the edication of Daoism is futilely banned and yet we see today that those who study ignore the strict rules and give the scriptures in order to obtain gold and silk fabric If a poor man comes to the Daoists they will not see him even if he dies They are greedy for prot and have no mercy No one goes against more than this Moreover their art is obscene and evil it is not clean They consider the grinding of teeth to be a heavenly drum swallowed spit to be like water from a sweet spring horse excrement to be numinous rewood and old mice to be the raw material for a transcendent elixir Even if one avails himself of this to seek the Way how could he attain it Formerly the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty and Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty could not lighten their bodies to become a transcendent sent Xu Fu and sent Gongsun to a very distant place beyond the clouds and waves and ordered them to offer a prayer and a greeting to communicate with transcendents but there was no result  When we tranquilize our minds and remove desire facts and the Way are next to each other Would it then be necessary to make efforts to run around swallow spit or grind ones teeth To Recklessly Claim the True WayThe Second Rebellious Act Those who try to reach the pale redcolored clouds in order to become a transcendent talk of the merits of alchemy and elixirs Those who try to open and clarify the pure intelligence count on the energy of a marvelous herb called danghua Although maintain these and consider them to be true they have not been able to avoid the nal consequence  Furthermore Zhang Ling absurdly called himself the Heavenly Master but since he insulted people as well as spirits he received retribution while still alive at the end of the Xingping era of the Han dynasty he was swallowed by a python His son Heng ran about looking for his body but could not locate it was afraid that pure talk would be besmirched by  in order to show the trace of mysterious transformation he bound the legs of a live crane and placed the animal on a precipice In the rst year of the Jianan era he sent messengers to announce that the Heavenly Master would ascend to the Mysterious Capital where divine transcendents dwell on the seventh day of the rst month The followers of the Way of the Five Pecks of Grain and those who make a living by hunting in the mountains gathered like ants outside the door  The parishioners of Mount Yuntai bowed their heads to the ground twice and said We have humbly heard that the sage will travel to the Mysterious Capital Corpus spirits will surely enjoy themselves and will precisely be as dark as the Nine Murks ie the bottom of the earth He lied to the people telling them that had said I will turn the carriage toward Chenhua Each of you return to your parish purify your mind sustain the practice keep the Master in mind and think of the Way Heng then surreptitiously untied and the crane ew straight up into the air The followers including those who make a living by hunting  were ignorant and foolish and all said that had ascended to immortals the living take advantage of the dead for prot and cheat Heaven and Earth c To Explain Sins by Means of the Union of the Yin and Yang Energies The Third Rebellious Act When one clears his mind of all feelings and removes desire his aspiration for the Way becomes bright and true A group of nameless ignoble people recklessly composed the Yellow Books They bow down and lightly reproach those who deliver an evil unprovoked magic formula The magic formula says The Way of Heaven comes to an end After fteen days have passed the sun and moon are bright As they come out it is tranquil and deep as they go in it is dark and profound When energy comes in the true energy is opened When the spiritual energy spreads out the energy of the Way is exercised All vicious spirits vanish He who sees me will become blind and he who hears me will become deaf He who dares to impose upon me will receive disaster instead I am fortunate and he is unfortunate In the year of Jiazi there was an imperial decree and in response a religious register was created Men and women became intimate with each other ie engaged in sexual behavior and there was no distinction between high and low Lu Xiujing of the Wu region frequently practiced this  Then they open the gate of destiny where the foundation of life resides hold a baby of the perfected and adopt postures like the winding dragon and the playing tiger Through taking postures like these they prevent calamities and disperse misfortune Yi Jun of the Han period practiced this as the Way he greatly misled the people and plunged them into disaster and was exiled to Dunhuang Later as for Sun En  his teaching was much more dissolute men and women became disordered and wild no different from those between male and female birds and beasts are easily drawn by visual objects form and color and it is difcult to eliminate delements not to mention those who mix the yin and yang energies at the cinnabar eld  who attempt to prolong life at the transcendent cave who give full swing to a weapon and pass through the prohibition of the jade gate  and who go to the extremity of adopting abnormal postures like the winding dragon and the playing tiger When alive they have no principles of loyalty and after death they suffer in the blue court ie a euphemism for hell located on the east side of Mount Tai I sincerely wish that the bright Heaven will investigate and reveal these fellows all things including myself will be upright and clean and will not go against the instructions of the unseen world To Presume Upon the Way and to Rise in RevoltThe Fourth Rebellious Act It is difcult to understand the ultimate truth and easy to be deluded by the glory of fame Relations are more signicant than deep waters or high mountains and virtue is less important than wind and dew People just like the rebels of the Yellow Turbans hoped a hawk does the Han royal family but on the contrary they despised bright Heaven Subsequently there was Zi Lu who also set forth the Way of Spiritual Beings  Yet the gods did not help him and he was gored by an elk After that Sun En also claimed the Purple Way  He did not care about his lowly status and inferior position and intended to attain the nobility of the emperor a cloud or a sound in a dark cave he issued absurd ideas in empty profundity The Water Transcendent confused others and killed sinless people regardless of their age He ruined the country and destroyed the people Isnt this cruel and inhuman Therefore Emperor Wu of the Song dynasty thought of this and sighed with deep feelings Then he ew a thousand li like a dragon and crossed over the three large rivers like a tiger Sentient beings were pleased and the grasses and trees enjoyed the spring light If one confers a posthumous title to the spirit of the dead or strives to follow the illustrious virtue if there is no true essence in the Way he just recklessly chases after unreality Then say that has gone to the east they get drunk and bring sins to an end Isnt such a bigoted and obscure thing vile and unusual Moreover regarding the issue that the merit one makes can be transferred to his ancestors of seven generations through the Yellow Register Fte a memorial service the purport of this passage is shallow and supercial ask to escape from carrying sandstones and become spiritual of Daoism for a long time The intelligence of sages thoroughly investigates the subtle  if there is a thought this is illuminated Why is it necessary to bother the libationary  or to waste paper and ink unreasonably  If one must submit a petition and later a judgment is given we know for the rst time that the Lord of the Way has no ability to profoundly examine things and the heavenly administrative staff does not possess the function of the heavenly eyes the Three Ofces sanguan the ofces of Heaven Earth and Water tire of attending to legal cases and spiritual ofcers are exhausted by arresting  To hear a petition is originally intended for those who are suddenly taken ill but if one submits a petition on the day of wuchen it never reaches  Since the petition does not reach him the petitioner will be wronged and driven to death Alas it is sad This is truly the fth rebellious act a To Be Afraid of Evil Spirits and Wear Talismans is the Atrocity of LawlessnessThe First For those who follow the correct Way sincerely even recalcitrant evil spirits reform their force For this reason sages of the superlative degree and people of lofty wisdom are devoid of emotions through myriad changes Therefore they can profoundly enjoy music played with instruments made of metal or stone and sleep in mists and rosy clouds  This is because their pure sincerity touches and is understood by Heaven How can wearing make this If one carries the talisman of the Grand Terminus on the left and the iron sword of Kunwu on the right when he points to the sun the sun stops shining and when he imitates a spiritual being he can cover an area even a thousand li away with blood If one receives the Yellow Book and the Red Writing Chizhang a talisman register written in red ink say that he is a numinous transcendent Regarding the matter of using a talisman to protect one against evil spirits on the six jia days and bowing ones head to ground in a toilet just as Guo Jingchun said that those of the Daoist school go into a toilet to exorcise evil spirits but in the end they are unsuccessful they are senseless and confused I have heard about wearing talismans In former days as a group symbol there were the yellow signs used by Zhang Jiaos  the dark redcolored signs worn by Zi Lus  the purple marks by Lu Songs  and the tactics called guxu by Sun Ens  They all powerfully confused the emperors troops but in the end their people and spiritual beings were all exterminated To Institute Imposing a Tax or Donation on the People is the Atrocity of Skillful DeceptionThe Second The teaching of the Five Pecks of Grain was founded by the Heavenly Master  Later it became vicious and corrupt In addition his group established the followers People of the world loathed and feared  Therefore Zi Ming and Du gong were both worried about by an evil python  Moreover as for the Mud and Ash Fte  the ritual was begun by Zhang Lu Since it was difcult to edify the Di and Yi tribespeople he established this ritual in which the practitioners tumble about in mud like a donkey put yellow alkaline mud on their faces bump their heads against a pillar and hang down beating their bodies just as clay is fashioned This rite is designated to the borderland it should not be performed in China At the beginning of the Yixi era  there was Wang Gongqi who was greedy for treasures Lu Xiujing of the Wu area was quite aware that the ritual was originally abnormal but still he smeared mud on his forehead and hung down with his hands bound behind his back I would be happy if you do not speak of this To Open a Kitchen at the Gate of a Tomb is the Atrocity of Not Being BenevolentThe Third To open the city gate and give great alms to the people is understood to be virtuous In the lingering vapor of the heterodox path ie the Way of the Five Pecks of Grain they open a kitchen at the gate of a tomb and give food to pitiful people which becomes a disorderly situation Formerly Zhang Zi Lu inaugurated a meritorious event in Guanzhong presentday Shaanxi province and gathered a large crowd of libationers and spiritual soldiers Furthermore the titles Heavenly Master  Succeeding Master  Heir Master  and Master of Three Daughters were eulogistic titles created by Zhang Lu for himself Moreover the Woman of the Way  the Man of the Way  the Capped Female Ofcials  the Father of the Way  the Mother of the Way  the Spiritual Lord  and the Seed People are names given to followers after they perform the ritual sexual practices of the union of the yin and yang energies In addition the People of Grain  the Family of Grain  the Supervisor of Merit  and the Libationer are titles given in order to placate followers in hard times Again the Decient of the Way Pindao ie the humble selfreference of a Daoist priest and the Dharma Master of the Three Grottoes are titles created by Senghui of Changan Moveover the Learned Elder  the People of the Way  and the King of the Transcendent Lord were created by Wang Lingqi a man of Moling county Furthermore Daoist Priest  Bandit of Ants  Controller of Wine  and Bandit of Grain are named by what the people consider Moreover regarding the Dharma Master  the Dharma Preacher  and the Attendant of Scriptures  Lu Xiujing established these names relying on Buddhism and following the world The Lord of Heaven  the Lord of Earth  and the Vassal or Concubine are also designated The Way of Great Peace  the Way of the Five Pecks of Grain the Great Way  the Purple Way  and the Teacher of Spiritual Beings Guishen shijun were false prestigious titles created during the rebellious times In addition Luan Da of the Jiaodong region was appointed to the post of General of Five Prots  Even though he was installed as a feudal lord he had none of the principles of a highranking ofcial By the end of the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty this title was no longer used drank excessively and consequently fell into a drunken frenzy His disgrace spread far and wide and eventually reached the fardistant Min region  Liu Zhang admonished  Even the numinous transcendent refrains from taking pine nuts and the mist of clouds in order to preserve his life yet you lead a luxurious life and relish good food and drink How can you respect the Way When Zi Lu heard this he was deeply resentful but felt ashamed in his mind He punished himself and cleared roads Concurrently he established the rules of kitchen in which the consumption of wine is limited to three sheng From the end of the Han dynasty onward he was called the Controller of Wine At the time of Wang Lingqi the category of the sin was removed The Learned Elders and the People of the Way were bestowed with  This is similar to although had the nobility of the Five Prots became the name of a monster To Deliver Living Creatures from Distress and Suffering is the Atrocity of Wild ImaginationThe Fourth The physical body is more fragile than the calyx of ripe fruit in fall and life is more transitory than ice in spring The wind of karma blows widely and vigorously in the transitory realm Therefore Lord Jing left in conditioned fate and Sunzi recorded that was a  walking corpse Deluded people and those of shallow learning are not aware of the Great Law  When they have an illness fall into decline or experience disaster they are much more deluded and deepen the cause under the inuence of evil spirits they consider that a spiritual myna bird is the cause of disaster and try to turn their disasters over to the distant Milky Way to see a shing star at the place where water falls in drops Then they frown and revile the spirits of the unseen world saying The messengers of the Three Ofces have already sent the dead One who is going to die will naturally die This is really only the libationers scheme to prot from clothes and food and they exploit people just as a silk worm consumes mulberry leaves It results in startling the highest sage by a burning house and manipulating peoples emotion with an elegy To Commit a Sin in a Dream is the Atrocity of IgnoranceThe Fifth Human beings originate with the function of consciousness as the foundation The amount of grass and trees is not greater than the number of times they have abandoned their lives In this case even the great earth hills and mountains are all my former traces A broad blue river is all my tears and blood Observing from this point of view who would not be my close friend if someone sees in a dream someone who has passed away then people say that it is a ghost or an apparition Their feelings of kindness and affection sometimes inuence each other All evil spirits are illmannered and do not understand the law of submission and opposition summon and feed spiritual ofcers and soldiers and report to in written form in order to judge them  They can cut off disembodied spirits but who can illuminate their minds I hope that in future you will not uphold superstitious words Then it causes to have no thought of stopping a meal before nishing in Heaven and to calm the voice of disastrous thoughts in the icy river  To Hastily Make Cold and Hot is the Atrocity of Ferocity and HypocrisyThe Sixth To profoundly calm the mind and keep silence is the true virtue among myriad acts Generally sentient beings in this world have no mercy Those who are erce cruel evil and vicious vie with one another in making talismans They hang on a gate or attach it to a door and deceive ignorant people Lofty wise people and intellectuals are still not content with this make the Yellow God and the transgressed talismans  and with them they kill spirits Furthermore they set up the Red Writing which is used to kill people Their interest is only to please human nature without taking disastrous sin into account Regarding the results of making conspiracies and harboring jealousy old patterns are found in scriptures will go to the great hell of pincers after death and will be reborn as an owl or a shrike or they will be dumb upon their rebirth Their spirits and skeletons will decay in confusion and drown and perish eternally Who is aware of this For our dear spiritual people of Daoism the characteristics of the Way are not so Although severe admonition is bitter wise people should submissively listen to it If you cannot adequately reform yourself please wait for a person of the highest virtue and prepare yourself to be illuminated by the melody of his song in order to understand the long night  Is this something that I can explain with my weak words today The Discourse on Extinguishing Delusions by Liu Xie Record Keeper at Dongguan County A person composed the Discourse on the Triple Destruction  Its purpose and testimonies are vulgar and its literary style is philistine Even though people of profound knowledge ascertain the highest principles people of shallow ideas are confused by groundless statements The vulgar views  of townspeople are truly not worthy of argument but on second thought I am afraid that if ordinary people hear they may think it is true The Discourse on the Triple Destruction says The excellent point of the Daoist teaching lies in putting all ones thought in the attainment of the One and becoming a sage without death On the other hand the wonderful point of the Buddhist teaching lies in samādhi in which one attains supernatural powers and is able to wish for no rebirth Death is named nirvana I have never seen a person who learns about death and yet does not die The Discourse on Extinguishing Delusions says The true and the false of these two teachings are evident and easily argued In the Buddhist teaching one trains the mind while in the Daoist teaching one exercises the body The body that must die is conned within a time period and a place The spirit is boundless and can go around the circumference of the world twice  Bright people avail themselves of boundlessness and teach others with distinctive wisdom Dark people feel a persistent attachment to that must die and deceive others with a ying transcendent The heart of the art of the transcendent is food and medicine conduct based on wisdom begins with meditation Since meditation trains the true consciousness it is exquisite and delicate and nirvana can be wished for Medicine on the other hand detains the impermanent body  and consequently even if one puts all his thought  he will be thrown into disorder endlessly If one abandons the wonderful treasury  loses his wisdom and nourishes his body when we prove it on the basis of principles we can know is false If his body ies into boundless space and his spirit which remains in the dark ies up to Heaven like a hawk how could he escape from being a bird In the wonderful fruition of nirvana the Way is simply eternal How could the assertion of learning about death be about analyzing principles The Discourse on the Triple Destruction says If it is said that a prince is the founder of the teaching then he did not take the tonsure yet he causes others to shave their heads he did not give up his wife yet he causes others to cut off their posterity  this is really laughable We clearly know that Buddhism is precisely the art to exterminate evils I have humbly learned that regarding the virtue of gentlemen our bodies down to each hair and every bit of skin are received from our parents and therefore we must not presume to damage them this is the beginning of lial piety The Discourse on Extinguishing Delusions says The prince gave up his wife and took the tonsure Isnt it deceptive to call white black What Buddhist lial piety covers is probably more extensive Reason is due to the mind and has nothing to do with ones hair If a person has a persistent attachment to his or her hair and disregards their mind what can he or she take hold of for lial piety Conduct is more clearly welltimed the fruition of highest wisdom is more wonderful than abdication in reason Since is more wonderful than abdication in reason shave their heads and follow the Way Since the conduct based on is more clearly welltimed they abandon worldly conduct and seek the mind Judging from the two wise men  have no deciency in lial piety When you examine it with a sacred state of mind of what are you doubtful As for the rst kind of destruction says  is something that entered our country and destroys it talk nonsense with falsehoods build regardless of the expense exploit people empty the National  and put people in distress Since they do not help the country the population decreases If we see a case where people do not conduct sericulture and yet wear silk clothes or where they do not cultivate land but have food the country will go to ruin and the people will become extinct There is no benet at all even the suffering from the ve kinds of disasters is no worse than that caused by them The Discourse on Extinguishing Delusions says The teaching of Mahayana Buddhism is completely perfect it probes into the very root of truth and is the most subtle Therefore claries the twofold truth of absolute and relative reality in order to drive existence away and speaks of the three levels of apprehension of emptiness in order to put a mark on nonexistence The four immeasurable minds promote peoples distinctive minds The six pāramitās save people from karmic suffering Even though you slander them by saying  talk nonsense how could you damage the sun and moon  They build Buddhist temples in order to expound and propagate the wonderful teaching While the construction work is momentary the teaching lasts a thousand years In former times when Yu gathered all the lords many states presented gems and silk to him Later in the epoch of the Warring States  only seven lords ie those of the states of Qin Chu Yan Qi Han Zhao and Wei survived During the Taishi era  the government ourished and every household was prosperous too the disturbance of the Red Eyebrows caused the land within a thousand li from the capital city Changan to have no human habitation The country will go to ruin and the people will become extinct Why is this due to  In the reign periods of Hai ie Hu Hai the second emperor of the Qin dynasty   BCE and Ying one dan of grain cost a hundred thousand qian During the reign periods of Emperor Jing   BCE and Emperor Wu the stored grain became red and rotted There were few Buddhist monks at the end of the Qin dynasty and at the beginning of the Han dynasty there was the Buddhist teaching causes a father and his sons to differ from each other in their behavior brothers to differ from each other in following rules to desert their parents and the Way of lial piety ceases separate from each other on sad or pleasant occasions or do not sing or weep together enmity arises between kinsmen a relative in mourning is eternally abandoned go against what they have been taught and violate the right order and do not repay Heaven Nothing among the ve rebellious acts and impious conduct is worse than these The Discourse on Extinguishing Delusions says The principle of lial piety is supreme and runs through Buddhist clergy as well as laypeople equally Although the Buddhist teaching differs from the nonBuddhist teaching ie Confucianism in conduct the function of mind is the same in principle If my fate falls in the secular realms I will basically cultivate myself according to the decorum of Confucianism When my fate receives the fruition of the Buddhist Way I assuredly propagate lial piety in the pure conduct of Buddhism There are reasons they do so They all realize the principles of the mind and examine and illuminate the human world passing horses exceeds proverbs A stream aggrieves the superb sages heart Therefore we know that even if we attend our parents with devotion throughout our life which is as short as the blinking of an eye there is no salvation for the disembodied spirit If we learn the Way and take our parents out  then the suffering of the netherworld will vanish eternally Consequently the gravity of matters is weighed that is rejected and this is adopted  In former days when the Three Augusts governed well they were adored by Yao and Shun When one died was covered with pieces of wood and laid in an open eld without raising a mound over it or planting trees around it There is no historical record about a mourners staff or a mourning dress  How could it be said that the Three Augusts instructed to reject lial piety At the time of the Five Thearchs the mourning system was brilliantly established it has not been heard that Yao and Shun performed a rite and blamed the Three Augusts belatedly for not having a mourning and funeral system The Three Augusts have never been blamed for such either Why is the Buddha alone doubted The reason the Buddha has no rule for mourning system is because his aim is to get rid of suffering sincere and simple customs is not doubted yet getting rid of suffering is reproached This is what is called one who is inconsistent and who mixes up joy and anger it is clearly known that the teachings of the sages are perfectly understood complying with what people feel The Three Augusts did not have the system of mourning practices because they the sincere and simple customs  the Five Thearchs formulated the mourning system according to peoples feelings Since ākyamuni get rid of suffering he abandoned secular customs and returned to the truth When the traces of these sages are inspected there are different paths but their profound edications result in the same point As for the third kind of destruction says  enters ones body and destroys it In the body born as a human being there is rst of all the suffering of injury second the pain of punishment of shaving off the hair third the rebellious sin of being impious to ones parents fourth the sin of extinguishing ones family line by not having offspring and fth damaging the body following the Buddhist precepts and learning only impiety Why do I say this The precepts cause to not bow to their parents They vie with one another in following them If a boy becomes a novice rst and later his mother becomes a nun she must bow down to her own son How could we follow it The Discourse on Extinguishing Delusions says The body in which one dwells and the mind he receives are determined in reason by conduct performed in a previous life Whether someone enters the Way or stays in the secular life is in truth linked with the causality  For this reason ākyamuni appeared in the world and his edication diffuses throughout Heaven and the human world The trace of the Way is testied to both in governing a country and ruling a family I have never heard that all the people of the world renounce the world at the same time because varies in giving rise to faith Therefore there are two noble teachings  This is why the ofcial class is different from that of śramaṇas A wife is a nuisance of affection and having hair is merely an adornment of ones appearance The nuisance of affection damages the mind and the adornment of ones appearance goes against the Way Therefore Buddhist monks purify their minds and exterminate affection and attending to the Way they give up adornment When principles go beyond the ordinary level the teaching must reverse the secular way If one does not bow to his parents it is because the Way is esteemed If the parents bow to  it is because they respect the Way The li states that when a son who newly wears the cap sees his mother the mother bows to him When a man in armor meets the ruler he does not bow Since it is valued that he holds weapons in his hands to honor does not apply to  The cap made of black fabric is used for minor ceremonies originally it had no signicance in the Way of the Spirit A helmet and armor are instruments of evil omen and have no highest virtue Nevertheless in the case where respect is to be paid a mother bows to her son In the proper circumstances to suspend paying ones respects vassals do not kneel down and bow to the ruler The provisions of decorum are the worldly teaching c established by the Duke of Zhou and Confucius Speaking of its exibility it is not only from one pattern not to mention the dignity of the Buddhist Way that reveals beyond the three realms of existence which is the subtle foundation of the marvelous teaching and the profound origin of a great number of principles If this is given to a person he really is more respectable than those who wear caps or armor If those who wear caps or armor go against decorum no one of any age will doubt them Regarding the dignity that is given to the Buddhist Way why are you surprised by it The Discourse on the Triple Destruction says Fo the Chinese term for buddha is indicated as futu in old Buddhist scriptures Kumārajīva changed it to fotu since he knew the derivation of the term futu is evil Later Senghui changed it to fotu  Originally in old Buddhist scriptures are called sangmen  The term sangmen derives from the gate of annihilation Since it is said that the Dharma is the teaching about nonarising  are called sangmen Again Kumārajīva changed it to sangmen  Buddhist monks are not worthy of being called  The Discourse on Extinguishing Delusions says Buddhist scriptures were transmitted for the rst time during Emperor Mings reign of the Later Han dynasty Therefore the sounds and the Chinese characters used for the transliteration were not correct The sound of fu is similar to that of fo and the sound of sang is like that of sha  The Five Classics are traditional Chinese books Studies of them are not based on translation but in both Ma s and Zheng s annotations on them the sounds and Chinese characters are interchanged Zhuangzi understood to forget the words after apprehending the ideas  Mencius ridiculed the harm done to ones ideas by written language You have not traced back to the great principles and only pursue words Could the peoples lack in versatility in Song state have been any worse than this The Discourse on the Triple Destruction says The teaching to destroy the three entities is not applicable in China Originally it was intended to correct the western region They do not differ much from beasts and they do not believe in absolute vacancy  After Laozi entered the western region through Pass he intentionally established the teaching to worship the images and edied them Furthermore says Tribespeople are erce and rude intended to cut off their evil seeds Consequently he ordered the men not to take a woman in marriage and the women not to get married to a man There is no doubt that truth has been exquisite from the ancient time of nonbeginning and the Way will cover the endless  Examining the event when Elder Li went over Pass the time period falls in the last years of the Zhou dynasty Since the world a was in isolation and wise people lived in reclusion he departed and forgot to come back Even when Jie Yu withdrew from worldly affairs he wiped out his trace not to mention went to the foreign land Thereafter a cunning and wicked libationer composed the Scripture on the Conversion of the Barbarians  The doctrine is clumsy and its expressions are vulgar has been transmitted by petty people When I examine it the western tribespeople are weak and cowardly while the northern tribespeople are evil and vigorous  jackals and wolves are on the road and kill foxes and raccoon dogs Dragging each other to total ruin commit cruelties Even the law made by Shang Yang is not as cruel as this How could the way of Boyang be like this Moreover it is useless if images of the founder of the teaching are provided before people follow  If people faithfully follow the teaching massacres can be prevented If only those who already follow are given the death penalty this means that a single word can cause morality to be lost and numerous falsehoods to be visible What reason could be seen in the sayings of an uncultivated person of the east  The Discourse on the Triple Destruction says Now I wonder by what means people such as the Three Augusts the Five Thearchs and the Three Kings learned the Way Is it because the Nine August Ones disregarded it or because Buddhism had not yet been established If it is because Buddhism had not yet been established this is vicious and false I will not say anything more about this The Discourse on Extinguishing Delusions says Regarding supernatural powers and transformations the substance of teaching is not one Receiving mysterious responses appears and disappears endlessly If a condition exists in the subtle edication bodhisattvas propagate the teaching and if the edication exists in a coarse condition sage rulers exercise their virtue Sage rulers and bodhisattvas reveal their responses in accordance with what they receive Different teachings are united There is originally no that is not of the Buddha It is certainly known that after the time of the Three Augusts what received was extinguished and what was distinguished was hidden but in the teaching during Emperor Mings reign of the Later Han dynasty the condition responded to and the image appeared Such things as the Three Augusts inuence by means of virtue and the Five Thearchs education with benevolence are called the Way but this seems not to be the highest  We have not heard that when xi and Nong conducted their administrations there were written reports to them Yao and Shun continued their administrations The Five Classics do not mention the Heavenly Master yet the Discourse on the Triple Destruction seeks instructions from these sage rulers When I examine the people of the Central Plains ie the downstream regions of the Yellow River there is no one who does not believe in Daoism Those now in China who believe in Buddhism must be from a tribal background If they say they are not why then do they believe in Buddhism The Discourse on Extinguishing Delusions says The ultimate of the highest Way results in the One in reason The true state of the subtle Dharma is originally nondual The highest of the Buddha is empty profound and formless but he responds to all aspects of natural phenomena entered the state of tranquility and extinction and he has no thought in his mind yet his profound wisdom shines more and more Our invisible fate secretly encounters  yet no one sees its culmination We employ the deep merit daily yet we are not aware that we are doing so b When reveals his trace he shows his sacredness with his golden form When he responded to the secular world he was born as a prince in a royal palace In order to get rid of ignorance the fourstage meditation is considered to be the beginning In order to develop wisdom the ten stages are considered to be the way leading to the goal All dragons and spirits are equally guided and even insects are equally loved The expedient teaching has no set rules There is no contradiction between clergy and laypeople in response When the One Vehicle is expounded different scriptures are led to the same  Since Buddhist scriptures follow expedients although the teaching of Confucius is different from that of ākyamuni tally with the Way Because there are east and west on earth a country xes its boundary between its interior and its exterior In extensively administrating the marvelous edication and educating and molding sentient beings there is no distinction Assuredly can save all sentient beings in the six realms of existence and completely regulate the trichiliocosm The Way is simply the highest and the Dharma is merely the most honored Nevertheless even though the highest Way is one delusions arise at the crossroads The ninetysix nonBuddhist teachings all claim to be the Way When we hear their names we cannot tell whether they are evil or virtuous but when we verify their teachings their truth or falsehood is spontaneously proven According to the Daoist system there are three classes Laozi is marked as the highest the divine transcendent follows him and Zhang Ling comes last Considering the Archivists great escape  he is really a great virtuous man he wrote a book he treated of the Way he valued nonaction he attributed reason to being still and uniform  and his teaching is based on voidness and suppleness Nevertheless he did not record about the three periods  and the conduct based on wisdom was not transmitted by him This means that is a good guidebook for secular people but it is not a wonderful scripture beyond the mundane world The petty way like that of the Divine Transcendent is called the Five Directions  Their highest happiness is to be reborn in Heaven the best of ones physical ability is to soar up  one attains supernatural powers and yet cannot escape from having delements one has a long life and yet cannot avoid death Merits are not expected from food and medicine Virtue follows practice and cultivation Thereupon ignorant and crafty Daoists give rise to false pretexts Zhang Ling a grain thief was recorded to have ascended to Heaven and Ge Xuan a rustic was made known as Lord Transcendent in his biography Ignorant people are deluded in this way Can intelligent people be deceived Today when we speak of based on the way of Venerable Sir Li  the shortcoming of the teaching is like this When we clarify the divine transcendent following  its essence is of low quality like this Moreover imitating Ling and Lu perform religious services and make petitions and talismans They established the teaching of the Five Pecks and intend to save sentient beings in the three realms of existence It is as if a mosquito were to try to carry a mountain on its back They hold up the name of the Great Way but their teaching is below the level of secular  They put up the designation Most High Lord Lao but their law is extremely idiotic How do I know this To wish greedily for a long life and to fear an early death are common feelings of sentient beings Therefore with the Yellow Book they c control women and falsely call themselves the earthly transcendent The body that is rst vigorous and later weak is loved by all sentient beings Hence they value tears and saliva treasures in order to pour them onto the numinous root  To avoid disaster suffering and disease is the constant concern of the people Therefore kill or bind evil spirits in order to make the peoples foolish minds feel happy To rely on power and depend on military force is the traditional custom of the secular world Therefore with civil ofcers soldiers and armed horsemen they stir up peoples shallow thoughts Regarding the dissolute method to prevent calamities and the debauched way to control people by charms the principles are vile and the words are disgraceful Accordingly Zhang Jiao and Li Hong exerted a harmful inuence on society at the end of the Han dynasty Rebellions led by Lu Song and Sun En lled the last years of the Jin dynasty They have truly numerous followers wherever the aftermath extends They are not lords in the ranks of the nobility yet they imprudently established a register system of their followers They have neither the tigershaped nor the bamboo as a sign of their authority and rank yet they recklessly collect taxes from  When the world is peaceful they gnaw at people They destroy the government and foment rebellions How could they be regarded to be the same as the Buddha Moreover how could the Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra and the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra be compared with the Inner Section of the Mysterious and Sublime and scriptures of the Shangqing Supreme Purity school Why would the golden form with the excellent marks envy the room for spiritual beings and the house of emptiness kongwu ie a place for cultivation far away from towns and villages He who subjugated the devil king of Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven does not admire deceptive and vicious tricks How could the pure cultivation and observance of the precepts be the same as the disgracefulness of tallies Is producing a clean and pure sound from a large bell similar to beating a heavenly drum with ones lips and teeth  If we compare Buddhism with Daoism in their forms and traces their exquisiteness and coarseness are already far apart from each other When we examine them with the ultimate principle how could the truth and falsehood be hidden If laugh at exquisiteness through its coarseness and slander truth with falsehood this is precisely the same as the case of the blind man who says to Li Zhu who has very good eyesight I can see clearly Response to the Discourse on the Triple Destruction which Daoists Postulate is Zhang Rongs Composition by Shi Sengshun The Discourse says Nirvana is precisely death I have never seen a person who has learned about death and attained a long life This is a teaching to extinguish the species My explanation is Excessive endeavours to perpetuate life result in no life  People like Zhang Yi and Shan Bao are good examples of this Accordingly Confucianists say Everyone accounts death a boon and life an evil Laozi says If I did not have a body what great calamity could come to me Zhuangzi became ill and suffered from pain in his body These three men are in a group of sages and virtuous men They consider life to be trouble If we want to seek no life nothing is equal to nirvana it is the sublime appellation of wuwei  When the trace of the Buddha is spoken there is a written record that a royal palace and twin trees How could you hear of the essential points of nirvana There were once three blind men who handled an elephant the one who touched the elephants ear insisted that an elephant is just like a winnower another who touched the elephants nose disputed this and said that an elephant a is like a pestle Each one could know a part of the elephant but they could not completely apprehend the actuality of the elephant after all You say that nirvana is precisely death You are truly like a blind man who touches only a part of an elephant The Discourse says The prince did not give up his wife and yet he causes others to cut off their posterity ie remain unmarried and childless My explanation is The sacredness is truly tranquil but he manifested the traces The prince took a consort as an heir of the royal family probably because he wanted to show the people that after he had fullled the way of human ethics he was then simply able to abandon this great treasure and forget his kindness and affection  all the gods sent blessings from Heaven in the evening  and he jumped over the castle astride a white horse  the reason for the ten epithets exists in these  Why should a wife and children be necessary Moreover children are the heaviest burden in the world When one suffers from cold and hunger he turns to thievery to make a living The Sutra says All sentient beings have buddhanature When we respectfully seek its purport this refers exactly to those who have the seed of buddhahood This is bliss and benet You are confused by the tenor of the secular world and stagnate in serious delusion You are dreaming How can you understand it The Discourse says The prince did not take the tonsure and yet he causes others to shave their heads My explanation is Those who live with their family have their parents affection while Buddhist monks have the valuable of their strict teacher Speaking of love ones hair and skin are important Speaking of the strict  shaving the head is a difcult task Therefore for who are pleased to take the tonsure who take long leave of their parents and who wish to leave behind the delements of this world and approach the wuwei of that  it is still possible to give up their attachment to hair and skin If they do not think little of hair and skin how could they respect the Way This can be compared to the mourning system requires this person to assume the heavy responsibility of the ancestral temple of his adoptive family and cut off his love and care to  That for his adoptive parents is extended to three years indicates the weight of his obligation indeed The Book of Rites states The reason why one who leaves his original family must shorten the mourning period for his real parents is because what he receives from his adoptive family is greater This is an example of it Sutras say that all heavenly beings offer swords and ascend to Heaven holding hair What do you mean by saying  did not take the tonsure You are merely fearless in probing a matter to the bottom yet cowardly in seeking the purport This is deplorable The Discourse says If a boy renounces the world rst and later his mother becomes a nun she must bow down to her own son This is extreme discourtesy My explanation is Those who have renounced the world revere their teacher value the Dharma give up secular life and follow the Way Moreover when the prince engaged in the learning his father the king paid his respects to him Gaozu the founder of the Han dynasty accepted the advice of the Household Prefect of his father and considered his father to be his own subject Lord Gaogui Xiang  b the Wei kingdom revered the King of Qi who had been dethroned in his private chamber Empress Dowager Chu of the Jin dynasty treated her father as a vassal in the Court If we judge from these incidents it is not strange  The Discourse says Those who take the tonsure are of futu  My explanation is Sutras say that the term futu means sacred auspiciousness or numinous diagram Since it oated upon the sea and reached  it is called futu The stone buddha image of the Wuzhong area had oated in the sea and suddenly came to  This historical fact is an example of this Consequently he had nothing of which to be ashamed in being defective in morality Zhongyong followed the customs by cutting off his hair and tattooing his body and he educated the natives If they met you today they would certainly fall under your disastrous barking at sounds Among things there are things that look the same and yet are not alike and things that do not look alike and yet are alike NonBuddhist scriptures take Zhongni to be a sage but the Chinese character ni in Zhongni is used to refer to a nun in Buddhist scriptures Going in and out arises from the origin To extinguish delements and lead to spiritual relief are precisely what the term sangmen means The Chinese character sang should be the Chinese character sheng  this is simply the case of an incorrect character The term shengmen refers to the gate of Mahayana Buddhism After extinguishing delements carry all the people they have encountered by this over to the yonder shore Furthermore all eightyfour thousand are called the Dharma gate Why would there be only the two gates called sangmen The Discourse says Barbarians do not believe in absolute vacancy  After Laozi entered through Pass he intentionally established the teaching the images and edied them My explanation is When we make inquiry into the origins of the establishment images that is not the original intention of the teaching it is simply because after passed away attachment to and affection for him did not cease It is also clear in the descriptions in the Buddhist scripture that they made an image from a fragrant tree candana Furthermore after Confucius passed away his three thousand disciples remembered him forever and gave rise to deep attachment to him This is not a seat for you Inferring from this we know that think about and adore  Dharma teacher Kumārajīva was born in a foreign land He was sharp and intelligent He was good at talking about the characteristics of all phenomenal things He c carrying Buddhist scriptures on his back and circulated them in Guangzhong and the Sanfu area  He explained the twofold designation of absolute and relative reality and veried that both objects and the intelligence to discern them are tranquil He aroused the lofty education of wuwei and urged the profound stream of the teaching to those who had not been awakened This as they say is to drive away until there is nothing to drive away You said Barbarians do not believe in absolute vacancy This is really not a serious discussion Gentlemen emphasize that there is superiority and inferiority in principles and they are not concerned with the existence of images yet you talk about images Isnt this applying yourself to paganism The Discourse says  the tonsure is originally not to seek the Buddhist teaching but to subjugate evil barbarians Those who do not hear the Buddhist Dharma are compared to animals their circumstances are alike the eight difculties in reality The current sage conducts more lofty state affairs than did the Three Augusts and the Five Thearchs He claries the Dharma of the One Vehicle Heavenly and human beings rejoice equally that crawl around and that take breath through a beak all rely on him It is said that even insects that pant and wriggle are rightly placed If you say this and that without rm thought you should immediately shut your mouth Truly the more is revered the loftier it can become and the more it is penetrated the rmer it is The Discourse says  entered our country and destroys it My explanation is The Sage assuredly follows the affections in the minds of and responds to them everywhere In the edication of monarchs of latter generations Yao and Confucius were exalted As to places beneted by the subtle Dharma certainly helps the secular world and edies  the people spontaneously become sincere without being killed as a penalty and they adopt the right Way without suffering from being whipped The rulers of the Shi royal family ie Shi Le and Shi Hu of the Later Zhao dynasty had Fotudeng as their teacher and brought prosperity to their country I hear only that Daoist monks of insignicant learning make the Red Writing in order to curse  They disclose others personal secrets go around the altar with disheveled hair call out to Heaven touch their foreheads to the ground and scheme to get rid of each other and kill each other regardless of their relative degree of intimacy This is precisely the way to destroy a family The Discourse says  enters ones body and destroys it My explanation is The body is a worse nuisance than shackles Laozi considers the body to be dung and earth ākyamuni considers the three a realms of existence to be a house on re Therefore those who have renounced the world must leave behind luxury give up fame and wealth realize the difculties of staying in an inn  and wish always for the bliss of complete extinction Those who follow popular customs on the contrary seek the way to escape from death What destroys life does not die and what produces life is not produced Recently a Daoist monk who is fond of fame said that he surpasses others in the Way of the Divine Transcendents before he reached several zhang in height he fell violently to the ground When I went near him and examined him I found that he had used none other than two wings of a large bird He is truly the socalled one who cannot spread his wings and y away Analyzing the doomed fate of based on their present affairs they will come to ruin  they will be punished before they turn back Zhang Ling of the Han dynasty falsely accused people and collected a highrate tax from them was called the Grain Thieves  They were also wiped out Regarding entering ones body and destroying it isnt this something like the poem The Bow Adorned with Horn   The Discourse says Buddhism causes family members to not join together in singing or weeping My explanation is To weep when others weep is the ignorant behavior of common people To be able to sing a song in the face of someones death indicates the calm and peaceful feelings of Buddhist monks When Yuan Rang lost his parent he climbed a tree and sang a song Confucius who was passing by did not blame him This is also one aspect of the teaching on morality and ethics  The Discourse says  do not go to the court  My explanation is Confucius said The scholar sometimes will not take the high ofce of a minister of the son of Heaven nor the lower ofce of serving the prince of a state Confucian scholars are a group of philistines but they can still be like this Needless to say śramaṇas are people who are beyond this world Formerly Bocheng and Zigao and Zizhou and Zhibo simply longed for profundity and adored the Way Because of this they did not get involved in human affairs The Discourse says Those who take the tonsure commit the sin of damaging their body My explanation is My view regarding the hair and skin was completely explained in my previous answer I will further briey speak of it Generally speaking regarding the issue not to dare to damage  this is precisely in order to prevent people from doing evil offending the judicial constitution being punished with the ve penalties and having an incomplete body Today śramaṇas keep the teaching of the Sage in mind and stick to it They seek the ten stages in the distance They shave their beards and hair and put on the Dharma robe They do not go against establishing themselves and becoming famous When they attain the Way they liberate their relatives as well Those who stick to written language simply do not understand the purpose beyond what is written Even the wheelwright Bian did not pass on his skill to his son  I have nothing more to say about this The Discourse says Among those who have renounced the world I have not seen a gentleman Why are you having such difculty in making things clear The Zuozhuan says Words are an embellishment of the person Zhuangzi says If words are not extensive it is insufcient to clarify the Way Although I would prefer not speaking how would it be possible All those who have renounced the world have the stable root of the spirit from their previous existences a very deep capacity for virtue and profound intelligence Therefore their spirits are concentrated and their minds are led  Since b they rise above the world cherishing lofty thoughts even the universe cannot examine what they have in their minds They are removed from the valuable favor of their kind parents give up the joy and love of their families they empty the room in order to produce bright light  and they practice meditation abiding by the profound  Some of them practice frugal living in a forest or wilderness and give up their own bodies to hungry beasts Some lead a calm and upright life and follow a vegetarian diet They dedicate themselves without negligence They delightedly seek the ten powers  leap over to the highest path set the heavenly net free melt away the earthen web give rise to myriad merits before they fully manifest and relieve ordinary people from ten thousand kalpas What do you mean by saying  escapees from corve labor Confucius wished to have a beak three chi long Although words come out of the mouth if a long tongue does not offend other people your beak should be three zhang long How deeply the people are hurt by your annoying statements about things that have nothing to do with you The Discourse says If two grownup men out of three renounce the world why does the one have no chance for the providence  My explanation is  no chance for the providence of the Buddha were born under no chance for the providence Those who have a chance for the providence of the Buddha come into existence precisely under the karmic condition of having a chance for the providence How do I know this is so In the world there is a case where the whole family entered the Way Therefore it is said that they came into existence under the karmic condition of having the chance for the providence On the other hand there are those who have never heard about bhikṣus from the time they were born Therefore it is said that they were born under the karmic condition of having no chance for the providence Sixteen princes renounced the world on the same day and entered the Buddhist Way following their father This is exactly a case in which the whole family was drawn by the providence and reached the Buddhist Way all at once Why do you think only two grownup men out of three in a family should renounce  Those who have no chance for the providence accommodate themselves to the condition of having no chance for the providence and should simply seek to examine themselves Dont you want to put away your shield and spear What I really hope for is that you can come back from delusion The Discourse says The Daoist teaching raises virtue and makes the country great My explanation is There are ninetysix kinds of teachings The Buddhist is the most esteemed  Even if the deities of mountains and rivers can produce clouds and rain they are objects to be worshiped by the country and by families In the point of raising virtue and making the country great have more or less efcacy Nevertheless in saving extensively and boundlessly pulling them out of great afiction our vajra sage ie the Buddha alone loftily wins the victory The Buddha already existed at the beginning of time when the Grand Terminus was divided  but at that time sentient beings causes and conditions were not yet active Hence the name was hidden for the time being Why do I say this Inferring about the past before the Three Augusts how could there be neither the Book of Rites nor the Book of Changes That is to say the two hexagrams qian and kun and the two lines li and yu conveniently arose together with Heaven and Earth Even though it is said that they arose together  the reasons why these names did not arise are merely because sentient beings faculties and receptivity had not begun so the employment of these names had not yet taken place Although the principles have always existed their traces were not evident c As for the two sages one in China and the other in a foreign country  their principles are the same Therefore it is said in the Scripture on the Clean and Pure Dharma Practice  The three wise men were rst sent  They gradually led to the secular teaching Later with the Buddhist scriptures they the people to eliminate evil and follow the correct  Li Laos school is a branch of ākyamunis teaching The Buddhist scriptures say  spoke here and there but his name varied and Once he was the leader of the circle of Confucian scholars the most reverent priest of the country or a monk Or he was tranquil and inactive and yet he performed a Buddhist service What the golden mouth expounds corresponds to  just as two pieces of a tally t together precisely Why do you leap around to the east and west avoiding neither what is high nor what is low Alas When we attain the principles we are complete in the Way For this reason a śramaṇa is called a person of the Way  The people of the Yangping area are called Daoists  The Sage ākyamuni attained the foundation of the Way Penzu and Laozi occupy the end of the Way For who attained the foundation of the Way the Way is spontaneously revealed before he speaks of the Way Those who occupy the end of the Way always talk of the Way but the Way of which they speak is insufcient For instance Confucius who was deeply learned did not make his name only for expertise in a special skill but his disciples such as you and xia are regarded as all four subjects  When that is collected there is life and when it is dispersed there is death If we follow your statement and if the Way is material force the Way would then be collected and dispersed as life and death I have heard that your Way also has the subject of uniting the yin and yang energies  I wish that you will not mention this really disgraceful issue Moreover Zhuangzi says The Way exists in excrement and urine It is possible that the Way that exists in excrement and urine is your Way of uniting the yin and yang energies isnt it End of Fascicle Eight of The Collection for the Propagation and Clarication The Record that the Emperor of the Great Liang Dynasty Sets Forth the Right Logic for Spiritual Intelligence and the Attainment of Buddhahood together with the Preface and Annotation Composed by Shen Ji of Wuxing The Way of the Spirit is profound and obscure and Xuanni ie Confucius certainly had nothing to say about it Psychological operations are subtle the Archivist did not talk about it either This is not because the wisdom of these sages was not complete but it is difcult to understand with familiar feelings and if it is explained in words it is abstruse Therefore great scholars of former generations left discussions about past karma and eloquent speakers of later generations stammer when it comes to discussing ones life to come Without utmost discretion of the world how can be made clear Therefore when deluded people hear that the spirit does not cease to exist  they all think that it is eternal when they hear that thought Skt cittacarita is not eternal they all think that it becomes extinct They are doubtful about the nature based on its function and think that its nature can be extinguished they are doubtful about its function based on its nature and think that the function is not inuenced None is able to seek it exquisitely Each person has a strong inclination toward  They then cause their spontaneous nature of awakening to sink to the level of supercial talk The sage ruler received a profound auspicious omen and manages from the imperial throne He is  b aware that he should confer the law in advance of Heaven and provide teaching observing the people He fears that incoherent sophistry makes its own logic and becomes rampant Who can restore order through subtle descriptions of complicated traces The literary forms of the teaching left behind by ākyamuni are going to disappear I Ji thinking from early in my life that my body is empty set the Buddhist teaching in my mind and I often appreciate the sound of the Dharma ie the Buddhist teaching and because of this I forget to eat and sleep Nevertheless it is difcult for me having a stupid and dull temperament to understand  Regarding the great meaning of buddhanature I lost my footing and was confused in the path of my mind  Since the words of the emperor have pervaded over even distant areas all the people equally receive comfort Myriad nights have ended and eternal dawn has come to the darkness Questions about various issues are now clear and completely understood Consequently hovering like oating clouds we still sense the harmony of beautiful sounds joyful like a swimming sh we still appreciate the harmony of pure sounds produced with a stringed instrument Moreover the divine wonder is sent from the will of Heaven This is why I dance waving my hands and stepping about and cannot stop myself With supercial perception I venture to respectfully make an annotation Might this be an attempt to trace to the very source of the innermost of Heaven through the eye of a needle Practicing is based on the establishment of faith I Ji say Ignorant and dark people assuredly give rise to great intelligence Practice is not mastered for its own sake it must be cultivated based on faith Faith is mind in reliance on a teacher and in conformity with reason without disobedience Therefore the ve roots of wholesomeness take faith as the basis and faith in the four objects takes being true to them as primary To perform wholesome deeds and reach fruition is called practice The establishment of faith derives from right understanding I Ji say If we do not know right from wrong how can we attain faith Consequently the foundation of establishing faith is supported by right understanding When understanding is right external wrong views ie nonBuddhist teachings do not disturb us I Ji say If the mind is right myriad wrong views are extinguished From this it is known that when we hold right views in our minds external wrong views do not disarrange us When faith is established there are no doubts in the consciousness I Ji say Consciousness is the mind Therefore the Discourse on the Achievement of Reality says The mind thought and consciousness are the same in essence though different in name Now that the mind has faith of what are we doubtful Nevertheless what faith and understanding depend on has its foundation I Ji say To depend on means to rely on When there is the basis for having peace in the mind minor issues and actions spontaneously follow  It is evident in the following sentences that there is the basis Why Because when we examine the origin of the spiritual intelligence in which imperishability is considered to be exquisite the exquisite spirit indeed returns to wonderful fruition Therefore the sutra says When we see a dead  the body deforms and decays yet the spirit does not perish According to the actions good or bad fortune and misfortune spontaneously follows him This is precisely the meaning of the imperishability and ceaselessness  If the decays just as do grass and trees could it be said to be exquisite Because is free from cessation it returns to the culmination of subtlety after all When the mind is based on this ground all principles that you touch become clear When you are clear in numerous principles what practice could you not achieve The foundation of faith and understanding means this The essence of the wonderful fruition goes to the end of eternity The exquisite spirit cannot avoid impermanence I Ji say Regarding the wonderful fruition the principle has already been sufciently claried Hence it must go through changes Impermanence is to perish rst arise later and not stay even for a moment  When arises and is then extinguished how could there of staying ālambana the consciousness of the former must differ from that of the latter  In this case goes together with the circumstance Who then would be able to attain buddhahood I Ji say The mind moves following the circumstance This is its external operation Even though the latter follows the former this is not a discussion of reality after all Consequently it is known that the nature of the spiritual consciousness is quiet and calm and does not move Since it is quiet and calm and does not move it nally returns to the wonderful fruition The sutra says The mind is the right cause and achieves the fruition of buddhahood after all I Ji say Briey speaking of the cause of attaining buddhahood there are two meanings one is the condition that causes and the other is the right cause  The condition refers to all wholesome deeds and the right means the spiritual consciousness All wholesome deeds have the merit of helping to reveal  Therefore it is called the condition  The spiritual consciousness is the basis of the right cause Therefore it is called right cause It has already been stated that achieves the fruition of buddhahood after all This clearly veries that is ceaseless Furthermore says If ignorance is transformed it turns into intelligence According to this the purpose of the sutra should be able to be pursued in reason The mind is the basis of function The basis is one while its function varies The mutual shift between brightness and darkness is called change In the case where something leaves rst and another thing comes later this is not called change The basis which is one is nothing but ignorance and spiritual intelligence I Ji say Spiritual intelligence is based on darkness Therefore ignorance is considered to be the cause Searching for what is called ignorance it is not a category of the Grand Void Soil and stone have no feelings How then can it be said that they are ignorant I Ji say In distinguishing between good and bad we have no ideas without the mind in knowing clearly right or wrong we have no recognition without feelings Soil and stone have no minds Therefore it is known that understanding and delusion depend on the existence of the mind and a fool and an intelligent depend on the existence of consciousness When ignorance is mentioned the meaning depends on the existence of the mind Consequently it is known that while discerning thought should be intelligent its essence is subject to delusion and since deluded thought does not know it is called ignorance c I Ji say Intelligence is the real nature Therefore it must be intelligent Hence delusion unavoidably enters it Being deluded and not understanding is called ignorance Based on this the name was given How could its purport be untrue Accordingly ignorance has arising and extinction in essence Arising and extinction differ from each other in function The meaning of the ignorant mind does not change I Ji say Inasmuch as there is essence there is function When speaking of function it is not essence When speaking of essence it is not function In function there are arising and falling away but in essence there is no arising or extinction I am afraid that if one sees that function varies he will think that the mind is extinguished following the circumstance Apart from essence there is no function When people see staying not too far away they may become confused about that essence and function sustain a relation of staying not too close when they are confused about staying not too close they think that the mind is extinguished following the circumstance Therefore the term zhudi is added after the name ignorance This shows that ignorance is precisely spiritual intelligence and the nature of the spiritual intelligence does not change I Ji say The reason to link the term zhudi to ignorance is probably to expel the deluded consciousness Those who harbor afictions have not perceived  How do we know this If the mind formerly committed a heavy evil act which causes one to fall into Avīci Hell and later the consciousness gives rise to the excellent wholesomeness of nonthought good and evil are very far apart from each other in reason and there is a big difference between the former and the latter I Ji say If there is no basis function has nothing on which to rely A deluded person sees that the similar categories are continuous and thus considers them to be the same Therefore the great wholesomeness is taken up in order to expel the confusion about this continuation From this it is known that the former evil is spontaneously extinguished yet the deluded consciousness does not change and even though the latter wholesomeness arises the mind of darkness does not change I Ji say The arising and extinction of good and evil never damage the basis Therefore the sutra says What is accompanied by the bondage of delement is called ignorance and what is accompanied by all wholesome things is called intelligence Isnt it that the nature of consciousness is one and it varies following conditions I Ji say If good and evil alternately arise how can it then be said that they are together Nevertheless these words are constantly opposed to each other and their purposes are always indistinct Therefore this important sentence is given in order to explain this to the many deluded people Hence it is known that the change of arising and extinction requites a past cause and the alternation of good and evil arises in the present state of the mind I Ji say Arising and extinction are caused by actions one previously performed it is not that they are caused by the present state of the mind Good and evil arise in the current state of the mind it is not that ones actions done in the past cause them Moreover the mind is the basis I Ji say Even though the function differs the essence does not Since the basis of the function is ceaseless the law of the attainment of buddhahood is bright Since it changes following the state of the mind it is clear that birth and death can be brought to an end I Ji say That the attainment of buddhahood is bright relies on the basis That birth and death can be brought to an end is derived from the function If there is function but no basis one is extinguished and does not attain  If there is basis but no function one attains and there is nothing to extinguish Criticism of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit Preface by Xiao Chen a Fan Zizhen  the elder brother of my wife wrote the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit in which he claried that there is no buddha He says that he has defeated numerous people in argument and caused a thousand people to surrender in a single day I would like to examine some doubtful points and inquire about what I have not yet understood What the Discourse has maintained up to today is about the physical body and the spirit and what it argues is the principle is exquisite For instance the fact that offerings are presented with lial piety at the ancestral temple in spring and autumn is considered to be for what the sages in accordance with the Way of the Spirit laid down instructions and rites and guarded against ignorance Du Bo fully drew a bow to shoot King Xuan Boyou who had been killed by a man of Zheng state walked around in armor It is said that monsters spontaneously appear between Heaven and Earth it is not that people who died became ghosts In this way it is impossible to crossexamine with the Book of Odes and the Book of History or to compare with things that happened in the past If body and spirit are one and exist and are extinguished at the same time then Fan Zi will exult and rouse himself in an impregnable fortress in the distance If spirit and body separate from each other and arise and go to ruin at different  I will overcome my enemy and attain superiority and my task will be completed Moreover even though I make clear that there are buddhas my treatment of buddha is not the same as that of other secular people I will explain my real intention at the same time and attach it after the Discourse The Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit The questions and answers are those between a guest and a host in the original text of the Discourse the criticism is my present inquiry Question You say that the spirit is extinguished How do you know it is extinguished Answer The spirit conforms to the body and the body conforms to the spirit For this reason when the body exists the spirit does too When the body withers away the spirit is extinguished Question The body is the name of what has no perception The spirit is the name of what has perception There are differences in conformity with phenomena between what has perception and what does not In reason it is not acceptable that spirit and body are one That body and spirit conform to each other is not what I have learned Answer The body is the substance of the spirit and the spirit is the function of the body This means precisely that the body is the substance and the spirit is the function It should then give evidence for their inseparability However simply b says The spirit conforms to the body and the body conforms to the spirit It is impossible that body and spirit differ from each other This is debating without evidence Here I will testify on the basis of dreams that it is impossible that body and spirit are one While someone is asleep his body is an object that has no perception but it has occasion to see something This is because the spirit goes out and makes contact with  The spirit does not stand by itself it must inhabit the body It is just like that people do not live in the open air but need a house in which to live When the spirit returns to the body the consciousness becomes slightly confused and in its confusion what has seen becomes a dream When people come back to their homes their spirits are suddenly obstructed Since their spirits have suddenly become obstructed brightness turns to darkness Sometimes in a dream people soar up into the deep sky or travel ten thousand li to a distant place if the spirit does not travel does the body go If the body does not go and the spirit does not separate from the body how could a case like this be possible It is said that is a manifestation of what one thinks So when a person peacefully enjoys deep sleep his body is like a piece of wood that lies at and his breath is like cold ashes If it is said that spirit and body are one this means that both the outside and the inside are inactive If a does not have contact with sounds from the external world how then could he give rise internally to thoughts From this it can be certainly known that even if the body is motionless the spirit moves swiftly Furthermore I have questions about dreams in general Zhao Jianzi dreamed of a naked boy singing a song that could as meaning that the state of Wu would invade the state of Zou One of the eunuchs of the state of Jin dreamed that he had ascended to Heaven carrying the marquis on his back but in fact at midday on the same day he had to carry the marquis on his back out of the privy  These are examples of this Qi dreamed that he had shot an arrow at the middle of the moon The empress of Wu state dreamed that her intestines left her body and ew around the Gate of Heaven  These are examples of this Jiang dreamed that Heaven named his son Yu A man of Cao state dreamed that many gentlemen were plotting to ruin the state of Cao These are examples of this he rice crop and shi to lose Wang Jun had a dream about three swords and became a district magistrate of a province since the Chinese character zhou province consists of three of the Chinese character dao sword These are examples of this Some have nothing that conforms to reality A man of the northern tribe dreamed of a boat A man of the Yue region in southern China where river boats are a major means of transportation had a dream of riding a horse These are examples of this Some later come true and some do not The head of the Yin dynasty obtained Fu Yue in a dream Emperor Wen of the Han dynasty dreamed that he obtained Deng Tong testify to dreams that later came true All of these indicate that the mutation of the spirit is vague and uncertain and the unseen world and this world is unpredictable This is easy to understand in brief but difcult to discuss thoroughly with logic If it is not accepted that the spirit goes out  all must be sought within the body I am afraid that a piece of the hidden spirit is cut off from seeing the external world Although you lean on the six kinds of dreams or try to aid with conception and cause it is impossible in reason Question The spirit is originally not the substance and the body is originally not the function either Their names differ from each other but their essences are one Question Their names already differ from each other Why is it possible that their essences are one Answer  between spirit and substance is similar to that between sharpness and a sword between body and function is similar to that between a sword and its sharpness The word sharpness is not the sword the word sword is not sharpness There is however no sword apart from its sharpness and there is no sharpness apart from the sword I have not heard that when a sword disappears its sharpness remains How could it be possible that the body is lost yet the spirit remains Criticism The sharpness that a sword possesses is due to the effect of the sharpened on a whetstone Therefore it can slice iguanodons and dragons in water and cut rhinoceroses and tigers on land If its sharpness is used up thoroughly and its function comes to an end the swords tip and edges will certainly break and the sword becomes blunt Just like this sharpness is lost yet the sword remains Namely the spirit is lost yet the body remains Why do you say there is no sword apart from sharpness and the words sword and sharpness differ from each other but their essences are one Since a sword and sharpness are not extinguished together body and spirit do not perish together either Even though you are capable of making an example from familiar things it goes against reality in reason Question  a sword and sharpness is probably as you say but the signicance of body and spirit is not the same as this Why do I say so The substance of a tree has no perception while the substance of a human being has perception A human being already has substance as does a tree yet has perception that a tree does not have Isnt it that a tree has one but a human being has two  Answer This sounds strange If a human being has substance like that of a tree that is considered to be the body and he has perception which a tree does not have that is regarded as the spirit then it might be as you say Now regarding the substance of a human being this substance has perception As for the substance of a tree its substance has no perception The substance of a human being is not that of a tree the substance of a tree is not that of a human being The reason the substance of a human being differs from that of a tree is because has perception Would a human being who has no perception be any different from a tree Answer A human being does not have substance without perception It is just as a tree does not have a body that has perception Question Isnt the dead body a substance without perception Answer If that is the case a human being surely has a substance like that of a tree as well as the perception that distinguishes from a tree Answer A dead body has substance like that of a tree yet it does not have the perception that distinguishes from a tree A living person has this perception that distinguishes from a tree yet he or she does not have a substance like that of a tree Question Isnt the skeleton of a dead body the same as that of a living person Answer A living body is not a dead body a dead body is not a living body How could a person who has the skeleton of a living person have the skeleton of a dead body Question If the skeleton of a living person is not the same as that of a dead body the skeleton must not derive from that of a living person If does not derive from the skeleton of a living person from where does this skeleton come  a Answer It comes from the skeleton of a living person which changes and becomes the skeleton Question Even if the skeleton of a living person changes and becomes the skeleton wouldnt there be death on the basis of life So it is known that a dead body is still a living body Answer If a leafy tree changes and becomes a withered tree with no leaves how could the substance of the withered tree be same essence as that of the leafy tree Question The essence of a leafy changes and becomes the essence of a withered  The essence of a withered is exactly the essence as that of a leafy  It is just like the essence of very ne thread that changes and becomes the essence of twisted yarn the essence of the twisted yarn is exactly the same essence as that of the very ne thread Is there anything faulty in this Answer If a withered is exactly a leafy and a leafy is nothing other than a withered should then appear withered when it is ourishing and bear fruit when it is withered Moreover a leafy tree should not change and become a withered tree Since a leafy is exactly a withered  no further change can happen to a withered  In addition if a leafy and a withered are the same why isnt a tree rst withered and leaess only later does it have leaves Why is it rst leafy and later withered  When life leaves his body should be suddenly and completely exhausted Why does his dead body remain for a long time Answer There must be a sequential order in the essence of arising and extinction Therefore what arises suddenly must be extinguished suddenly what arises gradually must be extinguished gradually What arises gradually are such things as animals or plants There is sudden and gradual  The Discourse says The substance of a human being has perception while the substance of a tree has no perception Isnt this because a human being recognizes when it is cold or hot he knows pain and itchiness he lives when he is nourished and dies when he is injured A tree is the same It is leafy in spring and withered in fall When it is planted it must grow but when it is pulled out  it must die Why do you think has no perception Here now the substance of a human being is just like that of a tree When the spirit stays  the body arises when the spirit leaves the body the body is exhausted arises is precisely like a leafy tree and is exhausted is exactly like a withered tree Why do you assert that this is not the perception of the spirit and say that substance has perception Myriad things are all perceived by the spirit they are not perceived by the substance The nature of grass trees and insects is however to simply be aware of ourishing withering arising and extinction The consciousness of a human being distinguishes safety from danger or advantage from disadvantage Why do you say it is not that has substance like that of a tree which becomes the body and has perception that distinguishes from a tree which becomes the spirit This would mean that body and spirit exist as two that can be distinguished from each other Trees merely receive the partial energy of yin and yang while human beings bear the exquisite intellectual function of the numinous being In consciousness both are probably the same but they differ from each other in spirit In the discussion on the skeleton of a dead body and that  and in the explanation for giving and receiving death and life judgment has already been previously settled The issues are absurd as well In the case where the body conforms to the spirit are body parts such as hands considered to be the spirit too Answer All are parts of the spirit Question If all are parts of the spirit then just as the spirit ought to be able to think hands and other body parts should be able to think too Answer Hands and other body parts have perception pain and itchiness but they have no faculty of thinking to judge right or wrong Question Are perception and thought the same or different Answer Perception is precisely thought What is shallow becomes perception and what is deep becomes thought  Question If this is so there ought to be two kinds of thoughts Since there are two kinds of thoughts are there then also two kinds of spirits Answer The body of a human being is only one How could it be possible to have two kinds of spirits Question If there cannot be two kinds of spirits why does a human being have perception pain and itchiness as well as the faculty of thinking to judge right or wrong Answer Even though hands differ from feet they all are of a person and even though right and wrong or pain and itchiness differ from each other they all are of the spirit Question If the faculty of thinking to judge right or wrong is not concerned with hands and feet with what should it be concerned Answer The faculty of thinking to judge right or wrong is taken charge of by the heart organ Question The heart organ is the heart of the ve internal organs ie heart liver spleen lungs and kidneys isnt it Answer Correct Question What distinction is there among the ve internal organs Does only the heart have the faculty of thinking to judge right or wrong Answer What difference is there among the seven apertures in the human head  Their functions are not equal Why Question Thought has no set pattern How is it known that this is taken charge of by the heart organ Answer When the mind becomes ill the faculty of thinking falls into disorder From this it is known that the heart is the basis of thought  Question How do you know that does not lodge in other body parts such as the eyes Answer If the faculty of thinking can lodge in the eyes why does the faculty of sight not lodge in the ears Question Since the essence of thought has no basis it can lodge in the eyes Why do the eyes have the basis Why does thought have no basis Is this the case No it is not Criticism such as hands are of the spirit This indicates that the spirit takes the body as the essence When the essence is complete the spirit is complete too when the essence is injured the spirit becomes decient What is spirit It is discernment and thought Now even if a person receives a cut on his hands and feet or his skin and esh are damaged his wisdom does not fall into disorder The spirit simply employs wisdom in order to do things and it lodges in the organs in order to facilitate the intellectual function It is similar to dwellings which have a gate on the east to invite wise people a balcony on the south for views a window on the north to take in fresh air and carved windowsills on the west that project the moon the host uprightly occupies the middle of the room and conducts all his business If the issue is just as your discourse says each of the sense organs of the mouth nose ears and eyes has its part of the spirit Then if an eye becomes ill the spirit of the visual sense will be damaged and both eyes ought to go blind together if an ear becomes ill the spirit of the auditory sense will be harmed and both ears ought to go deaf together From this it is known that the spirit is considered to be the organ but is not considered to be the essence Moreover says The heart is the basis of thought Thought cannot lodge in other parts In regard to the mouth eyes ears and nose this view is correct If however it is concerned with other peoples minds this is not so Although the ears and nose work together with one body they cannot be mixed together It is because what each of them has control of differs from the other organs and the function of each organ differs from that of the others  Even though other peoples minds exist in each of their bodies it is possible to communicate with one another This is because the principles of the mind are equally ingenious and discernment and thought are equal in achievement Why do you say that Zhang Jias mind cannot lodge in Wang Yis body or Li Bings nature cannot lodge in Zhao Dings body Question Sages bodies are similar to those of ordinary people but there is a difference between ordinary people and sages Hence it is known that body differs from spirit Answer This is not so Pure gold can shine while impure gold cannot Could there be a case where pure gold which can shine has the essence of impurity which cannot shine Moreover could there be a case where the spirit of a sage lodges in the body of an ordinary person There is no case where the spirit of an ordinary person lodged in the body of a sage either Therefore xun had eight variegated colors and hua had eyes with double pupils Xuan ie the Yellow Emperor had a forehead resembling that of a dragon and Gao had a mouth like that of a horse These are differences in physical appearance In Bi Gans heart seven apertures stand side by side Boyues gall was as large as a st These are differences in the heart and internal organs Therefore it is known that the characteristics of sages always differ from those of ordinary people It is not only that their way is more remarkable than that of sentient beings the bodies of sages also go beyond those of all creatures in the world You said that sages bodies must differ from those of ordinary people I venture to ask you Yang Huo looked like Confucius and of Xiang Ji resembled those of Emperor Shun Between Shun and Xiang or between Confucius and Yang there are differences in intelligence even though they were similar in appearance What is the reason for this Answer The stone called min resembles jade but it is not jade the bird called ju looks like a male phoenix but it is not a male phoenix In things there really are such cases The features of Xiang and Yang are similar to those of Emperor Shun and Confucius respectively but the former are not in reality It is because the heart organs of Xiang Ji and Yang Huo are not equal  their physical features alone is meaningless Question You may say that ordinary people and sages differ from each other their bodies and internal organs are not the same Sages are completely perfect and they are peerless in reason It is more evident here Answer Regarding the issue that sages are equally sages they are equal in sacred ability but this does not mean that their bodies must be the same It is just like horses whose coats vary in color run equally fast or jade stones that are diverse in color are still equally beautiful Therefore the jade produced in Chuiji of Jin state and He of Chu state are as valuable as fteen cities Hualiu and Daoli could both gallop a thousand li  Question I have already heard that body and spirit are nondual That the spirit is extinguished when the body withers should be indeed so in reason I dare ask you the Canon says They prepare the ancestral temple and make offerings to serve the spirits of the deceased What does this mean Answer The sages teaching is exactly so  God is the one who claries it This is the meaning Question Pengsheng who had been executed for murdering Lord Huan of Lu state appeared as a boar These incidents are recorded in ancient books Things about ghosts are vague they may or may not exist There are many who die an unnatural death yet not all of them become ghosts Why would only Pengsheng and Boyou do so Now he is a man now a boar It is not necessarily the case that is the son of the lord of Qi state or Zheng state Question The Book of Changes says Thus it is known that the condition of spiritual beings is similar to the law of Heaven and Earth and there is no difference between these two Furthermore it says There is a carriage full of ghosts What do these mean Answer There are birds and animals y and run There are people and disembodied spirits The Discourse says Could there be a case where the spirit of a sage lodges in the body of an ordinary person There is no case where the spirit of an ordinary person lodges in the body of a sage either Yang Huo looked like Confucius and Xiang Ji resembled Emperor Shun These are precisely that the spirit of an ordinary person can lodge in the body of a sage The stone min and jade or the bird ju and a male phoenix cannot be used as parables  The stone min has its own name min jade is truly called jade the full name of the bird ju is designated as yuanju a male phoenix is called the divine phoenix The names already differ from each other and their features differ from each other in reality as well Shun had the eyes with double pupils and Xiang Ji also had eyes with double pupils This is not the case of having two different names min and jade Furthermore there are other examples such as that Nwa had a body like a snake and Gao Yao had a mouth like a horse not only that the spirit of a sage can enter into the body of an ordinary person but also that the spirit can subsequently lodge in the body of an insect or animal From this it is more evident that body and spirit differ from each other and brightness and darkness are not the same If body and spirit are uniform and the cause of the former existence is cut off in reason only a sage ought to be born to a sage a worthy person must give a birth to a worthy person and a brave person a coward an ignorant person and an intelligent person are all supposed to resemble their parents  The Discourse further says Sages are equal in sacred ability This does not mean that their abilities must be the same It is just like horses whose coats vary in color run equally fast Here are the horses coats the abilities that run fast Among horses whose coats are the same color old wornout horses and ne horses may differ  In this way the color of the horses coat has nothing to do with the characteristic of running fast This is because in body there is no sacred ability In the body of a human being there is no difference between an ordinary person and a sage but there is a difference between being strong and being weak Therefore a patient spirit stays in a profound body while an impatient spirit dwells in an approachable body Regarding the bodies of sages mentioned previously by  he directly refers to the bodies of Confucius and Shun but he does not say that their bodies have sacred intelligence If I know that my spirit is extinguished what advantage is there  Answer ramaṇas ruin popular customs Just as erce winds blow and fog arises spreads out widely without stopping I lament its baneful inuence and intend to save those who indulge in  People use up their wealth in order to go to Buddhist monks and they go bankrupt in order to follow the Buddha yet they neither sympathize with their relatives nor feel pity for poor and destitute people It is really because they have the deep feeling to favor themselves and a shallow intention to save others Isnt this because they expect a great reward from the Buddhist monks but no repayment from their friend  delude people with obscure words frighten people with torment in Avīci Hell decoy people with preposterous talk and make people joyful with happiness in Tuṣita Heaven Therefore take off the Confucian robe and put on a Buddhist monks robe They abandon the sacricial stand and pot and arrange vases and bowls  In every family people give up attachment to their family members Every one cuts off his offspring As a result causes soldiers to lose courage in military affairs ofcials to absent themselves from government ofces grain to be used up because of peoples laziness and commodities to be exhausted because of construction projects voices praising the Buddhas excellence are still powerful This is all because of  This tendency continues without stopping and the harm goes on limitlessly the common people are satised with their elds and gentlemen remain calm being free from avarice If people till the land and obtain food we will not run short of supplies of food If they raise silkworms in order to obtain clothing we will not run out of clothes When people of the lower classes have a surplus they will offer it to those of the upper class People of the upper class maintain wuwei and wait for the common people  Then people can fulll the entire course of their lives attend their parents with devotion manage themselves act for the sake of others do things for the good of the country and make their ruler powerful The existence of the Buddha depends on whether or not the principles of the mind exist From now I will point out the gains and losses and speak of its advantages and disadvantages in order to correct your excessive discussion Some monks do so but this is not the Buddhas fault When the Buddha established the teaching its basis was to be fond of life to abhor killing to practice good deeds and to be engaged in almsgiving To be fond of life is not only limited to the wish that birds and animals should multiply but also to consider that the numen of a human being is important Could it be possible that to abhor killing means to suspend a sentence forgive a criminal or let a criminal abscond This refers to investigating criminals and judging them with sympathy To practice good deeds does not necessarily mean to revere one zhang and six chi tall It is to consider faithfulness and honesty as superior To be engaged in almsgiving does not at all mean to use up ones wealth for construction projects If everyone were to cut off his offspring the Dharma seed would certainly never be transmitted Even ordinary people understand this At present if Buddhist monks who wait by the stump hoping other hares will come by that same spot because they once caught a hare at that place and confused petty people see someone with cold they do not give even a poor article of clothing to him or if they encounter a starving man they do not give even coarse food to him Nevertheless vie with one another in gathering Buddhist monks who lack insight and compete with one another in making many buddha  They abandon their relatives and never think of them They abolish offering sacrices and never practice moral cultivation They tear up good silk fabric Buddhist temples and a scatter cinnabar and gold under pagodas They think such acts are all for a eld of merit and expect a reward This is all because their comprehension of the Buddha is not deep and their understanding of the Dharma is not excellent Even though they call the Buddha the Buddha do they understand the purpose of taking refuge in the Buddha They call a Buddhist monk a Buddhist monk yet how could they reach the meaning of following Buddhist monks In this condition divine beings do not bless them I can do nothing for them either In the ways of the six schools of philosophy each has had a longaccumulated evil effect This is entirely because the founders lost the transmission and came to fall into the mire You pick up the fault of being too severe and sophistic but you do not blame the founders Han and Deng  Yet you punish only our Tathāgata and disparage his right perfect enlightenment This is similar to becoming angry at wind and waves and destroying a ship  Rebels and villains presently deceive the ruler and their parents who are in a superior social position and they are cruel to people of the same class in an inferior social position Some do not fear the brilliant law  but are suddenly afraid of the government ofce of the netherworld They shrink from King Yamas ferocity and fear the brutality of the oxheaded wardens of hell Consequently they repent their evils and reform themselves This is an advantage  Moreover the law of evil acts and meritorious deeds cannot differ from that of the worldly teaching and should not go against human feeling If there is someone who serves the ruler with loyalty earnestly attends his parents with lial piety and is trusted by his friends it never happens to such a person that if he commits a fault that squanders his virtue he is disdained and abandoned or if he commits the sin of killing insects or sh he falls into hell Lord Yi slaughtered an animal in order to nourish King Tang Zengzi cooked a fowl in order to nourish Dian Both of these men however went to the hell of intense heat  and to the hell of sharppointed swords together they served their superiors yet they were against beneting their inferiors Formerly Mi Zi made a false statement and rode a carriage of the lord of Wei state because he was rushing to his sick mother but he was spared from execution because of his great generosity Alas I once thought that the numinous artisan is not as good as the lord of Wei state Therefore it is known that this is a precaution for merciless people and not an admonition for kindhearted people If we thoroughly examine its deviation and arbitrariness the fault does not lie in the Buddha When we observe fortune and misfortune we realize that the teaching was given in order to lead  For this reason when the body exists the spirit does too When the body withers away the spirit is extinguished Criticism Body does not conform to spirit and spirit does not conform to body These are united and then they perform functions Accordingly uniting is not conforming While one is alive are united and perform functions At the time of death the body still remains but the spirit departs On what basis do I say so In former times Zhao Jianzi was ill for ve days during which he did not recognize people  b and Lord Mu of Qin state came to his senses seven days  Both of their spirits traveled to the place of the Celestial Thearch where the Thearch had magnicent music played for them in Juntian  Is this an example that the body remains while the spirit departs If the spirit is extinguished when the body perishes as the Discourse says then body and spirit should certainly be together just as a shadow or echo  If this is so when the body is ill the spirit would also be ill How then could only the spirits travel to the Celestial Thearch and be delighted by the magnicent music of Juntian while their bodies they did not recognize the people  This means that the spirit communicates with others while one sleeps Therefore the spirit became a buttery and ew around That is to say his body and spirit separated from each other Namely his body and spirit were united When they are united they become one entity when they separate from each other the body perishes and the spirit departs Therefore when Jizi of Yanling buried his son he said The bones and esh return again to the earth but the spirit in its energy can go everywhere This exactly means that even though the body perishes the spirit is not extinguished If this is so then the clear testimonies found in the scriptures and history books are of uncommon brilliance How could it be that when the body perishes the spirit is extinguished The Discourse says The questioner says The Canon says They prepare the ancestral temple and make offerings to serve spirits of the deceased The explanation says It is not that there are spirits of the deceased This is because the sages teaching is exactly so What the Discourse says is completely a sentimental expression not the sages purpose Please let me quote a passage from the Canon of Filial Piety in order to testify to the sages teaching The Canon of Filial Piety says Formerly the Duke of Zhou sacriced to Houji Minister of Agriculture at the border altar in order to enshrine him as the correlate of Heaven and he honored King Wen in the Brilliant Hall in order to enshrine him as the correlate of the Supreme Thearch If body and spirit are extinguished together who then was enshrined as the correlate of Heaven and who was enshrined as the correlate of the Supreme Thearch If ji did not really exist and yet he was vainly enshrined as the correlate of Heaven this is precisely to deceive Heaven and it also deceives the people How could one who establishes a teaching on the basis of deception and falsity cause people to master the mind of a lial child and oppress thoughts of slighting  Seeking for the purpose of the Discourse its prerequisite is that the spirit does not exist I will try to question closely again Confucius offered a small amount of vegetable soup and melons in sacrice at his ancestral temple The Book of Rites says We welcome the spirits of ancestors with joy and send them off with sadness If there is no spirit what are we supposed to welcome in reception If there is no spirit what are we supposed to send off at that time If was happy when he welcomed  it would be false happiness that appeared on his face If he was sad when departed the tears he shed from his body would be false If this was the case then in the religious services Confucius performed deception lled his mind and his ancestral temple was full of falsity Could the sages teaching be like this Nevertheless you say The sages teaching is exactly so Why I Siwen speak I personally read Fan Zhens Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit in which he made himself the guest as well as the host Consequently there are more than thirty articles Without thinking of my ignorance I Siwen slightly criticized only two articles of the important points of the Discourse I earnestly desire to break the root with this When I look up I disgrace a blessing from Heaven and when I look down I tremble in fear as a consequence of  The two articles you criticized will be separately read in detail Body does not conform to spirit and spirit does not conform to body These are united and then they perform functions Accordingly uniting is not conforming Answer If are united and perform functions it is clear that they have no function unless they are united It is just like the animal called qiong and the animal called ju depend on each other if one of them becomes disabled the other cannot  Will you however become reinforcement for me Criticism In former times Zhao Jianzi was ill for ve days during which he did not recognize people  and Lord Mu of Qin state came to his senses seven days  Both of their spirits traveled to the place of the Celestial Thearch where the Thearch had magnicent music played for them in Juntian Is this an example that the body remains while the spirit departs Answer Regarding the issue that Zhao Jianzi became a distinguished guest and Lord Mu of Qin state traveled to the Celestial Thearch since it is said that they enjoyed the magnicent music of Juntian with their ears and made themselves easy tasting all sorts of food and drink with their mouths it is possible that they pacied their bodies in a grand mansion their eyes were delighted with a good view of the universe they wore beautifully embroidered robes and they bit and reined a dragon Therefore it is known that what the spirit expects does not differ from what people do Each of the four limbs and the seven apertures in the head is equal to those of the body Since it cannot go far with a single wing it ies with both wings If the spirit is extinguished when the body perishes as the Discourse says then body and spirit should certainly be together just as a shadow or echo  If this is so when the body is ill the spirit would also be ill If the issue is just as you think then when the body is ill the spirit is not in such a case the body would feel pain but the spirit would not When one has an afiction he is anxious in this case the body has anxiety yet the spirit does not If anxiety and pain have already been experienced by the body in this way how could the spirit be bothered for nothing I Cao  think that are united and perform functions while one is alive they share pain and disablement When one dies the body remains and the spirit travels Therefore that traveled to the Celestial Thearch is different from the body Criticism  the spirit communicates with others while one sleeps Therefore the spirit became a buttery and ew around When he awoke his body began functioning and he became the veritable Zhuangzi Namely his body and his spirit were united Answer This criticism can be said to be a thorough argument but it cannot be said to be the one who has mastered the principle You say The spirit became a buttery and ew around Did truly become a ying insect If so when in a dream someone becomes a cow he would then bear the shafts of another persons cart on his  back or if he becomes a horse in a dream he would then be ridden by other people the next morning there would be a dead cow or a dead horse  However there is no such thing Moreover her intestines ew around the Gate of Heaven  She should have died instantly How could she continue to live after losing her liver and lungs Furthermore the sun and moon have their places in the sky and land stretches a thousand li between east and west as well as between south and north It is unlikely that comes down and enters into the bosom of a common woman Dreams and phantasms are unreal It is too extraordinary if we were to take them to be real If we unite ourselves with intelligence and ponder over the sky we can travel all around the sky from our seats If our spirits are confused within us we untruly see peculiar things How could it be that Zhuangzi became a buttery and really disported himself in the south garden and Zhao Jianzi truly ascended to the Gate of Heaven My cousin Xiao Chen at Ying also keeps grumbling about this based on dreams  Yanling buried his son he said The bones and esh return again to the earth and the spirit in its energy can go everywhere This exactly means that even though the body perishes the spirit is not extinguished Answer When a human being is born the energy is provided from Heaven and the body is received from Earth What the Discourse says is completely a sentimental expression not the sages purpose Please let me quote a passage from the Canon of Filial Piety in order to testify to the sages teaching The Canon of Filial Piety says Formerly the Duke of Zhou sacriced to Houji at the border altar in order to enshrine him as the correlate of Heaven and he honored King Wen in the Brilliant Hall in order to enshrine him as the correlate of the Supreme Thearch If body and spirit are extinguished together who then was enshrined as the correlate of Heaven and who was enshrined as the correlate of the Supreme Thearch Answer If everyone is equally a sage or a very wise person the teaching originally does not exist The peoples feeling usually values life and despises death If they believe that there is a numinous being after death a feeling of awe increases but there is nothing to know after death they give rise to disrespectful thoughts Furthermore faithful and honest people have the foundation of their minds while rufans are awestruck on this point Therefore the Canon  They make the ancestral temple where they present offerings to disembodied spirits That is to say by employing the way of disembodied spirits we perform this lial offering Furthermore the Canon of Filial Piety says In spring and autumn they offer sacrices thinking of as the seasons come round claried that he encourages people to honor their ancestors  it is forbidden that one who dies in the morning is forgotten in the evening Why did not allow to serve them It is because if a person has cognition after death slight life and immolate himself  Why did not clearly say that exists and why did he give such an evasive answer Examining its meaning it is already discerned that cognition does not exist after death If Houji did not really exist and yet he was vainly enshrined as the correlate of Heaven this is precisely to deceive Heaven and it also deceives the people This would indicate that this sages teaching guides the people with deception and falsity How could one who establishes a teaching on the basis of deception and falsity cause people to master the mind of a lial child and oppress thoughts of slighting  Answer A sage is the one who manifests benevolence who stores up his functions within who thoroughly comprehends the spirit and who completely knows the processes of transformation Therefore it is said that The sage masters his principle while the wise person keeps to his principle Could it be possible to seek only the means and limit the teaching by words Deception merely refers to impeding edication corrupting customs and leading the people to injustice Please let me ask you a question King Tang banished King Jie and King Wu founder of the Zhou dynasty attacked King Zhou  These cases are of killing a sovereign arent they Nevertheless Mencius said I have heard that put the fellow Zhou to death but I have never heard that he killed a sovereign You do not blame the sages conduct of banishing or committing regicide Nevertheless you make strenuous efforts regarding the issue that offering a sacrice to ji is absurd dont you Why do things come to this Criticism  We welcome with joy and send them off with sadness And so on Answer The signicance of this issue is naturally understood without thorough explanation I will not waste words on a useless issue There are many statements about this in the Book of Rites I recently try to write about this section but regret a bit that I have not completed it I Siwen speak I read for the rst time the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit composed by Fan Zhen in response  He still holds fast to his previous delusion I Siwen tried to speculate about his logic and principle and charged forward with the four demonstrations I am however ignorant and shallow in feeling and intelligence and I have nothing with which to refute his vigorous discussion When I look up I cover the sacred mirror with dust and when I look down I tremble in fear as a consequence of  Zhen already established the meaning by going against the scriptures and he delivered a talk that opposes the truth It is difcult to upbraid with sacredness those who have lost sacredness and it is difcult to berate with the truth those who oppose the truth If the situation is like this on the whole it is all right to stop debating in language  The Second Criticism of Secretariat Fans Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit The Discourse says If are united and perform functions it is clear that they have no function unless they are united It is just like the animal called qiong and the animal called ju depend on each other if one of them becomes disabled the other cannot  Will you however become reinforcement for meThe Discourse again says  between body and spirit is similar to that between a sword and its sharpness  I have not heard that when a sword disappears its sharpness remains How could it be possible that the body is lost yet the spirit remains furthermore says  Yanling said that the body vanishes underground and the spirit extinguishes into Heaven Therefore it is said can go everywhere also says That ji is enshrined as the correlate of Heaven does not deceive Heaven It is just like when King Tang banished and King Wu attacked  these are not cases of killing a sovereign You do not blame the sages conduct of banishing and committing regicide Nevertheless you make strenuous efforts regarding the issue that offering a sacrice to ji is absurd dont you Criticism The animals qiong and ju is evidence only for the case that functions are made of what are united it is not evidence for the issue that when the body dies the spirit immediately perishes If the qiong is now killed the ju does not die and if the ju is beheaded the qiong does not perish They do not conform to each other At present you refer to these as keen evidence and good reinforcement regarding the issue that body and spirit perish together This is as if you were to give someone a spear that points toward yourself and you then seek a way to survive How sad This is nothing but the rst testimony for the issue that the body dies yet the spirit is not extinguished You say in the Discourse  between body and spirit is similar to that between a sword and its sharpness I have not heard that when a sword disappears its sharpness remains How could it be possible that the body is lost yet the spirit remains The ground of your discourse on the issue that body and spirit perish together is merely this single point An ignorant person has a delusion Spirit and body the two things are united and perform functions A sword and its sharpness are simply two different names for the same thing At present you refer to a thing with two different names and try to prove that two different things are united and function This looks like a hairbreadths difference but in fact it is a difference of thousands of li This is also the second testimony for the issue that the body dies yet the spirit is not extinguished Furthermore gives the statement of Yanling The body vanishes underground and the spirit extinguishes into Heaven The Discourse says that body and spirit are one entity and they conform to each other If the body dies here then the spirit should also perish in the body How could it be said that the body vanishes underground and the spirit extinguishes into Heaven This is also the third testimony for the issue that the body dies yet the spirit is not extinguished Moreover says That ji is enshrined as the correlate of Heaven does not deceive Heaven It is just like when King Tang banished and King Wu attacked  these are not cases of killing a sovereign Is this supposed to remove evils by expedients The rulers Tang and Yu  however had no trouble in banishing or attacking their immediate predecessors It is understandable in this case the era was not peaceful it was the last period of the three ancient dynasties ie Xia Shang and Zhou and the teaching was established as an expedient in order to relieve the people temporarily therefore ji was enshrined for the time  being as the correlate of Heaven and King Wen was enshrined temporarily as the correlate of the Supreme Thearch Now Heaven has been deceived and the Supreme Thearch has been slandered What has been quoted to support is like this This is again the fourth testimony for the issue that the body dies yet the spirit is not extinguished These four testimonies have already been established and the root of the Discourse has spontaneously collapsed The remaining various side issues will be dispersed before the wind blows away The Discourse says  We welcome the spirits of ancestors with joy and send them off with sadness The signicance of this issue is naturally understood without thorough explanation I will not waste on a useless issue There are many statements about this in the Book of Rites further says Deception merely refers to impeding edication and corrupting customs I said in my previous criticism If was happy when he welcomed  it would be false happiness that appeared on his face If he was sad when departed the tears he shed from his body would be false In fact the scaling ladder of my vulgar criticism and the sharp point of my weak reason lie in these words You the respondent however have not understood them well and say only  is naturally understood without thorough explanation Please let me explain it again According to the purport of your discourse you already admit that Confucius had false happiness and false tears In addition you admit that ji was enshrined as the correlate of Heaven indicates pointing to nonexistence and considering it as existence   This is not something that can be divined with diagrams it is something kept away from wise sayings You however say  it is possible to stabilize the upper class of the society and govern the people  Why The Discourse says It is already understood  but an ignorant person has not yet understood it I will again send an inquiry in a humble way If you would like to talk about the nonexistence of the Buddha you should establish host and guest make the points of argument clear distinguish the strong points from the weak points refute the Buddhist doctrine that your opponent asserts by means of the Buddhist doctrine that you understand Then the reason supporting the existence of the Buddha falters and the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit spontaneously prevails Is it appropriate to recklessly put forth a heretical view without seeking out others thoughts to utilize the veiled mind to wag your tongue to vainly draw suffering and to aimlessly slander Insects specic to a season are fearful and apprehensive of the changes  a frog in a well regards vastness as nonsense Why is this How could know the eternity of Heaven and Earth and the vastness of the dark sea Mencius said What people know is not so much as what they do not know This is true Observing the teachings founded by the three sages  they all speak of the imperishability  Since their writings regarding this are extensive it is difcult to record them all I will take up only a couple of examples and try to make a statement The Chapter on the Meaning of Sacrices says Only lial sons can perform a sacricial ceremony for their parents and the section on Ceremonial Usages says After three days purication one assuredly sees those to whom his sacrice was to be offered  If it is said that one offers a sacrice to someone to whom he is not supposed to offer and sees those he is not supposed to see this is to go against proper principles and rebel against his parents The Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit is something I do not understand Letter Given by Dharma Teacher Fayun at Zhuangyan Temple to Lords Kings and Noble Courtiers and their Responses Here I send you His Majestys Response to His Subject The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit What is marvelous and tranquil can be known

profoundly coheres and his intelligence shines deeply over distances This can be a tool for people of deluded views to attain enlightenment it teaches and leads on those of ignorant minds The Answer of Shen Yue  Director of the Imperial Secretariat The spirit is originally immortal The assertion the Extinction of the Spirit really startled me Recently when Dharma Teacher yue came out of the palace I also received a copy of the Imperial Response to His Subjects This not only subdues the heterodoxy but it also can destroy demons eternally Hereupon Confucius and ākyamuni are equally promoted I your disciple have also recently completed and presented my doubts and examinations about the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit a The Answer of Fan Xiu  Grand Master for Splendid Happiness and Current Commandant of the Right Guard of the Crown Prince I Xiu bow His Majestys instruction is profound and he discerns the very beginning of a movement Referring to a nonBuddhist text he promotes Buddhism illuminates and enlightens ignorant people and teaches and leads on those who have not yet awakened I attentively learn this through recitation night and day and write it on the end of the sash of my ceremonial gown waking and sleeping The Answer of Wang Ying Governor of Danyang your gracious letter I humbly read the signicance of the Imperial statement that the spirit is immortal His Majestys perspicacious thought is resourceful and deep His affections are observed just as clouds grow shows reason and claries instances have been dispersed just as ice melts away to indicate the issue and make a statement is as clear as if it were illuminated by the sun This will enlighten the ignorant and carry those who lack ability  There is no one among all sentient beings who will not take this and keep this in mind I will respectfully write this on the end of the sash of my ceremonial gown  and I will revere this throughout my life I your disciple Wang Ying bow The Answer of Wang Zhi  Secretariat Director your gracious letter I humbly read the Imperial Response to His Subjects the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit It shines upon me as if enlightening the ignorant I your disciple have followed Buddhism from my early days It has been a long time of practicing and following the teaching I learned a long time ago I not only echo very lofty  but also praise and encourage his purport Moreover the two interpretations he showed graciously in his response are calming to my mind and beautifully illuminate what I have learned I do not know how he could expound and propagate his deep plan and gloriously display his sacred account any more than this does There will be no chaotic obstruction either within or outside the country I will deeply keep your favor in mind The Answer of Yuan Ang  Right Chief Administrator your gracious letter The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit I respectfully read repeatedly I suddenly awoke from my binding in confusion The spirit is imperceptible and tranquil It is hard to get at the principle Taking an example from familiar matters I do not know all about the body that I still use every day not to mention the principle of profound and obscure  which is often incorrectly understood Respectfully inquiring about it in the sacred books they clearly state that is not nonexistent I must simply revere the teaching and take refuge in the position of the existence  Even if we follow the position that exists and speak of its existence we are still unable to reach the nature Consequently we discuss nonexistence from the position of not nonexistence This means we may be further away  Except for someone whose understanding towers above others and whose wisdom is peerless how could we subtly infer the statement that is not extinguished and how could we deeply comprehend the purpose that continues from one life to the next Also cites two illustrations I see precisely that the existence of the spirit is obvious Seeking this in the three periods of existence the doctrine of the immortality of the spirit is more evident It can be said that When I try to penetrate it it seems to become rmer when I look up to it it seems to become higher His Majestys examination will surely clear away all delusions and vice and cause those who are misguided to return to the right path I will humbly recite this tirelessly dancing with great joy I your disciple Yuan Ang bow b The Answer of Xiao Bing Chamberlain of the Court for the Palace Garrison your gracious letter The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit Even though the three periods of existence is evident the teaching of the One Vehicle is profound Some people have the obscuration of biased views and still adhere to strange doctrines Our sage emperor explored what is hidden searched out what is subtle focused on the spirit in the metaphysical world probed into the very root of the principle reached the nature and embraced Heaven and human beings He discussed and analyzed both the Buddhist teaching and nonBuddhist teachings Truly it may also cause even an icchantika to immediately awaken The Answer of Xu Mian  Imperial Secretary of the Ministry of Personnel According to the Imperial decree the Imperial Response to His Subjects the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit was briey shown to me one day I humbly studied and read it closely It probes into the very root of the principle and reaches tranquility Both the writing and its meaning are clear It profoundly transcends the secular world When I respectfully go into the details of the three periods of existence its brightness is like enlightening the ignorant I will not only recite and sustain this sincerely but also always distribute it to those who have not yet been awakened You kindly showed this to me I your disciple Xu Mian bow The Answer of Lu Gao  Palace Cadet of the Crown Prince I Gao bow I humbly read the Imperial Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit followed the doctrine that being free from any thought of attachment is the foundation He kept silent about entering the gate of nonduality and cut off thinking What is concealed in the collection of the Tathāgata is mysterious and absolute Therefore it caused Zhongchu ie Yu Chan to propose the assertion of the allegory of rewood and re to explain the relationship between body and spirit and Huiyuan to disseminate the criticism of the assertion that the spirit is extinguished just as re consumes rewood Questionable assertions have been conveyed and discussed by many people His Majestys brightness was endowed by Heaven His sacred intelligence is innate Understanding the faculties of the people he bestowed medicine to us He made use of expedients according to the object Consequently he straightened out propriety and corrected faults He caused the people to cleanse themselves of confusion and bestowed the Way on them Delusion is supported by compositions of nonBuddhist teachings He freely made statements and prevailed by surprise Based on what is in accordance with the principles he xed the three periods of existence as rmly as a city that is defended by moats and sustains sentient beings How could the advantage of these few words presented by him be minor I took part in receiving a share of his discussion with respect I am happy to pay respects to him You kindly showed this to me without forgetting me c The Answer of Xiao Chen  Cavalier AttendantinOrdinary I your disciple Chen bow your gracious letter I humbly looked at the Imperial Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit which wondrously surveys peoples faculties and the spirit and which brings ethical education into full play This is really good enough to cause the pure Dharma to increase its brightness and Confucianists to respect their studies Here the basis of the principles of human relationships is more claried One who goes against the scriptures and who introduces disorder into the public customs will spontaneously destroy himself I recite this clapping my hands in joy and overwhelmingly pay respect My brother  who is stupid and incompetent invited faults and now faces his trial He is tormented and fearful in public and private and his feelings and thoughts increase his terror I will remember with admiration your kindness and guidance I your disciple Xiao Chen bow The Answer of Wang Bin and Wang Jian AttendantsinOrdinary your gracious letter The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit His Majestys thought profoundly coheres and his logic is preeminent When he argues about the three periods of existence he clearly explains the doctrine When he cites two instances the Way of lial piety is easily understood This is good enough to cause the devils low fences to fall down eternally and the rightful peak to be lofty for a long time We your disciples respectfully receive the highest path and observe the law of Heaven How could our joyful minds be commonplace Wang Bin and Wang Jian bow The Answer of Lu Xu Secretariat Drafter of the Heir Apparent I received your very gracious letter I humbly looked at His Majestys Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit I bent and lifted my head and kneeled and worshiped this I have heard in private that sages simply have a single principle  but Tang and Yu have previously made no such remarks To know an omen just as a god does is only to receive with respect the edict of the Liang dynasty today When virtues last long the world praises the illuminative guidance You the Dharma teacher have deep knowledge and determination your gracious letter together with the Imperial Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit that you sent to me I humbly read the profound purport which removed obstructions from my mind and washed away my troublesomeness Only a superior sage can talk about the foundation How could a man who does not have supreme intelligence lead to its apex His Majesty probes into the very root of the spirit masters the mysteries of tranquility examines the Way and abides in the subtle state When he gives virtuous utterance the law of the three periods of existence spontaneously becomes evident When he expresses virtuous words even a thousand li receive his inuence His sincerity accords with propriety his righteousness moves both human beings and deities his reasoning stimulates the profound ways  and his virtue covers both the unseen world and this world The long darkness of the vast great night suddenly dawn Foolish and ignorant sentient beings become awakened by themselves overnight They exert themselves for the secret merits in the Deer Park  and saturate their daily lives with the stream of the Dharma Those who have sunk in doubt will spontaneously come to an end Since I your disciple returned to early and believe in it deeply I am much happier about  The Answer of Wang Jian  Palace Attendant It is very kind of you to take the trouble to send a letter to me The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit His Majestys purport is profound and illuminating The signicance exposes the delicate issue and the principle propagates the tranquil and profound matter The Canon of Filial Piety speaks of the signicance of the corpse and Section One of the Great Appendix describes the issue of the wandering spirit What I an ignorant man have recognized is that is not extinguished Referring to writings he testies with books is evanescent like ice that is melting away Those who have vulgar eyes will respectfully turn around and those who have the delement of delusion will reform their insecure minds I Wang Jian bow The Answer of Liu Yun  Palace Attendant your gracious letter the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit There is no dualism in a concourse where all points meet the main purpose is originally one To enter into the hall of the ancestral temple the faces  and their voices are the profound purpose of great teaching The purposes of these two sages one in China and the other in a foreign land match each other just as shadow  or an echo  Even though the truth exists without a doubt suspicions about the immortality of the spirit and the deep attachment to it were equally divided I will humbly follow the profound purpose  which illuminates as if enlightening me in my ignorance There is a similarity between and Heaven and Earth in completely surveying the characteristics  The unresolved doubts of the past thousand years melt away along with the spring ice A lifelong perverted mind is opened together with a drifting cloud I will simply recite repeatedly in order to be released from suffering eternally I appreciate your concern for me My sadness is truly pacied I your disciple Liu Yun stated above bow with my head to the ground The Answer of Liu Cheng  AttendantinOrdinary your gracious letter The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit The profound purport is abstruse and the reasoning traces to the very source of deep points I personally think that in cultivating causes and going toward fruition the spirit does not have two consciousnesses in attaining emancipation through the Way the buddhanature is only one Yang and Mo  however put these into confusion they offered farfetched explanations meaninglessly Hindrances went on and Confucianism in particular was concealed His Majestys mind profoundly discerns  and his testimonies are faultless He praises and censures the three dynasties ie Xia Yin and Zhou and he leads all to the same conclusion Both reality and unreality are clear without hindrance I will humbly read this with respect over and over again so that both my doubts and parsimonious thoughts will be exhausted I Liu Cheng stated above bow with my head to the ground b The Answer of Wang Mao Supervisor of the Household of the Heir Apparent I Mao bow I humbly looked at the Imperial Response the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit to which I pay my respects I am very happy and I cannot but dance about clapping my hands Even though it is not something of which we speak thoroughly it is luminously revealed in the writings left behind by various sages How could it be possible to recklessly speak unfounded statements and falsehoods and bring a heavy false charge against the imperial mandate that was previously made Once visited by suffering and emptiness he will repent  but it will be too late His Majesty bears intelligence embodies sacredness and wondrously discerns the truth and the untruth He expresses righteousness illuminates expressions and navigates for those who are drowned  Would only heavenly and human beings praise and respect him Truly all buddhas also emit light for him I your disciple have from early in my life basically relied on the Pure Land to ease my mind Fortunately I have lived a long time and met with this prosperous world I will surely accumulate causes for my next life and educate myself with this merciful guidance for a long time The sincerity of my joy is not only for today I always deeply appreciate your outstanding favor to me I Wang Mao bow The Answer of Yu Yong Chamberlain for Ceremonials your gracious letter You kindly showed me His Majestys Imperial Response to His Subjects the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit Before I humbly nished reading this smoke and mist were again removed I personally think that wormlike animals have perception but trees and plants have no consciousness Groundless discourse such as on the Extinction of the Spirit intends to equalize those that have perception with those that have no consciousness and asserts that omniscience is extinguished together with the body  In reason this is really sad His Majesty feels pity for those who are born from the four modes of birth and evidently sink in the six realms of existence He examined and compared the teaching of Confucius with that of ākyamuni and gave evidence drawn from both  He enabled those who live in the land that is farthest from the sea to know about the sea and those in hell to see the sun These words of utmost importance are as bright as the autumn sun Numerous doubts disappear just as does the spring ice Even though I knew that His Majesty issued the discussion to propagate the Way and I openmindedly appreciated his virtue I was furthermore given his instruction and guidance I bow down delighted with acts I performed in my previous life You the Dharma teacher keep the Dharma gate in mind and stick to it You will deeply agree with my joy in this I respectfully appreciate with praise I will recite this throughout my life tirelessly I your disciple Yu Yong bow The Answer of Xiao Ang  Acting King of Yuzhang your gracious letter The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit His Majestys purport and the analysis he gave are able to make deluded people bright The immorality of the spirit is apparent in the circulated books Since reason is abstruse people are confused His Majestys discernment is illuminating He examines by knowing coming events and goes beyond what is stored up in all past  He wields wonderful thought beyond the laws of nature and criticizes the heretics wild assertion Moreover he refers to the scripture of rites  and examines truth and falsehood The Way of lial piety is surely propagated here The Answer of Yu Tanlong Superior Grand Master of the Palace your gracious letter The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit which enlightens the ignorant brightly and illuminates them clearly The superior sage is extremely intelligent Therefore he traced to the very source of wondrous reality Ordinary people who live in the impermanent world do not recognize profound matters by themselves I have heard that for making an assertion the instructions given in scriptures are all traces of the teaching Regarding the Buddha foreign books state peculiar things It is difcult to expect reasoning for them I rely on the work and the sacred thought of His Majesty He analyzed and explained various situations for his subjects Are we not glad with praise I will imprint the clear purport in my mind and keep this throughout my life I feel more greatly obliged to your instructions my Dharma teacher I your disciple Yu Tanlong bow The Answer of Xiao Mi Frontrider of the Heir Apparent You kindly showed me the Imperial Response to His Subjects Before I had even nished reading it my heart became as delighted as if clapping my hands in glee Since the testimony of the meaning is fully provided from classical scriptures the frame of mind of lial piety is manifested here I will respectfully  keep this at my elbow spread it out on a desk or near my pillow and read it thoroughly day and night I will write this on the end of the sash of my ceremonial gown for eternal use and show it to everyone I your disciple Xiao Mi bow a The Answer of Wang Sengru  Palace Aide to the CensorinChief your gracious letter you kindly sent and showed me His Majestys response to all the ofcials who respectfully inquired about the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit I humbly read this over and over again deeply received it and studied it with respect I became clear just as the clouds open I personally think that it is difcult for the culmination of things to take shape and that no one but a sage can make this clear Since the truth is tranquil and obscures its location the ignorant become deluded Except for one whose spirit goes beyond the implications of language and whose thought transcends prior to an omen how could anyone illuminate these sublime words When we hear the sound of metal and stone ie a piece of good writing and see through the subtle state like this there is no wild path He causes the person who presented the discourse to not end up in the long muddy wheel tracks and those who have exclusively fallacious views to not sink into the sea of delusion eternally I will end my response here I will not go on tediously I Wang Sengru present this and bow The Answer of Wang Yi Gentleman Attendant at the Palace Gate your gracious letter The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit He is sympathetic toward the frog that stays at the bottom of the well and feels pity for the cicada that lives only a very short time Thoughts come from the depths of his heart his words are subtle and his reasoning is clear When he refers to classical scriptures his composition is simple but his purpose is profound When he concentrates on a tranquil and abstruse issue he can go through it by a single reason Ancient books are numerous yet he embraces them in one sentence He reveals the hidden purport of various sages He has nally brought longstanding stagnant delusions to an end Thanks to this the issue of whether or not is extinguished is understood This is truly good enough to warn and admonish those who are seriously confused and to serve as a model for a hundred generations As it is said A sages course of action is vast and great Fine words are quite evident I your disciple am ashamed of discerning reason I am weak in my ability to judge others intentions I successfully participate in hearing the moral instruction I was bestowed with the subtle writing I am forever grateful for the sacred rule I your disciple Wang Yi bow The Answer of Wang Tai Gentleman Attendant of the Ministry of Personnel One day having been invited to a banquet I took part in hearing Secretariat Fan s writing the discourse on the spirit and the body that are extinguished together He subtly refers to the Way of lial piety and enhances the profound principle  I will always recite this sincerely and rid myself of ignorance and delusion I your disciple Wang Tai lower my head to the ground and bow The Answer of Cai Zun  Palace Attendant your gracious letter declared the Imperial instruction of responding to inquiries about the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit The mysterious law is profound and wondrous It is really difcult to completely discern it Even though former sages spoke cordially talented people in later generations are still deluded His Majestys purpose is accordingly explained and the ignorant are brilliantly enlightened Assuredly he rises above all past generations and exclusively possesses wondrousness He awakens the future and immortalizes  I will sincerely copy it on the end of the sash of my ceremonial gown and rid myself of confusion and hindrance eternally b The Answer of Wang Zhongxin Director of Jiankang I Zhongxin address you your gracious letter I humbly read this profound and beautiful  and I cannot stop clapping my hands and jumping with joy His Majestys divine sagacity is innate and his sharp faculty is outstandingly profound The ve kinds of ceremonies shine on his outward appearance and the three transcendental knowledges sparkle within him When the golden wheel slowly revolves the Way saves the whole world When jade libation cups are already arranged lial piety ourishes in the seven imperial shrines The sun of wisdom reveals in the sky of China and the Dharma cloud hangs down in the trichiliocosm The meaning of as if exist in front of our eyes was made clear again this morning That the eternality is evident is everlastingly testied through all coming kalpas For this reason virtue surpasses that of a hundred kings and his reputation will be supreme eternally your disciple rests in the Dharma gate and worships the great teaching  The Answer of Shen Ji Adjutant of Outer Troops of the King of Jianan I your disciple Ji bow You showed me the Imperial Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit I am humbled and dance in joy I your disciple personally think that teaching is not spontaneously spread but is truly spread by people People need the consciousness and the consciousness desires the position Doesnt this mean what is said in the Book of Changes What is great treasure for the sage is to attain the position Nevertheless there may be a case when there is a position and yet someone is not suitable for the position In another case there may be a person yet the position is not suitable for him Reasonably speaking it is the most difcult to nd all three elements ie a person consciousness and a position together Therefore Confucius concluded the Spring and Autumn Annals with the record about the capture of a unicorn called lin and Mencius turned back to the title Nobility of Heaven It is really because they had no positions  Genuine edication is about to go down and disappear As for saving frightened people from a long night  except for whose virtue matches that of Heaven and Earth who else would be able to do so I your disciple bask in the marvelous teaching from the early days So I have already heard about this  Nevertheless a group swallows and sparrows still confuse each other and ying dried mugwort compete with each other The expressions are lofty and the principle is delightful He encourages the wholesomeness of human and heavenly beings and admonishes people for their gravest punishments  He gives the instruction in a brief writing that claries both Buddhists and nonBuddhists If a child were to fall into a well even ordinary people would be heartbroken not to speak of His Majesty who governs the people with mercy refers to that a white horse is not white is still seen to be inferior position to the teaching of His Majesty who has mastered the golden mean Regarding mind which he has received beyond the law of nature and his determination to promote edication evil spirits and monsters will destroy their own cheeks and tongues  His marvelous writing is as noble as Heaven and this cannot be originally inferred I feel quite ashamed of myself for having little virtue I your disciple Shen Ji bow c The Answer of Sima Yun Gentleman Attendant of the Ministry of Sacrifices your gracious letter I humbly read it completely and sang and danced with joy Consciousness and thought are deeply hidden the numen is obscure and subtle They cannot be caught up with by walking with short steps and they cannot be surveyed by the minds of ordinary people Sages of nonBuddhist teachings are aware of this and so they repressed and did not talk about it Therefore even after Confucius the issue is still unclear after the Duke of Zhou this still remains obscure Nevertheless mediocre people forget reason believe in what their eyes perceive dig with an awl and view through a pipe When ignorance and delusion become to this point we should feel deeply sorry for this Our emperors way pierces this world as well as the unseen world and is brighter than the sun and moon He hates the manner in which a foulsmelling water plant called you overpowers fragrance and a purple color takes away the luster of vermilion  He is angry when the stone min that resembles jade hinders jade and a pheasant disturbs a phoenix He illuminates the culmination of the mind as a familiar case and claries the basis of the virtue of lial piety as a profound case Truly he causes those who learn heathen ways to cut off their evil minds and those who lean toward honesty to make rm their admiration I fortunately happened to receive with respect edication The Answer of Shen Gun Adjutant of the Personnel Evaluation Section of the King of Yuzhang I Gun bow I your disciple personally think that in the way to exchange what is sought there must be equal give and take Regarding the case of not instructing so as to create annoyance to the ignorant this vainly results in restlessness Therefore I stopped receiving consultation for myself I am sincerely ashamed of myself for not examining highly profound things I have only vague knowledge about the mechanism of causality I genuinely hope that if I walk on hoarfrost without falling backward stronger ice will come You the Dharma teacher have a mind as broad as hills and valleys and with which fortunately even evil people can be accepted Though I do not have the rank to ascend to the court you invited me to join the group the Buddhist teaching Du Yi said If a person wants to call a thirsty horse to a water fountain the horse comes even if does not use a horsewhip You showed me His Majestys Response a to His Subjects I humbly read it morning and night tirelessly without sparing myself established this Dharma hall and leads the confused group of people The relationship between father and son ie the Way of lial piety is already mentioned and the three periods of existence is explained The conditions of the spirits can be pursued here It is said that the sea is vast but who can know how vast it is It is said that the sky is high but it is impossible to measure its height His Majestys sacred discourse probes profound issues and its purpose goes beyond the world of language I your disciple Shen Gun bow The Answer of Wang Qi Officer of the Personnel Evaluation Section of the King of Jianan You kindly showed me the Imperial Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit I personally think that the spirit is obscure and quiet Successive sages have not preached anything about this When I seek in records my grief and vagueness cross each other and deepen His thought arose from the profound point his sublime purpose was deeply settled the truth is already spread and the vital point of lial piety is concurrently investigated thoroughly I had had in my mind disappeared just as ice melts away Truly I realized with what I had been carelessly deluded Needless to say I an ignorant man am especially deeply impressed with this I Wang Qi bow The Answer of Wei Rui  Right Guard General The truth is abstract and tranquil When one says it exists it seems it does not When one says it does not exist in fact it exists The words of the truth are luminous in Daoist scriptures His Majestys way embraces the universe and is as bright as the sun and moon The mechanism of appearance and disappearance is assuredly illuminated and a vital point of existence and nonexistence is already seen His guidance is already deep and his logical explanation of the meaning is surely harmonious Who among all those who have a mind would not rejoice I was shown His Majestys writing which I attentively read My delements have disappeared just as clouds are dispersed Concurrently I clapped my hands in joy You the Dharma teacher have a good stroke of fortune the karma you created in your previous life caused you to meet the Dharma in this life You parted from the ve desires entered into the eight kinds of meditation for liberation left behind the three realms of existence and follow the teaching of the One Vehicle I could again happily hear your virtuous voice and come to praise you more I Wei Rui bow The Answer of Xie Chuo Chief Minister for Law Enforcement I Chuo bow has already rejected shortsighted discussion and truly explains various doubtful points I personally think that a human being is the most highly endowed and his spiritual function is inexhaustible People of the best class know coming events and store up all past  b and people of the next class nearly attain  From this viewpoint there is in reason no possibility to be extinguished Therefore Confucianists explicate ceremonies of sacrice for the spirits and Buddhists are engaged in great benevolence and illuminate the condition of birth  The Buddhist and nonBuddhist teachings become clear  It is already enough to relieve us from hindrance Moreover His Majestys instruction is patient and his references and information are more extensive He promotes what supports and begins all things to the people and offers a guideline about discernment and studying to those who are smart and openhearted He assuredly taught the ignorant and drew them out of hindrances From his seat he surveyed the extremely profound issue Heretical beliefs have already been cut off and the right path has returned I your disciple however think that I have studied in the school of the Sage in vain I am eternally delighted by your protection and guidance I Xie Chuo bow The Answer of Fan Xiaocai Libationer of the Minister of Education I your disciple Xiaocai bow I personally think that when Pengsheng became a boar after he was killed by a man of Qi state and stood up disaster fell upon the Lord of Qi state and the incident in which Yuanbo put on a ceremonial cap and appeared in Fan Shis dream is well known in the history of the Han dynasty Moreover when we take account of parables of murderous schemes we know they mean that must exist If we intend to destroy the spirit the Buddhist and nonBuddhist teachings will both be lost How could he distinguish west from east His Majestys purpose is broad and deep His sacred mind is compassionate by nature and absorbed in sacricial ceremony and worship He not only makes the scriptures and teaching ourish but truly he also causes ignorant people to become awakened in the Way I am obliged to you for handing down  I will imprint this instruction and guidance on my mind which brims with  I your disciple Fan Xiaocai bow The Answer of Wang Lin AttendantinOrdinary your gracious letter You kindly showed me the Most Augusts Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit I sincerely went to the limit of my mediocre ability and respectfully read His Majestys composition His voice brims with the sound of metal and stone his reasoning penetrates the deep spring his righteousness penetrates the six lines of a hexagram and his statement completes the three periods of existence This is sufcient to cause those of biased learning to know the ultimate law of nature and those who have gone astray to remember returning  Fortunately I your disciple was born in a happy and brilliant  The sincerity of my pleasure is as boundless as that of a wild duck that obtains duckweed I your disciple Wang Lin reply to you You graciously bestowed on me your letter and showed me Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit I have personally heard that one sacrices to the spirits as if the spirits were present Even though I seek previous monarchs they did not fathom it dwell in the eternal world they do not change The profound mystery I had studied intensively with respect disappears just as ice melts away Therefore I come to know that vast and profound traces of sages do not derive from a single way Different actions and responses basically follow the times The ignorant will become enlightened Even Xuan and Tang could not compete with him His clear and Great Way hereupon reaches its apex I He Jiong bow c The Answer of Wang Yun  Recorder of the King of Yuzhang I Yun bow your gracious letter You showed me His Majestys Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit I have personally heard that one will seem to see in the place  is a maxim in the canon of rites It is now the great tenor of Buddhism that is not extinguished Nevertheless the wondrous characteristics are evanescent and profound and the working of the spirit is extremely tranquil Except for those who have mastered the Way how could anyone understand in his heart the ultimate Way of nature Without one who knows what produces all things we have no way on which to depend to meet responses from the unseen world His Majesty has thorough knowledge of the myriad matters he manages his mind roams in the seven factors of wisdom in order to cultivate superior wisdom he feels compassion for sentient beings and warmly raises up the common people cleanses delements encourages with the wisdom of realization relieves them from ignorance and delusion and causes them to ascend to the state of the longlived virtuous My family respectfully follows the great Dharma from generation to generation and transmits the teaching of the Way I am able to understand with his single voice I your disciple Wang Yun bow The Answer of Sun Yi Gentleman of the Granaries Section your gracious letter You kindly showed me the Imperial Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit I humbly received this with respect and am delighted with it Without moving even a single hair  all evils will be dispersed and by crossing over on the ship we will go beyond to the yonder shore His Majesty keeps the two polarities in his body his virtue combines those of the three dynasties ie Xia Shang  and Zhou by means of the marvelous plan he manages the ultimate Way of nature and he takes charge of supreme wisdom in order to regulate the people When he issues an order the grass bends when the wind blows When he sits upon the throne and governs the nation he keeps silent but his edication moves just like that of a god He raises the Five Thearchs and follows their tracks His method is eternal beyond myriad kalpas Moreover by ringing a large bell he instructs us as easily as if he were to point to his own palm He sends down wondrous ideas and enlightens the ignorant His logic is admirable and deep and his purpose penetrates the issue and goes further He is equal to a precious jewel beyond price and equivalent to an undeled lotus ower Filial reverence covers the people and his instruction and examples glorify previous sages Even slowly moving creatures recognize this pleasure together with us and living things that it y or crawl are all happy about this blessing I greatly appreciate that your letter was distributed even to me one who occupies the lowest seat I received this with sincerity and will write it on the end of the sash of my ceremonial gown I your disciple Sun Yi bow a The Answer of Xiao Misu Aide to Danyang your gracious letter It is said that when human nature and the Way of Heaven are spoken of reason is cut off By great fortune I was graciously granted wondrous instruction I received it in the manner like throwing myself at your feet I will keep joy and respect in my mind I personally think that the Way of the Spirit is quiet and silent and it is difcult to see the edge of the sea of the Dharma Our consciousness understands objects sensed as visual color or form but they are still ambiguous Nevertheless it has been a very long time since the cloud of wisdom was gradually transmitted to the east and the boat of treasures crossed over to the south The sound of the Dharma has spread into remote areas Hence the twofold truth and the eight kinds of meditative powers that lead to liberation are entirely lacking in the emperors statement The nine kinds of Buddhist scriptures and the Tripiṭaka are bent to and mixed up with the national learning daxue great learning Although his assertion was refuted by ryadeva his inuence has not yet ceased Therefore it causes people of different learning who have numerous doubts to establish various views If we had not received the teaching of the one who apprehended this issue in the past we would really have ended up in confusion even in the next life His Majestys way benets the world and his faculty penetrates everything without any set pattern He inspects both the Tiger Library Baifuguan ie Confucianism and the Dragon Palace  and he leads equally by the highest virtue and the ultimate reality  Therefore he is in accord with the secular teaching and ascertains the way of the truth that is to say he follows the teaching of lial piety and propagates the teaching of the nature of awakening How lofty is  He has already performed the ten wholesome acts and is not far from the golden wheel king  You the Dharma teacher received the wisdom to discern emptiness by nature and have received training and learned much in this world When you turn the Dharma wheel the eight kinds of gods and demigods who protect Buddhism gather like clouds When you speak sublime words heavenly beings accept them Therefore you can spread the incense of the precepts in the private quarters of the imperial palace and embellish His Majestys abode with the owers of realization You can cause all the people to listen to the voice of the Buddhist Way I your disciple have no recollection of ākyamunis scriptures and I have not reached the gate of the Confucian school Although I wish to hear in the morning I end the day feeling ashamed of myself for frivolously squandering  I simply hope to follow the boundless Dharma and benet other people as well as myself I am suffering from a disease and my mind and thought are confused with fear I do not know whether or not I have arranged this in order I look forward to visiting you to ask questions and intimately receive the greatest teaching from you I your disciple Xiao Misu lower my head to the ground and bow b The Answer of Fu Jing  Secretariat Gentleman I was graciously shown the Most Augusts Response to His Subjects I humbly received the profound purport and was able to dispel many doubts His Majestys mind shines alone and he is apart from others in looking at the issue for his wondrous examination Therefore this is not something ignorant people would be able to penetrate and look up to Nevertheless ordinary scholars of narrow views personally sought a distinguished opinion Now we have again received these tenets  I looked for the doctrine extensively in the scriptures the doctrine is exactly founded on the tenets  You the Dharma teacher publicized and exalted His Majestys astute and discreet principles and greatly praised his sacred words You precisely cause the two teachings to come to the same  and the absolute and the relative ie the Buddhist Way and secular ways to square with each other I am inuenced and molded by the highest edication Yet I truly dance at the same time I am looking forward to meeting you to ask questions in the near future I will exhaust my sincerity on that occasion The Answer of He Yang Erudite of the Five Classics your gracious letter You kindly showed me the Imperial Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit I studied this intensively with respect recited it and enjoyed it again and again Therefore I know that wonderful encompasses the origin of what produces all things his business is apart from what ordinary people can recognize his spirit concentrates on the meaning beyond language and his principles excel ordinary peoples minds His Majestys astute and discreet discernment profoundly reaches human nature and the Way of Heaven Therefore his faculty is outstanding and profound and he realizes by himself transcendently and deeply He gives an account of the three sages in order to lead those who have not yet understood He shows the two issues in order to remove biased delusions Hence the purpose of the perpetuity of lial duty is even more claried and the ultimate law of causality is more easily understood The perfect scriptures expounded on Vulture Peak manifest here again Even if compared to the sun and moon there is nothing that can go beyond this I will research the wonderful tenor I feel as if I am still dancing with joy You the Dharma teacher publicized and exalted the highest Way and made the great plan clear and bright I your disciple He Yang present this The Answer of Liu Qia Secretary of the Heir Apparent your gracious letter With respect I looked at the Imperial Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit I humbly opened the letter of white silk and respectfully looked at the profound account The composition is as harmonious as the music of Emperor Shun and Emperor Yu and the meaning surveys the hexagrams and the Great Appendix  spreads the authentic teaching which is handed down to us in written form His words surpass the ultimate of heavenly and human beings Except for those who have mastered the highest virtue like his and whose thoughts match the virtuous spirits would it be possible to deeply clarify the essential points of the Way that the human intellect hopes to attain I will prudently write this on the end of the sash of my ceremonial gown and wear it eternally I will visit you on purpose to study one of these days and explain more about this I your disciple Liu Qia bow with my head to the ground and present this c The Answer of Yan Zhizhi  Erudite of the Five Classics your gracious letter The body is separated and engages in coarseness Needless to say the principle of discernment is minute How could those of confused views understand this If we keep the Middle Way in mind we can come back to the right path when we are swayed by desire If you pay attention only to the two ends of a matter you will be unable to reach the yonder shore forever In discussions on the extinction of the spirit this obstruction is really heavy I respectfully rely on His Majesty the chief support of the highest teaching The brilliant imperial instruction was accordingly issued The issue has been claried just as clouds disperse not only profoundly tallies the books authored by sages and virtuous emperors of ancient times it also deigns to promote the signicance of lial piety has most likely wonderfully reached the origin of life and deeply mastered the basis of conduct He consolidates even more the moral character to maintain the rules of propriety and he treads on hoarfrost and dew With the knowledge of examining the spirit he respects the joy of practicing meditation and enhances his mind Everyone should learn the mind of determination in the path of wisdom and force back the tide of the sea of delusions I your disciple try to establish my pure mind from early days but I have not yet known how to cross over to the yonder shore I humbly read the Imperial Response and my body and mind were lled with jubilation You kindly think of me and encourage me The Answer of Cao Siwen Houseman of the Eastern Palace You graciously sent the Imperial message to me I your disciple recently received the point of this argument with respect in person too His Majesty was deeply afraid that people would be deluded Once this imperial instruction is practiced even those of ignorant mind will understand that the spirit is immortal I your disciple recently criticized somewhat Fans Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit following the Duke of Zhou and Confucius which I now enclose in this letter Please be so kind as to take a look and refute strange points against scriptures I will not talk of many things here I your disciple Cao Siwen bow The Answer of Xie Ju Vice Director of the Palace Library your gracious letter The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit I humbly appreciate His Majestys instruction bestowed in written form The instruction deeply molds and fashions  feels pity on have the six coverings  and feels sorrow that they have the four kinds of evil attachments a heretical doctrine of the ninetysix nonBuddhist schools He dispels the insignicant assertions that cause confusion about the Way He delivers those who are on a narrow path to the Great Way The purpose is unrestrained and yet mysterious and the meaning is gentle yet clear Wide comprehension and great scope are all embraced here With a single sound of his voice and his chanting of half a gāthā fourline verse he manifests his outstanding realization Sunlike wisdom and a mind like water remove delement and confusion here Can he bear only the Tripiṭaka and cover the seven books I your disciple am fortunate to abide in the best of times and secretly receive correct guidance I will follow with respect and write it on the end of the sash of my ceremonial gown I Xie Ju bow a The Answer of Ma Yuanhe Chamberlain for the National Treasury your gracious letter You bestowed on me the Imperial Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit I have personally heard that the purpose of the crucial point showed is not studied by ordinary people and the pivot that tallies with a wonder is mastered only by the virtuous Therefore various teachings go around but the principle comes to sincerity and wholesomeness Numerous scriptures state full details yet the main point comes down to deliverance His principle transcends language and his consideration extends beyond the phenomenal world He attacks and blocks heterodoxy and expounds that are united into one Human and heavenly beings look up at him and follow him He is truly like a bridge formed of ships aoat on the blue sea or the sun and moon in the dark sky Discussions on the extinction of the spirit do not convince me When past sages spread teachings they forced them on or guided to them in different ways In short the principle is in fact not dual The Book of Changes says The family that accumulates wholesomeness is sure to have superabundant happiness and the family that accumulates evil is sure to have superabundant misery The Canon of Filial Piety says Parents are content with while living and when they are worshiped after death their disembodied spirits enjoy  Although the three periods of existence is not evidently discussed the tenor is apparent When rewood is completely burned up the ame dies out The wondrous existence is transparent This is the procient assertion of the ultimate The succession of a state and a family from generation to generation is derived from this The treasures of the three powers are marked by various changes and movements Discussions on the extinction of the spirit are frequently harmful to political affairs Those who refute sages have no law in their minds and those who object to lial piety disown the principle of affection toward parents If one fails in these two issues it will be difcult for him to conduct himself in the world of His Majesty I your disciple am ignorant and inexperienced in the highest Way You deigned to send a letter to me an ordinary man of shallow learning I your disciple Ma Yuanhe bow The Answer of Wang Jing Court Gentleman for Evaluations You showed me His Majestys Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit He lives without wasting even a single day His way is distinctive and he is simply sharp Thereupon he made inquiries to his subjects and extensively promoted the meaning of lial piety His Majestys writing is profound the ingenious principle is deep and boundless Except for a sharp and smart ruler or a sunlike monarch whom we follow or clouds we gaze upon from afar could there be someone who can analyze profound and tranquil issues and who can clarify them in an elegant discussion I your disciple am a lonely man from the area between the Yangzi and Huai Rivers I have no learning and no skill Even though I have followed a teacher and have had an audience with the emperor I am not versed in even a single scripture The Five Classics are vast and profound and the categories of items are broad and abundant As for the purpose of spiritual intelligence there is a great variety of meanings Regarding the music from instruments made from metal stone string and bamboo and the story that the Duke of Zhou swore an oath to the spirits on behalf of King Wu are they not meant to be for His Majestys purpose Furthermore when we speak of the Chapter on the Meaning of Sacrices  there is particularly clear evidence If it is said that the spirits do not exist then it would be possible that sages do not exist either If it is approved that sages exist there should also be the spirits The law of the spirit is luminous How could it be allowed that is extinguished My your disciples view is stupid and shallow I your disciple Wang Jing bow The Answer of Lu Ren Gentleman Cavalier Attendant and Lu Chui  Secretariat Drafter of the Heir Apparent your gracious letter You kindly showed us His Majestys Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit Formerly when people of different schools argued about the path Mencius took upon himself the Duke of Zhous way When Hinayana Buddhists put the Way into confusion Nāgārjuna explained the teaching of ākyamuni Thus in circles of Yangzi and Mozi every time they moved their tongues their mouths stiffened Regarding followers of the six leaders of nonBuddhist teachings their chariots were in disorder and their banners dropped  It can be said that those who assert the extinction of the spirit are biased in learning and inexible those who travel south while seeking the Yan region  or those who head toward the Chu area while steering the shafts of the carriage toward the north If one travels a thousand li on roads in this way he will be farther away from his destination His Majesty feels pity on those who go astray Thereupon he exerted himself to create this Imperial composition in which he investigated what lies deep and attained what is distant He completely comprehends the processes of transformation and knows what the spirit is We your disciples are both mediocre yet we benet from your kindliness Wearing a cap we at the imperial court that corresponds to Heaven We have heard the discussion to examine and study ancient matters We sincerely feel happy about this guidance our joy increases more and more We will respectfully write this down on the ends of the sashes of our ceremonial gowns We Lu Ren and Chui present this The Answer of Wang Sengshu Vice Commandant your gracious letter You kindly showed me the Imperial Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit How can we see it through a tiny pipe I am happy and contented with the fact that my ignorance has dispersed I will recite this in due order You Dharma teacher are outstanding in virtue today and your reputation is remarkable throughout all generations I think that you clarify and propagate His Majestys purpose The cloud of doubts will disperse luminously I your disciple feel ashamed of myself for studying under adversity and being unable to see the whole of a matter with my discernment How could I revere with praise the great brightness and publicize and uplift the wondrous model It is indeed impossible for him to speak of the right path How could he know of the certain danger of becoming stuck in a hitch when he has gone too far The principles of this world and of the other world are bright and errorless Cause and effect arise mutually and have no independence in relationship When the body perishes it naturally belongs to a class of trees and plants but the spiritual intelligence always exists following conditions Therefore there is a story in the Zuozhuan that Pengsheng appeared as a boar and we nd this passage in the Book of History Ancestors have arrived The Rites of Zhou says If music changes nine times human and spiritual beings can know this You should observe ceremonies In the Zuozhuan there is an episode of by tying up grasses repaying a favor he has received How could consequently be extinguished How could it be possible that the spirit does not exist in what was dreamed by Yuan Gui The immortality of the spiritual intelligence is written in the Buddhas golden sayings In the statements of Confucius there is more evidence of this Even though the Five Thousand Words Dao de jing and there are three hundred cantos in the Book of Odes if we attain their principle it may spontaneously be embraced in a single sentence Therefore we do not have to trouble ourselves to extensively seek for testimonies of  The three sages established brilliant teachings and the various schools of thinkers permanently established great doctrines but those who are ambitious and too hasty still strikingly make compositions and study strange doctrines again and again His Majesty has presently claried the essence and illuminated what is hidden and tranquil His discernment penetrates both the Buddhist and nonBuddhist teachings Since ancient sages are eternal and His Majesty nds that heresy recklessly arises he greatly gives rise to herein and bestows a piece of writing with love This causes even icchantikas to attain realization immediately and consequently attain the fruition of buddhahood and it openly and clearly cleanses persistent delusions in Jambudvīpa Moreover the benecial cause for gentlemen of the ofcial class is great I your disciple have enjoyed the Way without any order but you Dharma teacher have given me a bamboo basket full  I pay respect to this dancing with joy There is nothing with which my joy can be compared I will keep in mind deeply and much more I your disciple Wang Sengshu lower my head to the ground and bow The Answer of Ming Shanbin  Erudite of the Five Classics your gracious letter You kindly showed me the Imperial Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit Its foundation is deep and its purport is profound How could a deer or rabbit investigate them Probably each person will be happy about what he sees I cannot stop dancing with joy You Dharma teacher are outstanding in learning in the present time and accorded with the Way for a thousand years I think that you propagate subtle purpose without missing anything I your disciple have excused myself from focusing on Buddhist scriptures for cultivation and I am not procient in knowledge How can I respectfully give an account of the profound Way and glorify the teaching The advocate limits to what he sees and hears How could he reach what is vast and profound He can see what happens in a hundred years and he will be deluded throughout the three periods of existence He says that since the physical body perishes the spirit is extinguished together with the body This is already against what is stated in Buddhist scriptures and it also goes against the teaching of Confucius How can we argue about the highest Way and speak of the wondrous doctrine with him In this world we have ceremonies and music while in the other world there are spiritual beings Therefore when Confucius gave an instruction he responded to question you know about death King Wen of the Zhou dynasty established a teaching that he a man of versatile talent who is able to serve the spirits will die instead of  The Book of Odes says The Three Augusts reside in Heaven The Book of History says Ancestors have arrived Moreover the famous man who roamed on a bridge spanning the Hao River wrote the Discourse on the Coexistence of Opposite Views  The Archivist of superior intelligence said The manes of the departed do not manifest their spiritual energy When one puts rewood forward toward the ames as the force of the re weakens the ames are transmitted  very close to each other and are reborn All these stated and recorded in the classic books are evident and clear matters Since conditions are transient they are extinguished Because karma is something to be made it is impermanent Therefore even when the ve skandhas unite and become things they end up in nothingness just as smoke vanishes in the air Even when the four small elements are groundlessly formed together they disappear just as a re is extinguished I personally think that the Way of Spiritual Intelligence is neither karma nor conditions Since it is neither karma nor conditions although it moves it is not extinguished Since it is the subject that can perceive the object and also karma the subject of activities there are differences in the reward and retribution of joy and sorrow Even though there are different paths of teaching the truth returns to one At present has abandoned the original texts of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius and goes against ākyamunis genuine statement I do not know what he is going to become when he is like this Even when the True Dharma was practiced in the world there were still assertions Moreover after entering into the period of the Semblance Dharma there could be no situation in which there is no heretical view Regarding the issue that the spirit exists and is not extinguished the three sages have the same tenor This is clearly written in books but many years have passed  so wise Confucian scholars and the erudite have not completely encountered this meaning His Majestys intelligence is complete in the doctrines of emptiness and existence and his intellectual function investigates thoroughly the origin of the spirit Accordingly he gave rise to the sacred sincerity and personally wrote this composition He promotes the highest teaching and enlightens those who are seriously confused He relieves learned people from their doubts forever You caused me to be able to have a chance to appreciate His Majestys teaching and to receive his favor I pay my respects to you and I am truly delighted with  I Ming Shanbin bow The spirits of our ancestors will hear it The Zong Boshi section the Zhouguan  says If music changes nine times human and spiritual beings  can know this You should observe ceremonies The Chapter on the Meaning of Sacrices says When we go into the hall heave a sigh and we certainly hear their sigh of lamentation The Book of History says If you Three Kings truly bear the responsibility for Heavens great son ie King Wu please let me Zhou Dan ie the Duke of Zhou who can serve spiritual beings be a substitute for his person The Zuozhuan says that the spirit of Gun changed into a yellow bear Boyou became a ghost and Pengsheng appeared as a boar Above are seven items  I your disciple was born within the past hundred years I heard the law of the three periods of existence from my early years I have examined numerous scriptures and sought various ancient facts about this The evidence that spiritual beings exist is already shown in Chinese books The fruition of the highest wisdom is also indicated in the studies of the western region  The sacred teachings tally with each other on the point that the spirit has no end the Sages edication is however based on thoroughly understanding the peoples receptivity What the people do not understand is not spoken and what is spoken must be accomplished does not respond to when it is not the appropriate time and when he responds to them he alone saves them The reward and retribution of karma however varies Consequently the path of acceptance differs from the path of refusal The conditions of going and coming gather together and the mind that sinks and the mind to be awakened are in opposition to one another Those who are intimate with a little knowledge remain in darkness about this great tenet and those who stick to familiar information do not discern what is profound and subtle Our emperor succeeds the Three and the Five  attends to all state affairs and succeeds to the seven hundred in order to control the six elemental energies of the changing  His achievements are immeasurable and his way is pure at the same time He has the virtue of great ability to govern the universe and the brightness that is just like having the sun on his left and the moon on his right This is something that former emperors and kings did not distinguish that many sages do not possess that all the people should thoroughly understand and that we will certainly achieve in the future There is no one who is obstructed to receive profound wave and does not attain his deep point I humbly read the wondrous discussion which completely covers absolute and relative reality The three powers are clearly recorded All the people of His Majestys territories are attracted to  Even slowly moving creatures and wormlike animals know of this and dance with joy not to mention people I your disciple am young and wanting in reading thoroughly the meaning of writings Since matches my longcherished intention I secretly dance with deep joy Regarding the extent of various schools of thinkers their statements are quite numerous When we look for the issue of spiritual beings there are many clear testimonies Because are rejected by evil people I will not quote anything from them Except for correct words what else could correct  I have briey mentioned the seven items all quoted from scriptures These are just like if very tiny things were to lean against the Five Peaks or a snail were to cling to the emperors six military corps I your disciple Yu Qianlou bow  The Answer of Yin Jun  Household Provisioner of the Heir Apparent Recently your gracious letter Human nature and the Way of Heaven cannot really be heard His Majesty simply observes the twofold truth and concurrently understands the teachings of the three sages thoroughly He claries both of these in a few words and explains what is subtle in simple writing He teaches that sentient beings live within the ve kinds of ceremonies and his purpose is inclusive of the universe outside the limits of the human world This can be compared to how a river and the sea both lead to land or how the sun and moon ride high in the sky I humbly read and am very happy I rejoice both in body and mind at this I your disciple have been inuenced by the profound edication from early in my life and now when I have become old I have never lost  I am always afraid that my discernment and study have not been extensive and I may yet turn back halfway in vain When I sit straight and contemplate quietly my mind wanders about and scatters or when I give a statement or set up a discourse I am sometimes daunted by eloquent and sharp people The Great Way is very smooth yet common people love the byways At present I humbly received the wondrous purpose with respect I always carry this with me and chant it I will eternally take this as my treasure I have been involved in public and private matters for the past several days and was also laid up with illness so I was unable to respond to you immediately I cherish your favor more deeply The Answer of Zhang Mian  Assistant in the Palace Library In my search the three periods of existence is bright and the two effects luminously reveal themselves How is it possible to be deluded by the six dusts  to not be awakened to be confused in the ve realms of existence and to sink for a long time I think that when the body withers the spirit is extinguished or when a skeleton perishes the consciousness decays are the wrong views of a heretic How could control Gautamas True Dharma I am afraid that at the end of a long kalpa leads insects will certainly arrive The body dies and decays and again another body is received but the exquisite spirit does not change Human beings and animals comply with conditions the brilliant composition of the Nirvana Sutra and the valuable sayings in the ruiying  His Majesty sacredly illuminates what is tranquil and profound and clearly examines what is deep Comparing to the two phrases regarding sacricial offerings  he understands that the spirit is not extinguished He makes clear that the reckless conduct goes against ones parents His justice woven into  follows the eightfold holy path to enlightenment  It is difcult to be able to hear words just as Confucius discourse about human nature and the Way cannot be heard I your disciple visited the Ruo River when I was young I received the precepts in the area of Fan and Deng  and studied under Dharma teacher Qi at the White Horse Temple  Dharma teacher Qi frequently talked to me about the profound tenor of birth and death and spoke often of the subtle purpose of the exquisite spirit I again see that this judgment has destroyed the devils path to a greater extent I know only to take refuge in  and tacitly compare myself to Seeking Fame   You graciously beneted me by showing to me I deeply appreciate your favor I your disciple Zhang Mian bow The Answer of Lu Lian Erudite of the Five Classics I Lian address you You graciously showed me the Imperial Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit I humbly read His Majestys purpose which clearly illuminates my delement and ignorance My your disciples entire clan believes in the Three Treasures From the time of my youth I have followed the Buddhist teaching I carefully thought of many sages both Buddhist and nonBuddhist and found that they expand and guide with distinguished writings The Tathāgata explained the three vehicles in order to indicate one principle and spoke of the twofold truth in order to awaken those who are stuck  Former kings explained the ve ceremonies in order to cause the people to thoroughly understand love and respect and propagated the music of the six generations in order to lead spiritual beings They further showed the three periods of existence in order to prove cause and effect How is it possible to promptly reject the origin of the spirit and eternally cut off consciousness as a condition If this was the case reward and retribution for good and evil deeds would be merely an empty statement and the establishment of sacrices and reverence would be false When we seek this in common sense is it possible to be content with this Nevertheless ignorant and deluded people still remain quite obstinate Therefore His Majesty clearly viewed with a tranquil mind and his spirit visited the subtle gate  He put forth reason in words that are as bright as morning sunlight and gave testimony by issuing this writing which is as clear as a glowworm  This is enough to quickly educate ignorant and confused people and cause ordinary people to contentedly have faith I humbly follow the tenor of the imperial writing I will examine the origin of the mind I cannot express my happiness in words but I clap my hands and dance with joy I your disciple Lu Lian present this The Answer of Zhang Fan Mounted Escort of Yangzhou your gracious letter The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit in which the magnicent purpose traces to the very root of a vital point sublime words tally with the Way His Majestys innate intelligence is above those of the six scholars spontaneously inclusive of that of the one above the sages in the tenth stage  Regarding the law of effects brought about by causes his reason shines upon the three periods of existence As to the signicance of observing the proper rules for lial offerings  he follows the continuous line of all kings His sublime understanding is explained as easily as the ice melts in the springtime His supreme purpose is as bright as the autumn sky He causes the orderly simple and sincere tradition to thrive You Dharma teacher are an outstanding man of virtue well versed in principles You have received His Majestys edication together with us but you alone enjoy the spiritual intelligence deeply examine the profundity of the Way and have insight into the path of the ultimate law of nature I your disciple formerly heard a certain masters view and became awakened to the tenor of the grand scholar  Today I encounter an era of peace and justice and follow the teaching that is not extinguished truly shines upon me claries my ignorant mind and washes away my delement I prance and dance with joy How could language or symbols surpass  I Zhang Fan bow  The Answer of Wang Zhenguo  Commandant of the Left of the Heir Apparent your gracious letter I humbly looked at the Imperial Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit Regarding the immortality of the spirit scriptures present explicit sentences When we talk about the issue in conformity with our minds it lustrously stands to reason The discourse that the spirit is extinguished is really frightful and lamentable His Majesty illuminates deeply and rightly His wonderful tenor encompasses all extensively breaks the heresy and propagates this model of teaching I humbly read  I am happy to sustain this personally and deeply forever I Wang Zhenguo present this The Answer of Cao Jingzong  General of the Palace Guard You deigned to give me the Imperial instruction responding of the mortality of the spirit The reasoning encompasses eternity and the purpose includes the issue of the three periods of existence Those who have been confused in the six realms of existence for a long time will hereupon be awakened forever Those who have constantly been suspicious about the ve realms of existence will realize the truth just as if being enlightened I will respectfully carry with me and write it on the end of the sash of my ceremonial gown I will be sure not to disregard it even while sleeping and eating You Dharma teacher have knowledge that goes beyond the realm of existence Your learning has reached nonarising  You praise and recommend  and this good deed of yours shines as brightly as that of Dongli  I opened and appreciate it repeatedly and so I forgot about my illness I Cao Jingzong reply to you The Answer of Yan Shan Chamberlain for Attendants You deigned to distribute to me the Imperial instruction to ascertain the immortality of the spirit in response to subjects together with your explanatory letter The grounds of the reasoning are evident and it is wondrously inclusive of both sides Consequently propagates the intelligent insight on his own praising both the boat and the bridge by which people cross over to the other side What cannot be seen with the eyes may be blocked by a curtain or a wall and what cannot be heard with the ears may be obscured by distance We cannot say there are no sounds or objects simply on the basis of their not being heard or seen If we intend to ask about the Buddhist teaching now we should rely on books of nonBuddhist teaching A book says The spirit in its energy can go everywhere A Buddhist scripture says Nevertheless the spirit is not extinguished Since the Buddhist scripture tallies with that in the book of nonBuddhist teaching there is little to question about the issue that the spirit exists Those who doubt the immortality of the spirit and assert its mortality are like an ephemerid that does not know the morning and the end of the day  or a cicada that does not know what takes place between spring and autumn How could they know the long life of the tree called Dachun or the eternity of the sun and moon His Majestys intelligence exceeds that of the ancient  The tenor of the three periods of existence has testimony The principle of lial offerings to the ancestral spirits is honored here Ordinary people had dark and narrow views before but they have now become intelligent again People of later generations will fall into darkness and confusion but they will be awakened  I your disciple planted in my previous life and thus encountered happiness  being able to participate in following and enjoying the Way I present my mind to Maitreya Bodhisattva I sincerely and deeply take refuge in him with respect I your disciple Yan Shan present this The Answer of Shen Hong Erudite of the Five Classics I your disciple Hong lower my head to the ground and bow your gracious letter The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit I think that it is difcult to understand the vital point and an obscure matter easily becomes confused How could we exercise our own views in darkness He bestows the Dharma clouds in order to deeply benet them He discloses sunlike wisdom and increases its splendor His profundity is comparable to that of the dark vast ocean and his familiarity with the people is likened to theirs with a well crib Throughout the ages who else could know this  There are parables found in the Buddhist scriptures After a sparrow ies away the vase is still there or Even if light is extinguished the writing remains The Rites says  do not accept offerings from those who are not their family members When their family members offer sacrices to them they send down blessings Moreover  after dreaming of an orchid conceived the Duke of Mu of Zheng state The father of the concubine of Wei Kes fathers tied grasses together and fought Du Hui on behalf of Wei Ke Generally speaking there are many instances like these it is impossible to record them all Furthermore we transmigrate in the ve realms of existence but we will return to the same place the six pāramitās All this is the evident testimony of the spirit and the profound meaning of the immortality  Today was bestowed on heavenly beings above and reached even the icchantikas below This is what is called the simile of dispersing the dense fog by hanging two wellmatched objects ie the sun and moon or coming out of a dark night and seeing Zhulong  I attempt to draw water from a deep well with only a short rope and examine the condition of the sea only by gazing at great waves in the distance I am really happy and pay respects to  which is just like an invaluable precious jewel The Answer of Sima Jiong  Arbiter of Jiankang your gracious letter You kindly showed me the Imperial criticism on the Discourse on the Extinction of Mans Nature Miexing lun ie Shenmie lun Therefore the discernment of the seven kinds of meditation and the eight kinds of meditation leading to enlightenment  and the subtlety of the three gates of emancipation and the fourfold truths are originally luminous in scriptures and they are bright in clear and logical instruction Therefore an exposition of the Dharma by the Buddha says It is just like the case where even if a hundred people were to praise the wondrous awakening in a chorus they would still be unable to express even one tenthousandth of the praise When karma arises reward or retribution springs up from it Though the meaning is obscure the event is apparent Moreover even though the principle is profound the testimony is evident From what is familiar we can understand what is profound For instance when the sun or moon rises in the sky we do not have to borrow the eyes of Li Lou or when the sound of a bell reaches our ears we do not have to bother Ziqi to hear it The advocate of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit however makes himself dark strays from the right path and has trouble understanding  I humbly read His Majestys excellent purpose He achieves the apex and investigates what is profound He examines the most tranquil truth and moreover he elucidates it He opens the profound path and at the same time he claries it Even if various sages were to ride stirrup to stirrup with each other or a large number of scriptures laid out the mysterious principles in a row the Dharma expounded by the Buddha with his golden mouth on Vulture Peak and with his beautiful tongue near the Nairañjanā River cannot be sought and understood thoroughly after all without this  and if we disregard this instruction we cannot attain the right path Truly this washes away dust and dregs like the waves in the Yangzi River or the Han River leads with virtue sets ceremonies in order and returns customs and edication to  This is the reason why is versed in both the Buddhist teaching and the secular teaching I your disciple Sima Jiong present this The Answer of Qiu Zhongfu Assistant Director of the Left I humbly read the Imperial Response to His Subjects The Examination of the Discourse on the Extinction of the Spirit in which His Majesty illuminates what is profound and includes the absolute and the relative reality My humble joy deepens Xiao Mozhi the magistrate of Danyang respectfully submits a report in which he says Four dynasties have already passed since Buddhism was transmitted to China Buddhist temples and images in the thousands are everywhere When we advance we can connect our minds to  and when we retreat there are plenty of from whom we may ask advice They do not consider diligence and sincere faith to be supreme Moreover they place value on competing for luxury Instead they construct their several new buildings and proudly boast of it to each other Construction materials such as timber bamboo copper and varicolored silk are wasted limitlessly Those who disregard a standard degree and go beyond a limit should be given restraint I would like to request that from now on all those who wish to erect a bronze statue go to a government ofce and notify in person If someone arbitrarily erects a bronze statue or establishes a Buddhist temple or monastery the case should be discussed and under the law of failure to accept and exert the imperial  b decree the bronze metal and all building and construction materials and tiles will be entirely forfeited to the government His report was sanctioned At that time ramaṇa Huilin who falsely took up the position of a Buddhist monk and slandered the teaching wrote the Discourse on Buddhist Laymen and Clergy  He Chengtian the magistrate of Hengyang was in collusion with lin and they often praised one another They both adhere to one side and slander ākyamunis teaching Yan Yanzhi  magistrate of Yongjia and Zong Bing Secretariat of the Heir Apparent believe in the Dharma They reviewed these two essays and respectively refuted them in writings of more than ten thousand words lin and at rst corresponded with Yan Yanzhi and Zong Bing but they stopped before stumbling Bing accordingly wrote the Discourse to Clarify Buddhism in order to propagate his purpose His Majesty considered this to be virtuous and said to Palace Attendant He Shangzhi I did not read scriptures when I was young and I have no free time recently I have not yet thoroughly discerned causality of the three periods of existence Nevertheless the reason I do not dare go against is simply because my precursors and you contemporary men of outstanding ability who lead  all respect and trust in  Fan Tai and Xie Lingyun always say The compositions of the Six Classics were originally intended to save the common people and govern them If we must seek the genuine heart of our spirits how can we manage without taking Buddhist scriptures as guidebooks Yan Yannians refutation of the the Full Understanding of Life and Zong Shaowens criticism of the Buddhist Laymen and Clergy deeply and extensively clarify the Buddhist teaching In addition they are sufcient to open and encourage peoples minds Recently Xiao Mo requested me to draw up a constitution but I have not ordered to let pass We must have a measure to correct and stop supercial dissolute practices If has no harm in greatly encouraging the people then you should write an order Shangzhi replied People who have vague ideas mostly do not believe in the Buddhist teaching I am stupid and ignorant yet I take charge of the matter with my foolish diligence I am afraid that my incompetence will blemish the great teaching Regarding a great number of wise people of previous generations they did not disobey brilliant imperial decrees The medieval period is already far in the past and it is difcult to know completely After moving to the Jiangnan area Wang Dao and Zhou Yi are the most outstanding among the successive prime ministers Wang Meng and Xie Shang are models of the principles of human relationships Chi Chao  Wang Tan  Wang Gong  and Wang Mi are known either as being unparalleled or unrivaled People such as Guo Wen Xie Fu and Dai Kui all set their minds to the ultimate of heavenly and human beings and raise their bodies among the clouds The late brothers of my greatgrandfather ie He Chong and He Zhun were exemplars of the world with their virtuous opinions Wang Yuan and the Lin brothers held premier positions in the court due to their intelligence Other people roughly scores of men such as Fan Wang Sun Chuo Zhang Xuan and Yin Ji were talented people of the time Moreover all śramaṇas mentioned in Bings Discourse  Bo Tan  and sui are the next generation after them They are compared and contrasted with Yu Yuangui All the gentlemen before sui such as hu and lan are next to those gentlemen  When Buddhist clergy and secular people of modern times are compared and explained they are like this If we take extensive examples both from foreign countries and China and accordingly come to examples from the Han and Wei periods how could we be competent enough to speak of geniuses and extraordinary virtuous people Your Majestys thought penetrates beyond the world of creation and discretion and consideration is abstruse and subtle beyond the phenomenal world You investigate things deeply and attain what is profound How could A man can propagate the Way be a false statement Dharma Master Huiyuan once said There is nothing negative in ākyamunis edication Following the Way indeed stems from the origin of the teaching Why can it be said that only King Cheng and King Kang and Emperor Wen and Emperor Jing of the Han dynasty were extraordinary If this edication were practiced in concurrence with at the beginning of the Zhou and Han dynasties it would have been doubly fast that praise is made and punishment is terminated Personally I am inclined to think that this statement accords with the essence of reason If ten people from a village of a hundred households observe the ve precepts  those ten people are all honest and sincere If a hundred people in a town of a thousand households cultivate the ten wholesome acts those hundred people are peaceful and generous If the instruction of this teaching is transmitted and spreads throughout the world then a million people among ten million households will be benevolent This is merely an example given for those who observe both precepts and wholesome acts If those who observe even one precepts or one wholesome acts were all counted the number would be at least twenty or thirty percent of the population If one can perform a wholesome act he removes an evil act Since an evil act has been removed one punishment comes to an end If one punishment comes to an end in a family then in a state ten thousand punishments will come to an end It is not worthy to think that abandoning four hundred prisons is difcult It would be doubly fast in reason that the ode of the kingdom ya and the hymn of praise song rise This would be namely to achieve the great peace without doing anything as Your Majesty has said Theoretically speaking things should be like this If we seek actual facts for this I your subject will say more A history book of antiquity states that the people of the Western region all serve the Buddha and respect the Dharma Therefore even if the population of a large country numbers in the tens of thousands and that of a smaller country is in the hundreds in the long run they do not annex each other The people of the region are however still very honest and gentle they seldom ght Therefore when Fotudeng entered Ye cases of massacres carried out by Shi Hu were reduced by half When the treasure pagoda of Minchi in presentday Henan province emitted light Fu Jians use of a mallet and a saw to harm people stopped Mengxun turned against the one to whom he was indebted he was heartless as cruel as a wolf or tiger In his later years he was inspired and enlightened and ended up becoming a good man the Buddhist teaching matched that of Buddhist monks He possessed power as strong as that of ten thousand men combined When someone threw the region along the Yellow and Wei Rivers into disorder he was ready to risk his life and went to his teacher who was in difculty This is due to nothing other than a respectful faith  There is originally a reason for the fact that the Way of the Spirit helps in edication It often happens that are struck by lightning on a rainy summer day Regarding the incidence that the Zhan family shrine shook from being struck by lightning it was written that the Zhan family had hidden guilt In the reign periods of Jie of the Xia dynasty and Zhou  those who were wrongly put to death were too numerous to record but only King Xuan of the Zhou dynasty  and Lord Jing of the Jin dynasty incurred divine wrath for abusing their power to inict punishment When we examine examples from ancient and modern times our suspicions merely increase Scriptures and history books however record such cases as evidence of encouraging and warning  and say that one out of ten thousand images still bears its full fruit  in reason there is a purport that should be axiomatic and believable and in examining the fact there is also no fault of being perverse or absurd Furthermore familiar efcacies bestowed by Avalokiteśvara Mahāsattva all immediately manifest in experiences of ones lifetime and the people see them together with their own eyes In a family that offers prayers whatever comes true one after another This is the reason to encourage and warn  Therefore bears its full fruit Nevertheless a cohort of ignorant people improperly proceed to slander  neglect what is important yet die for what is unimportant They stick to trivial matters and miss out on what is important they resent that Buddhist monks and nuns cut off their offspring and hate that red and purple paint is wasted on Buddhist images and pagodas The case of Huilin and Chengtian is probably like this too As for the system reported by Xiao Mo I do not think this is entirely wrong but the worst people who hurt and harm the Buddhist clergy and laypeople exist among Buddhist monks and nuns who do no religious practice and it is difcult to sort them out based only on internal and external behaviors Even though more and more gold copper soil and wood are wasted to make Buddhist images and build Buddhist temples this is assuredly what is brought about by meritorious deeds It is also difcult to promptly stop this I was thinking to deal with this matter seriously these days but I had difculty in settling my course of action Today I graciously received with respect virtuous voice and I am truly at ease At that time Yang Xuanbao Gentleman of the Ministry of Personnel was present He stepped forward and said This discussion surpasses the ultimate of heavenly and human beings I am personally afraid that when we discuss plans to build up military power the states of Qin and Chu did or when we make an elaborate plot to annex other states Sun and did we should take something from this  His Majesty said This is not a preparation for the Warring States period but the issue is truly just as you said Shangzhi then said While a recluse is treated with due honor soldiers are treated coldly When benevolence is valued military esprit de corps declines If Sun and Wu are considered ideal and we engage in gobbling up other states then the Way of Yao and Shun is useless Is only ākyamunis teaching  His Majesty was delighted with and said That ākyamunis school has you is comparable to that Confucius school had Jilu It is simply a case of Evil talk does not reach my ears The Responses of Two Dharma Masters gao and ming to Li Miao of Jiaozhou Who Criticized the Matter that the Buddha Does Not Manifest Himself and Li s Letters The Way abides in purity and emptiness The principle of the four that are great is permanent but there is the Dharma gate that wondrously goes beyond a multitude of spheres If it is said that beneting the people with efcacy and delivering immeasurable are what is taught by the Buddha why doesnt he make a true appearance in this world why does he give empty talk that lacks substance I am now surely going to ask you about the origin of in the West I am humbly solicitous of you Great Precept Master to have compassion on me take ahold of my mind and freely bestow upon me your marvelous words I your disciple Li Miao bow I received a question from you about whether or not the greatest sage manifests himself The taste of your principle is profound and extensive and the signicance of your words is luminous and clear The more times I read this the more highly your virtue resounds The fences and the walls of your house are high and large and this naturally makes it difcult to nd the gate Then I will try to exhaust my humble opinions and emulate Wangxiang a mystic jade  There are generally three instances in which the Tathāgata responds to the people The rst is emitting light and causing the earth to quake which are equivalent to manifesting himself The second is that the True Dharma which is equivalent to the Buddha exists in this world The model which closely resembles corresponds to feelings of todays people What else then do they want to see Therefore the Vimalakīrtinirdeśasūtra states that is able to clarify the characteristics of existing things and know the faculties of sentient beings With regard to the three assemblies held under the dragonower tree at Kukkuṭārāma in the city of Pāṭali in Magadha state when Maitreya descends to this world from Heaven people perceive in their minds Maitreya Buddhas present existence What is then hidden Hence the Lotus Sutra states At that time I appear together with many monks at Vulture Peak It can be expected that the palace of the wheelturning king  Saṅkha who appears when Maitreya descends to this world is lofty how is it that the origin in the West cannot be seen Furthermore many people of the world who have such doubts say that the descriptions in Buddhist scriptures do not coincide with reality ākyamuni let the Dharma drum resound at the Deer Park and Confucius raised his virtuous voice in the Zou region of Lu state We cannot actually experience any of this with our own ears and eyes we believe them all based on written records If you do not believe in this  I am not troubled by the fact that you have doubts about that  Why then do you stick so rmly only to  My statements are supercial and my expressions are poor Although I speak I cannot articulate my thoughts I simply hope that on the day we personally see each other I must speak of your criticism Stated respectfully  Your expressions are arranged beautifully and there are many points with which I happily agree As you say to reform the people varies according to the time and the True or that an image differs from people to people I respectfully take your purpose as a model with which I can nd no aw Nevertheless the cause to attain awakening is assuredly based on examining by seeing  To rely on something obscure produces doubt Doubt is not the foundation of awakening If what exists in written records c is uniformly understood by various different generations we do not have to wait for a sage to appear as our teacher after countless generations If we resign ourselves to voice and trace equally his words and image are interdependent Once the great justice is disregarded the antagonism just like that between Confucianism and Mohism will ourish Then not only right faith will not be clear but also slander and misunderstanding will increase our sins Is it impossible to obtain the testimony of manifestation and strengthen with the seal and signs  With the wisdom of nonobstruction the Great Sage bestows benevolence without being asked to do so Why does he have to spare bright light make his two xuntall body obscure cut off sentient beings hope after he entered nirvana and cause them to commit sins prior to the three assemblies  If straw dogs are futilely displayed are they able to awaken you If ritual instruments and images are pointlessly set up are they able to cause you to have faith Regarding the Thearchs the Augusts the Duke of Zhou and Confucius their teachings are limited to this world Matters of the next life were left intact and they did not discuss them Therefore they did not discriminate about hiding or appearing declining or rising expedient or reality The Tathāgatas teaching completely threads through the three periods of existence and his compassion universally prots  This cannot be limited to the present existence The Buddhas altruistic activities are fully arranged successively and innumerably I have a question Where do the Buddhas altruistic activities exist today If the situation is just as you say then you believe in this ie Buddhism and testify to that  The Sage however does not appear in the world I cannot hold my tongue and refrain from  I have just expressed my thought in words I would be happy if you could further investigate in detail I Shi Daogao inform you I have again respectfully received your deep instruction I read it three times and thought of it several times and I nally came to admire your profound meaning The wisdom of predecessors and the ultimate principle are not what a common person can fathom and sublime words and abstruse expressions are not something in which a lowly and ineloquent man is concerned I will now attentively act in accordance with an ordinary mans indiscretion and roughly explain what I have in mind Some people sit and meditate in a grove some cultivate meritorious qualities in the vicinity of the city some bow and snap their ngers some sing gāthās and chant poems  All these are comprehended through the ears and eyes Actions are immeasurable This precisely corresponds to the case that the ferry by which one attains awakening is caused by relying on something obscure Why is it always the case that to attain awakening is based on examination by seeing  Doubt is also the foundation of awakening Please let me discuss this When one has a doubt he seeks a resolution  When the doubt is resolved one is able to become awakened When awakened one enters the Way If this is not the foundation then what is Even though Confucianism and Mohism vied with each other in rising and the nine schools discussed right and wrong the torches have not been put out and it is not that the sun and moon no longer shine brightly Why do you anxiously urge manifestation and hurriedly return to the same point The present world is indeed in the last period of the  when there is no realization It is also not incorrect to produce an effect in order to prove sincerity The Great Sage spares bright light Those in the world who have this doubt are arrogant and they do not see the Buddhas appearance Subsequently they end up being long confused in a great dream and perversely sink and drown in birth and death Scholars of the past and ancient sages have made old statements on this for  the most part There are not several traces of wheels on the path In that case I transmit but will not state  If we efface ourselves and sincerely devote ourselves to  we will assuredly sense  When we sense him we equally see him If we do not sense him we do not see him Those who have seen tell this to those who have not seen him but those who have not seen him certainly do not believe it How could it be that the Sage does not exist How could it be that sentient beings do not see him People hear the sound of the Dharma and praise it as good does not mean straw dogs are futilely displayed People see images and bow to them Would this be the case when wonderful ritual instruments are futilely set up The Duke of Zhou and Confucius tried to save decadent worlds How did they have time to spare to instruct people about future existences If Confucius and the Duke of Zhou had been born when knotting rope  they would have endlessly claried the three periods of existence You asked me Where do the Buddhas altruistic activities exist today We bow our heads and join our hands  There are however methods to bring people to be deeply awakened Even though the paths may vary they all arrive at the same point Regarding what I referred to in my previous letter that having a doubt in this and believing in that  this is precisely because since people of the world do not see and then say there is no Buddha I simply used the example of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius whom we have also not seen How could this be called contradiction Your innate intelligence is perfect and original disposition is spontaneous You hold a rank in the place of the Imperial throne and plan with your great resources You roam in the park of philosophic principles and wander in the garden of books In spare moments from your busy duty you enjoy carefree time for a long day Once your virtuous voice is given there is no one who does not listen to you attentively I have rough and shallow learning I am deeply ashamed of my poor skill in correspondence I submit my absurd and coarse reply to you  I fear that I will stain your glorious writing with particles of dust My awe and shame increase afterward and I am in an incessant cold sweat Your discussion claried that the ferry to reach awakening is accordingly attained through doubt to rely on something obscure is sufcient  there is no need to examine by seeing  and actions such as bowing and reciting praises are all enough to reach Way Nevertheless you say that the Dharma of a image departs from the True  your logic of seeking for awakening is vulgar To take this from secular books serves the purpose sufciently Why must emit light and cause the earth to quake without any reason If right faith is not conned to merely bending and lifting ones head and the Buddhas altruistic activities are completely performed through body and speech then what the Great Awakened One depends on is his wonderful physical form which is the foundation at the beginning when one rst becomes involved and seeks  Therefore it is known that those who rst come to believe in certainly doubt based on Confucian or Mohist and even those who learn still feel sorry about a lack of testimony  There is no trouble with the Three and the Five even if they spare bright light but it is a fault of the ten epithets to hide morality Wouldnt this be the case In addition you say that the Duke of Zhou and Confucius were engaged in relieving the decadent world and had no time the next life if they had existed in the time b when knotting rope they would have spontaneously claried the three periods of existence This is not the case either The future is included in the meanings spoken of in the Seven Classics Issues expounded and recorded in Buddhist scriptures are conned to reward and retribution based on causality Therefore the Book of Changes says The family that accumulates wholesomeness is certainly to have superabundant happiness and accumulates evil surely to have superabundant misery The sūtra says There are no self no one who creates  and no one who receives  yet good and evil karma does not perish This precisely indicates that the teaching of causality usually indicates being gradual while the teaching that includes is very magnanimous Could it be said that what is engaged in lies in this and what it lacks lies in that Your discussion is beautiful but it is from the beginning merely speech that goes around and around in circles I hope that you will pick up new and expound something different in order to wash away the delusions of all ages make the level and easy way wider and smoother and greatly pierce through the accumulated hindrances I deeply wish that you Great Precept Master will graciously accept my clear sincerity Presented respectfully by your disciple Li Miao A great discussion has been bestowed on me here I spent time to respectfully read this This is as fragrant as an orchid that blooms in a dark gorge and as clean as a gentle breeze My caliber is not as sharp as peaked frost and my movement is not that of chef Sheng I am inclined to be contrary to reason and alone am frustrated by many doubts This is truly because my expression is poor and my point of argument is not lucid and severe criticisms are ranged just as stars  I a silly person think that doubting something obscure placing ones mind in what is wonderful examining through seeing the manifestation bowing and singing praises and being moved by the Buddha who mysteriously transforms are all guides to reach the Way and a happy occasion to cleanly ascend  Therefore placing ones mind and examining through seeing may both be recommended and both doubt and verication should be practiced Would it be possible to give up seeing the manifestation  promptly forget the brilliant appearance equalizes the path with that of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius take to follow the same pattern as worldly instruction and think that emitting light and causing the earth to quake are empty speech for nothing The dharmakāya is quiet and still and the wondrous physical form of the Buddha is calm Therefore he is able to hide and show himself in accordance with the times and his course of action is inscrutable When he manifests himself he appears taking advantage of thusness  When he hides himself he is well gone  When we seek the purpose in conformity with these words what mistake could there be between and the ten epithets The glow after shines brightly enough for the decadent world How can those who have faith be more doubtful about since is just like the light of a rey or candlelight Buddhist pagodas images scriptures and books are replete all over the world How can those who learn feel sorry about a lack of testimony Furthermore in the meanings of the Seven Classics to which you refer the future is included  accumulates wholesomeness is certainly to have superabundant happiness and accumulates evil is surely to have superabundant misery even though people are born and die one after another and successively change into a new generation it is impossible not to receive the reward and retribution for good and evil karma  This is extensively claried in the three periods of existence which is even clearer than the Seven Classics I have inquired into this in writings and inspected it in reality You say in your previous discussion Regarding the Thearchs the Augusts the Duke of Zhou and Confucius their teachings c are limited to this world Matters of the next life were left intact and they did not discuss them Therefore they did not discriminate about hiding or appearing declining or rising expedient or reality This seems to contradict  In my previous letter I gave a rough account of the appearance and latency of the Highest Sage  but the signicance is unclear and my expressions were vague I would like to propagate the highest Way together with you Sentient beings enjoy a long sleep in the three realms of existence Their consciousness is eternally confused in the six dusts They secretly move and become mere subjects to be preyed upon The body serves as an inn and the spirit is equal to a guest who rests there on its way They suffer transmigration in the three lowest realms of existence They have hardships passing through the eight difculties Happiness and joy are temporary pleasures anxiety and fear are unending After the body dies and decays they receive another body Even if were to emit light and cause the earth to quake could a person in such a condition see it Consequently profound scriptures are circulated and expedients wait in array for a chance to take action After sensing it there is a response to it We slacken the reins in the way of purity and tighten them in the streets of evil and falsehood If we plant virtue and remove weeds virtue will grow densely and luxuriantly If we plant merit and pour right on this will branch out with a thick foliage How could we not be intimately illuminated by the brilliant luster and see his mysterious transformation Taking examples from what the ears and eyes perceive and what may be seen in a dream  Emperor Ming of the Han dynasty awoke to the Sage on the basis of a dream he had The great Dharma was thereupon transmitted  Monarchs sincerely devote themselves to take refuge in virtue Outstanding persons adjust themselves and abide by the edication ramaṇas stand shoulder to shoulder with princes Buddhist monks and nuns do not bow to emperors Who considers the ninetysix to be as lofty as  At the time Emperor Wu of the Song dynasty rst ascended to the throne he dreamed of a Buddhist monk carrying an almsbowl to beg  who then addressed him You gave a bowl of food to Vipaśyin Buddha in your previous life you attained the throne in this life The emperor dispatched a messenger to ask Eminent Huiyan to prove whether was true or false Eminent Huiyan immediately sent the Sutra on the Seven Buddhas to present to the emperor for his perusal Sun Quan  a ruler of Wu state was at rst doubtful of Buddhism cast bright light in his palace it could not be broken by hitting with metal or iron  and it could not be melted through metallurgy a Jianchu Temple seen today in the capital was built in connection with this incident In Wu County there was a stone Buddhist image that oated on the sea Five or six Buddhist monks and four men whose family name was either Zhu or Zhang approached and respectfully welcomed it remains now at North Temple in Wu County Among those who are extremely sincere there is no one who does not have the receptivity  The Zhu and Zhang families believe in Buddhism from generation to generation because they saw this miracle happen Guo Wenju greatly worshiped the Three Treasures He once groped for a sh bone  He had deep discernment regarding what is safe and what is dangerous Eminent lan brushed off a heavy coat of snow from a ferocious animal Eminent hu moved a driedup spring from which water owed out in response All were equally outstanding in lofty conduct and surpassed ordinary people in pure spirit I feel solitary and uncultivated with but little information My words are impolite and my expressions are plain I am humbled by shame and awe as a consequence of  The Discourse to Clarify Buddhism composed by Layman Zong of Jingzhou says Bo Yi said in the Book of Mountains and Seas Shanhai jing In the country of Shendu the people are very dear to others and love one another In Guo Pus commentary on the book it is said The country we formerly called du is Tianzhu where Futu originated  Liu Xiangs Biographies of Arrayed Transcendents states that seventyfour are found in the Buddhist scriptures Again it was not during the reign of Emperor Ming of the Han dynasty that began  The eminent Buddhist monk Fotudeng was a kindhearted sage at the time of Shi Le and Hu told Shi Hu In the city of Linzi county there is the old site of Ayuwang Temple where there is still a image and the dew basin is buried in the earth more than twenty zhang under a big tree in a deep forest An envoy of Hu looked for them relying on the illustration and found everything had mentioned Recently when Yao Les uncle was a king of Jin he saw a bright light at the site of Ayuwang Temple so called by the elders in Puban of Hedong Seeking he had dig there and obtained relics of the Buddha in a silver case placed inside a stone container Today bhikṣus live in a new temple where the relics are worshiped From the observation of these facts a long time has passed since Buddhist practices were transmitted to the land of Qi and Jin The reason was not mentioned in the three commentaries ie the Zuozhuan the Gongyang and the Guliang is similar to the reason why in the history books written by Gan Bao and Sun Sheng there are no remarks about the Buddha During the Jin period ourished in the Jiangzuo area  The Letter of King Wenxuan Given to Kong Zhigui Palace Aide to the CensorinChief in Order to Dispel Doubts together with the Answer I closely read your letter line by line I have long worried that groundless words always impair the right path and drastic measures harm purity and b peace The Mengzi says A monarch should not be fond of wisdom A monarch should not be fond of courage Excessive courage and wisdom produce trouble and disasters What he abides by is exactly that he should take love and justice as the foundation Today since studying ākyamunis teaching I have realized for the rst time from where this statement derives By pledging to and practicing  I would like people in both high and low positions to equalize their good points Furthermore I will use an illustration for liberation Nothing is gained and nothing is lost The goal of the teaching of the truth and the secular teaching is simply the same Because those who practice have not mastered this inconsistent views arise indiscriminately You say One who accumulates karma stays in faith In that case this would mean that speech and action go against each other Can it be said to be great lial piety that while attending ones parents a person respects his parents on the one hand and injures or wounds his own body a gift from his parents on the other I have never heard of such a thing The deeds of a person of virtue are not something to injure heartlessly but something to increase his goodness The moral conduct of an honest person does not form his virtue through greed and theft If things were like this would it be possible to reject taking refuge in the Three Treasures and observing the ve precepts even for a moment Would it be possible to abandon the ten wholesome acts and the eightfold holy path to enlightenment even for a short time I have not seen a case where the foundation is treated lightly while the branches are valued This is what is called The root has already been inclined and its branches and leaves follow it afterward Now you say The two paths are separate and different from each other How could it be possible to follow  I see that this statement is merely supercial talk Why do you incline your determination only to one side and bury the path  A person of learning does not usually leave the secular world to give instruction The teaching that conforms to the ways of the world can be understood If it is said that this Dharma vainly consists only of deception and falsehood the doubts of increase and it should be destroyed Would it then be possible to reprimand various instructions and admonitions for the reason that there are not many such good people and to burn all the classics history books and admonitory works How different is from this example Therefore those who take refuge in the excellent Dharma originally do not show their minds with decorum and respect and those who respectfully admire and worship do not from the beginning forget other people and think only of themselves Today those who courteously overcome their own desires are precisely only your group of people Together you now intend to leave behind arrogance remove haughtiness restrain sensual desires control greedy desires cultivate politeness and modesty learn how to be respectful admire benevolence and righteousness and deepen your lial piety toward your parents and respect for your siblings Why would you then be ashamed of yourselves in the eyes of spiritual beings To diligently urge yourselves to carry out the practices is exactly seen here Although I am not able to respectfully follow  I do not forget this in my mind glows in the night has not yet been thrown to you but you have already stood up and placed your hand on your sword  Even though you seek to hope for morality together dont you instead feel more ashamed What I have in my mind is not this The Ofce of the Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs primarily exhorts the teaching of the ve kinds of principles of human relationships Together we earnestly perform these good acts in order to act in accordance with freedom from desire and cause those who deceive and atter others to reform themselves through merely viewing the gate of the Ofce of the Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs or cause those who make an outward show without sincerity and who have loose morals to improve their c behaviors only through stepping into the yard of the Ofce of the Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs equalize the Ofce of the Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs to that mansion which sets our hearts at rest  and make the Ofce of the Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs equal to the tower of freedom from desire  Wouldnt this be good First we respectfully follow the benevolence bestowed by the emperor all over the world Second we respectfully receive the affectionate wholesomeness granted to us by the crown prince are fond of idly speaking on a great variety of subjects They say they do so because they wish for wholesomeness They have not been aware of the important point of harming the edication If this trouble has not yet spread I an old vulgar shallow person deeply regret it Why do you think that hurts the basis of lial piety and damages the foundation of principles If this issue can be abandoned I would be happy to hear other good points If a teaching is propagated in this way without fail Fangxun should have waited for the four wicked ones to reform themselves and attain sagehood instead of banishing them to the four distant regions and Yu Shun should have waited for Shangjun to become wise and his virtue to become clear Your intention like this should have what is broadly corrected What practice would we then be able to cultivate Generally when we hear a speech we assuredly judge the behavior When we see a behavior we certainly search for the reason behind that behavior If your reason does not contradict and your behavior does not transgress please do not reach for strange doctrines Truly different paths arrive at the same goal You need not be consistent in a minor point Recently there are many people who agree with you in this intention Today I convey my opinion in this letter Those who do not concentrate their attention harbor doubt and delusion in their minds His Majesty made this known publicly and widely I have briey expressed his thought but it seems that nothing is clear The issue easily becomes troublesome in a letter I cannot completely express my intention after all Everyone has a mind of his own just as everyones face is unique Could it ever happen that every persons face is the same and his or her intelligence is equal  Once someone goes against the path how could be changed by explanation When I saw you even though you claried the issue completely in your statement we did not reach this point This is truly because there was already a difference between the two parties yours and mine It would be fortunate if each party could maintain the same small difference  There is simply no need to fruitlessly discuss right or wrong and slander each other without restraint a As for resting ones mind and coming to have faith it is not that the virtuous people of former times did not have this determination I consider now that following wholesomeness is my happiness Therefore I try to take the conceit out of myself when meeting with people If you think that your virtue surpasses those of the ancient wise people your sacredness exceeds that of former virtuous people your intelligence excels that of a large number of people and your rank is the highest of human nobility then you can enjoy a free and leisurely life outside the mundane world edify people in your own way place your mind at a lofty level have nothing more to seek and be selfsufcient If we were to meet each other in a leisurely manner I would not have said anything from the beginning Recently I wrote a twofascicle work the Explanation on Dispelling Delusions  I think you may have already seen it at some other place I now send it and show it to you I would be happy if there is no need for you to further trouble yourself  It was written only to dispel my own doubts and delusions When you read this you will surely clap your hands in glee Kong Zhiguis Letters together with Answer I Zhigui explain I receive with respect your benevolent favor from early on I have deeply enjoyed the instruction given by you together with great mercy Thanks to your kindness I will assuredly complete my life I dare to now show my sincerity and humbly pray to illuminate your mind My family has occupied a noble position for a long time respectfully following Li Lao  We set our minds to become void and calm and make our conduct pure and moderate I revere and hold to the path my ancestors followed and cut off even as tiny as a speck of autumn dust Regarding the brilliant teaching of the Great Awakened One and the right origin of transcendental wisdom these are what I have come to respect in the course of my life Usually when I infer the ultimate principle principles come to the same point Since the time I began to respectfully receive your instruction I rely on and come close to your style You guide me through the right vehicle ie the right teaching and lead me with the universal precepts You caused me to promptly remove the six kinds of hindrances and to precisely clarify the ve desires I bow with my head to the ground and join my hands  I am willing to abide by this I respectfully take refuge in  I have pure faith from early on Regarding the important precepts and minor articles I have already observed half of them It would simply be unbearable for me to one day suddenly give up  There is an origin in the world of my mind I do not wish to conceal myself with regret throughout the morning Since the two teachings ie Buddhism and Daoism are almost the same I originally do not dare be unwilling to transfer my mind  How could I not happily think of the Mahayana teaching and cordially make up my mind to pursue the One Vehicle Needless to say I respectfully rely on you who equally govern propriety and morals Furthermore I must recite with reverence your pure faith Even though I think to say something against this my mind is unconsciously infatuated with it Further I did not foresee the greatness of your skillful guidance was so wondrous Extensiveness and simplicity are arranged from point to point and the exquisite light shines out Even if I intend to stop this I am still unable to do so Even if I did want to go against this how could I avoid facing it Until now I was not intelligent indeed but from now on I will make it my business to practice your words My silly mind just adheres to my family law I dare not distinguish ākyamuni from Laozi in my mind On one occasion we taught this to Zhang Rong who then wrote the Discourse on the Way to Reach the Origin of the Two Teachings  His name is Shaozi What Shaozi claried is how to combine Daoism and Buddhism Rongs comprehension of this derives from my family In the beginning I hesitated to take this trace but now I always respect both Buddhism and Daoism from the bottom of my heart I do not expect to suddenly attain great awakening one morning But if I am able to attain awakening it will be entirely owing to your guidance Again I have personally investigated how Daoism differs from Buddhism When Daoists discuss the ultimate they say that it exists in all the heavens but Buddhists despise this and say that it does not go beyond the three realms of existence Teachings are originally based on the mind and are adaptable to all people employ whatever people see and then the people follow them On the point of following  both make an exhaustive study of wondrous things Accordingly if there is a ground at the end of the ultimate its profundity would certainly tower over Heaven Laozi also says There was something undened and complete coming into existence before Heaven and Earth This means that the Way already exists beyond Heaven Rather does not take Heaven as the Way How is this different from the fact that in the Buddhist school an arhat is indicated as one who has attained the fourth fruition and yet just as in the Shengman jing  it is known that he still has more steps  Daoists worship of the zenith of Heaven is similar to the Buddhists the fruit of arhatship The Buddhist intention is not limited to arhatship The Daoist is not conned to Heaven either Then and only then do I believe that what Daoists consider to be the Way is denitely connected with the Buddhist Way in origin What my present mind relies on then follows the same direction as yours The Daoist school asserts abiding by wholesomeness This is consequently the same as the Buddhist school In the points common to both Buddhism and Daoism I do not carelessly abandon the Daoist teaching In the points where Daoism differs  I follow and join your Mahayana teaching I beg you to dare not lay down a further difference between Buddhism and Daoism today I have respectfully written of my sincere view I humbly wish for you to take notice of the penitence of an insignicant person and understand my initial position  I will withdraw and repent of my initial  c On the twentyninth day of the eleventh month a man of the province Palace Aide to the Censorinchief Kong Zhigui explains Originally reason is not dual This is something I usually deplore sighing Prince Xiaos answer says This letter from you is very good You should show it widely to those who have not understood the point The Letters of Two Dharma Teachers Daoheng and Daobiao Responding to Yao le the Usurper Ruler of the Later Qin Dynasty Who Exhorts Them to Give up the Way together with the Letters of the Ruler Yao The Ruler Yaos Letter Given to Two Eminent Monks heng and biao You are delighted with the tranquility of the essence of the Way I desire to summon people who live in sylvan seclusion with satisfaction and to search for who live in obscurity at a butchers shop Each of you receives the ability to manage the trend of the times and yet hides yourself in a place to keep yourself clean and pure Does this indicate the most genuine feeling with which I seek the wise and the deep interest by which you both propagate the Buddhist teaching together The ancient people had a saying There is a very fast horse in the country but no one rides it and the people only anxiously search for it This refers to us Today I will make an Imperial edict to Director of the Imperial Secretariat Xian in order to take up your meritorious minds of the two vehicles I hope you will understand my thoughts about this You cannot make to remain faithful to your principle a good excuse We respectfully received the Imperial decree dated the twentyeighth day of the last month You will make an Imperial edict to the Director of the Imperial Secretariat in order to take the Dharma robes from us Daoheng and Daobiao Since the moment we received the decree we have been sad in fear We have lost our composure and are ashamed and bewildered in every action We heng and  are truly stupid and incompetent in natural abilities and endowments It has not been long since we were imbued with the Dharma What we keep in mind is serious and our attachment to the Dharma is also deep We humbly received the favorable edict in which we are praised above what we deserve Even though you speak and reason in every possible way we really feel that we have no moment of ease We made a vow that throughout our lifetimes we will be under Dharma robes Concurrently we have been learning the Buddhist Dharma since our youth and we are not familiar with worldly affairs Even though we have a reputation for outstanding capability we are a useless to benet the times Before seeing even a small amount of help there would be a loss as large as a mountain We thus do not accept for your sake Your Majesty Even Emperor Guangwu of the Later Han dynasty could allow the recluse Yan ling to think freely and King Wen of the Wei kingdom kept Guan Nings moral principles intact the monarchs controlled their lofty ideas and let an ordinary person fulll his triing determination Lenient with the masses were content not to mention Your Majesty who manages the people by means of the Way You concurrently propagate the Three Treasures gather scholars of philosophical principles from all over the world in the capital city and circulate new and unfamiliar Buddhist scriptures in remote as well as near places The great Dharma ourishes and prospers upon this You have established a model for the coming one thousand years as a path to guide future generations  how could we Daoheng and  alone submit to this bright time and be unable to appeal to you for our ambition We humbly pray that you will examine our intention especially bestow the unrestrained principle which is understood by the less educated grant a brilliant decree again and concede our insignicant thought Then we will bear our gratitude to you even in the underworld and appreciate your virtue kalpa after kalpa We cannot stand trembling with fear We respectfully report to you The reason you have to submit to me now is because you are needed by the times Do not come to this through pushing your true intention Feel vexed about your politeness expand your horizons and respond to my interest I will not grumble anymore You are only expected to respectfully accept the current government order and make efforts to follow the bodhisattva path We Daoheng and  recently presented  hoping you would understand when you examined it We are not favored by your sympathy and benevolence We humbly read it with sorrow and anxiety Your Majesty your benevolence is as great as Heaven and Earth and you cause the people to be delighted in their nature We heng and  received training in Dharma edication when we were young What our stupid minds hope is that upon our oath we will be able to complete our triing lives in the Dharma robes Nevertheless you bestow on us undeserved favor kindly forget our ignorance and encourage us to propagate the bodhisattva way to save all sentient beings without distinction There is however a limit to our determination and power This is really something for which we are not adequate is not only to excuse ourselves from because we want to live in our remaining years we personally think that we must live up to what we foolishly keep in mind We humbly pray that you will examine and excuse us for our wholehearted sincerity and will not blame us for being stubbornly biased grant us a special benevolent imperial decree and accede to our triing feelings We repeatedly invite your brilliant decree and accordingly gasp for breath in fear We report with reverence to you again The situation is just as I explained thoroughly in my previous decree Do not annoy me again and again In our previous petition presented to the throne the issues to which we Daoheng and  hold with foolish intention have been thoroughly stated But since our purity and sincerity are wanting we were unable to move and awaken Your Majestys mind We repeatedly received an Imperial decree in b reply but we have not been placed under your benevolence We are anxious and fearful in our everyday life and our minds are not  Your Majesty cherishes the Way you efface yourself and accept everything and there is no limit to your support for the people We pray that you will reveal your kindness Heaven and Earth and allow us to accomplish onetenth of our determination If we take part in the offense of breaching an Imperial decree we will contentedly take responsibility for it without resentment We frequently asked you to listen to our winding  Report to the Throne by the Three Dharma Teachers Sengle Sengqian and Kumārajīva in Response to the Letters of the Ruler Yao who Tried to Suspend the Monkhood of Daoheng and biao together with the Ruler Yaos Letters The Ruler Yaos Letter Given to Kumārajīva Several tens of days have passed since I saw you last It is gradually getting warmer and warmer A petty savage tribe started hostilities in a remote area and there is no way to deal with them Everything is mournful I need talented people in order to manage these things Recently I issued an Imperial edict to Daoheng and and ordered them to take off the robes for arhat and seek the bodhisattvas trace You Dharma teacher must persuade them If I only mean to cause them to give up their minds of seeking the Way why would it be necessary for me to do this ie summon them to join the administration Since I have too many things to do I am not able to write in detail Please persuade them and cause them to advance in the bodhisattva practice The Ruler Yaos Letter Given to Sengqian and Others I examined what you have presented in your letter which gives a detailed account of each matter Ziling emulated Emperor Guangwu Junping was arrogant in a marketplace of Shu Zhou Dang refused a stipend from the Han court and Du Wei told Zhuge that he was deaf All these people stubbornly esteemed righteousness How sufcient are they to judge the essential points whether to be silent or to speak out and to understand the tenor of loftiness and excellence At present China is not governed well and the common people have hardships Having little virtue I alone try to deal with this bad situation I expect to nd many talented people with whom I might peacefully have the highest level of administration Even though you Dharma teachers have a quiet concentrated mind in the Dharma gate you also assist the world and propagate the teaching If the nine tributary streams of the Yellow River overowed and all the people were to become sh how could you Dharma teachers who assist the world and propagate the teaching apply  Furthermore for a long time Daoheng and have kept the instructions of the Dharma in mind Therefore I simply wish to remove their determination against their will in order to assist my ignorance in administration If there is a manifestation of meritorious reward and if the Buddha does not lie then regarding the achievement of delivering the world from an emergency and the honor of beneting the times and peacefully governing the country the merit exists here  not over there  You should instruct and explain this to each other in order to meet my hopes Therefore brilliant monarchs of ancient times discerned that it is difcult to govern if they go against nature and they became aware of the reason it is easy to let the people conduct affairs without restriction Thus Yao freed Xu You in Mount Ji Ling ie Lord Wen of Wei state allowed Ganmu to retire to his hermitage in Wei state the founder of the Han dynasty released the four bright men to Mount Zhongnan Shudu was summoned for the government during the Han dynasty and yet declined Zai Kui of the Jin dynasty put on coarse clothes in Shan county  and Xie Fu became a recluse on Mount Ruoye with disheveled hair They probably considered that following the nature of the wise is virtuous Therefore there are a wise ruler above and those who wear a leather girdle ie common people below The manners of hermits give a lesson today Regarding Daobiao and heng their virtue is not perfect and prominent now and their lot lies in remaining faithful to their principle Furthermore they learned the profound edication when they were young and they keep the Buddhist Way in mind and maintain it They are earnestly sincere and their determination is certainly rm without agitation As for expounding the subtle Buddhist scriptures and studying what is obscure they are sufcient to enlighten even children and to help edify about merit When one can cause people to discern what is evil and what is meritorious he has the benet to deliver them from suffering If the Buddha does not lie biao and are propagating the teaching of Vaiśālī We personally heard that recently often received a favorable Imperial decree that aimed to take the Dharma robes from them This indeed indicates Your Majestys benevolence and friendliness you spread kindness that is uncommon in the world Even beings outside the universe are moved by your pure virtue and are widely edied  We foolish monks think that although heng and biao are insignicant individuals and differ a little from others in maintaining their views they are originally within your net that is to say they are subjects for whom Your Majesty edies the Way Formerly Bei assisted in governing the world for twelve years We have not heard that his Dharma robe was taken away and he worldly opinions about his appearance If a person is helpful for the times he will greatly benet even if he wears a Buddhist surplice  In former times Chao and You upheld their high principles both Yao and You were lofty and the four bright men did not surrender to  This is the same principle throughout all ages and has been the common manner for one hundred generations They do not deserve having a magnicent carriage in the Tangfu village They are not as intelligent as Kongming Would they be good enough to receive three calls at the thatched cottage in the way that Kongming was visited by Liu Bei We pray that Your Majesty will bestow bygone favors on them and comply with their triing determination If a ruler does not give too much kindness  and the ruled do not lose their lot the edication of Emperor Tang will reemerge here and the guests near the Ying River and under Mount Ji will appear again today Sengle and his fellow monks speak The Letter of Dharma Teacher Huiyuan of Mount Lu in Response to Huan Xuan Who Urges that be Removed from the  together with Huan Xuans Letter Huan Xuans Letter The ultimate Way is far and remote The Buddhist principles are subtle and profound How could this be what ordinary people who spend time idly can learn and seek Buddhist monks of the present world even though they disgure their appearance have more than secular people What they talk about is the boundary between the Buddhist clergy and secular people It can be said that they are similar to the man who tried to learn the art of walking at Handan but forgot his original way of walking and crawled back home from there A sage of former times had a saying While you do not know life how can you know about death however torment their bodies and minds throughout their lifetimes and seek the imperceptible happiness of the nether world This is all a narrow view If they get lost and yet recognize to return they will not be far from the right path We will quickly become old if we waste time I will be happy if you can accept my words Dharma Teacher yuans Response The Great Way is profound and its principles are abstruse I cherish this lofty purpose which is really as you say Nevertheless I have renounced the world accordingly I am a guest from outside this world Even though I have not fullled the virtue of ancient wise people I am earnestly determined to seek enlightenment remove worldly clothing and dress decline fame and seek truth If the other world exists I originally and certainly do not fall short of secular people  It can be said that even though you see the appearance you have not yet come to the truth  How sad this is How sad this is fastened with a rope belt and who live in the mountains resting their heads on rocks are  they look majestic but they are unsubstantial They are people of a narrow view not worthy of envy Even though they discipline their original nature in mountains and forests how different are they from trees and shrubs Bian He wept aloud on Mount Jing because he was troubled by the fact that people could not distinguish  Formerly we heard the name of Bian He and now we see a person  Shouldnt you make merit for your future life You mentioned that a person who learned the art of walking at Handan had no achievement in the new and lost his original way  so he employed a man of Handan and crawled back to his hometown How can you mix these together to lead to your point  I already go against worldly affairs I temporarily place myself amid popular customs because among them I would like to edify those who have not yet been edied glory of ones lifetime is as momentary as a ash of lightning Whenever things meet they come to part It is not worthwhile to be greedy People of shallow views are confused on this point It can be said that The scholars of the lowest class when they hear about the Way have a great laugh at it They can really be said to be people who are confused and do not know how to return  Therefore I disgure my humble appearance ie shave my head and wear patchwork clothes  How could I give up my original ambition and realize your lofty instruction I am growing old with the passing of time and I have not recovered from illness You then graciously bestowed on me your brilliant consolation I have mingled feelings of appreciation and joy Your faith is deep and you serve as one to whom the great Dharma entrusts itself How could you cause even a single wound and damage the foundation  is not the words of Pāpīyas the devil king who tried to distract  I did my best to respond to your lofty order The Letters of Dharma Teacher Sengyan to Decline the Provincial Governor of Qingzhou Liu Shanmings Recommendation for the Official Appointment of the Cultivated Talent  together with Liu Shanmings Responses I renounced the world in my youth and separated from secular affairs from my early years I enjoy myself with the Buddhist teaching in my mind and in my determination I have turned my back on the Confucian teaching Even though I have not accorded with the place where the Buddhist Way is practiced I am originally far from the instruction of Confucius who was born near the Zhu River I am just now thinking to feed my body to a beast hoping to achieve the merit beyond nine kalpas and to share my esh to feed a dove intending to ride on clouds  How could I let my wings hang down in the middle of agricultural land turn back the path toward the place of connement give up the comfort of being in this path and hold these nuisances of the Imperial court in my arms Moreover ofcials are based on ability and good talent is certainly necessary for ofcial ranks There has not been a case where someone who is favored by an undeserved recommendation can maintain his glory to the end Please do not cause me to make you sigh in lamentation again just as Lord Cao who lamented the talented people who had declined his rewards and do not make me feel ashamed of myself once more just as Wang Zhou did The summons for replacement of the Cultivated Talent is not something for which I am t I Shi Sengyan present this Response to the Buddhist Monk Sengyan The book Zhuangzi explains that it is a mistake to leave ones native place in his youth A Buddhist scripture depicts the confusion of a poor son who does not know how to return to his father Every time I read these books I heave a long sigh It is important to respectfully care for our own hair and skin to become famous in future history and to reverently make well known When we seek sacred words far away this teaching is superlative When I apply the various familiar matters to me the reality confuses my reason and feeling If Gautama were to see this he would not oppose indeed Moreover you possess skill in debating and arguing others down over triing points and knowledge to penetrate ancient and modern times If you tear my cap and do not doubt or if you pull out my root and c are not aware of it the nether world will be surprised and people in both distant and near regions will be startled In ancient times L Shang held a shing rod at the age of eighty and set his mind on shing This is because his time had not yet come You have not yet come to drown and perish If you do not do so wouldnt that be sad I am grateful to have been appointed to an ofce in my native place where I hope to nd bright people who live in obscurity Therefore I would like to lead those who have not been led and cause those who have not risen to rise If you were to make an absurd statement would this be what I expect Formerly Wang Xiang was a woodman at yi and at the age of sixty for the rst time he assented to a provincial order Gongsun Hong pastured pigs on a beach When he already had gray hair he was only then recommended to serve in the central government as a wise man from a local school What do you think about this I respectfully declare my true thoughts and feelings Please reconsider  I Liu Jun reply to you The basis of your theory is bright When I wish to yield to the principles and argue with my feelings I merely have no ground Even though lofty righteousness appears as a phenomenon and subtle words enter into mind things in which my despicable mind persists can be still understood The reason is because one who knows people is wise and one who examines oneself is intelligent I truly feel uneasy if I were to forget my lot and rush on recklessly Formerly Wei Zhi complied with an order and had the humiliation of losing his reputation at last and Zun Zu was invited for service because of his ability and in the end he invited disgrace like that of the swan who tried to perch on a willow branch If I forget my lot and intend to imitate them in order to follow the traces of Wang and L The ability is the same crime as stealing things Shouldnt we refrain from this Therefore even if cut his own esh  no one jeered at him in former ages and even if he had his hair cut he still had the chance to join the administration of the state in the past Why is this strange I pray that you will pardon my foolish persistence and grant a favor to allow me to achieve my humble ambition I Shi Sengyan present this Second Response I received a letter from you again Your clear realization can be said both sides to look at each other and smile You have the knowledge to examine many currents and the wisdom to embrace the innermost of principles Every time you investigate the source of the relationship between receptivity and responsive activity you look for a theory as thoroughly as if you were sorting stones Why dont you always come to the point in every sentence and clearly see the foundation of the principles Furthermore if your humility makes you more brilliant you go against the manner of yielding a seat to the wise You are just like someone who follows an overturned chariot and has no regret about falling in its tracks While it is not difcult to recognize this it is not easy to practice it a Three years after a person leaves his country he is happy when he sees someone who looks like a member of his family Today if you make a vow to let go of the heavy burden from your shoulders and sit idly you will feel like giving up being a traveler and returning home You will go to the gate of your house joyfully and enjoy great happiness Moreover this is a time when the civilization controls the movements of Heaven just as when the Duke of Zhou and Lord Zhao mutually helped in political affairs thinking of wise people and praising the Way they forgot to take a meal until the evening came How is it possible to talk at the same level with the disgrace of shaving ones head and the suffering of being a bachelor We have worked sedulously in deance of hardships we have wished for a long time to train our deep determination If I hide a wise man like Zhan Qin  I will be reproached for being as disloyal as Zang Wen Zhong Therefore I have done my best to quickly inscribe this in my mind and explain it again in my response You should make effort and do not end up with bitter regrets I Liu Jun reply to you Sengyans Third Letter The issue I wrote about the other day should have somehow caused you to have fun and I did not think your favorable purpose was that profound Your kindness to encourage and instruct me extends this much Before I humbly read completely I broke into a cold sweat Now I have already grown old These are beyond comparison Formerly Zitai obeyed order and held his principle against Gongsun  Yu  who lacquered his body took revenge upon on behalf of Zhibo and had no regrets about ruining himself My virtue that you excessively praise today is as good as those of the two wise men Swallowing charcoal or deserting to the enemy camp are eternally far from my wish Facing letter paper I felt sad I did not know what to express I would be happy if you can stop your excessive favor of me Please do not write back to me again I Shi Sengyan present this Nevertheless you lost the root of reason when you were young and now move unsteadily losing the course when you have gray hair I value highly your talent Therefore I always sigh in lamentation Even though your mind is above the clouds your body remains in a pit in the ground Since you form a group with titmice I am afraid that you will lose the beauty of a phoenix  Therefore I acted in accordance with formal propriety in inviting scholars for service Compromise and comply with my recommendation for service in which we have a relationship between guest and host You deigned to write to me b three times and I have replied to you twice I respectfully defer to your clean breeze and reverently follow what you esteem I decided I am still ashamed of myself and concerned for you I Liu Jun reply to you When I make an inquiry I see that once śramaṇas renounce the world they are not bound by worldly dignities and emoluments Since the time of the Han and Wei periods successive distinguished sages all extended their greetings and no ruler requested them to bow before him Nevertheless Lord Yu monopolized power and absurdly gave rise to heterodoxy Huan doubted the brilliant and followed Yus groundless views If Lord He had not said that  the Dharma would have been hidden eternally If Virtuous Master yuan had not argued about  practical works of the sangha would have suddenly come to an end The section of gu lines of the Book of Changes says not to serve either king or feudal lord The Chapter on Scholars Behaviors of the Book of Rites says not to take the high ofce of being a minister of the son of Heaven Among the four classes of people ie scholars farmers artisans and merchants in the secular world there are people who do not bow  not to speak of those who abandon secular life and follow the Way The Essentials the Dharma and Sunshine are discourses  to awaken secular people The hermits three written appeals are also statements made in order to destroy devils Therefore I also include them in  Letter Given to Shi Daoan by Xi Zaochi On the fth day of the fourth month of the third year of Xingning  I Zaochi  bow my head to the ground and worship  Those who believe in emptiness realize the tenet of impermanence and those who preserve themselves in the phenomenal world master the expedient of having a transient body The cool breeze adorns China You have deep taste and a farseeing plan What is as glorious as these I your disciple hear that what causes rainfall throughout the whole world before the dawn are the clouds that ll the sky and what spreads from the source and moistens the universe are the four great rivers Moreover sympathizing with all the sentient beings of the world descended to this world and feeling pity for the times was reborn Clarifying the Way lies in training secular people rides a carriage free from suffering in order to go to an immensely far place He has the vehicle of a transient body prepared in order to respond to requests from the ten directions Moreover he is able to obtain enough gems to embellish an entire mountain and enough ice to freeze a whole gorge How could he be someone who rejects this world and would not teach the way to salvation Furthermore it has been more than four hundred years since the great teaching was transmitted to the East  Even though reason changed with the lapse of time not all people in the secular world were awakened Those who took delight in the great wave were only scholars of the lowest class Only Emperor Ming Suzu  is truly one upon whom Heaven bestowed virtue He drew the Tathāgatas countenance with his own hands and appreciated the purpose of samādhi by chanting His practice in compliance with the precepts he had received was more rigorous than that of a hermit in a mountain cavern Since the Great Mass has already chanted just as myriad apertures began howling all wise people and gentlemen take refuge in the ultimate Way of nature  Even though the sun and moon are far away the light gets brighter Isnt this like Moonlight Boy will rst enter the tranquil state and then be reborn in China or the mysterious bowl will move to the east and suddenly produce an effect in this place In addition I hear that three thousand monks who attained the Way are all in Nanyang and the bodhisattva of brilliant learning expounds words of mystic truth and edies them In the upper level I examine the instructions to attain the stage of a sage and in the lower level I survey the effects of Buddhist practice Who else but you could uphold all these profound sutras Therefore all Buddhist monks in this region admire you wholeheartedly They rejoice to see the goldenhued auspicious and wish to hear the supreme admonitions Both old and young equally wish for this and Buddhist clergy and laypeople think in the same way If auspicious clouds move to the east if a maṇi gem rotates and shines if you even once ascend the seat of the seven treasures if even for a short time you show the sages lamp if you cause nectar to rain on the grass that  grows thick and if you plant sandalwood trees on a riverbank then the Tathāgatas teaching will again be revered today and the profound waves and outstanding sounds will cleanse this generation once again I cannot hesitate any more so I decided to write and convey my thoughts I your disciple Xi Zaochi of Xiangyang bow with my head to the ground and worship Yu Chans preface to the Hymn for the Hall of Happy Wise People Lexian tang song also says that Emperor Ming Suzu was very fond of the Buddhist Way and copied a wonderful portrait with his own hands The Letter of the King of qiao to Discuss Confucius and ākyamuni In Buddhism in regard to evil acts and meritorious deeds the relationship between cause and effect is just like that between and its shadow or between a sound and its echo The sacred words are clear and precise and cause the people to feel their blood run cold Nevertheless from ancient timesthe eras of the Five Thearchs the Three Augusts Emperor Wen of the Han dynasty Emperor Wu the Duke of Zhou and Confuciusthe Regulations  Counsels  Instructions  and Announcements have been completely provided There is however nothing that gives a clear account of the law of the three periods of existence or that clearly describes reward and retribution All of the sages exhaustively probed the very root of the truth discerned thoroughly nature and clearly understood what cause phenomena How is it possible to see without compassion that people are driven into or drowned in yet be unwilling to help them and to have never spoken even a single word to instruct on the path to the ferry  He shot but not at birds perching However when fattened cows and sheep and plump pigs are offered the Supreme Thearch receives them From this viewpoint it is probably difcult to understand the laws of the three periods of existence and of reward and retribution I hope you will explain the gist and relieve me of my delusions with clear evidence If we are indeed weak in good causes we will give rise to delusions as vast as the Milky Way One who is awakened to what is mysterious or who probes into the very root of the truth is a sage or deity whose light shines throughout the eight directions He can see the nine provinces in an instant Nevertheless we live at a time when the human life span is only a hundred years It is impossible to clearly seek for the ultimate point of reason and indicate the ultimate principle What is subtle manifests gently completes and secretly moves to a far and high place To be fond of life is the origin of the three periods of existence The phrase to accumulate wholesomeness follows in the same wake of reward and retribution The fact that Confucius did not use a net shows his benevolence  hunting and hunting found in the Zuozhuan propagates honesty Since the people have been gradually imbued with these teachings and became familiar with them stinginess and delement has lessened day by day Then the Way reached the brilliant Han dynasty The teaching spread during the Yongping era  We know precisely that in the age of Fang  and hua was still not clear and was not apparent in the time of King Wen and King Xuan of the Zhou dynasty It is not the case that take different paths because their purposes are separate from each other Presumably their doctrines are equal yet both were frustrated I have absurdly made an erroneous statement because I am careless ambitious and too hasty Letter Given to Meditation Master to Discuss the Manner of Eating while Squatting with Raised Heels by Zheng Daozi Sages instructions are to cultivate the basis and remove nonessentials these come from ones most sincere heart and there is no difference between Buddhist clergy and laypeople  Therefore when perform purication and give a series of lectures they prepare the Dharma robe There is an order in worship and a system in sequence When respect lls ones mind a person pays respects outwardly bowing with ones head to the ground is approved of while the manner of squatting with raised heels is not The manner of pulling the lapels of the garments together respectfully saluting and bowing ten times is not something with which the easy informal sitting style practiced by Buddhists is concerned I do not see a common aspect in them In the teachings of phenomena each has signicance With regard to the Banzhou  the body is tormented in order to maintain the Way dear to the Way neglects his body There is a reason for practicing in this way and a basis for employing  Even if we employ it is not to torment the body One who sees the manner but does not reach its essence loses his feeling to pay respect and expresses surprise and disdain Is this the principle that sages establish teachings on the basis of actualities and that the ceremonial caps were not suitable for the Yue region where the people cut their hair and tattooed their bodies and therefore they had no use for a cap Some come from remediation and indicate that there is something from which one is rescued This is just as when one suddenly falls ill and takes medication as an emergency measure but not intended to be used for a long time the form and the teaching t each other and the actualities and principles are systematic have already set up the system of the three robes and perform worship They discipline themselves with the Dharma drum and line up in accordance with their rank When they squat with raised heels in such an environment how could this be seen as the systematic and rudeness going against each other At most it is just a onedayonly engagement it cannot be an instruction for a long time Reason is understandable Therefore many people ask about perfect virtue which is the foundation to return to propriety Today meditate and reform their minds but they adhere to this custom and never depart from it I Zheng Jun bow with my head to the ground Letter Given to Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs Wang and All Others in Order to Discuss Buddhist Monks Manner of Eating While Squatting with Raised Heels by Fan Bolun c I Fan Tai  respectfully address the highranking ofcials and many wise people ramaṇas of today have two different sitting styles  It seems that this was not so at Qiyuan Temple in the past Even today foreign languages differ from our language and by which we adapt or reject something differs from theirs too Sages establish laws complying with secular customs and propagate teachings according to each region We have not yet changed our language Why is it necessary to take the trouble to make our system the same as theirs At the present time however each person believes in biased views and thinks that he himself is correct and others are wrong There is no master to control this Consequently the situation has led to the present state He does not seek the reality of the sh and the rabbit and vies with others in attacking the insignicance of stakes and snares  The king of the tree attained right perfect enlightenment in the sixth year  All those in the audience sat with crossed legs they did not adopt the informal style of squatting with raised heels Meditation aims at stabilizing and its meaning is not to squat with raised heels and wait for someone to come The good point of eating while squatting with raised heels lies in eating not in order to be sated This is entirely the easy informal method of one country and not the common system of the world In addition there is no decorum for wearing clothes made of hemp rags in cold rural areas and there is no rule wearing a felt garment in sunny southern regions Based on this considering the early time when Great King Yu took off his clothes to enter the country of the naked people we cannot say that they had no ceremonial caps I beg each of you to give up altogether and entrust the issue to gentlemen who have compromised their views Harmony is valued in propriety The rules for Buddhist monks esteem equality Presently we ascend to the refectory and face the sacred images as if spirits exist in them As for the eight sages of the four stages of sainthood  we have no different statement in principle When Eminent Shi resided in Xiangyang the easy informal squatting style had already been introduced  but he did not think to change  He must have had his intention for this Recently in Meditation Master grand assembly at the seminary adopted the formal sitting posture Isnt this because major points are kept and minor points are omitted and it is not necessary in reason that be practiced concurrently The formal sitting posture is taken regardless of time but the easy informal squatting posture is done at xed times If one adopts the formal sitting posture it is difcult to continually adjust to a different way but it is easy to keep the same way when one experiences an unsual event Moreover regarding the issue that a host humbles himself and pays respects to his guest there is a reason for this I have inquired of Eminent yi about this but I have not yet been rewarded with any answer from him at all Therefore I respectfully address you the people who agree with my opinion and seek a common opinion I pray that you will kindly give me a surplus of coughs and sneezes to cover my weak and cowardly mind  Shi Huiyis Letter in Response to Fan Bolun Fifty  including Shi Huiyi of Qiyuan Temple respectfully address all our donors In the conventional way of śramaṇas we should precisely abide by the sutras and Vinaya texts sincerely and consider faith and obedience to the Buddhist teaching as the foundation If a śramaṇa intends to act contrary to sutras and violate Vinaya and considers his own mind as his teacher and that he himself is right such a case is serious trouble for the great Dharma and the worst in deling the Way In the precepts established by the Tathāgata there are approved and prohibited a precept prevents śramaṇas from touching females with their hands and bodies and from being close to them when all those who observe the precepts met with an accident in which their own mothers were cast adrift and about to drown in deep waters even if they could see no one ventured to rescue them  Thereupon people of the world said ramaṇas have no mercy In such a situation where is the Way So the Tathāgata the ridicule and suspicion of people of the world initiated a precept to counterbalance this which allowed to rescue from difculties  The precepts established by the Tathāgata are in a uniform system and we should positively follow them with faith and carry them out Even scholars of shallow learning esteem to follow faithfully the expression the fth summer   and they dare not add the Chinese character month to it This is intended to seriously prevent people from offering farfetched explanations and to eradicate those who are fond of new things and pleased with peculiar things Moreover the precepts were instituted by the one who possesses the three transcendental knowledges  How could we venture to recklessly adjust them  Even if you wish for the beauty of harmony if you do not use the Way to create harmony this means to exactly seek unity not harmony Since there is no testimony in sutras and Vinaya texts  it is no trivial matter if you suddenly intend to change the Buddhist Dharma Truly we dare not agree with you It has been a long time since the time this temple received the Mahāsāṃghikavinaya  Furthermore in this Vinaya there are clear descriptions altogether in eight items that stipulate the method of eating while in the easy informal style If there was originally no establishment of eating while squatting in the easy informal style then the full set of two hundred fty would not exist The descriptions include Food cannot be placed on a bed that is also used as a meditation seat and Food you wish to discard should be placed beside your right foot It also says You cannot squat with your knees apart and put one calf over the other Arent these clear testimonies for eating while squatting in the easy informal style Buddhist precepts and the Vinaya are śramaṇas No one except the king can participate in hearing them Today you our donors all have doubts about the two sitting styles the formal and the informal and you wish to make ourish and reject  I have briey given several articles in order to show their basis I will accept the burden of the sin of announcing our precepts publicly When the Buddhist Dharma ourishes we mutually attain the great achievement of protecting the Dharma but when it declines we all certainly incur the sin of the destruction of the Dharma I pray that you will think of this thrice and not cause yourselves to have regret in the other world as well as in this world  Response to Eminent yi I reply to you My previous discussion already included all the statements I will make here Precepts are for the prevention of evils Thus I an ignorant person am confused about this The precepts alter rules in accordance with customs We follow the rules against collecting the remains and crossing ones legs Therefore can be omitted As for the precept regarding eating with the hands there is no written instruction for the use of a spoon and chopsticks Why do you value the precept for the easy informal sitting style and slight the precept for eating with the hands According to the precepts cannot bring their hands close to females yet subsequently it is allowable for to rescue their mothers from drowning  This is a case that causes ordinary people to have doubt As a matter of fact this was sufcient cause to revise the precepts established by the Sage Increasingly we know that the two hundred and fty are not spontaneous permanent laws If this is the case rmly observing does not mean to completely attain all and it is unworthy to be very surprised if one takes his own mind as his teacher It is not doubtful for us to adhere to the rule for the omission in the phrase the fth summer If clear and prudent views are understandable how can you be unsettled in minding other peoples opinions As for the signicance of squatting with raised heels the intention lies in this posture being suitable to move forward but if one wants to act quickly things cannot be carried out well When one formally sits up straight he is uneasy in that posture My party is me alone without companions Why do I venture to deal with the great lines of fty  Here I will employ the strategy of being afraid of an enemy and keeping silence I hope this is the best relief Fan Boluns Letter Given to the Two Dharma Teachers sheng and guan Foreign customs naturally differ from ours When Saṃghadeva rst came  monks such as yi and guan all received his favor and admired him with praise thought that this teaching was the ultimate doctrine and said that all Mahayana scriptures of nonarising were the writings of demons The last time Saṃghadeva expounded Buddhist scriptures he did not ascend to a raised seat Faxian later returned to and the Nirvana Sutra was chanted for the rst time then thought that consists of words of eternality and the best of various doctrines and that the ultimate fundamentals of the transcendental wisdom entirely derive from this Inferring from this have no subjectivity within themselves and when they hear they always change  If we compare this to shooting  the shooter who shot last was defeated and divests the shooter who shot rst of the point So we see that foreign precepts are not xed laws the school that adopts the informal sitting style have no time to sit in the formal style When they expound the Dharma on a raised seat they sit in the style of squatting with raised heels The hands are mostly used in the foreign manner of eating Huiyis group of monks is aware of this but they have never converted  Regarding the informal sitting style they have practiced this style for a long time and feel no shame in being in conformity with it They contradict themselves Who can understand this  I your disciple always think that making a mistake along with others is wiser than being proud of my own  To infer my mind and be delighted  with aligning myself with others is not to venture to allow myself to seek straightness Todays laypeople who revere the Dharma should never wear foreign clothes Why do śramaṇas seem to have a hard time in keeping the rule of the informal sitting style Your Majesty acquires mastery of the Buddhist doctrines and you are about to attain its highest perfection With your lofty aspiration you anticipate what is farreaching I have had faith in the great Dharma since the time I was young I have accumulated the practices for wholesome nature I often hear additional discussions and somewhat understand the profound foundation of the teaching I formerly attended near the Imperial Throne and received unmerited favor and guidance from you So I could not help you understand issues that I tried to convey My regret for this will not come to an end in my lifetime I recently criticized Huiyis assertion of eating while squatting with raised heels I strained my ears in a lower seat and heard that my criticism about eating while squatting with raised heels had already reached your ears I ask you to understand that this matter is a local manner of one country and not a universal eternal system Foreign customs are not the same as ours and languages differ from ours as well Sages do not change their language Why must only trouble themselves to change their actions Language is a means to express ones thoughts When a thought has been conveyed the language is forgotten Deportment is a means to keep respect Once respect has been established the form of ones deportment is discontinued Therefore sages establish the precepts in light of actualities and change laws in accordance with customs When one reaches the Way it can be all right if he follows no regulation Isnt it despicable to stick to a xed idea just like gluing the bridges  or waiting by a stump hoping that other hares will come by that spot because a hare was once caught there ramaṇas of today guide people skillfully but they do not have a vital point to their way I personally feel ashamed of this how much more so do your other subjects who are more talented than I am The celebrated people of the present day do not have much sincere faith in the Way They have decided nothing beforehand in their intentions If we set up the system according to this would the Yellow River become clear Huiyan and Daosheng originally did not squat with raised heels Huiguan appears to regret his initial standpoint  At present I do not hope that you will issue an Imperial decree alone However if you give the gist of the Imperial decree to a prime minister the people below him will see this and be educated Who can say that he will not consent to this The august virtue of Your Majesty is about to reach remote areas Writing systems and the width of cart axles will be standardized If we do not cut the fresh green plants now we will have to look for an ax later Therefore it is proper to cause no one from the people close to you to those who are far from you to think of disobeying you a When was restored in the Jiangzuo area ie Jiangsu province a raised seat came  He did not say anything about this system ie eating while squatting with raised heels Eminent Shi had the most sincere faith in Buddhism he did not suffer from the restriction  It seems that he had a reason for this When Meditation Master came to for the rst time he visited the imperial palace and asked for an audience with the emperor This was unacceptable in principle Consequently he was not permitted to visit  Later when monks gathered at Dongan Temple they surely did not eat while sitting in the informal style These are past events of former dynasties that I personally observed I your subject speak Your Majesty you recently made an Imperial visit to Qiyuan Temple where I insistently begged you for a eulogy to be inscribed on a monument I recall that it seemed to me that you had approved this So soon after the Imperial carriage returned  paying reverence to you I precisely engraved the three Chinese characters huang di and zan ie the emperors eulogy on the monument I will submissively accept a demerit for my arbitrary action As for registering merit in the other world I do not know how to cultivate for salvation If you bestow on me your writing of several Chinese characters I will die but my body will suffer no decay With  social mores will be greatly encouraged There will be benets and no loss If you do not have time to do this because of your heavy workload please let your intention be known to your subjects who can assist you with this How could your vassal the Left Scribe or the Imperial Guard not have the utmost sincerity to render service I left the service a long time ago and my days are drawing to a close I receive deep and signicant favor from you as well as a generous salary I bow with my head to the ground and with sincerity equal to that of the spirit of the person who tied grass in order to help Wei Ke in repayment of his kindness I pray that Your Majesty will take pity on me and will not blame me for my statement I know that you have debated with Huiyi regarding the manner of eating while squatting with raised heels Recently I further heard a rough outline of your opinion which does not differ from the purpose of your report I however have not read Buddhist scriptures There is simply no way to manage this issue with my views I have no idea what Huiyan thinks Huiguan appears unwilling to repent of his original standpoint  Can you yourself seek a point of agreement with all Buddhist monks these days As for the eulogy for the monument at Qiyuan Temple I do not recall giving you permission Since is not something I have learned and in addition I have no time to do so I am unable to grant your request I am terribly sorry about this I your subject speak In the Imperial decree of today you order me to further seek a point of agreement b  Here following my wild impulse I will explicate a longcherished thought I think that wherever principles exist it is fortunately possible to not harm an intention by a composition None of the Five Thearchs followed the ceremonies of his predecessor and none of the Three Kings adopted the music of his predecessor In reforming the world with the mandate of Heaven and following the current of the times the signicance is completely great Zhuangzi compared ancient times and the present time to a boat and a carriage Mencius thought that it would be better to be without books than to believe in them exclusively Therefore testied a sheep is not upright I have heard that employing these two ways causes the Great Way to be pursued and the whole world to become one family Moreover is a foreign custom and a local system it is originally not a reasonable teaching yi sheng and guan attained favor and broadly make contact with the Imperial will If they have questions to ask me I hope that I will respond to them through relying on principles The answers Huiguan gave me all lack a reasonable basis He only praised me excessively and disparaged me as having a thousand faults Inferring from this I doubt if he is truly remorseful He has not yet returned to wholesomeness and expressed words of submission Your vassal Hong also says that my assertion is correct The lines of Huiyis great troops have already collapsed and the paths to ee in retreat and hide are closed He relies on this to rescue them but it is difcult for him to escape from there Moreover the virtuous person who is in charge of the tallies is above them Even if he explains everything away he will know that he has gotten into a scrape I recently criticized Huiguan Though I have tried to be intelligent I have reached an extremely old age  Not only are my words unsuitable but I fear deeply that I am not aware of my own confusion The Imperial Guard retainers are really in high repute of the day but they will not be able to sympathize with my inclination and admonish my incompetent points either These are all my faults that I invited onto myself I personally rely on my old age which as the classic states is not subject to punishment Report to the Throne Regarding the Issue that ramaṇas Should Not Bow to the King by Director of the Imperial Secretariat He Chong In the sixth year of Xiankang of the Jin dynasty  Emperor Cheng was still young and Yu Bing assisted him in political affairs Yu Bing said that śramaṇas should bow to the king Ofcials such as Director of the Imperial Secretariat He Chong said that śramaṇas do not have to do so and ordered the ofcials of the Chamberlain for Ceremonials to debate at length ofcials such as Director of the Imperial Secretariat He Chong Chief Administrators Chu She and Zhuge Hui and Feng Huai and Xie Guang of the Imperial Secretary made a report that śramaṇas do not have to bow  We Chong  Director of the Imperial Secretariat Army Commander General of the Pacication Army and Chief Township Marquis She Cavalier AttendantinOrdinary Left Supervisor and Count of Changping Hui Cavalier AttendantinOrdinary Right Supervisor and Count of Jianan Huai Imperial Secretary and Marquis of Guanzhong and Guang Probationary Imperial Secretary and Viscount of Changan speak Shizu Emperor Wu reformed the world with the mandate of Heaven and established the Jin dynasty with his abundant intelligence Wouldnt it have been easy for the śramaṇas of their days to kneel  however regarded the permanence of the way of doing good acts ie not bowing to the king to be a reason to facilitate the determination of the world We humbly think that you should follow the historical example of these preceding emperors which is excellent in reason The Imperial Decree on Behalf of Emperor Cheng of the Jin Dynasty Composed by Yu Bing Who Admonishes the Purport Again and Thinks that ramaṇas Should Bow to the King c All nations have different customs and the Way of the Spirit is difcult to discern If we take a philosophic view of the object and closely understand it there is really nothing strange not to mention the saluting in the kneelingtoworship style We should trace back to the original intention with which the preceding emperors esteemed it Were they simply fond of this style of bending ones body and from their seats meeting people circumambulating them  Certainly this was not the case Based on the respect between father and son the order between the king and his vassals was established laws and institutions were set up and considerate treatment was honored Moreover does the Buddha exist or not as a matter of fact If the Buddha exists his Way is assuredly magnanimous If there is no Buddha what signicance can we obtain   however deform their physical appearance avoid ordinary duties change the statutes of ceremonies and reject the teaching on morality and ethics  This is something by which I am surprised It is not discontinued no matter how many generations pass The inscription on the tripod of Chan says You may get up early in the morning and become greatly distinguished but in future generations will still become idle Regarding the bad aspect that will become idle it is difcult to discern the cause If today we adore something that is far away and uncertain rely on something faint and undistinguished reject our proprieties suddenly and discontinue the teachings of the present age we will cause ordinary people to haughtily go against the constitution This is also something by which I am surprised Rules laws and magnicent models should assuredly not be discontinued in the Imperial court All these kinds of people ie Buddhist monks are the nation of the Jin dynasty Speaking of their intelligence they are only ordinary people too Nevertheless because what they assert is difcult to argue against they avail themselves of outrageous costumes and accessories set up haughty decorum based on strange customs and do not bow down even before the emperor who commands ten thousand chariots This is again something I cannot accept You gentlemen are all people of talent of our country When you hear reasonable words you will survey what is obscure When you speak of governing the nation you must honor national laws Second Report to the Throne by Director of the Imperial Secretariat He Chong and Officials such as Chu She Zhuge Hui Feng Huai and Xie Guang We Chong Director of the Imperial Secretariat Army Commander General of the Pacication Army and Chief Township Marquis She Cavalier AttendantinOrdinary Left Supervisor and Count of Changping Hui Cavalier AttendantinOrdinary Right Supervisor and Count of Jianan Huai Imperial Secretary and Marquis of Guanzhong and a Guang Probationary Imperial Secretary and Viscount of Changan speak The Imperial decree is just as found above We do not deserve to glorify the Imperial will and to propagate the great righteousness Together we all promptly inquired into the details The issue of whether or not the Buddha exists is assuredly not something we can determine Nevertheless when we look into the scriptures that have been left to us and intensively study their essential points the prescription of the ve precepts truly helps the kings edication for the people despise actions that are taken obviously to seek fame and they value the imperceptible secret delity To practice virtue lies in forgetting oneself To stick to one principle is the purity and wondrousness of the mind Moreover from the time of the Han dynasty introduced up to the present day even though the Dharma has risen and fallen there has not been any harm of weirdness and absurdity The Way of the Spirit ie Buddhism has prevailed for a long time There is no other case like this One who curses has loss and one who prays must gain benet From the bottom of our hearts we truly wish that Buddhist monks prayers which are as insignicant as dust and dew will increase benefaction which is as lofty as Mount Song and Mount Tai and that their unimportant prayers will enable to manage the most important rules to govern the world if you even once order to bow to you you will consequently destroy the Dharma and cause the custom of cultivating wholesomeness to be discontinued in your holy world We are concerned about these things and our minds quietly grow uneasy Even though we are ignorant how could we dare confuse and misguide Your Majestys ears with our biased views We simply think that has prevailed through the three dynasties and that intelligent and enlightened rulers have appeared one after another Presently even if we do not create a new law mandating that śramaṇas must bow to the king there will be no shortage of the kings law and it is possible that there would be no hindrance of the rules of the other world For these reasons we again express our sincerity Humbly yours Emperor Chengs Second Imperial Decree I examined the report in which you fully explained your situation and intention The issue of the other world truly cannot be completely explained with allegories The general idea is however simply that conventional rules between human beings and spirits are overstated and classied examples are briey added to them Moreover the minor good conduct outlined in the ve precepts was roughly drawn up and modeled after the principles of human relationships of Confucianism Nevertheless do omit decorum and homage for the ruler of the times Decorum is important and paying homage is signicant The general rules of government administration reach an extreme at this point The emperor who commands ten thousand chariots is superior not from choice and the people of his territory are his inferiors not by preference Nevertheless even if the difference between superiors and inferiors is not arranged the kings teaching must be unied This is why the sage kings of former times established constitutions and those who assume the responsibility of governing the country should not be misled People of allaround talent extensively collect and they often study the principles  They may cultivate themselves in Buddhism in private but not on the level of the nation and the Imperial court Wouldnt this mean to stay away from  Sure enough you have not been able to determine whether or not exists Third Report to the Throne Regarding the Issue that Should Not Bow to the King by Officials such as Director of the Imperial Secretariat He Chong and Supervisor Chu She b Even though we are quite ignorant and do not thoroughly understand your profound intention regarding the thought to follow assiduously day and night your virtue and magnanimity how could we hold fast to narrow biased views and throw important relations into disorder Simply from the time of the Han and Wei dynasties up to the time of the Jin dynasty we have not heard that there were objections and there was no case in which the statutes of superior and inferior were damaged even for a short time Today śramaṇas are earnestly prudent in observing the precepts and they exercise decorum Regarding those who seriously observe the precepts they do not spare even their own lives How could they then dare neglect decorum and homage in order to be particular about their bodies Every time we see burn incense and pray they assuredly rst offer prayers for the country and wish for the prosperity with divine help Their feelings are boundless The meshes of the heavenly net are large far apart yet they let nothing escape We consider with reverence that even if we do not have bow  no damage is done to the laws of the land If we favor people according to what benets them and if we cause none among the wise and the ignorant to dare not exert his mind then what we have above will be an extensive government just as Heaven overspreads all and Earth supports all and what we have below will be people who preserve one principle and cultivate wholesomeness We have sincerely restated our fatuous and shallow  We pray that you will graciously examine  At this time Yu Bings opinion came to an end and must bow was not applied after all Letter Given to the Eight Executives to Discuss Buddhist Monks Bowing by Huan Xuan I Xuan bow twice and speak I bow with my head to the ground The eighth day of the month is approaching Formerly śramaṇas did not bow to kings at all Even though He and Yu have already debated this matter and both presented their opinions neither of them submitted to the other logically Yu intention lies in respecting the ruler but he has not completely established the basis of his reason Because of his strong inclination toward faith  He consequently lost the essence of his name Even though the Buddhas edication is endlessly vast and infers the world beyond the visual and aural senses respect is considered to be its foundation I assume that what they aspire for may differ but this does not mean that respect should be abolished In the Laozi  princes are considered equal to the three great elements how could they be referred to as equal to the two polarities  only for the reason that sages occupy the throne As the Book of Changes says The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called life to make life all over the country and arrange all things lies in sovereigns Therefore we respect the throne and we are gloriously courteous to it The reason śramaṇas are born in succession and live with support is also that they are every day under government ordinances  How could it be that enjoy the virtue and abandon courtesy  or benet from kindness but reject paying respect to them Inasmuch as this is not allowed in reason neither is it tolerable in sentiment For such a serious matter to our generation we must together seek an appropriate idea Moreover we should thoroughly study this in a body You should have a complete conclusion by this coming eighth day of the month I Huan Xuan bow twice and bow down with my head to the ground The Eight Executives Response c We Huan Qian General of the Capital Army Director of the Imperial Secretariat and Dynastyfounding Marquis of Yiyang and others fearing the death penalty respectfully received your instruction to require śramaṇas to bow to the king Nevertheless the Buddhist Dharma and the teaching of Laozi and Confucius are separate from each other in tenor and entirely go against each other in terms of ethical education people consider their hair and skin to be valuable while do not question shaving off their hair renounce the world abandon their parents and do not think that being respectfully attentive to their parents is lial piety They view their bodies a clod of dirt or a piece of wood they cut off desires and stop competing They do not expect anything in this existence and seek for bliss beyond myriads of kalpas They keep away from all the things that are considered honorable in the secular world and in their intention they completely cut off what is valued in ethical education The service due to a father is employed in serving a ruler the relationship with ones blood relatives is considered to be the most important  How would it be possible that they would bow to the emperor who commands ten thousand chariots Through the three dynasties we have allowed to take its own course This is because spirits have no set rules and so they also did not control  Furthermore the fact that the king deferentially follows the Dharma is due to his own respect  It is incomprehensible that he would believe in Buddhist doctrines yet want to change deportment Zhang Chang of Confucius kingdom is over there I think you have already inquired of his facetoface what they have in mind All Buddhist monks including Daobao deserve to requite your lofty purpose We do not know Buddhist doctrines We are ashamed that our statement is unworthy for you to read We Qian and others are afraid of being sentenced with the death penalty Letter Given to Secretariat Director Wang to Discuss the Issue that Buddhist Monks Should Bow to the King by Huan Xuan ramaṇas reject bowing to the Most August I feel that this is an awkward situation and a matter of grave concern of our generation We should discuss this fully together Today I give this letter to you You are the one who is capable of managing this matter Letter in Response to Huan by Secretariat Director Wang a Wang Mi General of the Palace Guard Minister of the Ministry of Personnel Secretariat Director and Baron of Wugang fearing the death penalty respectfully received your instruction which refers to the fact that Buddhist monks reject bowing to the Most August I read your letter which was given to the Eight Executives at the same time Recently I briey heard the impartial way but I have not yet completely investigated the issue I examined the two purposes of He and Yu  I also regret that they have not fully  I think that these two debate has faltered in biased views The Buddhist Dharma arose in and came from India Its foundation is deep and it is difcult to express in words Although what the people are content with varies in each place as far as the principles by which their ruler reigns over the people are concerned it is hardly possible that nothing is the same Today even though śramaṇas are deeply respectful in their minds they do not consider bending their bodies to be a courtesy are those whose footprints ll this land and yet whose interest goes beyond the boundaries of this world Therefore every king of a foreign country humbly shows courtesy to them I think that it has been really a long time since the great Dharma began to be circulated  It has been more than four hundred years and three dynasties have elapsed Even though our customs have changed and government has shifted there is no change in the fact that is propagated Wouldnt this be because the teaching of splendid isolation is benecial for edifying the people little by little in daily life and the clean and simple style does no harm to worldly prosperity and peace Therefore kings behave themselves prudently and do not feel sad about having fewer households  ramaṇas protect the truth and make no question of going against worldly affairs I heard that you said  to make life all over the country and arrange all things lies in sovereigns When I examine what it is to which all principles return it is really just as you have argued I read your virtuous letter three times and still cannot stop rereading it Even though I wish to respectfully reply to you I have no words I still think that one whose achievement is lofty is not rewarded and one whose benevolence is deep is not given grateful acknowledgement Even if were to bow to  would this be enough for them to respond to the kindness with which he aids and leads them I pray that you will not reject my words merely because they are from me Criticism by Huan You wrote in your letter Even though śramaṇas are deeply respectful to the king in their minds they do not consider bending their bodies to bow down to be a courtesy I criticize this saying Regarding śramaṇas reverence how could they all neglect it in their outward form and keep it only in their minds When they repent and worship they do so in a serious  śāstṛ up to a senior priest who supervises the ceremonies and services of a templeall  Since they cannot forget the form over there why then do they disregard the style of deportment here Moreover  regarding the reason to become a teacher they consider awakening through helping others to be virtuous The way of the ruler is to make life possible throughout the country How could the meaning of the three most revered people not be the very pinnacle of reason and feeling You wrote in your letter  every king of a foreign country humbly shows courtesy to  This is really to value that the Way exists not merely to weigh the importance on account of a individual I criticize this saying It is not appropriate to compare to those of foreign countries In Buddhism originated we can see its tenor Isnt it the case that since the six barbarian tribes are disobedient and strong and cannot be educated by normal teachings therefore by the great establishment of a mysterious and strange aroused awe and they then submitted  This is probably based on the fact that were basically fearful of the reward and retribution of spiritual beings How can this be said to be reverence for the profound and wondrous Way How could it be possible that if one merely puts on a Dharma robe the Way exists within him If the Way rst exists and only later is deemed valuable as you said the way of sages would therefore be the culmination of the Way In the homage paid to a ruler by his subjects courtesy would be deeper In such a situation how could it be possible that the reason śramaṇas do not bow is because the Way exists is considered to be valuable You wrote in your letter Since the great Dharma began to be circulated in China it has been four hundred years and three dynasties have elapsed Wouldnt this be because the teaching of splendid isolation is benecial for edifying the people little by little in daily life and the clean and simple style does no harm to worldly prosperity and peace I criticize this saying The fact that has not changed over the duration of cannot be considered as a testimony Formerly there was almost no one among the Chinese who believed in the Buddha All śramaṇas and their followers were various kinds of foreigners Moreover the kings did not make contact with foreign śramaṇas and their followers Presently His Majesty believes in the Buddha and is on intimate terms with in Buddhist services The situation is different from that of former times  in daily life and the clean and simple  is helpful in teaching the peoplethis is entirely as you have said but this is likely the achievement of the Buddhist Dharma not a benet brought about by śramaṇas boasting If we are sincerely respectful to now there will be nothing more to strengthen their help  You wrote in your letter One whose achievement is lofty is not rewarded and one whose benevolence is deep is not given grateful acknowledgement Even if were to bow to  would this be enough for them to respond to the kindness with which he aids and leads them I criticize this saying The utmost degree of reason is not recompensed Nevertheless in our sentiments when is boundless our respect for him naturally follows This is why sages establish courtesy according to human feelings and lead each person to that to which he entrusts himself If gratitude is always to be omitted when the achievement is deep and there is great benevolence is ākyamunis virtue deep or shallow If it is shallow we should not throw important relations into disorder his minor ways If it is deep how could it be possible that seriously pay respect among themselves yet reject bowing  Second Response by Lord You criticized Regarding śramaṇas reverence how could they all neglect it in their outward form and keep it only in their minds When they repent and worship they do so in a serious  c I reply The way of śramaṇas originally takes reverence to be primary Since are simply different from us on the path to ferry  they do not bow according to what is right The reason śramaṇas admire and respect their teachers and senior monks is truly because when they share the same goal younger monks give precedence to elders and in their relationships with who support and lead them to the goal their actions comply with their minds Originally although the Buddhist Dharma is vast it does not abandon minor wholesome conduct Reward complies with even small merit Many a little makes a mountain The meaning of this is apparent here You criticized The way of the ruler is to make life possible throughout the country How could the meaning of the three most revered people not be the very pinnacle of reason and feeling I reply The way of the ruler is to make life possible throughout the country that is to say it is the same in reason as the Creator Nevertheless it has never been the case that those who receive its blessings are thankful to for them No one has felt obligated to the foundation of reason  The principle of moving Heaven and Earth smoothly is wondrous How can we requite it through our poor conduct In Buddhism originated we can see its tenor Isnt it the case that since the six barbarian tribes are disobedient and strong and cannot be educated by normal teachings therefore by the great establishment of a mysterious and strange aroused awe and they then submitted  I reply  established their instructions in accordance with the Way of the Spirit which is really difcult to discern in language I think that shows reward and retribution by the great establishment of the mysterious and strange  This is the fundamental essence of Buddhism If we think now that the three periods of existence is false and absurd and weal and woe as the result of good and bad conduct is a threat then what ākyamuni claried has nearly no standpoint I usually think that the edication of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius is to rescue from a very harmful situation Consequently spoken by them are limited to a lifetime and do not explain the path for myriads of kalpas Nevertheless when we deeply inquire about their purport we can also often nd teachings similar to those of Buddhism Compassion and mercy are certainly observed in the destruction of life according to the four seasons Furthermore admonished and stopped Zhong You from asking about death and spirits It also appears that he had a profound purpose  The style of the teaching  however differs from  Therefore these points are usually obscure I calmly looked into this issue It is mostly so It is nearly so You criticized In the homage paid to a ruler by his subjects courtesy would be deeper In such a situation how could it be possible that the reason śramaṇas do not bow is because the Way exists is considered to be valuable I reply I reexamined your lofty discussion You think that the way of the ruler moves smoothly and is the same as the three great elements in reason I think that as far as the way of the ruler and his people is concerned I personally agree with your lofty purport Regarding the homage paid to a ruler by his subjects the principle a is limited to the teaching on morality and ethics  Today śramaṇas are not the subjects of princes and nobles Therefore bow to them is abolished You criticized The fact that has not changed over the duration of cannot be considered as a testimony Formerly there was almost no one among the Chinese who believed in the Buddha All śramaṇas and their followers were various kinds of foreigners Moreover the kings did not make contact with  I did not mean that there is never a reason to change anything that has been accomplished Foreigners did not make contact with kings This is again just as your lofty discussion The reason the issue was not discussed in former ages probably lies in this fact You criticized This is likely the achievement of the Buddhist Dharma not a benet brought about by śramaṇas boasting If we are sincerely respectful to now there will be nothing more to strengthen their help  I reply I respectfully examined the discussion in your letter It does not bring a false charge against Buddhist doctrines This is truly as you admonished really just as you admonished I think that the way of śramaṇas can be said to be peculiar but it is not such boasting Presently in these latter days a thousand years after ākyamuni passed away simple and sincere customs and traditions have declined and those who dishonestly wear robe have become numerous How could I not feel ashamed of them I simply think to control myself and keep silent now I should put aside speaking about other human beings and speak only of the Way I wrote in my previous response  not to weigh the importance on account of a individual My humble intention lies in this point You criticized If gratitude is always to be omitted when the achievement is deep and there is great benevolence is ākyamunis virtue deep or shallow If it is shallow we should not throw important relations into disorder his minor ways If it is deep how could it be possible that seriously pay respect among themselves yet reject bowing  I reply I think that the Way of ākyamuni is deep indeed profound and those who look up to him respectfully consolidate their respect more and more This is probably because those who reach the Way must rely on the achievement of practice and nothing is more esteemed than the virtue of the achievement of practice Just like this accumulating practice is the base cause the key to ones next existence Moreover it is still difcult to restrain achievement of paying respect to his teachers and seniors Furthermore in drawing the mind toward the ultimate is it possible to neglect courtesy Therefore even if one were to bend or lift his head for numerous kalpas this does not mean that he expresses his gratitude for the blessings  Second Criticism by Huan I examined your letter How is it allowable for there to be two different principles for feelings and paying respect Everything is simply from the inside and inuences the outside  Since we have already entered the realm of beings who possess feelings and consciousness sentient beings it is impossible to do without  If just as you said in your letter  the ruler  It has never been the case that those who receive its blessings are thankful to for them No one has felt obligated to the foundation of reason  this means that achievement is profound his reasoning is deep and nothing is greater than this How could the Buddhas edication surpass this What is their goal If studies are considered to be their goal what scholars learn originally spring simply from the essential qualities of Nature How is it possible that actions comply with the mind applies here but does not over there Moreover you said The edication of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius is to rescue from a very harmful situation This is different from the teaching that urges people to practice benevolence and righteousness which is limited to human affairs Therefore the followers of the Yellow Turbans who aroused people with wild talk all advanced just as clouds do  If this is the truth and is also easily practiced why do sages reject the practical way that is easily practiced and take up minor things that are difcult to carry out It is also clear that this cannot be so Furthermore you said  the homage paid to a ruler by his subjects the principle is limited to the teaching on morality and ethics Today śramaṇas are not the subjects of princes and nobles Therefore bow to them is abolished Why is this so Regarding the principle of respect I have explained it in detail in my previous letter The homage paid to a ruler by his subjects arises entirely spontaneously and is rm in the foundation of feeling in reason How could this be a matter of the teaching on morality and ethics In my previous discussion I said  The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called life to make life all over the country and arrange all things lies in sovereigns If what makes life possible all over the country lies in these  how could it be possible that is not valued by Nature In addition you said Those who reach the Way must rely on the achievement of practice  accumulating practice is the base cause the key to ones next existence Furthermore in drawing the mind toward the ultimate is it possible to neglect courtesy even if one were to bend or lift his head for numerous kalpas this does not mean that he expresses his gratitude for the blessings  Please allow me to follow your purpose in your letter avail myself of it and offer criticism According to your letter paying respect is the beginning of practice and sincerely paying respect is important The achievement of practice must be simply calculated based on the effort one has made toward its achievement How could it be possible that one merely reveres ākyamuni and then claims that there is nothing more esteemed than this  Gratitude for blessings is beyond expression This is something about which wise people have no doubt In reason however is extremely deeply rooted in feeling It is simply impossible to go about without respect How could subjects paying homage to their king be showing gratitude for blessings I accept your lofty purpose The principle of this issue is profound and it is extremely difcult to discuss Furthermore it is a matter of grave concern for our generation My talent is not outstanding and I particularly lack the ability for close investigation and analysis Moreover your wondrous criticism is of an  extremely advanced level In this case I will again recklessly respond to your admonition in accordance with my shortsighted view I pray that you will inquire of various Buddhist monks and versatile scholars and remove my imperfect points If studies are considered to be their goal what scholars learn originally springs simply from the essential qualities of Nature Studies are an expedient that we use daily Therefore we know that achievement of that we are borrowing is not the utmost point One who goes to the utmost point through the accumulation of learning certainly goes up coarse steps and reaches a wondrous stage After the sh is caught the bamboo sh trap is abandoned You think that it is easy to edify by means of the mysterious and difcult the achievement of benevolence and righteousness why do sages reject the practical way that is easily practiced and take up minor things that are difcult to carry out It is also clear that this cannot be so I think that the Buddhas teaching is absolutely different from that of the Chinese sages Since it is said that they differ from each other they are not on the same level as a matter of course At present we are discussing Buddhist doctrines Therefore we must establish our statements on the basis of its foundation Therefore I simply cited them Nevertheless as far as my ignorant view is concerned Buddhism is more difcult Why do I say this According to what the Chinese sages have now claried it is believed that when one sends forth his words if they are good they will receive a response just as a shadow and an echo  and if the are evil they will be opposed by people as far as a thousand li distant In this way good or bad conduct soon responds  and fortune and misfortune appear before his eyes There are however still those who reject right and comply with evil and those who go against the Way and follow desires Moreover in Buddhism ones lifetime is explained as of very brief duration like the time it takes to snap ones ngers and reaching the essential destination is expected to take place after an eternal kalpa It is said that mysterious things have no xed status Reward and retribution is provided in the future even though no indication of our existence is given Isnt it also difcult to accept these and believe  Therefore the benqi jing says Words that are strictly true sound paradoxical This is what is meant You said The achievement of practice must be simply calculated based on the effort one has made toward its achievement How could it be possible that one merely reveres ākyamuni and then claims that there is nothing more esteemed than this  Please let me try to say more about this I think that the Buddhist Way is great and vast and its doctrines are complicated In the case of someone who has no weariness in his mind and is able to effort to do anything to revere the ultimate is merely one of the achievements of practice I did not mean  that worship counts for nothing as a practice Even if something is very insignicant it is certainly what is needed for the closing period How could this be a matter of the teaching on morality and ethics I respectfully keep your valued discussion in mind and stick to this Therefore I said in my previous response As far as the way of the ruler and his people is concerned I personally agree with your lofty purport My intention lies in this Regarding the homage between a ruler and his subjects the issue is limited to the decorum of bowing with ones hands folded in front Therefore I simply took this to be the teaching on morality and ethics ie Confucianism I did not mean that between ruler and subjects is limited to this behavior The forms to show respect of that time are never heard  The way of the ruler was openly carried out Consequently the operation in which do not engage with one another was peaceful The way of the subjects was moved and inuenced imperceptibly Inferring from this point it is almost clear that the forms to show respect have nothing to do with ones mind Later when gave rise to love and praise  this decorum developed Can it be denied that was established by a sage of later ages and developed in accord with the need of the times It is particularly striking I thought it could dispel my doubtful points but it still has not come to that point Thereupon we have attacked and criticized each other but we have not come to a conclusion If we now again consider the essentials clarify the principle of the three most revered people and argue with regard to the gravity  then the reason why do or do not bow can be understood I think that the achievement of closely investigating something subtle must lie in going through such trouble and making a judgment The eighth day of the month has already come I have now written to Right Chief Administrator and ordered him to enforce the custom that śramaṇas must bow and revere the way of the ruler I caused no one in the world to not bow  Even though the Buddhist Way is the most respectable can it be acceptable for to not have complete good conduct Although this matter has already been put into operation no one should hesitate to discuss this I think that there are some among you who have analyzed the issue more closely They may show Zhongwen  Today I will repeat what I previously thought and go into details I hope that you will rein in a white horse and simply understand that there are rules in debating What is important in Buddhism is to completely value the human spirit For this reason a teacher and his disciples mutually believe in this incomparable principle Generally each side of the spirits light and darkness has its own part There is the foundation from which each part receives its nature when it arises The teachers achievement lies in developing his disciples natural abilities and awakening them This can be compared to the achievement of polishing a rough jade from Mount Jing until it becomes smooth and glossy If the real substance is not ne jade  what benet can be expected if one were to chisel and polish it This means that the good and bad dispositions of people exist naturally Profound virtue exists in a  person at the beginning of his life The achievement of polishing until it becomes smooth and glossy truly comes at the very end One holds a jade within himself and works on it in order to make vessel Except for the way of the ruler nothing prolongs and completes ones life and leads one to devote himself to the Way This is why in the importance of the three most revered people the teacher is at the bottom How can this be said It is because the way of the ruler holds that of the teacher simultaneously but the way of the teacher does not hold the ruler concurrently Isnt this so How could it be possible for less important in the principle to deprive should be more highly respected of homage I repeated this reason three times I have even greater suspicions and I am surprised by them The purport that created lies in that  but not in this  When we mistakenly employ this the harmful inuence becomes more serious You indicated that the teacher does not have virtue to lead inclusively but the ruler holds the virtue of the teacher simultaneously You promote the grand decorum to venerate the ruler and analyze the depth of the three most revered people The reason I recently spoke of my humble views impertinently and corresponded with you is this as inquiries gathered around me and I was not allowed to hide them I have already carefully looked again into your wondrous purpose Your reason is quite great and extensive I look up respectfully to the meaning I understand which lies in encouraging us to adhere to delity  Letter in Response to Huan Xuan Regarding the Issue that ramaṇas Should Not Bow to the King by Dharma Teacher Huiyuan of Mount Lu together with Huan Xuans Two Letters Letter Given to Dharma Teacher yuan by Huan Xuan As for the issue that śramaṇas should not bow to the king this is already not understood in my feeling and not claried in reason We cannot make this establishment inappropriate Recently I wrote to the Eight Executives Please explain why should not pay homage to  This custom must be put into practice I hope that you will certainly have explanations for my doubtful points Commandant Wang seriously intends to take charge of this matter Recently I visited Xie Zhong along with and consulted with about it face to face So we have not dispelled our doubts I will order Guo   Jiangzhou to accept your response Please deliver your opinion to him Response by Dharma Teacher yuan I carefully examined your proclamation in a separate envelope and the letter given to the Eight Executives You ask me my opinion regarding the issue that śramaṇas are disrespectful to the king In order to prove it you refer to Laozi and take princes to be the same as the three great elements Heaven Earth and the Way Since the way is what supports to grow and to move smoothly we must value the throne If we infer the foundation in order to look for its origin all beings receive the vapor from the two polarities Heaven and Earth and their bodies from their parents That is to say the way to perpetuate lives and cause Heaven and Earth to move smoothly is magnanimous The principle on which we depend for our existence and which we employ every day is great Consequently should not abandon showing courtesy to as long as they receive his virtue They should not reject paying their respects to him as long as they benet from his kindness When I look into the issue from Buddhism and seek the way of śramaṇas the situation is not so in reason According to what is claried in Buddhist scriptures there are two groups  One group are those who stay in the secular world and propagate the teaching The other group are those who renounce the world and pursue the Way  For those who remain in the secular world the courtesy to serve the ruler paying respect to ones parents and the righteousness of loyalty toward the ruler and lial piety toward ones parents are found in compositions in Buddhist texts The instruction the three most revered people is evident in the sacred books  This is the same ordinance as that of the Imperial system they are just like a pair of tallies A divergent view is not allowable in reason Those who have renounced the world are visitors from beyond the mundane world The teaching for them is to master that afictions are caused by having a body and that afictions are ended by not preserving the body to know that the operation of life after life is derived from receiving the principle of the mutation  and to seek the ultimate law of Nature by not following the principle of the mutation of birth and death Since they seek the ultimate law of Nature by not following the principle of the mutation  they do not value the support of manages the movement of  Since they bring an end to afictions by not preserving the body they do not esteem the advantage of welfare  Accordingly in general those who have renounced the world live in seclusion in order to pursue their aspiration and they become different from secular people in order to realize their way Since they are different from secular people their clothing code must not be the same as in secular rule Since they live in seclusion they must follow a lofty lifestyle On this basis they are able to save secular people who are drowning in the deep stream  uproot their deep roots for numerous kalpas profoundly lead to the ferry of the three vehicles and open the broad path to the realms of heavenly and human beings This kind of person makes a vow for himself by taking the tonsure at the beginning and his determination is accomplished in his later years If someone completes the virtue  the Buddhist Way diffuses over his family members of the six relations and the benet spreads to all people Even though are not placed in the rank of princes is certainly compatible with the fundamental Way by which the emperor rules over the world and they provide extensive protection for the people Do they receive the favor by doing nothing and vainly benet from his kindness in the same way as those wise people who receive a stipend without ever rendering any service  You recently considered that there are who put on robes yet there is no one  This is beyond all description If you remove evil monks by means of the Way it is appropriate to take away their robes Even if you abolish the Way because of monks you must keep the framework of ceremonies If the ceremonies remain the purpose for establishing the teaching can be sought If the traces ie the framework of the Buddhist ceremonies are abandoned there will be no basis for the pleasure of accomplishing our determination Why do I say this so plainly Even though the śramaṇas regulation of clothing and Buddhist implements are not like those found in the rules of the six generations they are themselves the distinguished system for the Buddhist school and they are excellent articles beyond the secular world If such excellent articles are mingled with  phenomena go against the foundation If phenomena go against the foundation the framework of the Buddhist ceremonies loses its function Accordingly those who love ceremony certainly do not damage such excellent articles What you have attained cannot be lost There is a reason for this One who abides by the Classics of the distant past still keeps the sacricial sheep connected with the inauguration of the rst day of each month If the sacricial sheep can still preserve the ceremony how much more so could the Dharma robe of the Tathāgata preserve the Buddhist ceremonies Inferring from this I say that even if the Way does not exist we should certainly preserve the ceremonies If the ceremonies are preserved the Dharma can be promulgated If the Dharma can be promulgated the Way can be sought This is common throughout the ages and it is the immutable great law Furthermore the Buddhist surplice is not the type of clothing for monks to wear when they have an audience with the emperor at court and a Buddhist monks earthenware almsbowl is not a vessel to be used in the Imperial court The clothes in military affairs differ from those in state affairs If who shaves his head and disgures himself were to suddenly participate in various Chinese ceremonies this is a phenomenon in which two different kinds of things are mingled It is also something with which I am personally not content You our donor have an outstanding personality towering over others since the time you were young You still call on and study with wise people of the time in order to seek the truth From this point I infer that you would surely not ignore words just because the person who expresses those words is awed I am in the evening of my life just goes down in the west I avail myself of my remaining time awaiting my nal day If I hold fast to my assertion without yielding it is likely because I merely wish to restore the Three Treasures in this illustrious time and honorably transmit bright virtue to the coming hundred generations If this issue is enforced even once Buddhism will be ruined for a long time the Tathāgatas immutable law will vanish without a trace at this point heavenly and human beings will lament and Buddhist monks and laypeople will change their minds and stop following the Buddhist Way While writing this I  felt sad and resentful I was unaware as my tears and nasal mucus unrestrainedly owed Response by DefenderinChief Huan  together with the Decree to Stop ramaṇas from Bowing I came to know that abandon their bodies because they are visitors from beyond the mundane world and therefore they do not value the benet of maintaining their lives If the task of has nothing to do with the support and guidance  they need not again have the signicance of extending respect  If you admit that feelings for the ruler and their own fathers have not come to an end why then do they reject to convey their feelings Worries exist in mental delusions not from the form of bowing Probably the form of bowing is simply of the mental function Furthermore you said that Buddhism is propagated by two groups there is the teaching for those who stay in the secular world there is also the teaching the benets of which spreads to all people of the world the way diffuses over their family members of the six relations is assuredly compatible with the fundamental Way by which the emperor rules over the world and do not vainly benet from virtue Buddhism exists in acts By each comply with circumstances There is the origin of cause and condition and there is surely a result without fail If is like this how can those who follow the Way disobey  Therefore ākyamunis Way was not able to cause his father King uddhodana to ride the ferry beyond  Just as you said in your letter there is a reason for this The achievement of profound virtue is assuredly not what those who should teach  of today can consider and deliberate I have not been able to seek the reason together with you in your letter Accordingly I have not yet claried the issue I hope that you will become free from confusion and the stagnant ideas that you have held for a long time and not make a mistake in employing feeling and reason Imperial Decree to Allow Buddhist Monks Not to Bow by Huan Chu My people The Buddhist Dharma is too vast and unintelligible for me to understand I infer your serious feelings for and purposely join you in your respect for it Today  so the issue of whether or not śramaṇas must bow to the king is already at my discretion Everyone do not force to bow any more and let all the people know about this Response to Huan Xuans Decree by Bian Sizhi and Yuan Kezhi On the third day of the twelfth month we Palace Attendant Sizhi and Gentleman Attendant at the Palace Gate and Palace Attendant Yuan Kezhi speak The Imperial decree is just as mentioned above The Way of the Spirit is profound and obscure and the Imperial will is profound and remote What  Your Majesty propagates is great This has accordingly reached Buddhists who believe in the Buddha Within the territory of your state all people are Your Majestys lieges Nevertheless place themselves as equal in courtesy to the emperor who commands ten thousand chariots because they formerly began wearing the Dharma robe  How can practicing the decorum of bowing to the king with ones head to the ground and standing up damage their way The important human relations between the nobles and the humble people should not be discontinued at all If you allow that those except Confucianists may be excused from the deportment of bowing please reject granting them an audience immediately Response to Huan Xuans Decree by Ma Fan and Bian Sizhi On the fourth day of the twelfth month of the second year of Taiheng  we Director of InterpreterClerk Ma Fan and Palace Attendant Sizhi speak Again we received your brilliant Imperial decree You honor the highest degree of deep modesty and walk the way of glorious humility We are always concerned about you and we personally feel uneasy Even though there are various ways to govern the world all principles come to the same point In revering ones ruler and parents the Dharma teaching does not go against  The four that are great advocated by Laozi are equal in nobility Even though of which śramaṇas avail themselves differs from their traces do not go beyond this world How could it be possible that they are not the same as those whom Heaven made Your Majesty sincerely intends to promulgate the custom that śramaṇas do not have to bow to the king above others Nevertheless the decorum between the humble people and nobles is the statute to govern the world We think you must condescend and follow popular sentiment and uphold the custom that śramaṇas should bow to the king as an eternal system for the future Please do as we have stated previously Let each person act in his own way This is also to love the nine schools without distinction and to let each fulll his own way Response to Huan Xuans Decree by Bian Sizhi I Palace Attendant and Libationer Sizhi speak Again I was granted the Imperial decree as mentioned above Your Majestys highest virtue is perfectly free from prejudice You let the wind blow so that each of the myriad makes its own sound Each of the nine schools shows its good point Your marvelous kindness secretly ows There is no one who does not hold this thought in mind I have heard that Buddhism takes spiritual wisdom as the foundation and reaching the goal as the achievement The mysterious principle is obscure If respectfully bow with their heads to the ground and then stand up there is nothing in this that will damage their observance of precepts I was previously appointed to a post in a foreign land and I was rarely informed of your words Therefore I did not know about your brilliant discussion on this issue last spring Recently I was directly granted the Imperial a decree I then frankly stated my silly thoughts which I was afraid did not meet yours After returning here I precisely saw the reality of this issue and received your marvelous writings These are not things that I an incompetent man am able to praise merely by clapping my hands In former ages it was already practiced that śramaṇas place themselves as equal  Today you a great bright man ascended and your edication of the Way reaches all people without exception In order to rule the country there should not be any deciency in important human relations Humbly yours Again this is not praise for the way  Response to Huan Xuans Decree by Bian Sizhi I Palace Attendant and Libationer Sizhi speak I respectfully received the Imperial decree again Now that both Buddhism and the nonBuddhist teaching are promulgated concurrently the Imperial decree is deeply understood and way holds the premier position over those of a hundred kings I humbly read and exclaimed with reverence To revere the ruler and respect the law is the delity of vassals Your brilliant decree is transcendental and your profound strategy is eternal and fair As a result I am ashamed of myself I will follow and consign this to the external bureau I will propagate regulate and abide by this Humbly yours Presented on the twentyfourth day of the twelfth month of the rst year of Yuanshi  Letter Given to Huan Xuan to Discuss the Evaluation of ramaṇas by Huiyuan of Mount Lu together with Huan Xuans Decree Decree Given to the Staff to Intend to Select Buddhist Monks by Regent Huan Xuan The Way of the Spirit is obscure This is something of which sages do not speak Nevertheless when we think about what their works promulgate it seems that we will be able to see  What the Buddha treasures is wuwei  and his cordial intention lies in cutting off desire In the capital city vie with each other in having an extravagant life Rankings and the proper equipages have become wicked and corrupt due to this fact Absconders ll the Buddhist temples Consequently several thousand gather in every county and form a lawless community The drones of society gather in groups in every town We should immediately issue the following strict orders Among all the śramaṇas in every place those who are able to explain the teachings of Buddhist scriptures in detail and can uently expound the Buddhist doctrines those who orderly cultivate religious practices who observe the precepts without deciency and who always reside in a hermitage  and those who live in the mountains to ennoble their aspirations and who are not deluded by popular customall these are worthy to be in charge of propagating the great edication Therefore they will show people what the Way is propagate the teaching and serve as a model for the people In each place where an institution is located the registers must be managed and strictly controlled This should be promptly decreed and at the same time should be listed and reported to me Mount Lu is the only place where virtuous Buddhist monks reside and it is excepted from the investigation for this decree b Letter Given to DefenderinChief Huan to Discuss the Evaluation of ramaṇas by Dharma Teacher yuan It has been a long time since Buddhism gradually began to decline and became obscene and odd Every time I think about this my heart lls with indignation I am always afraid that will unexpectedly encounter bad times get mixed up  and altogether sink into ruin This is why I lament and worry from early morning until night without sparing myself This truly conforms to my true intention If the Jing River were separated from the Wei River the clear water will ow separately from the muddy water If what is crooked is straightened by what is upright those who lack virtue will spontaneously disappear Inferring from this point I say that once Heavens auspicious decree is put into practice we will certainly be able to distinguish between the two principles  Most certainly who make a plausible outward show will cut off their false path by themselves and who believe in the Way and embrace the truth in their minds will not be suspected of turning their backs on the secular world Thus the Way and the secular world will ourish together and the Three Treasures will again prosper here The reason I live in the Jiangnan area is because I wish to rely on the one who practices the Way in order to maintain the great enterprise  The rise and fall of the enterprise truly depends on this person This is the best time for me to restore  My secret feeling to rely on you was already formed in our former existences Accordingly in letters I often sent to you I considered that relying on you is the foremost point Every time I nd that your letter comforts me I keep your favor in my mind and never forget it I am simply afraid that as I grow older and older with the change of times I will not be able to see your prosperous edication through to the end Therefore I now confer with you about several articles as the attached paper According to what is stated in the teachings of the Buddhist scriptures there are generally three classes  First is the class of those who enter the subtle through meditation second are those who recite and appreciate the scriptures left  last are those who perform meritorious acts These three classes are truly separate from one another but they all make acts based on the Vinaya as the foundation among those who establish meritorious acts there are some who do not violate the precepts in their minds yet live in a place other than a hermitage there are those who recite many Buddhist scriptures and chant them continually yet they cannot smoothly explain the doctrines or there are those who are already aged and do not fall under the three classes  yet whose essential nature is pure and virtuous and who do not do serious evil Generally people like these are suspect Therefore I clearly state this It is easy to examine outward appearance and manner but difcult to distinguish truth from falsehood ramaṇas who reside in the metropolitan city and whom you our donor can see and c hear assuredly have nothing that makes them suspect If government ofces in the border regions are remote and information does not reach them and do not understand the purpose of your decree then they may take advantage of Heavens auspicious decree and unreasonably include good people in  This is my deepest concern If an executive ofcial of each ofce has no detailed idea  and if at that time there are no experienced and reputable śramaṇas who can make a correct judgment please have the reports sent to the central government ofce in order to be examined by you Then it will be great in reason I think that you our donor have wondrous thoughts and already understand this Therefore I could not stop speaking to you about it If among the sons of powerful families there are lineages that are originally exempt from corve labor those follow the great Dharma from generation to generation or who are known to be intelligent by nature when they are young and who wish to renounce the secular world enter the Way and strive to become a śramaṇa then when I infer from the regulation of the decree and think of the intention it seems that will not be blocked from their pure path However you must confer and settle this point and cause those who purify their minds and head toward the goal to have no doubt about themselves In former times many foreign kings applied their minds to sacred scriptures Moreover in accordance with the times some kings helped the propagation of the great edication protected the Buddhist Way from danger and saved it from disadvantage Since you our donor often hope to equalize your frame of mind with those of ancient people I again briey state what I have learned Letter Given to Huan Xuan to Discuss that the Provincial Office Requests to Register ramaṇas by Dharma Teacher Zhi Daolin On the fth day of the fourth month of the third year of Longan  we śramaṇas of the metropolitan city bow with our heads to the ground and speak If the law agrees with what is supernatural and profound we will more deeply receive favor Even though we have an ordinary personality and are frivolous in practice we respect the Three Treasures and cultivate ourselves with them Our affection came from Heaven and we had faith before learning it As for the merit attained by diminishing day after day however we place our hands on our chests and increase our lamentation Throwing ourselves under the wings of sage rulers and sagacious kings we are personally able to further propagate the Way You enable those who live in the mountains to have their own way in cultivation and those who live near a city to be quietly procient in  Nevertheless the status of śramaṇas in the world may be simply compared to that of unloaded boats that converge at a great gorge When they come they do not think anything and when they go they take advantage of tranquility If the country is in a troubled state they travel alone shaking a walking stick When the Way is diffused they gladly gather together You try to raise great disciplines in the period of decadence and extend sincerity for a hundred generations but these days we are frequently requested by the provincial ofce to present the register of śramaṇas The situation has become acute and very urgent We have not yet understood your lofty purpose for this Rustics easily become fearful and deeply anxious Consequently this causes people who meditate to lose their calmness and gentlemen who practice diligently to discontinue their practice We lose the essence and vital energy and cannot sleep until dawn We are uneasy and do not know how to calm ourselves We humbly pray that our bright lord will raise the customs handed down from Tang to a high rank and treat Buddhist monks kindly under these conventions Please allow those who hold the Way in mind to attain liberation and all those who have the noble aspiration to achieve their goal Their bodies will perish and they will exhaust their bodies and complete their lives here Report to Emperor Wu of the Qi Dynasty to Discuss the Issue of the Inspection and Examination of Buddhist Monks by Shi Daosheng of Tianbao Temple a I Shi Daosheng of Tianbao Temple report Formerly Confucius educated three thousand disciples Among them those who studied astronomy wore a round cap and those who studied geography put on rectangular shoes Zhuang Zhou of Chu state visited Lord Ai of Lu state and said I have heard that there are quite a few people who are well acquainted with astronomy and geography in this country Please let me test them Lord Ai immediately sent out an ofcial announcement through the country ordered those who were versed in astronomy to wear a round cap and those who were learned in geography to put on rectangular shoes and commanded all to come to the gate  Confucius alone arrived at the gate and answered all the questions Therefore it is known that all the other scholars adopted the dress arbitrarily ākyamuni emeged into this world expounded the Four Noble Truths and the six pāramitās and established various precepts and deportment His disciples such as āriputra all attained arhatship Accordingly it is known that the great Dharma is not something that has no fundamental truth Nevertheless from that time ie the time when the Buddha resided in the world on peoples faculties have become dull and we have become far removed from the Way If we can leave behind the thought we will be in accord with the precepts and codes of conduct If not we will be those who arbitrarily put on robes I humbly pray Your Majesty that with your holy brightness you will deeply understand this principle and not assume that ordinary people who seek the Way of the Sage In ancient times Zichan of Zheng state was praised as a great wise person but he still was unable to correct his faults and was jeered at by Shentu Jia This goes without saying for bhikṣus of the present time in the age of the Decadent Dharma If one cannot correct his faults he will certainly give rise to evil intentions How can the three administrative monks of the temple fulll your order There is criminal law in the country I pray that you will decree that the local government ofce should punish according to the offense  We would be happy if we do not confuse you  Illness due to old age rages within me but I admire the complaints board of remote antiquity and dare to express this I bend down over the paper and break into a cold sweat End of Fascicle Twelve of The Collection for the Propagation and Clarication Essentials for Believing in the Dharma by Palace Secretary Chi  The threefold refuge refers to taking refuge in the Buddha the twelve kinds of Buddhist scriptures and the Buddhist order You must always worship and repent your sins to the buddhas of the three temporal worlds of past present and future in the ten directions  the doctrine of the scriptures of the three temporal worlds in the ten directions and the Buddhist order of the three temporal worlds in the ten directions At the same time we should think of all sentient beings with compassion and benevolence and pray that they will all attain liberation What is called namo in the foreign language means to surrender oneself to in the Chinese language buddha means awakened one and sangha means a group in the Chinese language When an intoxicant is used for medicinal purposes the dosage must be weighed it is important to stay within the limit of sobriety Drunkenness causes thirtysix faults and the scriptural teachings take this as a serious precept If there are no acts of killing can live a long time If there are no acts of stealing will always remain peaceful and safe If  there is no adulterous conduct we remain clean and pure If there is no drunkenness our spirits are clear and in good order After observation of the ve precepts we then perform purication for three periods every year and six days each month The three periods in a year for purication are from the rst to the fteenth day of the rst fth and ninth months The six monthly days for purication are the eighth the fourteenth the fteenth the twentythird the twentyninth and the thirtieth day of each month On all purication days sh and meat must not be offered We eat before noon and must not partake of anything such as sweets and delicious food in the afternoon We cleanse our minds keep our minds on the Way take refuge in the three revered ones  repent our sins reproach ourselves and practice the four immeasurable minds We stay away from the inner chamber and do not become attached to the six desires We must not whip or curse others nor ride in an oxcart or horsedrawn carriage and we must not carry weapons Regarding women over and above these they must abstain from adorning themselves with perfume owers and cosmetics correct their minds rectify their thoughts and strive to remain docile The purication is extensively performed for the sake of ones acquaintances and relatives both those who have passed away and those who are still alive as well as for all sentient beings Everyone will come to awaken the aspiration on the basis of this utmost sincerity Once our minds have become inspired we will nally avoid the suffering caused by the sins  Therefore loyal and lial people make effort and encourage themselves to perform  On the day of purication we must devote ourselves solely to practicing the profound contemplation and recite the words of the Dharma If we are unable to practice emptiness we must learn the six kinds of mindfulness  The six kinds of mindfulness refer to mindfulness of the Buddha mindfulness of the scriptures mindfulness of the sangha mindfulness of donations mindfulness of the precepts and mindfulness of Heaven What is meant by mindfulness of Heaven The ten wholesome acts and the four immeasurable minds are considered to be the acts to be reborn in Heaven Moreover it essentially means to exert ourselves to the best of our ability to save all sentient beings The ten wholesome acts refer to not committing the bodily sins of killing stealing and adultery not committing the mental sins of envy rage and ignorance and not committing the verbal sins of telling lies engaging in idle talk being duplicitous and using abusive language What is meant by not killing We must always be compassionate toward all living creatures including vermicular animals Even in desperate circumstances we must never harm them Whenever sentient beings are facing a disaster or danger we must devote all our energies to rescue them and return them to the water or the land according to wherever they used to live In the case where there is doubt whether was killed for our benet we must not receive  What is meant by stealing This generally means to take things that are not our own possessions regardless of size as well as to become corrupt when in an ofcial position These are all called stealing What is meant by adultery All kinds of attachments are generally called excessive desires As applied to sexual desire we must not engage in sexual relations with anyone other than our ofcially married spouse In addition since secret that cannot be made public it is simultaneously a sin of stealing What is called envy is jealousy When we see others good points or we see that other people are virtuous we all must replace with great joy We must not give rise to rivalry or thoughts of jealous hatred What is called rage is that the mind harbors wrath and keeps delement within it What is called ignorance is to have no faith in the great Dharma and to doubt the scriptural teachings What is meant by idle talk is rhetorical embellishments and sweetsounding words which may be beautiful but lack substance  What is meant by being duplicitous This means to say different things to ones face and behind his back and be selfcontradictory What is meant by abusive language This refers to reviling  Some people say that abusive language also refers to speaking unwholesome things and cause people to blindly follow and commit sin On the whole we must not give rise in the mind to any of these ten behaviors even for a moment These are the ten wholesome acts and also called the ten precepts The ve precepts regulate bodily acts and the ten wholesome acts serve to protect ones mind from evil Accordingly there is a difference between light and heavy reward and retribution  Those who completely observe the ve precepts will possess a human form Those who complete the ten wholesome acts will be reborn in Heaven Even those who complete only one precepts will be able to become human beings There are differences among people regarding their social rank or life span These are due to how many precepts one has observed  The opposite of the ten wholesome acts are the ten evil acts Those who have committed all ten evil acts will fall into hell Those who are bellicose and obstinate who disregard sincere remonstrance whose minds are full of poisonous thoughts and who deceive others to prot themselves fall either into the realm of animals or are reborn as snakes or vipers Those who are stingy and greedy who monopolize prots and who always complain of dissatisfaction fall into the realm of hungry ghosts Those whose sins are somewhat light but who often keep secret and whose personal feelings are not fair and clear all fall into the state of spiritual beings  Even though they may enjoy a little happiness they cannot avoid suffering from pain These ie hell the realm of hungry ghosts and the realm of animals are called the three lowest realms of existence and also called the three evil paths  Form perception consisting of pain and pleasure yang literally meaning itch conception  volition  and consciousness are called the ve skandhas  Generally all external things that have a shape and are visible are called form Losing this and becoming sad and distressed is of pain Having this and being greatly delighted is of pleasure Considering beforehand what has not yet taken place is thinking and looking back at what has already happened is recollection That which formerly was involved  stored there and never forgotten is consciousness Consciousness still germinates in the mind after having passed through a succession of kalpas Even though its derivation is obscure it is deeply rooted and is secretly linked to  The ve hindrances that cover ones mind are Ignorance is the foundation of the causality of birth and death All kinds of various attachments entirely begin with ignorance Painful torment in hell mostly results from anger Recognition is consciousness of skandhas mentioned above I am inclined to think that the ve skandhas and the six desires are the origins of the transmigration of birth and death and the source of all sin and suffering The methods to remove and control these are set forth in detail in numerous sutras The mind makes one a human being The mind makes one an inhabitant of hell The mind makes one an animal Even those who attain the Way owe to the mind Whenever a thought is impelled by the mind each and every thought is subject to reward and retribution Even if an action has not yet taken place the hidden response is constituted in the unseen world Thoughts arising from feelings move swiftly and smoothly The mechanism very slightly moves but then lls the universe Fortune and misfortune and ones physical form and destination entirely derive from  How could they be concerned only with  words expressed in a house are responded to from a place a thousand li away or that one is prudent in his bodily actions because nothing is more visible than what is secret The second translation of the Sutra of Twelve Gates says If one has a good point he should always hide it If one has a bad point he should bring it forth A gentleman does not set his mind either for anything or against anything If one has faults and does not repent  certainly he will not feel satised with himself he had better abandon the course of action within the circumstance he has been given When we examine the laws of nature working in evil acts and meritorious deeds we see that the more leaks out the lighter will be and the more is inwardly accumulated the heavier  Once an act is set forth in the human world retribution in the unseen world will certainly be lessened If wholesome conduct is apparent the achievement becomes known If the achievement becomes known public praise centers on one  If someone is concerned about stopping and encouraging in his feeling and if public praise centers on him from the outside he will then harbor greed  which certainly lls him from within Furthermore a gentleman among human beings is still a small man of Heaven not to speak of one whose benevolence is immature and whose fame does not match with reality Except for those who possess virtue we all surely have some incompleteness If one were to frankly expose to everyone will disperse along with  If he allows an unjust thought to become imprinted on his mind harbors it maintains his honor outwardly in order to avoid others reproach and win worldly fame he then greatly insults the laws of nature If he is blamed he will be ashamed if one presumes that will not be revealed he will not reform himself after all In addition if heavenly blame lls ones mind and he fears that it will be revealed he will inwardly worry  about everything and take precautions even more skillfully This is probably because he did not refrain from giving rise to the scheme at the beginning concealed the fault and did not praise what is wholesome The Sutra on the Formal Purication says You may simply speak of a hundred good things of others but you must not speak of even a single evil thing of others When we speak of others wholesomeness we give rise to a wholesome mind When we speak of others evils we give rise to an angry intention Even though intention may be small at rst it gradually grows by accumulation Ancient people said The prosperity of a military family does not last more than three generations Chen Ping also said Because I have laid many plots my descendants will not become prosperous If we refer to and take them as a teaching it is truly worthy to propagate  Nevertheless in of Qi state and Chu state whose founders committed evil deeds their descendants enjoyed generation after generation while the descendants of as Yan and Ran  received no prominent reward Since it is already obvious in these cases that the subject of reward and retribution lies in oneself this is not a matter that can be claried logically Xi and Fu were differed from each other in appearance It has been a constant rule for a hundred generations to punish the four criminals ie Gonggong Huandou the chief of Sanmiao and Gun yet not to blame  Even when sage kings ruled over the world there was no unjustiable  Nevertheless reward and retribution fall wrongly and good and evil are not made clear then that person brings a false charge against the laws  If a punishment is not inicted on the offender while disasters befall the offenders kin and if this practice is legislated it would not only be allowed in rules made by sages but would also certainly be rejected even by Shen and Han  Therefore the Nirvana Sutra says If the father does something evil the son does not suffer for his father If the son does something evil the father does not suffer for his son either One who does good obtains a reward by himself and one who does evil receives retribution by himself How truthful this is If we investigate the worldly teaching that ancestors good or evil conduct results in their descendants happiness or misery originated isnt it because feel that the way does not stop even after they themselves have been punished The more widely reward and retribution spreads the deeper the peoples prudence and fear will be If one sticks to written words without understanding thoroughly the expedient way if one recklessly follows the teaching without reaching the heart of the teaching and if one measures himself by this way and tries to comply with the truth arent such people misdirected Regarding evil acts and meritorious deeds in right and wrong there are certainly reward and retribution without fail If one is ignorant of this truth he will have no xed position for right and wrong and his mind will have no authority in which to trust When we examine only in regard to the present existence it is truly vague and there is scant evidence There is no mistake or unreasonableness in the law  but the actual fact is not constantly apparent How could we not consider it all to be due to conditions from our previous existences that extend to future existences Because we understand that The meshes of the heavenly net are large far apart  we hope that nothing will escape We realize that time continues without interruption see ten thousand kalpas to be the same as a brief space of time lump the three periods of existence together and take them all to be one and seek the nal result as that which inevitably comes why should we reform ourselves depending on revealing or concealing our sins or why would we have to change our thought depending on whether will come slowly or quickly This is the chief foundation for those who have the initial faith and something that is deeply hoped for by those whose minds are bound by karma The Sutra of the Twelve Gates says Sometimes if you think of yourself that you are correct and good you must then examine yourself  There is nothing in your body but liver intestines stomach lungs bones blood excrement and urine Moreover when you observe other peoples bodies their impurities are all the same as these If stinginess and greedy intentions arise you must remember that all your property and jewelry and valuables neither came with you when you were born nor will they go with you when you die passes and changes it is even impossible to guarantee that the morning will be the same in the evening Your body does not last long and nothing has a permanent possessor In the present existence we should bestow favor on others and show kindness to them offering money to the poor and saving the sick with medicine We must delightedly live all day long diligently watching over others and providing relief to them If an angry intention arises you must deeply produce equality and concurrently observe the ten precepts The Kṣemaṃkaraparipṛcchā says Among the bodhisattva practices forbearance is the greatest If they are beaten they receive and never retaliate If they encounter an angry person they face him with compassion If they are slandered they do not think of the slanderers vice Furthermore the Dhammapada Faju jing says When you are disgraced your mind should be earth When you practice forbearance you should be like a doorsill The examples of earth and doorsill are probably used because these are things that are covered with dust soiled with mud and trampled upon all day long The Sutra on the Complete Accomplishment of the Light Samādhi Chengju guangming dingyi jing says If a person inicts the four kinds of transgression on you you will be aware of the verbal faults You should respond to such a person with wellintentioned words and peaceful expressions When someone comes to you with evil and you respond with wholesomeness if his mind is not that of a senseless being he will be moved in reason If you can keep forbearance in mind on every occasion regret and stinginess will disappear in this life and a happy reward will appear in the future The Sutra on the Virtue of a Wise Person says If your mind is unstable never bite at others Speaking in familiar language this is the way of magnanimity If we infer this to the highest point it is the meaning of the four immeasurable minds What are the four immeasurable minds They are benevolence  compassion  joy  and protection  What is meant by benevolence It means to feel pity for sentient beings to regard all beings as equal to yourself to be merciful in putting yourself in another persons position to pray to be able to provide for all beings to be easy and comfortable to extend your love even to insects and to have a feeling of nondiscrimination What is meant by compassion It means to love others universally to save equally to let tears fall like rain and to exhibit innate mercy You must cause a real achievement to reveal itself secretly It is not to simply have a mind  What is meant by joy It means to be joyful happy and gentle and to make donations without regret What is meant by  protection Those who can practice the four immeasurable minds are the most esteemed in the three realms of existence However if you are unable to efface yourself in the state of no portent then your fate is sealed to certainly come to an end Therefore the benqi jing says Although all heavenly beings have a happy time when their merit is exhausted comes to an end too When you reach the apex of glory the way to Heaven is right across from hell The Sutra on the Complete Accomplishment of the Light Samādhi furthermore says Fortune has suffering delement vexation and coming and going ie the transmigration of birth and death The Nirvana Sutra says In the ve realms of existence there is no peace gain and loss slander and fame praise and ridicule sorrow and joy are neither pleased when they hear about wholesomeness nor fearful when they hear about unwholesomeness If ones faith is spontaneously rm neither encouragement nor discouragement can change his will Since the truth has become rooted in him objects of the external world cannot offend his thoughts Moreover whatever he encounters in this existence must have been caused by conditions from previous existences Conditions caused in previous existences mysteriously keep moving and their working is just the same as the operation of the four seasons It is impossible to guard against their advent or to stop their passing away Assuredly we must submit to this be content with it and delightedly complete it If we cordially enhance ourselves in the training of Buddhism expect various things and yet are unmindful of them since the retribution upon ones body has ceased one will attain the great peace The truth is founded in the mind and reward and retribution manifests itself in a factual matter is compared to the fact that if a form is upright then its shadow appears straight too or if a sound is peaceful then its echo is agreeable to the ears How could there be one who does this If this is so those who harmonize their minds with the Way of the Spirit should expect assuredly to lead their minds to the truth strive to have the farreaching thought efface their minds correct themselves and have no expectation of obtaining help from others Certainly this has nothing to do with what is dark and abstruse When we investigate why the teachings of the scriptures were established we see that the reason is probably to make us aware of relying on ourselves In the way to rely on oneself however there is no awakening that is not based on the teachings If awakening is based on the teachings the merit one may obtain from relying on oneself derives from the Way of the Spirit If exultation arises within the mind certainly takes a denite form in phenomena It is just like when simply singing a song is not enough to express an exultant feeling so one dances for joy If this is so to admire and respect is probably not necessary in reason but it cannot be rejected in feeling We should efface ourselves and master thoroughly the tenor of the teachings and absorbedly and joyfully think of the teachings We must place ourselves in sentient beings place in order to lead them with our own bodies Consequently we can secure the ambitions of new followers and cause them to have the determination to consign their feelings to  A sutra says Birth is suffering aging is suffering sickness is suffering death is suffering meeting ones enemies is suffering separation from loved ones is suffering and not obtaining what one wants is suffering If you encounter any of these types of suffering you should think that such suffering is simply a result from what you have done in previous existences and concurrently you should realize that this is an evil falsehood You must awake from through a farsighted view and enlarge with the immeasurable minds The number of our successes and failures certainly does not deserve counting If you practice the several ways concurrently this thought will naturally cease Furthermore if you do not enter the Way weal and woe arise alternately In the collecting and dispersing ie birth and death or in going and coming ie transmigration in birth and death both the wise and the foolish attain the same thing Therefore sutras say If there is peace then there is danger If there is birth there is death This is probably the common force of nature and the xed rule that inevitably visits you If you infer and pacify  you will be at ease in whatever you do The Vimalakīrtinirdeśasūtra says All phenomenal things take form following the workings of a mind If this is so there is a sign of a activity at the beginning and then a phenomenon responds to it later A thought arises and then there is  When your mind is stable you are at ease in whatever circumstance you encounter When your feelings are hindered you are inactive wherever you go If fear arises in the mind a misfortune from the external world takes advantage of  When misfortune from the external world takes advantage fear increases in the mind In all phenomena there will be nothing that can disturb you and no evils will be able to assail you The four types of impermanent things are impermanence  suffering  emptiness  and nonself  The fact that our bodies change as we go from young to old or that a hill and a valley change places is called impermanence That arising and falling away alternate or that joy at its summit certainly turns into grief is called suffering That all phenomena nally end in nothingness is called emptiness That the spirit does not have a permanent dwelling and transmigrates without cessation is called nonself Therefore even if you reside in peace you still worry about danger and if you enjoy a good reputation during the day you become anxious in the evening This is to realize that having a mind means to have hindrance and having hindrance means that suffering exists Even if one were to become the noblest in the heavenly and human realms and concurrently have a high rank the more signicant ones position the deeper his arrogance The greater ones pleasurable feeling the more suffering there will be in the law  Therefore a sutra says The three realms of existence are full of suffering there is nothing pleasurable Moreover says Sentient beings in the ve realms of existence are all in a large prison As long as your mind is bound to the world of existence weal and woe are linked together This is why the three realms of existence are collectively called a large prison The Buddha asked his disciples what impermanence means One answered  is unwarrantable even for a single day This is impermanence The Buddha told him You are not my disciple Another said  is unwarrantable even for as brief a time as it takes to have a meal This is impermanence The Buddha said You are not my disciple Another said One has transited to the next life before even his exhaled breath has returned to him This is impermanence The Buddha said You are truly my disciple The evident testimony of impermanence is displayed before every day yet all generations continue to act in the same ways and no one realizes after all They have no peace even for a moment and yet they make a plan for their whole lifetimes  If fear does not exist before  they neglect to do everything If they try to improve their virtue in this manner they will not have even as small an achievement as overturning a basket  If they control the mind in this way they will be indolent in what they learn Consequently gentlemen who have a grasp of the Way pay heed for a few minutes and regret the passing  They continually strive for improvement lashing the laggards and cultivate themselves through competing with time Because they do not have enough time deluded thoughts have no cause to arise and the conditioned response to has no derivation from which to arise To be capable of giving away that you have accumulated in order to benet and save sentient beings is giving To respectfully observe the ten wholesome and ward off evils by sincerity is precepts To not retaliate for any outrage you have suffered and to always remain humble is forbearance To practice industriously what you have learned and never be idle day or night is diligence Generally if these ve matters are practiced with thoughtfulness this is called the worldly pāramitās and if they are operated with the concurrently forgetting everything this is called the wisdom of the Way  The benqi jing says There are ninetysix different teachings Each believes in what it serves They all hope for peaceful living Who knows their own delusions To be delighted with gain hate losing enjoy living and lament over death are probably the ordinary delusions of young wanderers and the common feelings of sentient beings However once the unseen power secretly responds no matter how one may strive to attach to he cannot keep them When the response arrives he receives retribution How could be controlled by intellectual functions Accordingly those who learn must unite their minds in the foundation of transformation and understand and view the profound ultimate When one appreciates and values  all thoughts spontaneously disappear When disappear one has forgetting  When one has forgetting  causation is cut off Retribution due to causation is therefore already cut off and then one will enter nonarising Since he or she is not reborn he or she will not trouble to die Therefore the Lalitavistra says There is no place from which things arise and they arise everywhere In all places they arise there is no place where they arise The Nirvana Sutra says When your mind and consciousness cease you neither die nor are reborn The mind is like a seed actions are like the soil and reward and retribution are like the resulting fruit It is just as one sows each seed according to its kind When the time has come the plants sprout and no one can stop it The above section gives a minute account of what kind of rebirth one will receive when the precepts of the ten wholesome acts are planted In addition when one plants the seed of the four abodes of emptiness in the realm beyond material elements through dhyāna he or she will receive the noblest position in Heaven From the rst heaven up to the twentyeighth  merit gradually increases according to what one has done When one plants the truth of impermanence through meditation goes against the world of existence and places himself in the world of nonexistence he is able to enter the nirvana of the arhat Not shunning the world of transience not being bound by contemplation on emptiness uniting tacitly with all principles having no attachment and depending on nothing results in nothing planted Since there is nothing that has been planted one is not subject to retribution Being unprejudiced and profoundly extinguished is the nirvana of the Buddha The Vimalakīrtinirdeśasūtra says Those six masters say their partial teachings are the Way Those who follow these masters are enmeshed in various views fall into prejudice and end up in the eight difculties They are unable to leave behind the way of birth and death Even though the profound mental state is repeatedly practiced if moves even slightly you will also be detained in limited existence just as the six masters  were Even if their merits go beyond mountains and rivers and they are the most noble in the three realms of existence fortune and misfortune alternate with each other and return to them They will fall into punitive suffering in the end How can they attain the great achievement of pacifying their spirits calm restful profound peace Living creatures inevitably have feelings This is the natural course of Heaven If they do not settle in wholesomeness they will surely dwell in unwholesomeness Consequently those who begin to practice the Way need something on which to rely So a sutra says If you want to build a mansion in the air it is impossible to accomplish this after all if you want to take hold of the buddha lands it is not through emptiness If this is so the ve pāramitās and the four immeasurable minds cannot be disregarded When you take refuge in the Buddha there is no emancipation in the Buddha When you take refuge in the precepts there is no merit in the precepts Then the truth dhyāna and the ve skandhas will be deeply united Even though numerous practices may be concurrently arranged this is originally only to practice emptiness within emptiness Some people may think In emptiness there is nothing to practice Since there is already practice isnt it to lose emptiness Emptiness is a term of nothought not a designation of a government ofce or a residence Nonbeing is truly nonbeing If we existentialize nonbeing we will completely remain in the limited  Being is really being If we forget both being and nonbeing then we will attain profound realization Although physical objects and phenomena are displayed in their practical use  when sensations cease they deeply unite with the principle  How could there be nonbeing after the extermination of being How could we reach exhaustion only by means of gradual decrease Speaking from this viewpoint being is indeed not in itself a hindrance If we reverse the current return to the origin and entrust ourselves to the foundation we will spontaneously be without limit In the profound Mahayana sutras the three periods of existence are always combined in one and the phenomena we see right in front of our eyes are usually not considered to be existent Accordingly the purpose of to practice emptiness within emptiness is seen here Clarification of Two Issues by Chamberlain for the Attendants Yan Yanzhi to discern that Buddhism Confucianism and Daoism are equally wholesome and to become procient in divergent subjects First is to speak the Way next is to discuss the mind and the last is to examine reason To speak the Way is to talk in conformity with Heaven to discuss the mind is to argue on the basis of human beings and to examine reason is to take in phenomena When we distinguish following  we separate them from one another and arrange each by its path When we summarize and understand these three teachings we nd that they all reach the same point in the end  Things like profound and marvelous scriptures and extremely brilliant doctrines all offer clues of these three signicances ie the Way the mind and reason and reach the highest point of nonduality The language  however originates in a foreign region Therefore has been disliked by worldly scholars In the Way bestowed by Heaven there is no difference between foreign countries and China Whenever a person receives the spirit  how could it be that is limited to a specic place either outside or within  When we consider this there can be no arbitrary judgment Those who practice Daoism are of the school that came out of the Way of the Transcendents Therefore rening the form is considered to be primary Regarding those who worship the Buddha the origin lies in enlightening the mind Accordingly controlling the mind is considered to be foremost Those who follow the school of rening form must go to a deep and spacious place where they try to return to ying spirits Consequently they become rejuvenated reject aging prolong youthful charm and preserve the bright appearance of youth They intend to unite their bodies with the light red clouds and spread their traces all over the empty sky These are their strong points If false practice this they fear divine punishment force people to offer crude prayers mix male and female together and throw evil and justice into disorder In the art of controlling the mind people must part from their relatives and wives restrain themselves in both body and mind revere the Pure Awakened One as their teacher and believe in causality and lives Therefore they return to nonarising and are able to achieve the sacred enterprise their intelligence is brighter than the sun and their aspirations are as innumerable kalpas are narrow If those who go against practice this they take advantage of taking the tonsure become overly familiar with highranking people attend those who have honor and fame and seek prot In anything there is a case of notso in any matter there is nothing without harm Even if we measure something with a weight and check it every day we still worry about nding a difference Moreover the Way of the Spirit is formless and assuredly something of which numerous matters avail themselves If one is not suspicious that there is no spirit before he is able to comprehend the spirit I think that this is because the nature of numinous beings is subtle and obscure Great change happens abruptly we can rely on great conformity  shines just as the clear sky does and it is as cautious as when one looks into an abyss Those who can consider that principles and conformity make a person can altogether say that there is the spirit If someone slanders the truth and blames for its disadvantages he has simply not yet developed discernment Sunshine by Wang Gai When I inquire the scriptures of the highest Way explicate the origin of birth and death indicate reward and retribution for good or evil conduct and explain that there is a ferryboat to take us beyond this world The instructions and precepts are clearly stated and fully enumerated going into particulars Nevertheless sincere words are not beautiful The compositions are complicated and the expressions are vague Waves separate us from the deep pool in which a pearl worth a thousand ounces of silver is found Therefore those who learn have not attained its gate or they have not paid attention to it When we avail ourselves of the small in order to reach the great we may unexpectedly come close to secular customs To assist Heaven and to enhance brightness is called sunshine I investigate exhaustively what is magnicent and do not come to an end I tread on an terrain a small piece of land and I wear the round sky an overturned bowl I see the boundlessness of the three realms of existence far in the distance and I encounter the vigorous yinyang vapors I seek the profound origin of the Grand Creator and survey the deep root of Natures nourishing Then the body that avails itself of the four great elements will dissipate like foam while the spirit that is subtle among all things exists permanently This is the state understood by those good people Consequently birth is sad and the spirit is pleasing As for all living creatures the spirit has no set pattern Regarding the species of wriggling living creatures their disposition is impermanent To come occurs as swiftly as owing water and to entrust ones life to this world is a spark It goes and returns appears and disappears It ows around in the great sea and transmigrates in the great change  It rides upon the waves and drifts far away It transmigrates in the three lowest realms of existence and stagnates in the environment of the eight difculties It is pitiful that there is no hope to attempt to break free from this environment and escape It is lamentable that there are hired people ie lowly people who return to  We regard respectfully that virtue should be quickly exalted and we consider that the accumulation of evils must be delayed This is the easy point to see the accomplishment of this undertaking  The mental movement of foresight is not weak The ve kinds of happiness arise from performing correct things and the six extreme evils are formed by following evils It is natural to be moved by the truth Who creates happiness Who launches disasters Water moves and makes a pool in a lower level The way of human beings hates arrogance Sins are caused by the accumulation of wealth and blessings are brought about by the promotion of modesty When even a child acts correctly evil spirits run away When we look at the pair of a form and  or of a sound and  or when we examine a pair of signs such as weal and woe the principles exactly t our thoughts With our own eyes we can see that the traces correspond to  just as a round wheel holds a pair of compasses or a carpenters ink string is attached to a straight rafter To seek happiness sincerely lies in oneself and to become a good person truly lies in ones own  Those who breathe have nothing permanent We have no idea to where they arrive after suddenly departing We sympathize with a young beauty who dies at a tender age She might return reincarnated as a pig owned by her former household She was raised with great love and care in her former life but in her current life she will be slaughtered in a sacricial ceremony The spirit subtly and continually dwells within us but our bodies undergo changes and transform into other bodies Even before ten years have passed after our deaths we will be forgotten We should sigh deeply and weep for this This is not only what one person doeswe ignorant people all act like this The latter are restlessly prolic day after day Who knows how to secretly clear up the cause of this I may be wrong but I have learned as follows Even though the Way of the Spirit is obscure the law of spirits is particularly clear wander around in the intermediate state between death and a new life  and they go to the iron city of hell where Wang Shu is terminated in the night and where there is no sun in the daytime They have to pass through a yard of burning charcoal On the mountain of sharply pointed blades knives are piled up The forest of swords that raise up their sharp tips are aweinspiring and exquisite There is a vast expanse of melted copper that gushes out like the sea In a huge cauldron boiling water undulates and makes a sound like thunder King Yama supervises inspections  and beside him the wardens of hell hold prongs in their hands There are venomous birds called zhen with sharp beaks bright and scintillating ery carts sharply pointed nails pointed spears and dogs called jiao that bare their fangs Licentious people are burned on an illusory pole Hungry convicts are laid out to dry up on dirt and sand lasts for numerous kalpas There are a thousand different severe and they cause diverse types of suffering You cannot go through it without gasping for breath You suddenly arrive in and forget your home Thereupon there are those who observe the ve precepts without failure and who are perfect in performing the way of the ten wholesome acts When they pass away just as the evening sun sets they fortunately ascend to the nine heavens where they will see a dazzling holy palace hall and a stately mansion built in the air There are altogether a hundred beautiful buildings and nearly a thousand clean households The Gate of Gold shines as brightly as crystal the lanes made of gems sparkle as attractively as lapis lazuli pearl trees line the streets and the fabulous birds luan and phoenixes sing in the tree branches Fragrant owers are dignied splendid and elegant and an aromatic breeze blows gently diffusing the aroma If you merely think of clothing a beautiful garment is put on you If you think of eating fragrant food appears in abundance before you Xi He goes on a long journey and one day is as long as ten thousand years  No one ever does anything to offend his nature They narrow their eyes and see that beings lightly y around They master the highest level of music of wonderful sounds They go to the end of existence prolonging their lives They abandon this vulgar world and ascend Accompanying their outstanding peers they ascend higher If this is so delicacies are served daily in order to provide a feast for the virtuous people of the past This land is barren agriculture cannot take place Even if there were a large accumulation of resources how could they be inexhaustible Even if someone is blessed with longevity his life will come to an end at last When the three disasters arise even the palace buildings will be lost When the seven symptoms reach there the revenues conferred by the Lord of Heaven will cease When the great autumn season comes and having fullled their growing season wither away there is no distinction between the legendary tree called dachun and a fungus Therefore the Tathāgata the Great Sage clearly illuminates us with the three transcendental knowledges feels compassion for those of us who are in trouble and ignorant and explains clearly the essentials of the Way A superior person opens wide his mind and forgets what he wished to say but a mediocre person tenaciously holds to his aspiration and sticks to the teaching The teaching has no xed pattern it follows whatever people do if one is traveling on land he should go by a vehicle but when he is traveling on water he requires a boat  The Section on Pasture does not comprise all of the three hundred odes  There is nothing unequal in the teaching but there is sharpness and dullness in individuals temperament The foolish and the wise are guided equally dragons and spiritual beings are edied together Myriad paths come together and return to one through transcendental wisdom This can be compared to the fact that one cannot cross the sea in anything other than a ship If we urge numerous people to move to a place where the Buddhist Way is studied they will complete wuwei and cease transmigrating in the cycle of birth and death Originally in the beginning the three vehicles equally returned to one nonexistence So for practical purposes are differentiated Consequently they are absorbed in emptiness and are peaceful and contented Pratyekabuddhas understand troubles through knowing the minute  Accordingly they move to a profound place and do not dwell  Though their subtle traces are lost again because they have left the world of existence they still make an impression as if they remained there How would they need to remove anything They understand clearly before they examine They keep in mind and unite it in their initial intention Their principles are important and deep beyond words In former times when ancients met the Imposing One whose light shined upon them they were able to personally receive the sacred instructions The people who adored respectfully gave their eyes and ears to him Some were enlightened by the sound of a single cough from him and some repented and reformed themselves on account of receiving a single meal  one who has attained emancipation extends to today even as the fortune of the Way has begun to decline The great teaching still exists but those who appreciate it are rare Moonlight is considered to be as bright as a rey Yu transcended the secular world and realized the profound tenor  He led the life of a recluse in the hills and valleys and his benevolence moved even tigers and water buffaloes When he chanted in a feeble voice in a deep ravine water in the driedup spring gradually arose and increased Elder Que ascended to the sky and Wei du belonged to the path but they were both indifferent to nonarising so they left their bodies and became immortals Today Zhi Dun is particularly outstanding His great enterprise is deep and pure and his spiritual manner is clean and reverent When he utters a single word the obstructions people have collected disperse To see him is enough to wash away ones stinginess By hearing his one can leave behind arrogance He fullled his original and now enjoys composing poems on the eastern mountain What kind of deep appreciation must he have in order to live such a simple life and to consider that the great treasure is as light as a very tiny thing If no one has difculties in his talent the wise is not valued If the fool is not laughed at sages are not lofty Profound music seems shallow to vulgar ears Who could forget the taste when he hears the Shao the music composed during the time of the sage Emperor Shun Wherever we go there is the Way There are spirits wherever we go There are exquisiteness and coarseness in principles The great occupies the position of an exquisite lord and the minor becomes a minister of great virtue Winged birds follow the sacred bird called  garuḍa The creatures that have a shell belong to the asuras The two polarities take the Grand Terminus as their origin All the stars link to the North Polar Star Therefore the ninetysix schools abundantly spread their branches slight and abandon the important root and rashly reject what is tranquil and great Their followers all claim that they participate in sacredness Some move to a mountain and dwell near a stream and some are shortlived They command beautiful beings who wear heavenly garments howl at the savory odors in a numinous kitchen glorify the atrocity of the orderly returning troops transform a pebble into a ne piece of jade exhaust every means of transformation and tower above others in eccentricity They regret that what they rely on has no perpetuity These are pleasures within the limited world and they are not as good as even the chaff and bran of the highest Way  Regarding those found in the Arrayed Transcendents and those who rene the body they pass their time like a bear stretch and twist like a bird and breathe in the Grand One In the evening they consume the brilliant moon along with the moisture of an elm tree and in the morning they take the bright rosy clouds together with the red sun Juanzi ew into the sky by eating glutinous millet An enjoyed longevity by eating pine resin Fengren lightly lifted his body to the sky by eating nuts of the cypress tree What the elixir imbues is enough to support life and sustain the body Inwardly they are not peaceful if they rely on their outward appearance They vainly climbed into the clouds fell and died It is esteemed to be able to y yet even moths and butteries can y high It is wonderful that one hardly grows old yet even turtles and snakes live long While we make ourselves comfortable in this inn ie this transient world only the mind should be treasured Those who wish to sustain the body are not worthy of discussing the spirit with us Those who are familiar with secular customs cannot talk about the Way with us Those who try to inquire about it are at a loss in asking and those who try to answer are conned in themselves As for the darkcolored pearl and the explanation of the Way I would say that has no phenomenon and has nothing to say If we keep still and silent there are admonitions in the profound response Ever since a man of Ying died who can serve as a chopping board for the artisan  ie what can we do without those things on which we have relied Even if one has completed preparations to know the Way just as one sets up a bamboo sh trap in deep water or sets a snare in a dense vegetation waiting for a sh in the river or a rabbit in the forest if he attains the meaning beyond what is spoken then as soon as he has seen it he should abandon the mind We respectfully expect to benevolently edify us Even though the divine reins move swiftly the mechanism of causality is unending There is no beginning and no end in it  but there is a beginning and end with oneself People temporarily take steps the end of a streak of bright lightning and they breathe amid violent winds that carry stones and gravel They know to fear a path and to be terried of bandits but they puzzle over the fact that the desires caused by objects of the six sense organs have invited the foreign  People neglect what is profound and superb yet covet what is familiar to them They think that luxury and frugality are both aspects of wealth After the strong winds have stripped  they think  to return to the beginning and try to make more beautiful than before Even if they feel regret myriad times how could their be satised Consequently those who have made a great oath burn their ngers and bore through rocks  They secretly expect to attain without to wait for it They draw the divine sword and brandish the halberd of the precepts They weed out the six thieves from their minds and try to put an end to an expedition in the ve paths Folding their hands  they regulate what is internal in themselves and completely have the decisive mind to attain Dharma wisdom Skt The the three periods of existence will then all be extinguished and their minds will become entirely open Even if they commit their ears to hearing what is not clear and consign their eyes to seeing what cannot be relied on delements will fruitlessly fall away following and impurity will futilely dissipate along with them It universally saves people and peacefully ferries them across  Who commiserates with great benevolence People entrust to the lodging house in order to mingle with the world by tempering their brightness They customarily ramble about and abide in what is deep and dark They act like Heaven  and they undergo transformation just as things do They are just like someone who treads water with no worry  If through the subtle wonders of supernatural transformation one regulates miracles he can lift up the trichiliocosm on his palm cause a mustard seed to contain Mount Sumeru and the four seas to be held within a single pore of ones skin and make the seven treasures longer than the period of a kalpa These can be believed but they cannot be sought these can be followed but they cannot be understood These are not what are propagated through talking or chanting How good are the words expounded by the Buddha of his own accord Skt Even if the world were full of wise people and one of them had a hundred heads and one of those heads had a hundred tongues and one of those tongues explained a hundred meanings with sharp and outstanding oratorical talent and even if all those people gathered and praised the Way would still be less than one tenthousandth  Moreover I an ignorant bigot respectfully give an account of under the pretext of being ambitious and too hasty Am I one who tries to raise the brightness of the glow of a rey and who intends to increase the light of the sun in order to assist the sun The repository of numinous beings outside of this secular world is excessively far and vast Of all that is subtle and wonderful the innermost is immeasurable Those who have great words unexpectedly lose  The virtue of Earth is deep We are startled when we hear about immense gullies Chinese classical books carry in their grasp of them Foreign scriptures record this as if listing doors and windows So he believed in the lowly and disgraceful stories of the Qi Xie He saw the bird called peng and the sh called kun and indicated that they are large but he did not see the king of birds or the mother of shes  Unusual and extraordinary things have accumulated but they are too subtle and extensive to record are extensively arranged in the book Huanglan How can we shallowly detest cut jade Furthermore why would we largely bring a false charge against textiles re Moreover below these there is the tenor of the teachings bound together but these are the expedient baits of Emperor Yao and Confucius I always  devote myself to and abide by the law I am afraid to overstep what I am told to completely reject reason in order to testify to statements to not understand meanings inferring in accordance with categories to vainly make things vast and scheme to complicate things and further to increase suspicion and invite fear I realize that I have skillfully made a display of my wisdom and astonished people Therefore I will lay down my brush and stop thinking I put one corner in my rough purport I will wait for someone who has clear knowledge to embody truthfulness End of Fascicle Thirteen of The Collection for the Propagation and Clarication Written Appeal to Mount Tai by Zhu Daoshuang I ramaṇa Zhu Daoshuang dare to address the Spiritual Government Office and the messengers of the Overseer of Mount Tai the Eastern Mountain  The god of earth was placed below and guarded by the Five Sacred Mountains The yin and yang spread Natures nourishment throughout the eight directions All things were born in this  These receive pure vapor make use of the truth and have no impurity of evil They are the Way of the Spirit they are spontaneous dignied and not false They follow the laws of Heaven and Earth They are sincere honest upright straight tranquil calm profound and pure Advancing they lead the beginning of the operations of the four seasons Retreating they follow the essence of the teaching of the ve kinds of principles of human relationships They conceal the disposition to understand what is subtle within and clearly show the brightness of the Way and its outowing operation without At the upper level they master absolute vacancy and at the lower level they nourish the masses They cherish virtue and secretly understand it thoroughly They roam around the nine cliffs ie the edges of the world and y with a ap of the wings to Mount Xuanque in c the north The Eastern Mountain is the starting point of the east and springtime and the vapor of pure yang It is in the rank of king or father just like the constellation Nanji and the Big Dipper that are the central stars in the nine heavens or the KingSire of the East and the Queen Mother of the West Xi wangmu who are the former rulers of the ultimate of nonbeing  ies like a phoenix riding on vapor and goes to this subtle and profound world which is clearer and more still than the primordial substance and in which human beings do not exist Its Way is spontaneous Nevertheless why do you use apparitions and other prodigies or specters under the pretext of the Way of the Eastern Mountain or numinous beings who dwell on the mountain and mislead the ignorant feelings of secular people on the basis of the wild deceptions of the wandering spirits of the dead You make books about deities and articially erect images of them There is originally no record and in the end nothing to ascertain the truth In your appearance there is a poisonous vapor caused by destroying the lives of living creatures and within you a hundred evil spirits prevail During the day grains and cooked rice are greatly offered to you during the night numerous evil spirits haunt in the yard These are all spirits of wolves and snakes Owls and pythons vainly cry out From the time the Three Augusts established the foundation up to the present time when the tradition is transmitted I have never seen such a divine message among what has been respected for successive generations Therefore the Records of Minor Conquest says When the spirit is right its light is hidden in dimness It goes up high above to the celestial bodies and plays below at Mount Xuanque  It roams around in the clouds shadows and soars like a dragon to the eight ends of the universe A wind rises and rain is distributed Natures nourishment is just like thunder and lightning Even though no lunch basket is provided foods of numerous avors are spontaneously offered Its kindness is as bright as the morning sunlight If you eat in accordance with Heaven you will not destroy the life of numerous living creatures This is a subtle principle regarding the wonderful soaring and the Way of the Spirit that is pure and free from prejudice If the spirit is not right it offends all things According to the circumstances or when taking advantage of divine messages conveys to secular people things that confuse them The lives of numerous living creatures are cut off living creatures who are in the middle of their lives are unfairly killed and their bones and esh are put on a cutting board in order to offer them to the wrong spirit The peoples minds then become scattered and their primordial energy is painfully injured How could the deity of the Eastern Mountain be considered in this way Therefore the Zhenzhong jie says Those who bear vapor those who wriggle and numerous insects should not be harmed Never eat the eggs of birds All living things receive life from the primordial energy of Heaven and form their bodies in the yard of Earth At their origin they received their lives and bodies from the two polarities  Many people bear benevolence in mind so they do not kill others obeying Heaven It is needless to mention the taking of the lives of pigs and sheep and drinking their blood  From this we can infer that is not the spirit Furthermore the true deities of the Five Sacred Mountains are the symbols of the spirits They receive the Way so they are pure and free from prejudice They have neither voice nor sound They take no pleasure in being respected and they do not feel sadness even if they are disrespected They have no sense of benet or loss even if they are praised a thousand times or slandered ten thousand times Nevertheless you falsely say  disguised as living people become angry groundlessly and eat butchered a  Those who follow them are granted favors but those who disobey them receive misfortune Your course of action is unjust and false You defame and disgrace the true deities It is not their Way Therefore the section called the Record of the Midst of Profundity of the Huangluozi jing says One who claims to be the deity of a mountain is most certainly a python or a snake One who calls himself the deity of a large river or the sea must be a sea turtle an alligator a sh or a freshwater turtle One who represents himself as the parent deity of Heaven and Earth is certainly a wild animal such as a cat or raccoon dog One who assumes the title of the deity of generals must be a bear brown bear tiger or leopard One who calls himself the deity of ofcials must be a small or large monkey One who refers to himself as the deity of a household is most certainly a dog sheep pig or cow Mischievous spirits incarnate themselves as categories such as a door a well a furnace or broken utensils They all call themselves deities but they are only vapor of vicious spirits that frighten people The energies of obscene spirits are all recorded in scriptures and clearly analyzed in commentaries More than six years have passed from the time you made the assertion of fortune and misfortune You invite people from remote places in the four directions There is no one who does not promptly respond to you Those who escort a sick person and come to you are like a small stream owing to the sea but the grief of those who take their dead back from you lls the road A person with a minor illness easily recovers you then praise yourself your good fortune to him If it is difcult for you to save someone with an advanced disease you have no favor The disease of the ancient state of Zhongrong was not cured by you You had no efcacy in these two cases You try to cause a large number of people to join themselves to you and take refuge in you Without a good physician and good medicine even those who take the tonsure cannot subdue the demon of disease Even after ten days or a month have passed there would be no sign and response  Furthermore at the great beginning of the country King Huan was installed as a feudal lord He bestowed virtuous relationships on the six states restrained the assistance of the Three Communicating Agencies  and gloried the Imperial house Heavenly calamity accidentally befell him and his body was attacked by a minor illness He thought that your god of the land could reveal the mysterious virtue Consequently he propagated your virtue and believed in your command He visited your sanctuary offered three kinds of livestock  and gave an additional gift of rare and precious things If you represent the sacred Way if you can communicate with Heaven and if you can achieve what is subtle why is it that you could not remove his illness and attain peace for him by informing the Nine Augusts above consulting with the god of the earth below gathering a hundred numinous beings manifesting a miracle or utilizing the good assistants of the country Since there was no prompt efcacy  suddenly passed away We have veried these kinds of falsehoods Moreover in ancient times the stones on Mount Tai stood by themselves and the altar of the god of the land moved Divine spirits sent down omens This legend has been passed down for ten thousand generations You claim the sacredness of Mount Tai for yourself You are not able to manifest supernatural virtue by raising clouds and causing rain at all You plot evil in order to damage the true Way Even if you are able to move chopsticks along the surface of a tray and completely drink wine by lifting a cup it is similar to performing supernatural magic Moreover there is no evidence that you do What deity is there Furthermore Mount Tai is ruled by King Yama His domain is dark and obscure different from this world in its mysteriousness The messengers of the Overseer send down in the same manner as deities do Myriad evils are all recorded even if they are triing Trivial acts of wholesomeness b are unimportant but nothing is left out  All spirits are completely collected  it is not a government ofce with which living people must comply Nevertheless why do harmful spirits falsely state this purpose throw off all restraint at will among human beings and deceive and jeopardize people in all respects Among the trees of a dense forest or in a eld full of magpies they draw together or move around They are enumerated in books of ceremonies from remote to the present  They assemble men and women and plant earthly desires in their minds Their foul vapor invites misfortune from the external world The hooting of an owl spreads out into the distance Their poisons accumulate in the kings territory become harmful and increase exceedingly Clouds and fog cover the sky Various kinds of evil conceal what is right Many things are harmed through your weird and peculiar means Even though I am but an insignicant follower I fully step up to the rank of the Three Seasonal Tailoring Groups  I often read classic books and commentaries and now I see these calamities Inferring from ancient matters and examining present matters evil does not go along with good I will wash away impurity and brightly raise the sacred Way I inform you that I will strictly investigate the faction of mischievous spirits and make them return to the graveyards to roam about there If they eat fruit and drink spring water it is enough for them to open a path to living This then causes the masses to cut off the trouble of exhausting their wealth and the birds and animals to not be killed in snares If there are still some spirits that turn their heads around feel a persistent attachment  and do not leave here hoping for food then I will summon deities such as the divine king Vaiśravaṇa and Rāṣṭrapāla to whom I will grant vajra I will station a military division of true that are brave and sternly powerful They will rigorously move the trichiliocosm The mere posture of couching their shining spears or drawing their bright swords can break a mountain into pieces subdue dragons and bring demons to their knees You are a minor spirit I think of benevolence and feel pity for you for what you do When I warn you of this danger and worry about you my heart hurts Quickly appear before me and return to your original form Go on a long journey myriad miles back to blue waves on the seashore Do not stay here any longer Show your submission and do as I have ordered Written Appeal to the Demon by Shi Zhijing I Shi Zhijing repeatedly bow to you with my head to the ground Your Excellency and I have traveled on different ferries in the profound path but human beings and Heaven are unied Even though our most honored masters differ from each other we are fundamentally the same in terms of being in the three realms of existence At the present time the Dharma King manages the world and everyone in the ten directions desires to follow him The marvelous net is precisely spread and the large rope of the net is seized completely There is the tide for the Great Pervader to prevail and the lofty assembly will soon be held I cannot stand up eagerly longing for it so I am simply writing this to make my intention clear The times that are blocked have a way to be opened A thousand sages hand on from one to another A great number of teachers inherit this in succession In ancient times our great founder the heavenly king Ultimate Source  embodied the functions of all changes and ascended the throne in the original region in accordance with an auspicious omen sent down from Heaven He relied on the expedient form and subjugated all countries He powerfully washed away the four evils and cleansed the three realms of existence He brought calmness to the remote backward regions in the seven directions and pacied and unied the nine lands  c Nevertheless the profound laws of nature were not sympathetic to him His true appearance became tranquil The double brightness of the sun and moon stopped the luminosity and waves capsized an empty boat Consequently this caused evil to arise one after another just as when ants  and views like an owl to develop ercely The true path was dimmed and polluted Pure people became stained and confused Cruelty accumulated among the masses Poison owed for myriad kalpas Sentient beings who cherish the Way in mind have different thoughts from one another but they come to anger in the same way Our Dharma King received the mandate of Heaven appeared in this world as occasion demands in order to rectify confusions He was born as an heir of a noble house of the upper level  and charged himself with numerous peoples minds on the lower level He held in hand the star called the Heavenly Banner and encompassed the trichiliocosm He took a rm grip of the sacred chart and caused the great enterprise to prosper Clouds arose in the four palaces and the auspicious bird luan ew to India when the spirit descended to Kapilavastu and made the moat of time around the city He encouraged and led peoples minds and offered comfort and instruction to the sick He adorned his heart with the axe of wisdom wore the wondrous armor on his body sympathized with the eighteen innocent people and felt sad that the path to the three kinds of emptiness was cut off He was determined to relieve in the end of the world and had to conquer many difculties You are unafraid that serious delusions may cover you you are deeply attracted by silly thoughts so you stick to false views like a wolf you occupy a heaven of the realm of desire like an owl you hoot at a mysterious watchtower you betray and leave your allies at national borders you oppose the divine principle and you think that you are able to ascend the Throne and change great laws Looking at even just two or three of these issues causes me to draw a deep breath Formerly Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū governed the world and all regions depended on him just as a shadow follows  There was a deceitful idiotic heavenly demon who did not observe the right principles disobeyed the will of Heaven and disturbed deities minds Soldiers led lled the empty sky took temporary forms and variously transformed Their ne armor gleamed in the sunlight and their pointed spears wiped out the area Mysterious drums vied with one another in their loud pounding vigorously walked about or ran around thinking themselves to be strong and energetic Once King army rose in force the group of evil spirits was brought to an end Needless to say you are only a single general and try to be valiant Nevertheless you intend to go against  usurp and oppress the splendid capital city seize the powers of the spiritual world and y over the Supreme One  If you disgrace

His Majesty will open his heart to you be moved by your intention to submit confer ofcial positions and titles of nobility upon all of you and award efs as well Your achievement will be considered equal to that of vassals of long service Nevertheless what frame of mind do you possess You unreasonably give rise to a peculiar plot You are haughty in a deserted border region and scheme to strengthen a permanent position harmful inuence will break out among the masses and disasters will ow eternally How sad this is It is really wrong Formerly according to circumstances you were misled by objects Your mind was unrestrained and confused You plunged yourself into danger and escaped to the nonBuddhist teaching If someone makes a single mistake out of a hundred acts even though he may be wise and virtuous he loses his normal state  Why do you choose ignorance cling to absurdity and seek merely temporary ease in an evil position You commit yourself to the mountain of ignorance and consider yourself to be lofty You rely on the grove of wrong views and rest in comfort You indulge in the delements of the six desires amuse yourself with evil delusions and please your spirit You raise the standard of arrogance aloft lead the ferocious battle array of ignorance stride along a deserted path and make light of the sacred treasures You try to usurp the heavenly palace and compete with the sun and moon I am afraid that you will not be successful Your splendid features are bright and shining and you are the center of public attention You should apologize for your faults at the red gate  When everything is set in order by the Way family and nation coexist the sovereign and his vassals are equally eminent your body and fame are secure you are able to understand with a philosophic eye and your dependents are peaceful and easy The Kings army now sets the time to take the eld In the ten directions the reins are raised carry trumpet shells in their hands A group of sages dance in unison The axe of the Way glitters in the vanguard and mysterious drums roar in the rear guard Once the spiritual bell has been struck the ten directions will be overturned c the waves of the sea will splash and lands will quake just like a boiling  At this moment Mount Sumeru is enclosed within a particle of dust and Heaven and Earth revolve within a millet grain Akṣobhya is put in the left palm and wondrous happiness shines in the right palm Given that the supernatural power is like this how could you face it Our Dharma King who has mastered the Way is benevolent He has scruples about easily attacking you temporarily stops all military forces and collects the reins of divine for the moment At the very moment to go to the front he had me send this letter to you hoping that you will order your deluded vehicles to aboutface Your gloried name will then shine within you and your freely moving body will sojourn in the external world Who else but you then could take an ofcial post of the celestial realm Wisdom is to clearly know a crucial point intelligence is to value avoiding calamities This is precisely the best time to turn misfortune into a blessing and a good opportunity to secure merit In ancient times when King Jie of the Xia dynasty was a tyrant King of the Yin dynasty subjugated him when King Zhou of the Shang dynasty was the principal of disorder King Wu of the Zhou dynasty took up arms against him These are exactly that were divined with stalks and tortoise shell and they serve as comprehensible lessons for generals  Even though you and I are against each other in these years our intellectual style in the sense of the Way should be the same Human and heavenly beings are uneasy and troubled but why is it worth causing a separation between us  Why I secretly feel sad about these words and yet still send a letter describing all this in full detail is that I do not wish to cause a fragrant orchid to wither in summer or cut its stalk until it is destroyed ie I do not want to cause you to come to ruin in the prime time of your life Deeply think about my statements Make a good consideration by yourself Do not cause yourself to fall into

kalpas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River Even if the two polarities ie Heaven and Earth were to fall down he can never be harmed If he is visited by a disastrous re he will not be not burned If he is immersed in a torrent he will not drown Someone who possesses profound literary knowledge is still unqualied to clarify the Way The enormity contains the whole world but this cannot describe his greatness His neness goes into innitesimal space between things but this cannot describe his minuteness His edication holds both the Originator and the Mother of all things He does nothing just for the sake of doing it yet there is nothing that he does not do He soars on the path of complying with mutation and saunters about in the world beyond existence and nonexistence He is peaceful in the state of nirvana The two vehicles conceal their thoughts in the tenor of emptiness as emptiness The Brahmā King sighs with praise and takes refuge in the virtue akradevānāmindra keeps in mind and detests being in the rank  went out of the ve realms of existence and rose just like a dragon He is prominent in the world beyond emperors His Way is the most powerful in the three realms of existence and his virtue covers the ten directions The areas near the capital are as numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges River and his capital city is the trichiliocosm He is at rest in the comfortable room of the nine kinds of meditation  ascends the lofty mansion of the seven factors of wisdom  washes in the clean pond of the eight kinds of meditation leading to liberation  and roams about in the spacious garden of dhāraṇī Thereafter he resides in the palace of benevolence places himself on the seat equal to emptiness wears the minor marks of physical excellence as his imperial ceremonial dress and has a topknot as his heavenly cap He appoints the one who belongs to Maitreya as Minister of the Left and a peer of Mañjuśrī as Minister of the Right Graceful hymns of Mahayana sutras are sung before him and the bells and whisks of the four methods of winning people over dance behind him He is guarded by ofcers who have mastered the contemplation for bodhisattvas of the eighth stage and he is attended by numerous eminent transcendents who have attained the four fruits Ofcials of the Three Communicating Agencies are all sages and the Six Tax Supervisors have only wise people Thereupon the Duke of Zhou and Confucius propagate the teaching Yao and Shun preside over  King Tang and King Wu elevate the great authority The Regional Governors are the Three Augusts When edication is accomplished the level thoroughfare of the eightfold holy path to enlightenment becomes evener the ferries of the three vehicles are opened to all directions the wonderful residences of wuwei are arranged severe suffering are liberated from delement the crooked paths of the three lowest realms of existence are closed off pleasure is opened to heavenly and human beings the stage of fruition is considered a b title of nobility and the meal of nectar is taken as ofcial pay Those who have great merit are rewarded with a ef of the Pure Land Those who have small merit are directed to the peace of the city created by supernatural powers  This is what goes beyond the great enterprises of all kings and the highest administration of the world of great peace The ve realms of existence are the pure Imperial court for government ofcials The four modes of birth are the culmination for those in the ofcers ranks They are pleased by familiar satisfaction just as that keep one another wet by tiny bubbles on the surface of water completely forget about distant rivers and lakes Therefore Devil King Pāpīyas planted the root of ignorance in himself at the very beginning accumulated delusions in his mind in the illusory world drifted on the turbulent waves of the three major evil passions and entered the dense forest of perverted views Consequently he has come to stealthily make sport of the sacred treasures avail himself of falsehood and profane the truth He boastfully reigns over the heavenly palace and divides the high mountains and lands  He issues a command to the six heavens of the realm of desire as he likes and indulges in the power of prejudice Internally he designates various poisons as the three dukes and the nine kinds of delement as ministers Externally he employs the six coverings greed breaking precepts anger indolence distraction and ignorance as his generals and the four kinds of delement delusion regarding the self the view that the self exists selfconceit and attachment to the self as soldiers Internally he rampantly acts in deance of authority he is not afraid of ordinances of the August  His light is as feeble as the glow of a rey yet he still competes with the sun for brightness Consequently he has recently challenged the divine authority and risen in arms against the bodhi tree He raises his voice just as Lord Thunder makes a sudden peal of thunder and he arranges people in a line just as Mount Khadiraka belches out re He has caused disorder in China for a long time The Sage King laments that confused people are deaf and blind  He is saddened by the fact that a young person who has lost his way grows more homesick He will unite numerous evil people in order to equalize their views and will assemble the nine heretical schools in order to cause them to get on board the same ferry Hereupon orders his followers who have great powers to be his generals and selects soldiers from among the vajra  these are men who eat gold and chew iron and people who can break up ice or walk through re Brave soldiers are as numerous as particles of dust and sand They move like a shooting star rise like a wind and prance like a dragon in the devils territory The corps is stationed according to a carefully thoughtout plan and press their enemies to the eld of inevitable death Nevertheless the devil rebels do not behave themselves prudently They oppose us by ignoring the order just as the states of Zong and Kuai did unfurl a commanding ag in the land of selfconceit and solidify delement on the steep mountain of a multitude of delusions The soldiers of delement alternately watch for just like jackals in a border region The generals of the six coverings walk just like tigers on a long thoroughfare When you gaze into the distance it looks just as it does when clouds rise and cover the sky and fog envelops the whole world The vigor of is a rare case since the creation of the world Skilled cavalry and foot soldiers surround a thousand or ten thousand times over Covering the battle eld the reserve forces are stationed at positions of strategic importance General Dāna in the front line watches the ag of parsimony and advances straight ahead General Vīrya in the rear pushes soldiers of indolence to the back Dhyāna captures the cavalry of sloth on the left īla defends against the soldiers of wickedness on the right Upāya of the outer army moves the cavalry to a steppe and causes the soldiers of frivolity to run swiftly to the point under crossexamination and submission We set up the dangerous machinery in hidden places Prajñā of the central army grasps the subtle mirror of the profound pivot handles the wonderful art of victory controls myriad powerful generals and possesses as many strong soldiers as there are particles of dust and sand Hereupon all our forces act in concert and vie with each other in advancing on myriad paths Their minds move the world and their voices shake Heaven and Earth The brightness of their drawn swords dazzles peoples eyes even more than sunshine The sound of the Dharma drums mixes with thunderclaps Swift elephants jump and run around The bow of meditation is like smoke going up or clouds rising The arrows of wisdom y like a shower and drift into the air wield the whip of provisional name and tread onto the steppe of doesnotexist  They burnish themselves through the lions roar ie the Buddhas exposition of the Dharma pierce with the sound that suffering is emptiness wield Ganjiang and cut the enemy solders to pieces and brandish spears and lances vying with each other to win victory We lay the corpses of delement down and cover the eld with them The blood of the delement runs just as a long river does We demolish the high and steep mountain of ignorance dry up the great stream of lust drive those who defy to the cave of various wrong views and crush impertinence in the nest of the seven kinds of selfconceit Thereupon even if the devil rebels can make their way they have lost the spirit to oppose Even though they try to retreat they have no hiding place where they hope to escape  They run about anxiously but there is nothing on which they can depend Devil King s hands are tied behind his back and he is brought before the military tribunal All heavenly beings arise just as lightning ashes and take refuge in edication Confused people come swiftly as the wind to receive their rst light of the sun ie the Buddhist teaching The power of the August wipes out just as the sun melts morning frost or the whole water of a great stream is poured to extinguish a bonre Therefore in the morning we cause the enemies who have absconded for myriad generations to collapse just like a landslide and purge the difculties from ancient times in China within a brief moment This is truly the wonderful achievement of the spiritual assembly by the holy August  and an excellent meritorious deed that is rare in the world Formerly King Tang of the Yin dynasty defeated King Jie of the Xia dynasty and established merit as great as a cloud in the outskirts of the Xia dynasty King Wu of the Zhou dynasty exterminated King Zhou of the Yin dynasty and cleansed the atmosphere in the pasture of the Shang dynasty How could it be possible to view as equal to the achievement of our Sage Thereupon I reverently propagate the Imperial plan and pacify those who adhere to for the rst time I content them with the house equal to emptiness ll them with the stream of the eight kinds of meditation leading to liberation  defend them from through the propriety of the precepts and the wholesome acts and cause them to follow the breeze of the six pāramitās Old people understand to follow the truth in a new song and young wanderers hear for the rst time the sound of Let me return  To be punished in accordance with Heavens decree is the way of the Spring and Autumn era To render a meritorious deed and suppress a rebellion are acts that are praised by former kings The profound breeze incites remote areas Those within the territory of our state have joy in their minds In the imperial court there is the song of  will be happily performed and outside the government there is the song of happy borders merits are high and his Way is great His sacred thoughts are deep and profound and they cannot be described in words I have briey itemized the Imperial authority and the methods of wonderful schemes Moreover I have displayed the vigorous power of our military Our courier who travels as fast as lightning goes quickly like a shooting star  We the vassals  sincerely humble ourselves and clap our hands in joy Having become free from giving sermons I again somehow prolong the day  I hope that those who are fond of the wrong way will return before they go too far A sutra says Nirvana is nonarising and yet there is nothing that is not brought into existence The most genuine intelligence is nonilluminating and yet there is nothing that is not illuminated Only the Tathāgata possesses both of these Victory is not won through the merit of shields and spears To invade territory is not achieved through a powerful army that is well known in the world An emperor or king is not esteemed just for being in that rank Regarding supreme rulers vassals not only those of Lord Huan or Lord Wen are noble The teaching of Confucius and the Duke of Zhou is far at this point The words of Laozi and Zhuangzi appear to be similar to but they are not equal to  Therefore we know that the foundation of truth exists beyond the views of the common people and that the most August is the king within the true mirror Middleclass people hesitate between existence and nonexistence The ignorant people of the lowest class are surprised and laugh in a state of permanent confusion I hope now that those who read this will abandon their conceit which is just like that of Hebo who was happy about the abundant water in the river in autumn showing that he had no knowledge that there is more water in the Northern Sea and that they will go to a distance and enjoy themselves at the profound gate of Ruo of the Northern Sea who ruled over vast expanses of water We should not bind our minds with the familiar teaching or frighten our spirit with absurd doctrines This is the case when a person has not cultivated the body has not cultivated virtue has not cultivated the mind has not cultivated wisdom and his life span is very short This is the case of a person who having done an unwholesome action must experience suffering as its fruit by hell as a result Again there is a person who has done an unwholesome action and must experience suffering as its fruit by the result in this life Why must a person who has done an unwholesome action experience suffering as its fruit by the result in this life This is the case when a person has cultivated the body has cultivated virtue has cultivated the mind has cultivated wisdom and his life span is very long This is the case of a person who having done an unwholesome action must experience suffering as its fruit by the result in this life It is just as when a person owes another person a hundred coins yet is not arrested by the creditor and would not be arrested by him even for owing a thousand or ten thousand coins Why is it that a person who owes another person a hundred coins is not arrested by the creditor and would not be arrested by him even for owing a thousand or ten thousand coins This is the case when the debtor has property beyond measure and is extremely powerful and because of that despite owing a another person a hundred coins is not arrested by the creditor and would not be arrested by him even for owing a thousand or ten thousand coins This is the case of a person who owes another person a hundred coins yet is not arrested by the creditor and would not be arrested by him even for owing a thousand or ten thousand coins It is the same with a person who has done an unwholesome action he must experience suffering as its fruit by the result in this life Why is it that a person who has done an unwholesome action must experience suffering as its fruit by the result in this life This is the case when a person has cultivated the body has cultivated virtue has cultivated the mind has cultivated wisdom and his life span is very long This is the case of a person who having done an unwholesome action must experience suffering as its fruit by the result in this life He experiences the result for wholesome and unwholesome actions in this life and only to a moderate degree This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse to Vappa  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Nigrodha Park At that time after the midday meal Venerable Mahā Moggallāna was sitting in the assembly hall together with a company of monks for some purpose Then a Sakyan by the name of Vappa a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas wandering around after noon approached Venerable Mahā Moggallāna and after exchanging greetings sat down to one side Then Venerable Mahā Moggallāna asked about this matter What do you think Vappa If a monk is restrained in body speech and mind do you see any possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might arise leading to future existence Vappa replied Mahā Moggallāna if a monk is restrained in body speech and mind I do see a possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might  arise leading to future existence Mahā Moggallāna if someone has done unwholesome actions in a previous existence then owing to that unwholesome taints will arise leading to future existence after this the Worldhonored One who was meditating in a solitary place heard with the purified divine ear which surpasses that of human beings the conversation between Venerable Mahā Moggallāna and Vappa the Sakyan a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas Hearing it the Worldhonored One rose from his afternoon meditation went toward the assembly hall and sat down on a prepared seat in front of the assembly of monks Having sat down the Worldhonored One asked Moggallāna what matter were you discussing with Vappa the Sakyan a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas For what matter were you sitting together in the assembly hall Venerable Mahā Moggallāna replied Worldhonored One today after the midday meal I was sitting in the assembly hall together with a company of monks for some purpose Then Vappa the Sakyan a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas wandering around after noon approached me and after exchanging greetings sat down to one side I asked him this What do you think Vappa If a monk is restrained in body speech and mind do you see a possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might arise leading to future existence Then Vappa the Sakyan a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas replied If a monk is restrained in body speech and mind I do see a possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might arise leading to future existence Mahā Moggallāna if someone has done unwholesome actions in a previous existence then owing to that unwholesome taints will arise leading to future existence Worldhonored One that was the discussion I was having with Vappa the Sakyan a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas Because of this matter we were sitting together in the assembly hall Then the Worldhonored One said to Vappa the Sakyan a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas bIf you agree with what I say you should say yes if you disagree you should say no and if you have any uncertainty you should ask me further thus Renunciant Gotama how is this What is the meaning of this If you can accept what I have just proposed I could discuss this matter with you Vappa replied Renunciant Gotama if I agree with what you say I will say yes if I disagree I will say no and if I have any uncertainty I will ask you further thus Renunciant Gotama how is this What is the meaning of this As the renunciant Gotama has just proposed I accept it May the renunciant Gotama discuss this matter with me The Worldhonored One asked What do you think Vappa Suppose that a monk has given rise to unwholesome bodily activities  taints vexation and worry that at a later time he ceases unwholesome bodily activities Creating no new karma and having abandoned old karma he in this very life attains the goal and free from vexation remains permanently and unchangingly  which is spoken of as something to be seen by noble wisdom and to be known by noble wisdom he gave rise to unwholesome verbal activities  unwholesome mental activities  unwholesome activities based on ignorance that at a later time he ceases unwholesome activities based on ignorance Creating no new karma and having abandoned old karma he in this very life attains the goal and free from vexation remains permanently and unchangingly  which is spoken of as something to be seen by noble wisdom and to be known by noble wisdom What do you think Vappa For a monk who is restrained in body speech and mind in this way do you see a possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might arise leading to future existence c Vappa replied  Gotama if a monk is restrained in body speech and mind in this way I see no possible cause owing to which unwholesome taints might arise leading to future existence The Worldhonored One praised him saying Very good Vappa Why is that Vappa If in a monk ignorance has been extinguished and knowledge has arisen then with ignorance extinguished and knowledge arisen when there arises the feeling of the body nearing its end he knows that there has arisen the feeling of the body nearing its end When there arises the feeling of life nearing its end he knows that there has arisen the feeling of life nearing its end And when the body breaks up and life ends the life span having expired then all that is felt in this life will be exhausted and come to an end It should be understood that it will end and become cold Vappa it is just like a shadow that exists in dependence on a tree Suppose that someone comes with a sharp axe and chops down the tree at its root cuts it into pieces then breaks into ten or a hundred fragments burns them in a fire so that they become ash which is then blown away by a strong wind or carried away by water What do you think Vappa That shadow existed in dependence on the tree so once the cause of the shadow has been cut off will the shadow disappear and not arise again Vappa replied Indeed Gotama Vappa it should be understood in the same way in the case of a monk in whom ignorance has been extinguished and knowledge has arisen With ignorance extinguished and knowledge arisen when there arises the feeling of the body nearing its end he knows that there has arisen the feeling of the body nearing its end When there arises the feeling of life nearing its end he knows that there has arisen the feeling of life nearing its end And when the body breaks up and life ends the life span having expired then all that is felt in this life will be exhausted and come to an end It should be understood that it will end and become cold  Vappa a monk whose mind has been rightly liberated like this attains six wholesome abodes What are the six Vappa on seeing a form with the eye a monk is neither pleased nor displeased he remains equanimous and unaffected with right mindfulness and right attentiveness Vappa a monk whose mind has been rightly liberated like this attains the first wholesome abode Similarly the ear  the nose  the tongue  the body  on cognizing a mental phenomenon with the mind he is neither pleased nor displeased he remains equanimous and unaffected with right mindfulness and right attentiveness Vappa a monk whose mind has been rightly liberated like this attains the sixth wholesome abode Vappa a monk whose mind has been rightly liberated like this attains these six wholesome abodes Vappa replied Indeed Gotama A learned noble disciple whose mind has been rightly liberated like this attains six wholesome abodes What are the six Gotama a learned noble disciple on seeing a form with the eye is neither pleased nor displeased he remains equanimous and unaffected with right mindfulness and right attentiveness Gotama this is the first wholesome abode for a noble disciple who has learned much and whose mind has been rightly liberated Similarly the ear  the nose  the tongue  the body  on cognizing a mental phenomenon with the mind he is neither pleased nor displeased he remains equanimous and unaffected with right mindfulness and right attentiveness Indeed Gotama a learned noble disciple whose mind has been rightly liberated like this attains the sixth wholesome abode Indeed Gotama a learned noble disciple whose mind has been rightly liberated like this attains these six wholesome abodes a Thereupon Vappa said to the Worldhonored One Gotama I have known it Wellgone One I have understood it Gotama  it is just as when someone with clear vision uncovers what was covered exposes what was covered or shows the way to one who was lost or offers a light in the darkness so that those with eyes can see forms In the same way the renunciant Gotama has taught me the Dharma using countless skillful means to reveal its meaning in various ways Worldhonored One I now go for refuge to the Buddha the Dharma and the community of monks  May the Worldhonored One accept me as a lay follower From this day forth until life ends I go for refuge Worldhonored One just as a person who raises a bad horse expecting to get benefit from it only tires himself and gets no benefitWorldhonored One I was like this Those foolish Nigaṇṭhas lack right knowledge they are unable to understand and know Not recognizing the fertile field  and not examining for myself revered them for a long time made offerings and paid them homage expecting to get benefit from it but I only suffered in vain Worldhonored One for a second time I now go for refuge to the Buddha the Dharma and the community of monks May the Worldhonored One accept me as a lay follower From this day forth until life ends I go for refuge Worldhonored One formerly I was ignorant Whatever faith and respect I had for those foolish Nigaṇṭhas has today been cut off Because I was deceived Worldhonored One for a third time I now go for refuge to the Buddha the Dharma and the community of monks May the Worldhonored One accept me as a lay follower From this day forth until life ends I go for refuge This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the Sakyan Vappa and the monks were delighted and remembered them well   The Discourse on Transcended  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Park At that time the Worldhonored One said to the monks  There are three tenets to be transcended of different affiliation different appellation different school and different doctrine that despite being well accepted firmly held and declared to others by socalled wise men are not beneficial What are these three There are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare All that a person does is caused by what was done in previous lives Again there are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare All that a person does is caused and created by a supreme divine being Again there are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare All that a person does is without any cause or condition Herein if there are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare All that a person does is caused by what was done in previous lives then I approach them and having approached them I ask b Venerable friends is it true that you hold this view and declare All that a person does is caused by what was done in previous lives They reply Yes Then I say to them If that is so venerable friends then you all endorse killing living beings Why is that Because all is caused by what was done in previous lives In the same way venerable friends you endorse taking what is not given sexual misconduct false speech   wrong views Why is that Because all of that is caused by what was done in previous lives Venerable friends if the view that all is caused by what was done in previous lives were true then it would follow logically that all that one does or does not takes place without desire without effort Venerable friends if in doing a deed or not doing it a person lacks true understanding then he has lost right mindfulness and lacks right attentiveness and hence is unteachable If renunciants proclaim such a teaching then those renunciants and brahmins can be refuted by such reasoning  Herein if there are renunciants and brahmins who hold this view and declare All that a person does is caused and created by a supreme divine being then I approach them and having approached I ask Venerable friends is it true that you hold this view and declare All that a person does is caused and created by a supreme divine being They reply Yes Then I say to them If that is so venerable friends then you all endorse killing living beings Why is that Because all is caused and created by a supreme divine being In the same way venerable friends you endorse taking what is not given sexual misconduct false

without effort Venerable friends if in doing a deed or not doing it a person lacks true understanding then he has lost right mindfulness and lacks right attentiveness and hence is unteachable If renunciants proclaim such a teaching then those renunciants and brahmins can be refuted by such reasoning The Dharma I teach to you which I have known and realized by myself cannot be refuted cannot be defiled and cannot be prevailed over by any renunciant brahmin gods Māras Brahmās or anyone else in the world Why can the Dharma I teach to you which I have known and realized by myself not be refuted defiled or prevailed over by any renunciant brahmin gods Māras Brahmās or anyone else in the world There is the teaching on the six sense bases which having known and realized it by myself I have taught to you it cannot be refuted cannot be defiled and cannot be prevailed over by any renunciant brahmin gods Māras Brahmās or anyone else in the world Again there is the teaching on the six elements which having known and realized it by myself I have taught to you it cannot be refuted cannot be defiled and cannot be prevailed over by any renunciant brahmin gods Māras Brahmās or anyone else in the world What is the teaching on the six sense bases which having known and realized it by myself I have taught to you are the eye sense base the ear  nose  tongue  body  the mind sense base This is the teaching on the six sense bases which having known and realized it by myself I have taught to you What is the teaching on the six elements which having known and realized it by myself I have taught to you are the elements of earth  water  fire  air  space  and the element of consciousness This is the teaching on the six elements which having known and realized it by myself I have taught to you Because of the combination of the six elements there is rebirth from a mothers womb because of the six elements there are the six sense bases because of the six sense bases there is contact and because  of contact there is feeling Monks one who has feeling will know suffering as it really is know the arising of suffering know the cessation of suffering and know the path to the cessation of the suffering as it really is What is knowing suffering as it really is It is this birth is suffering old age is suffering disease is suffering death is suffering association with what is disliked is suffering dissociation from what is liked is suffering not getting what one wants is suffering in brief the five aggregates of clinging are sufferingthis is called knowing suffering as it really is What is knowing the arising of suffering as it really is It is craving for and clinging to future existence with delight and desire seeking after this and that existencethis is called knowing the arising of suffering as it really is What is knowing the cessation of suffering as it really is It is the cutting off without remainder abandoning disgorging fading away cessation stopping and disappearance of this craving for and clinging to future existence with delight and desire seeking after this and that existencethis is called knowing the cessation of suffering as it really is What is knowing the path to the cessation of suffering as it really is It is the noble eightfold path right view  right concentration these eightthis is called knowing the path to the cessation of suffering as it really is Monks you should know suffering as it really is you should cut off the arising of suffering you should realize the cessation of suffering and you should cultivate the path to the cessation of suffering If a monk knows suffering as it really is cuts off the arising of suffering realizes the cessation of suffering and cultivates the path to the cessation of suffering then that monk having abandoning all taints having loosened all fetters is able through right attentiveness to attain the end of suffering This is what the Buddha said Having heard the Buddhas words the monks were delighted and remembered them well a   The Discourse to Rāhula  Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary At that time Venerable Rāhula was also staying at Rājagaha in the Hot Spring Grove Then the Worldhonored One when the night was over at dawn having put on his robes and taken his almsbowl went into Rājagaha to beg for food Having finished begging for food he went to the Hot Spring Grove the place where the venerable Rāhula was staying When Venerable Rāhula saw the Buddha coming in the distance he forthwith went to greet him took the Buddhas robe and bowl made a seat ready and set out water for washing feet The Buddha having washed his feet sat down on the seat prepared by Rāhula Then the Worldhonored One took the water vessel and having poured out the water until only a little was left asked Rāhula did you see me taking this water vessel and pouring out the water until only a little was left Rāhula replied Yes I saw it Worldhonored One The Buddha told Rāhula In the same way the practice of those who knowingly speak falsehood without embarrassment or regret without shame or scruple is of little  I say Rāhula there is no evil they would not do Even in jest I shall not speak falsehood The Worldhonored One again took the water vessel containing a little water and having completely discarded the water asked Rāhula now again did you see me take this water vessel containing a little water and completely discard the water Rāhula replied Yes I saw it Worldhonored One The Buddha told Rāhula In the same way the practice of those who knowingly speak falsehood without embarrassment or regret without shame or scruple is completely discarded I say Rāhula there is no evil they would not do Even in jest I shall not speak falsehoodb The Worldhonored One again took the empty water vessel tipped it over on the ground and asked Rāhula now again did you see me take the empty water vessel and tip it over on the ground Rāhula replied Yes I saw it Worldhonored One The Buddha told Rāhula In the same way the practice of those who knowingly speak falsehood without embarrassment or regret without shame or scruple is tipped over I say Rāhula there is no evil they would not do Even in jest I shall not speak falsehood The Worldhonored One again took the tipped water vessel and having turned it bottom up asked Rāhula did you see me again take the toppled water vessel and turn it bottom up Rāhula replied Yes I saw it Worldhonored One The Buddha told Rāhula In the same way the practice of those who knowingly speak falsehood without embarrassment or regret without shame or scruple is turned bottom up I say Rāhula there is no evil they would not do Therefore Rāhula you should train yourself like this Even in jest I shall not speak falsehood Rāhula it is just as if a king had a great elephant who when going into battle uses his forefeet his hindfeet his tail shoulders back flanks neck head ears and tusks everything except his trunk which he keeps protected Seeing this the elephant trainer would think in this way The kings great elephant still cherishes his life Why so Because when going into battle the kings great elephant uses his forefeet his hindfeet his tail shoulders back flanks neck head ears and tuskseverything except his trunk which he keeps protected Rāhula if when going into battle the kings great elephant uses his forefeet his hindfeet his tail shoulders back flanks neck head ears tusks and also his trunkif he uses everythingthen on seeing this the elephant trainer would think in this way  The kings elephant no longer cherishes his life Why so Because when going into battle the kings great elephant uses his forefeet his hindfeet his tail shoulders back flanks neck head ears tusks and also his trunk he uses everything Rāhula if the kings great elephant when going into battle uses his forefeet his hindfeet his tail shoulders back flanks neck head ears tusks and also his trunkif he uses everythingthen Rāhula I say that when going into battle there is no evil that the kings great elephant would not do So too Rāhula those who knowingly speak falsehood without embarrassment or regret without shame or scruple Rāhula I say that there is no evil they would not do Therefore Rāhula you should train yourself like this Even in jest I shall not speak falsehood Then the Worldhonored One uttered the following verses He who transgresses this one law Against speaking falsehood Not fearing the next world There is no evil he would not do Better to swallow an iron ball Burning hot like fire Than to transgress the precepts While accepting the offerings of the faithful c If you fear suffering Not even wishing to think of it Whether secretly or openly Perform no evil deed An unwholesome deed Already done or being done Can never be escaped One cannot hide from  Having uttered these verses the Buddha asked Rāhula further What do you think Rāhula For what purpose do people use a mirror  Venerable Rāhula replied Worldhonored One they wish to examine their face to see if it is clean or not Similarly Rāhula if you are about to perform a bodily action then examine that bodily action I am about to perform a bodily action Is this bodily action pure or impure Am I doing it for myself or for another Rāhula if on examining it you know I am about to perform a bodily action and that bodily action is impure either for myself or for another it is unwholesome has suffering as its fruit and will result in the experience of sufferingthen
