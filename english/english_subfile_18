Stress is a term adopted from engineering science by psychology and medicine
Simply defined stress in engineering means force upon an area
As so many forces are working upon us in the modern age and we find it extremely difficult to cope under so much pressure stress is called the disease of civilization Philip Zimbardo in his Psychology and Life traces four interrelated levels at which we react to the pressures exerted upon us from our environment
The four are the emotional level the behavioral level the physiological level and the cognitive level
the emotional responses to stress are sadness depression anger irritation and frustration
The behavioral responses are poor concentration forgetfulness poor interpersonal relations and lowered productivity
The physiological responses consist of bodily tensions which may lead to headaches backaches stomach ulcers high blood pressure and even killer diseases
At the cognitive level one may lose selfesteem and selfconfidence which leads to feelings of helplessness and hopelessness
At worst such a person may even end up committing suicide
In order to understand stress let us consider the various environmental factors which exert pressure on modern man
In this atomic age the very survival of the species is threatened
Nuclear war threatens every single human being on earth irrespective of whether one lives in a country with nuclear weapons or not
Population explosion threatens man with severe food shortages at present even a large segment of human population is undernourished while still others are dying of starvation and malnutrition
Environmental pollution causes severe health hazards and mental and physical retardation
Unemployment among the skilled is a growing global problem
The pace of life has become so hectic that man is simply rushing from one task to another without any relaxation
This is really paradoxical in an age when laborsaving devices are freely available and are in use to an unprecedented degree
Competition for educational and employment opportunities is so severe that it has contributed to a fair share to increase the rate of suicide
Enjoyment of sense pleasures has grown so obsessive that it has become like drinking salt water to quench thirst
Constant stimulation of the senses is today considered a necessity and thus pocket radios with earphones chewing gum and cosmetics are marketed everywhere
Sense stimulation goes on unrestrained but satiation is far from achieved
It is no wonder that man caught up in all this is terribly confused and frustrated and his life is intolerably stressful
This is the situation Buddhism describes as tangles within and tangles without people are enmeshed in tangles
While the above observations were made from the point of view of modern studies and contemporary conditions Buddhism makes similar observations from a psychological perspective
Man experiences stress and suffering because of five psychological states which envelop his whole personality
They are called nivarana in the Pali language meaning hindrances
They hinder happiness and overcloud man's vision of himself his environment and the interaction between the two
The thicker and more opaque these hindrances the greater the stress and suffering man experiences
The thinner and more sparse these hindrances the less his suffering with a corresponding increase in happiness
These five hindrances are the desire for sensual pleasures anger indolence worry and doubt
The Pali canon illustrates the effect of these hindrances with the help of five eloquent similes
The mind overpowered by the desire for sense pleasures is compared to colored water which prevents a true reflection of a thing on the water
Thus a man obsessed with the desire for sense pleasures is unable to get a true perspective of either himself or other people or his environment
The mind oppressed by anger is compared to boiling water which cannot give an accurate reflection
A man overpowered by anger is unable to discern an issue properly
When the mind is in the grip of indolence it is like moss covered water light cannot even reach the water and a reflection is impossible
The lazy man does not even make an effort at correct understanding
When worried the mind is like windtossed turbulent water which also fails to give a true reflection
The worried man forever restless is unable to make a proper assessment of an issue
When the mind is in doubt it is compared to muddy water placed in darkness which cannot reflect an image well
Thus all the five hindrances deprive the mind of understanding and happiness and cause much stress and suffering
Buddhism puts forward a methodical plan of action for the gradual elimination of stress and the increase of happiness and understanding
The first step recommended in this plan is the observance of the Five Precepts comprising the abstention from killing stealing illicit sex falsehood and intoxicants
Stress is greatly enhanced by guilt and these precepts help man to free his conscience of the sense of guilt
The Dhammapada says the evildoer suffers here and hereafter on the other hand the man who does good deeds rejoices here and hereafter
Buddhism firmly believes that evil increases stress while good increases happiness
In addition to the observance of the Five Precepts throughout life Buddhism advocates the periodical observance of the Eight Precepts by laymen
These additional precepts attempt to train man for leading a simple life catering to one's needs rather than one's greeds
A frugal mode of life where wants are few and are easily satisfied is highly extolled in Buddhism
It is the avaricious and the acquisitive mentality that is responsible for so much stress that we experience
The next step in the process of training is the control of the sense faculties
When our sense faculties are uncontrolled we experience severe strain
We have to first understand what is meant by being uncontrolled in the sense faculties
When a person sees a beautiful form with his eyes he gets attracted to it when he sees an unpleasant object he gets repelled by it
Similarly with the other senses too
Thus the person who has no control over his senses is constantly attracted and repelled by sense data as during waking life sense data keep on impinging on his sense faculties constantly
When pulled in different directions by sense stimuli we become confused and distressed
Our sense faculties have different spheres of activity and different objects and as each sense faculty is a lord in its own sphere and as they can severally and collectively dominate man they are called in Pali indriyas meaning lords or masters If we allow the sense faculties to dominate us we get terribly confused
If we assert ourselves and control our sense faculties we can have unalloyed pleasure so called because this pleasure is uncontaminated by defilements
It is also called adhicittasukha meaning spiritual pleasure
Whereas sense pleasures increase stress this type of spiritual pleasure reduces stressfulness and increases peace of mind and contentment
The third step in the management of stress is the cultivation of wholesome mental habits through meditation
Just as we look after and nurture our body with proper food and cleanliness the mind too needs proper nourishment and cleansing
The mind is most volatile in its untrained state but when it is tamed and made more stable it brings great happiness
Buddhism prescribes two fundamental meditative methods of mindtraining called samatha and vipassana calm and insight
The former is the method of calming the volatile mind while the latter is the method of comprehending the true nature of bodily and mental phenomena
Both methods are extremely helpful for overcoming stress
The Samaññaphala Sutta explains with the help of five appropriate similes how meditation reduces the psychological stress caused by the five hindrances
The man who practices meditation gains a great sense of relief and it is this sense of unburdening oneself that the similes illustrate
They are as follows A man who has raised capital for a business by taking a loan prospers in business pays off the loan and manages his daytoday affairs with financial ease
Such a man experiences a great sense of relief
The second simile portrays a man who has suffered a great deal with a prolonged chronic illness
He gets well at long last food becomes palatable to him and he gains physical strength
Great is the relief such a man experiences
The third simile speaks of the relief a prisoner enjoys after being released from a long term in jail
The fourth is the slave who gains freedom from slavery
The fifth simile speaks of a welltodo man who gets lost in a fearful desert without food
On coming to a place of safety he experiences great relief
When the stress caused by the five hindrances is eliminated from the mind great joy and delight arise similar to the relief enjoyed by the men described in the similes
The best and most effective way of overcoming stress is the practice of meditation or mental culture
But as a prelude to that at least the Five Precepts must be observed
The cultivation of positive emotions such as lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity is another means of conquering stress
Strained interpersonal relations is one of the common causes of stress in household life and in the workplace
Loving kindness is the positive wholesome attitude one can cultivate with benefit for oneself and others in all interpersonal relationships
Compassion is the emotion with which one should regard and help those in distress
Sympathetic joy is the ability to rejoice in the joy of another
It is difficult for a man of mean character to entertain this attitude as the joy of another brings jealousy to the mind of such a person
Where there is jealousy there is no unity and where there is no unity there is no progress
The cultivation of these positive emotions stands for both material and spiritual progress
Equanimity is the attitude to be adopted in the face of the vicissitudes of life
There are eight natural ways of the world that we have to face in life
They are gain and loss fame and lack of fame praise and blame happiness and sorrow
If one trains oneself to maintain an equanimous temperament without being either elated or dejected in the face of these vicissitudes one can avoid much stress and lead a simple life with peace and contentment
We cannot change the world so that it will give us happiness
But we can change our attitude towards the world so as to remain unaffected by the stresses exerted by events around us
Buddhism teaches the way to bring about this wholesome change of attitude
The world today has evolved various means of bestowing honor on individuals whom society recognizes as worthy of being honored
The Nobel Prize is considered one of the most prestigious and there are various other prizes and honorific titles that are bestowed annually or from time to time on distinguished persons
In the scholarly world the publication of felicitation and commemoration volumes and the conferment of honorary degrees are the usual methods of honoring academic celebrities
In society at large we indulge in various devices in the public display of honor and appreciation
Often we resort to overtly egoboosting methods
As the public display of honor and esteem has become such an important phenomena in our social life given much publicity over all the media  the press radio and television  it is timely to pause to understand the Buddhist attitude towards the display and acceptance of such public honor
The Pali canon uses terms such as labha sakkara siloka puja and vandana to mean various expressions of honor esteem and reverence
According to Buddhism the presence of ethical and spiritual qualities is the primary criterion for eligibility for honor
The Buddha the Paccekabuddha the arahant and the universal monarch rank as the highest personages who are worthy of honor and respect
Honor paid to those worthy of honor is listed as a great blessing in the Mahamangala Sutta
The Dhammapada declares that honor paid to a perfected saint is far better than a century spent in the performance of sacrifice
The same text reiterates that the merit of one who reverences those worthy of honor cannot be measured
In the domestic sphere parents are greatly honored and esteemed
As they have done so much for the children toiling through a whole lifetime they deserve to be appreciated honored and looked after by the children
There should be mutual honor and respect between husband and wife
This quality helps to weave a cohesive relationship to build a happy home for the rearing of progeny
It is also a healthy ageold custom to honor and welcome guests as is for instance maintained in the Canki Sutta
Respect shown to elders is also highly commended as is well illustrated by the parable of the Tittira Jataka
Thus noble spiritual qualities parentage and seniority are recognized as some of the main criteria deserving the display of honor and respect
Now let us turn our attention to the attitude to gain and honor by those who receive them
Since the Buddha's immediate disciples were monks who by reason of their religious status regularly received gains and honor from the laity it is to be expected that his statements on this subject are addressed primarily to the monks and their concerns
Moreover as the monks have committed themselves fully to the quest for deliverance the Buddha's advice to them naturally takes their special vocation into account
However while recognizing the differences in their position lay people can take the Buddha's counsel to the monks as guidelines for their own attitudes towards gain and honor
The Pali texts show that it is possible to adopt one of the following three attitudes One could eagerly appreciate and enjoy the honor one receives even actively seek it
One could turn away and refuse to accept the honor bestowed
One could be indifferent and entertain an attitude of equanimity towards such honors
We shall take these one by one for discussion
The Mahasaropama Sutta elucidates the appreciative attitude to gain and honor with the help of a simile
If a monk who has entered the Order enjoys the gain and honor he receives and is satisfied therewith he is like a man who being in search of timber is satisfied with the end trimmings of a huge tree
What he looked for is timber but what he is satisfied with is just twigs and foliage
Devadatta is the classic example of one who fell into utter ruin by enjoying gain and honor
He had developed psychic powers and he utilized these powers for convincing laymen of his spiritual development
The most influential layman who was thus convinced was Ajatasattu
The unconcealed display of superhuman powers gave rise to much gain and honor for Devadatta so much so that in his utter stupidity he wished to kill the Buddha and usurp Buddhahood and he enticed Ajatasattu to kill his father and usurp the kingship
The Buddha pronounced that it is for Devadatta's utter ruin and downfall that he was endowed with so much gain and honor just as the plantain tree beats fruit for its own ruin
The Dhammapada maintains that gain and honor is one thing and the path to the realization of Nibbana is another
Knowing this clearly a monk should not take delight in gain and honor
According to the Milindapanha just as a ship has to withstand various forces such as the force of strong currents thunder and whirlpools even so a monk has to withstand the forces of gain honor fame and homage
If a monk relishes these and gets a bloated ego he flounders and sinks just like a wrecked ship
The Milindapanha takes another simile from naval experience
A ship's anchor is able to hold a ship fast without letting it drift along even in very deep waters even so a monk must remain anchored to his purpose with great strength of character without letting the gain and honor that comes in the wake of virtue carry him adrift
It is no doubt the duty of the layman to honor and respect a virtuous monk and also to provide him with the requisites
It is the responsibility of the monk to maintain a sane balanced attitude without becoming elated
Buddhism maintains that it is difficult for a man of mean spiritual development to resist the enjoyment of gain and honor
There is the great danger of spiritual erosion when a man indulges and basks in the glory of fame and honor
One develops a bloated ego and boastfulness creeps into his character in the most surreptitious ways
Such men also develop contemptuous attitudes towards others who do not get so much honor
The Labhasakkara Samyutta sarcastically compares him to the dung beetle who entertains contempt towards other dung beetles for having less dung
The Anangana Sutta shows the abhorrence and disgust towards a monk who undertakes the religious life and difficult ascetic practices for the sake of public generosity and popularity
Such a monk is compared to one who places the carcass of a snake or a dog in a beautifully polished brand new metal bowl
The bowl of higher life is not meant for storing carcasslike immoral intentions
Monks are advised in the most emphatic terms to guard against taking delight in gain and honor
The Labhasakkara Samyutta works out a number of similes in great detail to illustrate the point
A young tortoise who defied the elders' advice is shot with a splinter to which a string is attached and he is bound to be caught by the hunter in no time
The hunter in the simile is none other than Mara himself
The splinter is gain honor and fame
The string attached to the splinter is the monk's attachment to gain and honor
Again gain and honor are compared to a bait which greedy monks might swallow to be utterly ruined in the hands of the trapper Mara
Now let us turn to the attitude of the monk who refuses gain and honor
Mahakassapa was an eminent monk who eschewed gain and honor and found delight in helping the poor to earn merit by going to them for alms
Once the Buddha saw him begging his alms in a locality where povertystricken weavers lived in spite of gods trying to procure for him a fine meal
On this occasion the Buddha gave expression to an inspired utterance in appreciation of Mahakassapa's simplicity
Once a famous householder named Citta was impressed by the explanation of a knotty doctrinal point by a monk named Isidatta in a great assembly
Citta invited Isidatta to reside in the locality and promised him hospitality with all requisites
Isidatta seized the first opportunity to quietly leave the locality without informing Citta
Such was the scrupulous reticent behavior of those who understood the pernicious nature of gain and honor
Generally the Buddha and arahants do not fight shy of gain and honor
They face it with the same equanimity as they face loss and blame
The MahaGovinda Sutta records that gods rejoice in the Buddha because of his attitude to gain and honor
The Buddha has received gain and fame which a king would long to have but with no trace of elation whatsoever he fares along partaking of only the basic requisites
The gods declare that there was never a teacher of such calibre before
The lotus though born in the water remains unsullied above the water
Similarly the buddha and arahants rise uncontaminated above the mundane conditions of family prestige gain fame and reverence
The Unique Ones are worshipped by gods and men
But they relish no honor
This is the norm of Buddhas
Cullasabhadda an upasika observes that while the world is elated and depressed by gain and loss respectively the true monks maintain an equanimous attitude in the face of both
Buddha declares that he has personally known seen and understood that beings who have been overwhelmed by gain and honor and also those who are obsessed by the lack of gain and honor at the disintegration of the body are born in states of woe
The desire for honor and recognition is so insinuative that even normally upright individuals can succumb to it
The Buddha says that there are some who would not stoop so low as to tell a deliberate lie for the sake of silver and gold a beauty queen parents children or even life but who would do so to gain honor and prestige
So vicious and pernicious are the snares of gain and honor
Except arahants those of the highest order who have reached the state of akuppa cetovimutti or unshakable mental emancipation all those of lesser spiritual development are said to be vulnerable in this respect
It is no wonder that gain and honor is a powerful member of the army of Mara
It should be recognized by all those who value spiritual progress as a disaster come in the guise of a blessing
Right livelihood is the fifth factor in the Noble Eightfold Path
As a method of earning one's living is important to every human being whether a member of the clergy or a layman the correct understanding of right livelihood is crucial
For a monk complete dedication to the higher life constitutes right livelihood
He then is rightly entitled to be supported by public generosity
In this essay we shall confine ourselves to an inquiry into the concept of right livelihood for the layman
Right livelihood implies that one has to avoid a wrong means of earning a living known as miccha ajiva in Pali
This includes trades which are directly or indirectly injurious to others be they animal or human such as trade in meat liquor poison weapons and slaves
These are contrary to the basic five precepts which all lay Buddhists are expected to abide by
In the world today these trades except perhaps the slave trade are flourishing industries and much of the revenue to governments comes from these industries
This shows to what an extent wrong livelihood is prevalent in the world today
Even a blameless means of living can become blameworthy if practiced with inordinate greed and dishonesty
If a doctor in private practice makes mints of money exploiting his patients he is guilty of wrong livelihood even though medicine itself is a noble profession
A vegetable dealer who cheats in weights and measures is similarly guilty of wrong livelihood
Honest scrupulous service rendered without exploiting the public is considered an essential feature of right livelihood
Buddhism upholds the quality of having few wants and the ability to be satisfied with little as great virtues
One has to practice these virtues not only in consumerism but in production too in the modern world however these virtues have been totally lost sight of in both these spheres
Therefore governments as well as the private sector aim at ever increasing development
Such development however has no limit
Each time a target has been reached the limit to possible growth recedes further like a mirage
More and more is produced more and more is consumed
There is no satiation with development nor with consumerism
This is a limitless race in a limited world with limited resources
Therefore mankind has to learn that the concept of development as it is understood today cannot go on forever it is logically and practically impossible
Nature seems to set its own limits to this process of escalated growth
It appears that there are biological psychological social and ecological limits to growth
The physical constitution of man seems to revolt against this limitless growth
There is an array of diseases man readily succumbs to today related to overconsumption and overindulgence
There are pressurerelated diseases too which affect both the human body and the human mind
Presentday development taxes man's endurance enormously and he becomes a psychological wreck due to the pressures of work competition and maintaining standards
Interpersonal relationships have become superficial brittle and sour and this seems to be a sign that society cannot withstand the weight of its material development
In the external world too there are unequivocal signs which portend impending catastrophe unless man changes his course of action
There is air water and land pollution everywhere and this is extremely injurious not only to human life but to all forms of life in this planet
These are nature's ways of expressing her disapproval of the methods and rate of production and consumption man has chosen today
Agriculture is recognized in Buddhism as a noble means of making a living but what has happened in this sphere
Prompted by population pressures and encouraged by the everexpanding vistas of scientific knowledge traditional methods of tilling the land have given way to mechanized industrial agriculture
Vast acres are plowed by machines chemical fertilizers are applied freely weedicides insecticides and pesticides are used indiscriminately and large harvests are gathered
More and more research is going on in agricultural engineering to produce better seeds which promise higher yields
Though production has increased prices remain at a constant high level
In some countries when the price level threatens to go down due to overproduction the products are methodically destroyed or dumped into the sea despite the fact that large masses of people in the world today are undernourished and some are actually starving to death
It is blatantly clear that the whole industrialized agricultural policy is prompted by inordinate greed and it is far from right livelihood
From the Buddhist point of view this whole system is wrong
On the one hand it has resulted in the erosion of moral and human values
It has deprived man of sympathy for his fellow sentient beings as is evident from the largescale use of insecticides
Economic gain seems to be the only criterion by which man is prompted to action
Blinded by shortterm economic gain man seems to turn a blind eye to the longterm repercussions of his aggressive policies on this planet
In the wake of the avaricious and aggressive industrialization the crime rate has risen to an unprecedented degree and this is a clear index to man's moral degeneration
On the other hand the natural ecological balance of the earth has been disturbed to an alarming degree
Chemical pollution of land and water has affected bacteria insects and fish
While some of these forms of life useful to man have died or are dying others especially insects dangerous to man have become resistant to insecticides
As more and more effective chemicals are produced these creatures become immune to them and the vicious circle goes on without any practical solution in sight
The natural fertility and the organic balance of the soil also diminish as more and more chemical fertilizers are applied throughout the years and thus a vicious circle gets formed there too
All this evidence clearly shows that man cannot dominate and subjugate nature
In the long run nature emerges triumphant and man becomes the loser
Instead man must learn to cooperate with nature
Here we are reminded of an admonition given by the Buddha that in amassing wealth man must exploit nature as a bee collects pollen
The bee harms neither the beauty of the flower nor its fragrance similarly man must not pollute or rob nature of its richness beauty and its rejuvenating and replenishing capacity
This is the real implication of right livelihood when it comes to the utilization of natural resources
It should be reiterated that the whole modern concept of development which seems to have nothing short of the sky itself as the limit is severely antithetical to Buddhist values
Buddhism sets the limit at the other end it advocates that we feed our needs and not our greeds
Man needs the basic comforts of food clothing shelter and medicine
It is the responsibility of the rulers to provide avenues of employment so that the average man can afford to have these needs satisfied with a fair degree of comfort
As man is naturally prone to greed Buddhism emphasizes the value of having few wants
Contentment is also a much valued virtue in Buddhism
Care is taken to see that these virtues do not degenerate into apathy and cause social stagnation
Buddhism encourages the layman to be industrious to forge ahead in his chosen blameless occupation
Wealth earned by sheer perseverance by the sweat of one's brow is highly praised as well gotten righteous wealth
It is even recommended that a layman should invest half of his earnings for improvement of his industry
Laymen are also exhorted to save their hard earned money and to lead a comfortable life consonant with earning capacity avoiding both extremes of miserliness and extravaganceoverindulgence
thus the tension between having few wants and contentment on the one hand and industriousness on the other helps to keep society at a practically comfortable level of development which can be sustained for a long time
When these economic ideas are reinforced with the other moral values inculcated by Buddhism a stable society with harmonious interpersonal relations can be expected
The modern concept of largescale industries and factories also does not agree with the Buddhist concept of right livelihood
These large industries and mechanized labor have made a few people enormously rich and thrown millions of employable people out of employment
Thus wealth gets concentrated among a few factory owners and businessmen while millions can barely eke out an existence
Maldistribution of wealth is regarded in Buddhism as a social evil which paves the way to crime and revolution
Moreover machines have robbed man of his creativity and left him terribly frustrated
This may be one of the reasons why the youth of today have turned to drugs to find an easy escape route
The concept of right livelihood works with the notion that man is the central concern in economy as producer as well as consumer not the profit made in the process of products changing hands
The skills and talents of the producer should be enhanced in the process of production and he should have the satisfaction derived from his output
The producer not an employer above him or a middleman should get a fair return commensurate with his labor and sufficient to afford him a decent living
The consumer on the other hand should get quality and quantity for what he pays
In sharp contrast to this ideology the profit made by the employer is the central concern today both the producer and the consumer are subservient to the profit motive
Therefore right livelihood would opt for smallscale industries which would satisfy the creative instinct of man and the basic needs of many more people and would also ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth in society
It is better to have a large number of skilled cobblers than a well equipped mechanized shoe factory
As right livelihood is a part and parcel of the Noble Eightfold Path when it is rightly practiced it leads to the elimination of greed hatred and delusion
Just as the river Ganges is inclined towards the east he who practices the Noble Eightfold Path is inclined towards Nibbana
Thus the correct understanding of right livelihood is essential for the Buddhist layman who is bent on his spiritual welfare
Death is the only certain thing in life
It is also the thing for which we are least prepared
We plan and prepare for various other things  examinations weddings business transactions building houses  but we can never be certain whether our plans will materialize according to our wish
Death on the other hand can come any minute sooner or later it is the most certain event in life
Just as the mushroom raises itself from the ground carrying a bit of earth on its hood so every living being brings with himself the certainty of death from the moment of his birth
The Anguttara Nikaya illustrates the uncertainty and the evanescent nature of life with the help of a few evocative similes
Life is compared to a dew drop at the tip of a blade of grass it can drop off any moment and even if it does not fall off it evaporates as soon as the sun comes up
Life is also as fleeting as a bubble of water formed by the falling rain or a line drawn on the water
The text points out that life rushes towards death incessantly like a mountain stream rushing down without stopping
The Dhammapada compares the fragility of the body to foam and to a clay water pot
Thus with various similes the uncertainty of life and the certainty of death are emphasized over and over again in the Buddhist texts
It is accepted as a general truth that everybody fears death
We fear death because we crave for life with all our might
It is also a fact that we fear the unknown
We know least about death therefore we fear death for a duality of reasons
It seems reasonable to conjecture that the fear of death or the fear of harm to life lurks at the root of all fear
Therefore each time we become frightened we either run away from the source of fear or fight against it thus making every effort to preserve life
But we can do so only so long as our body is capable of either fighting or running away from danger
But when at last we are on the deathbed face to face with approaching death and the body is no longer strong enough for any protest it is very unlikely that we will accept death with a mental attitude of resignation
We will mentally try hard to survive
As our yearning for life is so strong we will mentally grasp another viable place as our body can no longer support life
Once such a place for example the fertilized ovum in a mother's womb has been grasped the psychological process of life will continue with the newly found place as its basis
Birth will take place in due course
This seems to be the process that is explained in the chain of causation as craving conditions grasping grasping conditions becoming or the process of growth which in turn conditions birth
Thus the average man who fears death will necessarily take another birth as his ardent desire is to survive
Let us probe a little further into the process of death going from the known to the unknown
We know that in normal life when we are awake sense data keep on impinging on our sense faculties
We are kept busy attending to these sense data rejecting some selecting some for greater attention and getting obsessed with still other things
This is an ongoing process so long as we are awake
In the modern age man is reaching out and seeking more and more sense stimulation
The popularity of the portable radio with or without earphones chewing gum cosmetics and television is a clear indication of the present trend for more and more sense stimulation
By all this we have become alienated from ourselves we do not know our own real nature or the real nature of our mind to be more precise
Moreover we go about our business in social life wearing masks appropriate for each occasion
We often do not show our true feelings of jealousy greed hatred pride or selfishness
We hide them in socially accepted ways of formalized verbal expressions such as congratulations thank you deepest sympathies
But there are times when our negative emotions are so acute that they come into the open in the form of killing stealing quarreling backbiting and so forth
But generally we try to keep these venomous snakes of negative emotions inhibited
Now let us see what happens at the moment of death
We believe that death is a process and not just a sudden instantaneous event
When the senses lose their vitality one by one and they stop providing stimulation the inhibitions too fall away
The masks we have been wearing in our various roles get cast off
We are at last face to face with ourselves in all our nakedness
At that moment if what we see are the venomous snakes of negative emotions of hatred jealousy etc we would be laden with guilt remorse and grief
It is very likely that our memories too will become quite sharp as all the sensory disturbances and inhibitions which kept them suppressed have fallen off
We may remember our own actions committed and omitted during our lifetime with unpretentious clarity
If they are morally unwholesome we would be guilty and grief stricken but if they are morally wholesome we would be contented and happy
The Abhidhammattha Sangaha speaks of the presentation of kamma or kammanimitta at the mind door on the advent of death
This seems to be the revival in memory of an actual action or action veiled in symbols at the onset of death
It is said that rebirth will be determined by the quality of thoughts that surface in this manner
Death is as natural an event as nightfall it is but one of the manifestations of the law of impermanence
Though we dislike it immensely we have to orient ourselves to accept its inevitability as there is no escape therefrom
The Buddhist texts advocate the cultivation of the mindfulness of death often so that we are not taken unawares when the event does take place
To face death peacefully one has to learn the art of living peacefully with one's own self as well as with those around
One method of doing so is to remember the inevitability of death which will deter one from unwholesome behavior
The practice of meditation is the best technique which will enable one to live peacefully with oneself and others
The practice of lovingkindness is an effective method of meditation
One of its special advantages is the ability to face death undeluded
In one sutta the Buddha explains how to prepare for a peaceful death
One has to organize one's life and cultivate an appropriate attitude for this purpose
The instructions given there are as follows
One should not be fond of being talkative
One should not be fond of sleeping
One should not be fond of having too many companions
One should not be fond of too much social intercourse
One should not be fond of daydreaming
Another sutta explains that if one avoids unwholesome wicked activities through body speech and mind one need not fear death
The Mahaparinibbana Sutta categorically states that those who are evil in character face death with delusion while the virtuous face death free from delusion
Thus if one leads a simple virtuous life one need not fear death
Once Mahanama Sakka disclosed to the Buddha that he was worried where he would be reborn if he were to meet with a violent death in a road accident
The Buddha explained that those who have cultivated the qualities of faith virtue learning generosity and wisdom for a long time need not entertain such fears
To illustrate the position further the Buddha employs a simile
If a pot of oil or ghee is broken in deep water the potsherds will sink to the riverbed and the oil or ghee will rise to the surface of the water
Similarly in such a tragic situation the body would be discarded and may be devoured by vultures and jackals but the mind will rise and progress upwards
The account of the illness of Nakula's father is another interesting episode regarding the Buddhist attitude to death
Once Nakula's father was seriously ill and his wife noticed that he was fretful and anxious
She advised him that death with anxiety is painful and is denounced by the Buddha
Therefore he must compose himself
Comforting him she said that he might be worried about the family income and the task of bringing up the children after his death
She assured him that she was capable of spinning and weaving and thus she could provide for the family and bring up the children
He may be anxious that she would remarry after his death
She said that he knows just as well as she that she has never been unfaithful to him ever since they were married at the age of sixteen and she pledged that she would remain loyal to him even after his death
Perhaps he may worry about her spiritual development and she assured him that she would continue to be earnest in her spiritual welfare
Therefore he must face death if need there be with no anxiety
Such was her advice to her husband who was fatally ill
It is said that he regained self composure and thereby good health too
The matter was later reported to the Buddha who commended Nakula's mother for her wisdom and composure
The suttas also discuss the advantages of the regular contemplation of death
The mind gets divested from the love of life and being intoxicated with the zest of life men commit various atrocities
That can be prevented by the habit of practicing mindfulness of death
If we only remember that we have not come to this world to stay forever we would take care to lead much better lives
If when we take stock we find wicked negative emotions such as lust hatred and jealousy in us we should immediately take steps to eradicate them as we would try to put out the flames if our head were to catch fire
Thus the Buddhist texts tirelessly reiterate the positive benefits of the regular contemplation of the inevitability of death
It helps one to lead a more wholesome life and also to face death the one and only certain event in life with calm composure and fearless confidence
When alive the human body is the most precious and the most mysterious object in the whole world
We regard it as beautiful and spend much time energy and money to make it more beautiful
We regard it as an instrument for pleasure and spend nearly all our lives in procuring objects of pleasure
We assume it is a vital part of ourself
It would be useful to discuss the validity of these attitudes and assumptions from the Buddhist point of view
The human body is the most intricate machine in the world
Each human body is unique not only in appearance but also in its biochemical structure sensitivity of sense faculties disease resistance disease susceptibility etc and hereditary laws alone are incapable of offering a satisfactory explanation
Buddhism holds that the body and its sense faculties have been so structured as the effect of former kamma
From the dawn of civilization man has tried to understand the mystery of the human personality and he has given rise to various sciences and religions
In one sutta the Buddha says that within this fathomlong sentient human body is found the whole world its origin its cessation and the path leading to its cessation
In a way this means that the world of experience is within the human body
In another sense it means that if one were to understand the mystery of the human body that would amount to understanding the mystery of the world
In fact the external world is nothing but what we get to know through the instrumentality of our sense faculties
If we understand the sense faculties and sense data we have understood everything
The relationship of the body and the mind is most elusive
According to the Samaññaphala Sutta this relationship can be understood only after the attainment of the fourth jhana
The adept can then see consciousness established in the physical constitution just as one can see a colored thread running through the aperture of a transparent gem
Another sutta explains the interdependency of body and mind through the simile of two bundles of reeds placed against one another supporting each other
Emotional changes in the mind affect body chemistry and fluctuations in body chemistry affect the mind
As a gross example we can take the negative emotion of anger
Anger triggers off glandular secretions which alter body chemistry considerably to bring about changes such as trepidation sweating feeling hot etc
On the other hand changes in body chemistry produced for instance by the intake of alcohol or drugs affect the mind to bring about appropriate mood changes euphoria and hallucinations
According to a sutta in the Anguttara Nikaya all thoughts are translated into sensations
This shows the extent to which the body is influenced by the mind
Buddhism has clearly recognized this interdependency and utilized that knowledge in its path to liberation
The body is disciplined through morality and is thus maintained at a reasonably healthy biochemical level
The mind is disciplined with meditation to produce healthy psychological changes and thereby reinforce a more healthy biochemical composition of the body
This process goes on until the attainment of arahantship when the biochemical composition has undergone such a radical irreversible change that an arahant is said to be incapable of certain physiological functions which are antithetical to spiritual development but normal in average human beings
Though the sentient human body is most precious no precious material goes into its composition
It is precious because through its instrumentality man is able to probe into the deepest mysteries of the universe and of himself into the meaning of life and the enigma of death
When we stand by the ocean in the evening twilight and gaze at the vast ocean as far as the horizon or at the starstudded firmament receding into infinity as far as the eye can see we are awestruck by the magnitude of the universe
Compared to that man is but an infinitesimal speck of dust in size
But when we pay attention to the potentialities of man it is he who can even conceive of this mighty universe it is he who can unravel its mysteries
Though part and parcel of the universe though subject to natural cosmic laws man has the capacity to transcend the natural material world and can even reach Buddahood
Therefore man is supreme and the sentient human frame is precious
It is true that we generally look at the human body as a thing of beauty
We speak of beautiful eyes teeth face hair and figure
But Buddhism looks at the human body from a realistic point of view
The body is a bag of filth it is full of impurities
The Buddhist texts dealing with the thirtytwo parts of the body spell out in detail its foul material constituents
If we only pause a moment to consider attentively the state of the face prior to a wash in the morning we can gain a fair idea of the body's repulsive nature
It exudes so much dirt from its major nine apertures and numerous pores that it needs constant cleaning
Just imagine how intolerable the body would be if we neglect to clean what it discharges from the outlets even for a single day let alone for a long period
Great care has to be taken to keep the body clean so that it is not offensive to oneself and others
If no regular cleaning is done it can be the home of various parasites and thus a public nuisance
We have to understand the real nature and the composition of the body in order to reduce and eliminate our infatuation with it
We have to feed the body very carefully throughout life
However well the body is fed it grows hungry over and over again
Hunger is the worst disease says the Dhammapada
There is no end to feeding the body until death
The stomach is like an open sore which needs careful periodical dressing
Gross food is but one of the nutriments the body needs according to Buddhism contact with the environment volition and consciousness are the other three nutriments
All these four forms of nutriment are essential for the continuance of the body in health
The body also needs to be protected from heat cold rain injurious germs and external harm
We have to be ever alert to protect the body from these various sources of external danger
For these reasons Buddhism says that the body is a source of great anxiety  bahudukkho ayam kayo
Great is the hardship man has to undergo just to keep the body viable clean and healthy
The body is endowed with sense faculties and they are ever in search of pleasure
The eye is in search of pleasant forms the ear of pleasant sounds the nose of pleasant smells the tongue of pleasant tastes and the body of pleasant tactiles
Most of our life is spent in the pursuit of these pleasures
But it remains a fact that the body texture is such that it does not tolerate excessive pleasure
However desirable pleasure may be the body falls ill when overloaded with them
For instance however palatable rich food may be when it is taken in excess the body becomes a victim of killer diseases
Similarly excessive indulgence in sex causes social diseases of which the most dreaded today is AIDS
Acquired Immunity Deficiency Syndrome for which a cure has not yet been found
Therefore restraint in the enjoyment of sense pleasures is the best course of conduct for those desirous of health and long life
When we look at the body in its various postures of standing sitting walking and lying down we realize that the body can tolerate these postures only for a very short time
Even if we are sitting in the most comfortable seat we continue to remain in the same position without moving around only for a short time
Automatically we move about adjusting our limbs to more comfortable positions in a constant search for pleasure
But pleasure is short lived pain raises its head and we move and adjust ourselves again to eke out a little pleasure
Thus the search for pleasure goes on and we delude ourselves saying that we enjoy life
The basic truth is that the body is a source of misery but we prefer to turn a blind eye to this fact and cling desperately to fleeting pleasures
The Buddha says that there is no doubt an iota of pleasure appassada but the misery is far in excess of this pleasure bahudukkha
The body in its various stages of growth also brings much pain
Birth causes excruciating pain both to mother and babe
The infant is completely at the mercy of others around it
If its needs are not duly attended to it experiences much misery which it expresses by pitiful cries
Teething is a significant landmark in the series of growing pains
All attempts to master the various physical postures contribute their own quota of hardships to infancy
Puberty and adolescence are also harassed by the growing pains appropriate to those ages
Old age is particularly notorious for aches and pains
The sense faculties are on the decline sight fails hearing becomes short and other senses too diminish in their acuity
Various joint pains and body aches become more constant and the body strength ebbs away
Even the Buddha in his old age said that his body was like an old wornout cart which could be kept going only with much repair
He added that he enjoyed physical comfort only when he spent time in jhanic ecstasy
Such is the nature of the body in old age
We cannot forget that the body is prone to various diseases during all stages of its growth
Though the body is thus a source of great misery we cannot afford to hate it
To have a healthy attitude towards the body we should avoid both extremes of being infatuated with the body and hating it
We should have metta a friendly attitude towards the body
Realistically understanding its nature we should avoid misusing it as an instrument only for pleasure
We should be very careful not to form habits which are injurious to the body such as smoking drinking and the excessive indulgence in sensual pleasures
The body becomes a prey to selfinflicted diseases if we fail to cultivate an attitude of friendliness towards it
If we want to enjoy a reasonably healthy body as a vital part of our self
When we say I am tall I am fat I am fair I am beautiful or ugly we really mean that the body has these attributes
But as we keep on using the pronoun I we get caught in the grammatical subject and assume the existence of an ontological subject such as the soul or the ego
Therefore we establish a relationship of identity and possession with the body
Thus the body becomes a vital part of the self
The Buddha argues that if the body is really ours as we assume it is it should behave according to our wishes
It should remain young healthy beautiful and strong as we always wish it to be
But the body hardly behaves according to our wishes and we come to grief when it goes against our wishes and expectations
The Buddha points out that the body really does not belong to us nor is it really our self or a part of our self
We should therefore give up craving for it we should cease to identify ourselves with it
Giving up craving for the body results in much happiness and peace
In order to wean ourselves from our habitual identification and ownership we have to impress the repulsive and alien nature of our bodies into our minds with deep sensitivity so that an attitudinal change takes place in us with regard to the body
Observation of the repulsive and miseryproducing nature of our bodies repeatedly over and over again is one sure way of gaining the realistic perspective
This is the path leading out of misery
Scientific and technological advancement has brought about widespread changes in the lifestyle of modern man
Changes have been so rapid and overwhelming during the th century that this century seems to far outweigh all other centuries put together in this respect
Man's attitudes values goals and ideals too have undergone radical change
Scientific knowledge regarding the nature and evolution of the universe man society culture and civilization has unsettled many of the old certitudes and undermined the very basis and authority of the Western theistic religious traditions
With the loss of respect for authority and tradition the validity of moral values too came to be questioned
Ever renewing scientific knowledge which exposed traditional beliefs one after another as superstitious or mythical gave a halo of superiority to modernity
Nurtured in such an environment the younger generation became alienated from the lifestyle of their parents and the ageold generation gap assumed unprecedented proportions
While scientific knowledge rendered man a skeptic alienated from his cultural heritage technology robbed him of his creative ability
The machine with its vast powers of production reduced man to a button pusher and threw millions of workers out of employment
Their muscular and creative powers were left unharnessed thwarted and frustrated
As a result the indigenous folk arts and crafts of all nations which were in fact expressions of sublimated emotions became almost extinct
Man in his admiration for creativity and feeble struggle for selfexpression has now become an antique collector
The next force which completely overwhelmed modern man was the tyranny of commercialization and advertising
When production exceeded consumption man had to be persuaded into consuming more lest trade suffer with a backlog of unconsumed stockpiles
Deliberate and calculated attempts were made to change traditional frugality into an ethic of consumption
Mass media were utilized to convince the people of the virtues and necessity of increasing consumption to maintain the newly acquired standard of affluent living
Research into motivational and behavioral psychology betrayed the susceptibilities of man and advertising agents made capital by playing upon these weaknesses namely man's innate greed for sensual pleasure personal property and social prestige
Unleashed as he was from his cultural moorings and frustrated as he was in his creative urge modern man succumbed to the attractive appeals of mass media and plunged into a life of selfindulgence
Having thus briefly outlined the main causes responsible for modern sensualistic social trends it is useful to glance at the effects they have produced on the individual and society of today
Venereal diseases have become rampant it is reported that there was an increase of  within one decade in the United States
The ever widening field of psychiatry shows that mental health is rapidly deteriorating
Alcoholism and drug addiction are major health problems
The crime rate is ever mounting
Bonds of wedlock have become sadly brittle and the divorce rate is alarmingly high
The family as a viable institution is threatened according to some sociologists with extinction in the not too distant future
Disruption of family life has affected child life most pathetically
A British report of Health Economics published in January informs us that babies are the most common homicide victims in Britain since the early s
They are battered to death at times of family stress
Teenage drug addictions and juvenile delinquency have become alarming problems of the day
These social phenomena are directly related to man's attitude towards sense pleasure and serious rethinking seems most urgent today if man is to be saved from the imminent danger of self destruction through sensuality
Buddhism has been a great civilizing force and a guiding principle for millions of people during the last twentyfive centuries
It would be useful to see what light Buddhism sheds on the present chaotic situation and what wisdom it offers for selfadjustment under modern conditions and for healthy family and interpersonal relations
Though criticism is often levelled that Buddhism is a lifedenying ascetic ideal and that it is antisocial and antipolitical it should be remembered that Buddhism embraces in its dispensation not only monks and nuns but also male and female lay followers
The intellectual and disciplinary training of the laity is as important a concern in Buddhism as that of the monks
Therefore Buddhism offers a social and a political philosophy the goal of which is the creation of a society where human rights are safeguarded human enterprise is the key to success resources are well distributed and justice reigns supreme
As Trevor Ling too maintains Buddhism is not just a religion or a philosophy it is in fact a whole civilization a full fledged multifaceted philosophy of life designed to meet the secular and spiritual needs of man
According to Buddhism ambitions of man center on the acquisition of wealth pleasure fame longevity and happiness after death
Accepting these as human aspirations and goals of human endeavor Buddhism advocates a way of life to help man realize these aims
For the danger is ever present that man in his pursuit of pleasure will in the long run defeat those very aims
Wealth and sex are two important means of acquiring pleasure
A prudent attitude towards them would go a long way for the realization of the other three human ambitions as well
As most of the social ills of today are attributable to the mishandling of these two a correct understanding of the Buddhist attitude towards them would be most profitable
The Buddhist attitude towards wealth is such that it has never prescribed a ceiling on income
What it has prescribed is that wealth should be acquired through righteous means and expended also in a righteous manner
Wealth earned by the sweat of one's brow without harming deceiving or exploiting others is highly commended
It is always emphasized that wealth has only instrumental value
It should be utilized for living in comfort making one's family parents dependents and friends happy insuring oneself against possible calamities through fire water etc performing one's duties to relatives guests and state and for religiocultural activities and patronizing those engaged in spiritual advancement
According to one's means on a large or very small scale one should try to make the best use of one's resources in the most righteous manner
What is deplored in Buddhism is the excessive acquisitive greed and the hoarding habit
While niggardliness is held in contempt frugality is extolled as a virtue
Wastefulness is a deplorable habit and it is even regarded as antisocial
Once Ananda explained to a king how the monks put the gifts offered to them to maximum use
When new robes are offered the old ones are taken as coverlets the old coverlets are utilized as mattress covers the former mattress covers are used as rugs the old rugs are taken as dusters the old tattered dusters are kneaded with clay and used to repair cracked floors and walls
Such was the Buddhist monks' conscientious use of resources
The same frugality has influenced the laity too and the famous episode of a wealthy merchant who bade a servant to collect a drop of ghee off the floor lest it be wasted is a very fine example
The same merchant was so generous that his largesse surprised the recipients
Though frugality and generosity appear to be incompatible they are recognized as commendable virtues in their own right to be cultivated by one and all
When these simple virtues are compared with the information revealed to us for instance by Vance Packard's epochmaking eyeopener The Waste Makers one begins to wonder whether sanity and common sense have left the knowledgeable man of science today
Some investigators estimate that American consumption of the world's resources within forty years is equal to what mankind has consumed during the last years
As the earth's resources are not unlimited it is high time that modern man did some rethinking and cultivated some economical Buddhist habits at least out of sympathy for posterity
It is true that oceanography opens unexploited resources to man but it must be remembered that the ocean too is not unlimited whereas man's greed knows no limit nor satiation
Buddhism recognizes the sex attraction as a universal reality
Among animals the sex impulse is regulated by nature and thus their mating and breeding are seasonal
Among humans there is no such natural mechanism and man has by a long process of experiment and adjustment arrived at certain taboos rules and regulations to handle his sex drive in a manner appropriate to himself and his fellow beings
Though these rules differ according to times and place on the whole they have helped man to emerge from savagery to civilization
According to Buddhism monogamy is the ideal form of marriage while chastity and fidelity form ideal behavior before marriage
This alone is not sufficient for success in married life
Mutual confidence morality selfdenial and prudence are emphasized as virtues which ensure conjugal happiness and success
In other words mutual confidence means dependability morality implies strength of character selfdenial or the joy of selfless service to the beloved denotes emotional maturity and prudence shows intellectual maturity
These qualities bring the spouses so close to one another it is said that the relationship could persist even after death in a future existence
Nakula's parents are portrayed in Buddhist literature as an ideal couple who in their old age expressed the wish that their love should survive death
The Buddha replied that the wish would materialize if the above qualities are equally shared by both partners
Marital bonds of modern man are so brittle and fragile because these cohesive emotional forces are lost in sensuality
Much emphasis is laid on carnal pleasure while personality adjustments and emotional involvement which call for sacrifices and selflessness respectively are ignored or neglected
Though sex is an important basic requirement in marriage it is certainly not the beall and endall of family life
Indulgence in sex for its own sake never brings satisfaction whence fulfillment
The insatiability of lust is disdainfully illustrated in Buddhist literature by the traditional simile of a dog licking a bone to satisfy hunger
But sex as an expression of conjugal love is a satisfying emotional experience
If sex was the only concern man need not have evolved an institution like the family
Animals too satisfy their sex instinct but nothing compared to the human family has evolved in the animal kingdom
The important function of family life seems to be to teach man a great moral lesson to overcome his egocentric nature
Man starts life in his mother's womb as the most selfish parasite
He then passes through the emotional stages of selflove conjugal love and parental love
As a mature man and a parent he completely loses himself in the service of his offspring
His selfdenial is such he even relinquishes his personal possessions acquired through the toil of a lifetime in favor of them
Finally he makes an emotional self sacrifice when he gets a partner for his child to love and cherish
In his old age he regards his offspring with equanimity and contentment
This emotional maturity and fulfillment is utterly impossible if sensuality is regarded as the goal of married life
These two ambitions of man depend to a very large extent as mentioned earlier on the manner he handles his wealth and pleasure
Special mention should be made that liquor like sensuality is a great betrayer of all human ambitions
It has been aptly remarked that a man's conscience is soluble in alcohol
According to Buddhism both liquor and sensuality destroy man's physical and mental health drain his resources spoil his public image and distort his intellectual capacities
In this age of material pleasure man is not much concerned with a life after death
The Buddhist axiom is that a man reaps what he sows
If one has led a useful moral life and reached old age with a sense of fulfillment contentment and equanimity one has no regrets
A wellspent blameless life has according to Buddhism happiness beyond the grave
Such a person is said to progress from light to brighter light
Another noteworthy ill effect of selfindulgence is the inhibition of intellectual capacities
Buddhism emphasizes that obsession with sensuality prevents clear thinking distorts vision clouds issues inhibits wisdom and destroys peace of mind
While these observations were made twentyfive centuries ago by the Buddha the inhibitory effect of sex on brain activity seems to be indicated quite independently by medical research on the pineal gland
In man the pineal gland is a pearshaped midline structure located at the back of the base of the brain
This gland synthesizes a hormone called melatonin which affects behavior sleep brain activity and sexual activity such as puberty ovulation and sexual maturation
While melatonin stimulates brain activity it inhibits sexual activity
Again it has been recognized that light dark olfaction cold stress and other neural inputs affect the pineal function
Exposure to light reduces the synthesis of melatonin and depresses pineal weight
On the other hand light accelerates sexual maturation activity
It will be useful to compare this medical information with Buddhist ideology
Buddhism maintains that sense stimuli disturb mental activity
If the sense doors are well guarded ie if visual auditory olfactory gustatory and tactile inputs are controlled a corresponding degree of concentrated mental activity becomes possible
Cittassa ekaggata or the ability to fix the mind on one point is greatly determined by the control of the sense faculties
In terms of physiology it seems to mean that such sense control helps the synthesis of melatonin in the pineal gland which stimulates brain activity and retards sexual activity
Thus with the help of medical research it seems possible to confirm the buddhist point of view that sensuality inhibits intellectual maturity
According to the Aggañña Sutta which gives an account of the evolution of the world and society the earliest inhabitants of the earth were mindmade and selfluminous beings who subsisted on joy and moved about in the sky
After a long time they tasted something extremely flavorsome and were delighted with this new gustatory sense experience
Craving entered into them and they went on tasting food in this manner
Consequently their bodies became coarser and coarser they lost their radiance and the ability to subsist on joy and to traverse in the sky
Now what is important for us here is not the authenticity of this evolutionary process but the point that sensual desire has caused the loss of higher mental and physical capacities which man is supposed to have once possessed
The Cakkavattsihanada Sutta deals with the problem of social change
As a result of the unequal distribution of wealth poverty becomes widespread and moral standards deteriorate rapidly
With moral degeneration there is a corresponding decrease in physical beauty and length of life
As time goes on and immorality settles down society comes under the grip of three derogatory phenomena namely perverted lust wanton greed and a wrong sense of values
Disrespect for family religious and cultural traditions becomes an accepted social phenomenon
When moral degradation continues thus a time will come when the life span is reduced to ten years and the marriageable age goes down to five
By that time food will undergo so much change that delicacies such as ghee butter honey etc
will vanish and what is considered coarse today will be a delicacy of that time
All concepts of morality will disappear and language will have no word to denote morality
Immorality will reign supreme with social sanction
There will be no marriage laws nor kinship and society will fall into a state of utter promiscuity as among animals
Among such humans keen mutual enmity will become the rule and they will be overcome by passionate thoughts of killing one another
A world war will break out and largescale massacre would be the result
After this mass blood bath the few destitutes who are left behind will find solace in each other's company and they will begin to regard one another with kindly thoughts
With this change of heart there will be a gradual reevolution of moral values
Step by step the good life will be restored physical beauty will reappear and the lifespan will increase
Mental potentialities too will gradually develop
Such are the Buddhist ideas of social change
Society stands or falls with the rise or fall of moral values
It is noteworthy that some presentday sociological studies too have revealed that morality and culture are causally connected
William Stephens observes that primitive tribes have great sexual freedom premarital as well as extramarital when compared with civilized communities which have tight sex restrictions
Dean Robert Fitch has connected the decline of the Roman civilization with the deterioration of their sexual morality
The most important contribution in this respect is made by JD
Unwin in a study called Sex and Culture
He has conducted a survey of the sexual behavior and the level of culture of eighty uncivilized tribes and also those of six known civilizations
He concludes that there is a definite relationship between permissiveness and primitiveness and sex restrictions and civilization
Sexual freedom gives rise to what he calls a zoistic culture where people are born they satisfy their desire they die and are forgotten after the remains are disposed of
They are not able to rationally find out the causal connection between events
When afflicted by illness for instance they resort to witchcraft and nothing more
When a certain degree of sex restriction occasional premarital or postnuptial is present the result is a manistic culture where ancestors are worshipped at times of crisis but without a definite place of worship
Strict sex regulations as in monogamy produce a deistic culture with definite places of worship
Culture in the sense of the external expression of internal human energy resulting from the use of human powers of reason creation and self knowledge becomes possible only with strictly enforced monogamous sex mores
The mechanism of this operation is not known just as it is not known how carbon placed under different settings turns to coal or diamond
All that can be said is that there is a definite causal link between sexual behavior and the culture pattern
As Unwin comes to this conclusion after conducting exhaustive methodical investigations it is possible to maintain that scientific inquiries too have confirmed the Buddhist point of view regarding the relationship between morality and culture
The Anguttara Nikaya maintains that rainfall decreases when society comes under the sway of perverted lust wanton greed and wrong values
Drought causes famine as a result of which the mortality rate goes up
Though it is difficult to establish a direct connection between immorality and lack of rain an interpretation of the five natural laws mentioned on the commentaries might offer a plausible explanation
In the cosmos there are five natural laws or forces namely utuniyama bijaniyama cittaniyama kammaniyama and dhammaniyama
These can be translated as physical laws biological laws psychological laws moral laws and causal laws
While the first four laws operate within their respective spheres the last law of causality operates within them as well as among them
Thus the physical environment or ecology affects living organisms ie biology this influences psychology which determines the moral force
The opposite process also operates with harmful or beneficial results depending on the nature or the forces at work
Perhaps the operation can be illustrated with a concrete example
Man's greed for luxury wealth and power has caused the setting up of vast factories
They created the problem of air water and noise pollution which have adversely affected both fauna and flora
The inadvertent modifications of atmospheric properties and processes caused by human activities is intensively studied by scientific bodies today
It is complained that although the effects of pollutants and smog upon people plants and economic activities have been extensively studied relatively little attention has been paid to the effects of pollution and smog upon climatic patterns
It is well known that many climatic elements such as radiation cloudiness fog visibility and the atmospheric electric field are affected by pollution
Temperature and humidity are influenced indirectly and effects on precipitation are also suspected
Science will reveal in the course of time whether pollution is definitely responsible for weather and climatic change but it remains a fact that the world is already confronted with an acute shortage of water
It is no secret that man uses his inherent powers of reason intelligence and creativity to change his environment for his advantage
But man is not aware that the moral force he himself creates brings about corresponding changes in his environment to his weal or woe whether he likes it or not
Concluding this essay it should be emphasized that there is a Cosmic Moral Force which profoundly influences man
According to Buddhism it is this Cosmic Moral Law or Force which makes the world and mankind go on kammana vattati loko kammana vattati paja
This Cosmic Moral Force is generated by none other than man himself for the Buddha maintains that human thoughts are a moral force
It is also more directly said that thoughts make the world go on
Therefore man has to discover his own inherent powers which are at present mostly dissipated on alcohol and sensuality
The discovery of the potentialities of The World Within is the most urgent need of today as modern man living in Sick Cities lost in a Sexual Wilderness unaware of The Hidden Persuaders is being slowly but surely reduced to a Naked Ape

Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Today when the role of Women in Society is an issue of worldwide interest it is opportune that we should pause to look at it from a Buddhist perspective
In the recent past a number of books have been written on the changing status of women in Hindu and Islamic societies but with regard to women in Buddhism ever since the distinguished Pali scholar Miss IB
Horner wrote her book on Women under Primitive Buddhism as far back as very little interest has been taken in the subject
It seems therefore justified to raise again the question whether the position of women in Buddhist societies was better than that in nonBuddhist societies of Asia
We will look briefly into the position in Sri Lanka Thailand Burma and Tibet at a time before the impact of the West was ever felt
Hugh Boyd who came as an envoy to the Kandyan Court in writes
The above quotation is just one selected from a series of comments which European observers have made on the women of Sri Lanka
Many of these European visitors to our shores came during the th th and early th centuries
There were among them envoys missionaries administrators soldiers physicians and shipwrecked mariners
They had firsthand knowledge of the women in Europe and many of them came through India having observed the women in Hindu and Islamic societies
Hence their evidence is all the more valuable
The recurring comments made by these widely traveled visitors on the women of Sri Lanka have evoked our curiosity to conduct this inquiry
The discussion that follows will deal with condition that prevailed up to the middle of the nineteenth century
Prior to this our sources are so meager that we cannot detect any major social changes
After this due to the impact of Western imperialism commercial enterprise and Christian missionary activity incipient changes in the traditional structures become perceptible
It is only in European writings that one finds lengthy accounts of the social conditions prevailing in the island
The indigenous literature being mainly religious lacks information regarding mundane topics like women
But from circumstantial evidence one could surmise that the liberal attitude towards women in Sri Lanka is a trend that has continued from the remote past
When one thinks of women in the traditional East the picture that comes to our minds is that of the veiled women of Islamic societies the zenanas where high class Indian ladies lived in seclusion the harems of Imperial china where lived thousands of royal concubines guarded by eunuchs the devadasis who in the name of God were forced into a life of religious prostitution all manifesting different aspects of the exploitation of women in the East
It is little known that there were societies in Asia where the position of women was a favorable one judging even from modern standards
Thailand and Burma too belong to this category
In those instances also we have based our conclusions mainly on the observations of Europeans who lived in these two countries in various capacities in the th and th centuries
R
Grant Brown who was a revenue officer for years in Burma has remarked
A British envoy to the Court of Ava was struck by the equal treatment accorded even to royal ladies
Lieutenant General Albert Fytche Late Chief Commissioner of British Burma and Agent to the Viceroy and Governor General of India wrote in Unlike the distrustful and suspicious Hindus and Mohammedans woman holds among them a position of perfect freedom and independence
She is with them not the mere slave of passion but has equal rights and is the recognized and duly honored helpmate of man and in fact bears a more prominent share in the transactions of the more ordinary affairs of life than in the case perhaps with any other people either eastern or western
Further inquiries have revealed that in Thailand too though not to the same extent the women enjoyed considerable liberty
For instance JGD
Campbell Educational Adviser to the Government of Siam wrote in
Sir Charles Bell British Political Representative in Tibet Bhutan and Sikkim writes in When a traveler enters Tibet from the neighboring nations of India and China few things impress him more vigorously or more deeply than the position of the Tibetan woman
They are not kept in seclusion as are Indian women
Accustomed to mix with the other sex throughout their lives they are at ease with men and can hold their own as well as any women in the world Bell continues And the solid fact remains that in Buddhist countries women hold a remarkably good position
Burma Ceylon and Tibet exhibit the same picture
These comments on the freedom and independence enjoyed by the women in certain preindustrialized and sometimes isolated Asian societies are startling
It is not suggested that in any of these countries Sri Lanka Burma and Thailand the women are on a par with the men both in theory and practice
But they have been favorably compared with the women of the neighboring countries of India and China where Hindu Confucian and Islamic doctrines held sway
This statement may appear contradictory for Burma and Thailand were synthesis of Indic and Sinic civilizations
In Sri Lanka too the impact of Hinduism was very strong
The question arises as to how the situation with regard to women in those three societies should be different from the major cultures of Asia
The common feature predominating in those countries is that they are intensely Buddhist
It is tempting therefore to conclude that Buddhism has helped to better the position of women in Sri Lanka Burma and Thailand
This conclusion would take us back to the question of the Buddhist attitude towards women and how it differs from that of other religions
Examining the position in ancient India it is clear from the evidence in the Rigveda the earliest literature of the IndoAryans that women held an honorable place in early Indian society
There were a few Rigvedic hymns composed by women
Women had access to the highest knowledge and could participate in all religious ceremonies
In domestic life too she was respected and there is no suggestion of seclusion of women and child marriage
Later when the priestly Brahmans dominated society and religion lost its spontaneity and became a mass of ritual we see a downward trend in the position accorded to women
The most relentless of the Brahman law givers was Manu whose Code of Laws is the most antifeminist literature one could find
At the outset Manu deprived woman of her religious rights and spiritual life
Sudras slaves and women were prohibited from reading the Vedas
A woman could not attain heaven through any merit of her own
She could not worship or perform a sacrifice by herself
She could reach heaven only through implicit obedience to her husband be he debauched or devoid of all virtues
Having thus denied her any kind of spiritual and intellectual nourishment Manu elaborated the myth that all women were sinful and prone to evil
Neither shame nor decorum nor honesty nor timidity says Manu is the cause of a woman's chastity but the want of a suitor alone
She should therefore be kept under constant vigilance and the best way to do it was to keep her occupied in the tasks of motherhood and domestic duties so that she has no time for mischief
Despite this denigration there was always in Indian thought an idealization of motherhood and a glorification of the feminine concept
But in actual practice it could be said by and large Manu's reputed Code of Laws did influence social attitudes towards women at least in the higher rungs of society
It is against this background that one has to view the impact of Buddhism in the th century BIt is not suggested that the Buddha inaugurated a campaign for the liberation of Indian womanhood
But he did succeed in creating a minor stir against Brahman dogma and superstition
He condemned the caste structure dominated by the Brahman excessive ritualism and sacrifice
He denied the existence of a Godhead and emphasized emancipation by individual effort
The basic doctrine of Buddhism salvation by one's own effort presupposes the spiritual equality of all beings male and female
This should mitigate against the exclusive supremacy of the male
It needed a man of considerable courage and a rebellious spirit to pronounce a way of life that placed woman on a level of near equality to man
The Buddha saw the spiritual potential of both men and women and founded after considerable hesitation the Order of Bhikkhunis or Nuns one of the earliest organizations for women
The Sasana or Church consisted of the Bhikkhus Bhikkhunis laymen and laywomen so that the women were not left out of any sphere of religious activity
The highest spiritual states were within the reach of both men and women and the latter needed no masculine assistance or priestly intermediary to achieve them
We could therefore agree with IB
Horner when she says Buddhism accorded to women a position approximating to equality
Moving from the sphere of philosophy to domestic life one notices a change of attitude when we come to Buddhist times
In all patriarchal societies the desire for male offspring is very strong for the continuance of the patrilineage and in the case of Hindus for the due performance of funeral rites
For only a son could carry out the funeral rites of his father and thus ensure future happiness of the deceased
This was so crucial to the Hindu that the law allowed a sonless wife to be superseded by a second or a third one or even turned out of the house
It is said through a son he conquers the world and though a son's son he attains immortality As a result of this belief the birth of a daughter was the cause for lamentation
In Buddhism future happiness does not depend on funeral rites but on the actions of the deceased
The Buddhist funeral ceremony is a very simple one which could be performed by the widow daughter or any one on the spot and the presence of a son is not compulsory
There is no ritual or ceremonial need for a son and the birth of a daughter need not be a cause for grief
It is well known that the Buddha consoled king Pasenadi who came to him grieving that his queen Mallika had given birth to a daughter
A female offspring O king may prove even nobler than a male a revolutionary statement for his time
Despite the spiritual quality of the sexes and the fact that a son is not an absolute necessity in securing happiness in the after life yet even in Buddhist societies there is a preference for male offspring even today so potent is the ideology of male superiority
Marriage and family are basic institutions in all societies whether primitive or modern and the position of woman in a particular society is influence by and expressed in the status she holds within these institutions
Has she got the same rights as her husband to dissolve the marriage bond
Has she the right to remarry or is this a man's privilege
The answers to these questions will undoubtedly determine the position accorded to women in any society
Let us examine the Buddhist attitude to the question
In Buddhism unlike Christianity and Hinduism marriage is not a sacrament
It is purely a secular affair and the monks do not participate in it
In Sri Lanka Thailand and Burma there is a good deal of ceremony feasting and merrymaking connected with the event but these are not of a religious nature
Sometimes monks are invited to partake of alms and they in turn bless the couple
Although there are no vows or rituals involved in the event of a marriage the Buddha has laid down in the Sigalovada Sutta the duties of a husband and wife
The significant point here is that the Buddha's injunctions are bilateral the marital relationship is a reciprocal one with mutual rights and obligations
This was a momentous departure from ideas prevailing at the time
For instance Manu says Offspring the due performance of happiness and heavenly bliss for one's ancestors and oneself depends on one's wife alone Confucius an older contemporary of the Buddha spoke in the same tone in this way when the deferential obedience of the wife was complete the internal harmony was secured and a long continuance of the family could be reckoned with Confucius gives in detail the duties of the son to the father the wife to the husband and the daughterinlaw to the motherinlaw but never viceversa so that the wife had only duties and obligations and the husband only rights and privileges
According to the injunctions of the Buddha given in the Sigalovada Sutta which deals with domestic duties every relationship was a reciprocal one whether it be between husband and wife parent and child or master and servant
Ideally therefore among Buddhists marriage is a contract between equals
However it does not necessarily follow that social practice conforms to theory
The egalitarian ideals of Buddhism appear to have been impotent against the universal ideology of masculine superiority
The doctrine of Karma and Rebirth one of the fundamental tenets of Buddhism has been interpreted to prove the inherent superiority of the male
According to the law of Karma one's actions in the past will determine one's position of wealth power talent and even sex in future births
One is reborn a woman because of one's bad Karma
Thus the subordination of women is given a religious sanction
It is not unusual even in Sri Lanka for women after doing a meritorious deed to aspire to be redeemed from womanhood and be reborn as a man in future
Despite the remarkable degree of sexual equality in Burman society all women recite as a part of their Buddhist devotions the following prayer I pray that I may be reborn as a male in a future existence In Thailand in AD the Queen Mother founded a monastery and commemorated the event in an inscription in which she requested By the power of my merit may I be reborn as a male
Several examples could be quoted from the popular parlance of all three societies to show that even women whatever their station have accepted the idea of female inferiority and this has influenced the husbandwife relationship in varying degrees in the societies concerned
In Sri Lanka where this idea is least perceptible it is considered becoming even in modern times to maintain a facade of husband domination
The wifely control is unobtrusive and subtle
This ambivalent attitude is more pronounced in Burma where women are a specially privileged lot
They control the family economy socially politically and legally they are on a par with men
But the wife makes a show of deference to the husband which in itself is no measure of male dominance but an adaptation to a cultural norm
On the other hand the fact that men could have multiple spouses whereas the women were restricted to one placed the husband in a privileged position
The reverse was true in Sri Lanka where polygamy was unknown except in the royal family polyandry was practiced till recent times
In traditional Thailand the subordination of the wife in the family hierarchy was sanctioned by law
Till polygyny was legally recognized
From the nature of the marriage contract one passes on to the question whether both parties had the same facilities for terminating the contract
It is seen that in most cultures the woman is irretrievably bound by the chains of matrimony while the man can shed his shackles with ease
The Confucian code of discipline provides the husband with several grounds for divorce
Not only leprosy and sterility even disobedience and garrulity were valid reasons to get rid of a wife
Among the Hindus marriage was an indissoluble sacrament for the woman while the man had the right to remarry even when the first wife was alive
Says Manu A barren wife may be superseded in the th year
She whose children all die in the th she who bears only daughters in the th but she who is quarrelsome without delay In addition a man could abandon a blemished diseased or deflowered wife
Under Islamic law the contract may be dissolved by the husband at his will without the intervention of a court and without assigning any cause
But a wife cannot divorce herself from her husband without his consent except under a contract made before or after marriage
If the conditions of the contract are not opposed to Muslim law then the divorce will take effect
In Buddhism marriage received no religious sanction and in the absence of a Buddhist legal code comparable to the Laws of Manu or the Sharia Law of the Muslims the dissolution the marriage contract was settled by the individuals concerned or their families
With regard to Sri Lanka there is a document dated which gives an orthodox and official view on the subject
The Dutch who were ruling the maritime provinces of Sri Lanka wished to codify the laws and customs of the island
The Dutch Governor IW
Falck sent a series of questions to the eminent monks of Kandy and the answers to these are given in the document known as the Lakrajalosirita
The governor raised the question whether divorce was permitted among the Sinhalese
The reply was
The next question is for what faults on the part of the husband may the wife sue for and obtain a divorce from him
The Bhikkhus reply
The significant point is that even in theory the Sinhala laws were equally applicable and binding to both husband and wife
One clearly sees the influence of the injunctions of the Sigalovada Sutta in the development of these institutions
However litigation being a tedious process then as now it is unlikely that the average Sinhalese of the th century resorted to this lengthy judicial procedure
The Lakrajalosirita was written by Buddhist monks for the information of a foreigner and judging from the rest of the document they tried to depict ideal conditions
Only the very welltodo could afford the luxury of a court case
A more realistic account has been left by Robert Knox who spent years in the company of poor peasants
According to Sinhala laws of the th century the wife was treated very liberally at the time of divorce
She got back all the wealth that her parents gave her at the time of marriage and half of all the property acquired by the couple after marriage
Also she was given a sum of money sufficient to cover her expenses for the next six months
It is worthy of note that in Sri Lanka prior to European occupation both sexes had equal facilities for divorce both in theory and in practice
The situation changed however with the impact of Christianity and the introduction of Roman Dutch Law by the Hollanders in the areas under their control
In traditional Burma too a code of divorce provided for ill assorted unions
Where there was a mutual desire for separation due to incompatibility or other causes parties can divorce each other by an equal division of property
If one is unwilling the other is free to go provided all property is left behind
A woman can demand a divorce if her husband illtreats her or if he cannot maintain her and a man in case of sterility or infidelity of the wife
Another method not uncommon is for the aggrieved party to seek refuge in monastic life for this would at once dissolve the marriage bond
This easy availability of divorce in Burma has been condemned by Father Bigandet the Roman Catholic Bishop of Rangoon as damnable laxity
Despite this censure it is said that this easy and equal facility for divorce has rendered the Burman spouses more forbearing and that serious connubial quarrels are rare among them
In Thailand although women had legal disabilities they could initiate divorce proceedings which enabled them to escape from a tyrannous husband
As far back as the French envoy to the Siamese court observed
Although the conjugal power of the husband was fundamental to the Code yet the wife's right to divorce was preserved and she was treated generously when the marriage was annulled
Moving on to the question of the remarriage of widows and divorcees one notices that in certain societies the wives were regarded as the personal property of their husbands
As such the custom of slaying sacrificing or burying women alive to accompany their deceased husbands along with their belongings has been found in many lands as far removed as America Africa and India
The best known example is the soti puja or self immolation of highcaste Hindu widows
This custom which was unknown in the Rigveda developed later it was never very widespread but there were isolated instances continuing even up to early British times
The British had to introduce legislation to prevent it
Among the Hindus a widow was expected to lead a life of severe austerity and strict celibacy for she was bonded to her dead husband
Further she lost her social and religious status and was considered an unlucky person
The question of the remarriage of divorcees did not arise because a Hindu wife could not repudiate her husband even if she was rejected by the latter she had to remain celibate
In Buddhism death is considered a natural and inevitable end
As a result a woman suffers no moral degradation on account of her widowhood
Her social status is not altered in any way
In Buddhist societies she does not have to advertise her widowhood by shaving her head and relinquishing her ornaments
She is not forced to fast on specific days and sleep on hard floors for selfmortification has no place in Buddhism
Nor does she have to absent herself from ceremonies and auspicious events
Above all there is no religious barrier to her remarriage
The remarriage of rejected wives is also known in Buddhist literature
Women whose marriages break up were free to remarry with no stigma attached But if they chance to mislike one another and part asunder then she is fit for another man being as they account never the worse for wearing Even the Lakrajalosirita which gives an orthodox Buddhist view permits the remarriage of women after separation from their spouses
It was common even in the highest rungs of society
In Burma and Thailand too women had the right to remarry after divorce
As far back as La Loubere the French envoy noticed that in Thailand After the Divorce both can remarry and the woman can remarry on the very day of the Divorce
It is clear therefore that Buddhism has saved the daughter from indignity elevated the wife to a position approximating to equality and retrieved the widow from abject misery
The social freedom that women enjoyed in Buddhist societies above everything else has evoked from Western observers the comments that we have quoted earlier in this paper
It is not so much the equality of status but the complete desegregation of the sexes that has distinguished the women in Buddhist societies from those of the Middle East the Far East and the Indian subcontinent
Segregation of the sexes only leads to the seclusion and confinement of women behind veils and walls
The Confucian code lays down detailed rules on how men and women should behave in each other's presence
Manu went to the furthest extreme of segregation by warning that one should not remain in a lonely palace even with one's own mother and sister
Sexual segregation pervades all aspects of life in Islamic society
In early Buddhist literature one sees a free intermingling of the sexes
The celibate monks and nuns had separate quarters yet the cloister was not cut off from the rest of the world
It is recorded that the Buddha had long conversations with his female disciples
The devout benefactress Visakha frequented the monastery decked in all her finery and accompanied by a maid servant she attended to the needs of the monks
Her clothes and ornaments were the talk of the town yet neither the Buddha nor the monks dissuaded her from wearing them
It was after she developed in insight and asceticism that she voluntarily relinquished her ornaments
This free and liberal attitude certainly had its impact on the behavior of both men and women in Buddhist societies
In Sri Lanka in the th century the Men are not Jealous of their Wives for the greatest Ladies in the land will frequently talk and discourse with any Men they please although their Husbands be in presence It has been remarked that the women visited places of worship always dressed in their best attire
This is quite a contrast to the stand taken by Manu according to whom the love of ornamentation was an evil attribute of women and the Koranic injunction that the pious woman should hide all beauty and ornamentation behind the veil
Burmese women of all ranks went unveiled and ornamented and added color to all occasions though flanked by India and China where customs such as purdah and foot binding prevailed
In Thailand it has been noticed that the women of the upper classes though by no means confined to lives of strict seclusion did not appear much in public
In conclusion we could say that the secular nature of the marriage contract the facility to divorce the right to remarry the desegregation of the sexes and above all else the right to inherit own and dispose of property without let or hindrance from the husband have all contributed to the alleviation of the lot of women in Buddhist societies
Conflicting with the Buddhist ethos and negating its effects in varying degrees is the universal ideology of masculine superiority
So that in all three societies  Sri Lanka Thailand Burma  there is an ambivalence in the attitudes towards women
Yet their position is certainly better than in any of the major cultures of Asia
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
I am grateful to Mr
Paul Ingram who as the then editor published the original very much abbreviated version of this paper in the Buddhist Society's journal The Middle Way
My thanks are also due to the Ven
Nyanaponika Mahathera who encouraged me to develop my ideas further
For these however I must accept sole responsibility
It is the manifest suffering and folly in the world that invokes humane and compassionate social action in its many different forms
For Buddhists this situation raises fundamental and controversial questions
And here also Buddhism has implications of some significance for Christians humanists and other nonBuddhists
By social action we mean the many different kinds of action intended to benefit mankind
These range from simple individual acts of charity teaching and training organized kinds of service Right Livelihood in and outside the helping professions and through various kinds of community development as well as to political activity in working for a better society
Buddhism is a pragmatic teaching which starts from certain fundamental propositions about how we experience the world and how we act in it
It teaches that it is possible to transcend this sorrowladen world of our experience and is concerned first and last with ways of achieving that transcendence
What finally leads to such transcendence is what we call Wisdom
The enormous literature of Buddhism is not a literature of revelation and authority
Instead it uses ethics and meditation philosophy and science art and poetry to point a Way to this Wisdom
Similarly Buddhist writing on social action unlike secular writings makes finite proposals which must ultimately refer to this Wisdom but which also are arguable in terms of our common experience
In the East Buddhism developed different schools of traditions serving the experiences of different cultures ranging from Sri Lanka through Tibet and Mongolia to Japan
Buddhism may thus appear variously as sublime humanism magical mysticism poetic paradox and much else
These modes of expression however all converge upon the fundamental teaching the perennial Buddhism This pamphlet is based upon the latter drawing upon the different oriental traditions to present the teachings in an attempt to relate them to our modern industrial society
From the evidence of the Buddha's discourses or suttas in the Digha Nikaya it is clear that early Buddhists were very much concerned with the creation of social conditions favorable to the individual cultivation of Buddhist values
An outstanding example of this in later times is the remarkable welfare state created by the Buddhist emperor Asoka
Walpola Rahula stated the situation  perhaps at its strongest  when he wrote that Buddhism arose in India as a spiritual force against social injustices against degrading superstitious rites ceremonies and sacrifices it denounced the tyranny of the caste system and advocated the equality of all men it emancipated woman and gave her complete spiritual freedom
The Buddhist scriptures do indicate the general direction of Buddhist social thinking and to that extent they are suggestive for our own times
Nevertheless it would be pedantic and in some cases absurd to apply directly to modern industrial society social prescriptions detailed to meet the needs of social order which flourished twentythree centuries ago
The Buddhist householder of the Sigalovada Sutta experienced a different way of life from that of a computer consultant in Tokyo or an unemployed black youth in Liverpool
And the conditions which might favor their cultivation of the Middle Way must be secured by correspondingly different  and more complex  social economic and political strategies
It is thus essential to attempt to distinguish between perennial Buddhism on the one hand and on the other the specific social prescriptions attributed to the historical Buddha which related the basic perennial teaching to the specific conditions of his day
We believe that it is unscholarly to transfer the scriptural social teaching uncritically and with careful qualification to modern societies or to proclaim that the Buddha was a democrat and an internationalist
The modern terms democracy and internationalism did not exist in the sense in which we understand them in the emergent feudal society in which the Buddha lived
Buddhism is illserved in the long run by such special pleading
On the other hand it is arguable that there are democratic and internationalist implications in the basic Buddhist teachings
In the past two hundred years society in the West has undergone a more fundamental transformation than at any period since Neolithic times whether in terms of technology or the world of ideas
And now in the East while this complex revolution is undercutting traditional Buddhism it is also stimulating oriental Buddhism and in the West it is creating problems and perceptions to which Buddhism seems particularly relevant
Throughout its history Buddhism has been successfully reinterpreted in accordance with different cultures whilst at the same time preserving its inner truths
Thus has Buddhism spread and survived
The historic task of Buddhists in both East and West in the twentyfirst century is to interpret perennial Buddhism in terms of the needs of industrial man and woman in the social conditions of their time and to demonstrate its acute and urgent relevance to the ills of that society
To this great and difficult enterprise Buddhists will bring their traditional boldness and humility
For certainly this is no time for clinging to dogma and defensiveness
In modern Western society humanistic social action in its bewildering variety of forms is seen both as the characteristic way of relieving suffering and enhancing human wellbeing and at the same time as a noble ideal of service of selfsacrifice by humanists of all faiths
Buddhism however is a humanism in that it rejoices in the possibility of a true freedom as something inherent in human nature
For Buddhism the ultimate freedom is to achieve full release from the root causes of all suffering greed hatred and delusion which clearly are also the root causes of all social evils
Their grossest forms are those which are harmful to others
To weaken and finally eliminate them in oneself and as far as possible in society is the basis of Buddhist ethics
And here Buddhist social action has its place
The experience of suffering is the starting point of Buddhist teaching and of any attempt to define a distinctively Buddhist social action
However misunderstanding can arise at the start because the Pali word dukkha which is commonly translated simply as suffering has a much wider and more subtle meaning
There is of course much gross objective suffering in the world and much of this arises from poverty war oppression and other social conditions
We cling to our good fortune and struggle at all costs to escape from our bad fortune
This struggle may not be so desperate in certain countries which enjoy a high material standard of living spread relatively evenly throughout the population
Nevertheless the material achievements of such societies appear somehow to have been bought by social conditions which breed a profound sense of insecurity and anxiety of restlessness and inner confusion in contrast to the relatively stable and ordered society in which the Buddha taught
Lonely alienated industrial man has unprecedented opportunities for living life in the context of equipment as the philosopher Martin Heidegger so aptly put it
He has a highly valued freedom to make meaning of his life from a huge variety of more or less readily available forms of consumption or achievement  whether career building home making shopping around for different world ideologies or dedicated social service
When material acquisition palls there is the collection of new experiences and the clocking up of new achievements
Indeed for many their vibrating busyness becomes itself a more important selfconfirmation that the goals to which it is ostensibly directed
In developing countries to live thus in the context of equipment has become the great goal for increasing numbers of people
They are watched sadly by Westerners who have accumulated more experience of the disillusion and frustration of perpetual nonarrival
Thus from the experience of social conditions there arises both physical and psychological suffering
But more fundamental still is that profound sense of unease of anxiety or angst which arises from the very transience of life
This angst however conscious of it we may or may not be drives the restless search to establish a meaningful selfidentity in the face of a disturbing awareness of our insubstantiality
Ultimately life is commonly a struggle to give meaning to life  and to death
This is so much the essence of the ordinary human condition and we are so very much inside it that for much of the time we are scarcely aware of it
This existential suffering is the distillation of all the various conditions to which we have referred above  it is the human condition itself
Buddhism offers to the individual human being a religious practice a Way leading to the transcendence of suffering
Buddhist social action arises from this practice and contributes to it
From suffering arises desire to end suffering
The secular humanistic activist sets himself the endless task of satisfying that desire and perhaps hopes to end social suffering by constructing utopias
The Buddhist on the other hand is concerned ultimately with the transformation of desire
Hence he contemplates and experiences social action in a fundamentally different way from the secular activist
This way will not be readily comprehensible to the latter and has helped give rise to the erroneous belief that Buddhism is indifferent to human suffering
One reason why the subject of this pamphlet is so important to Buddhists is that they will have to start here if they are to begin to communicate effectively with nonBuddhist social activists
We should add however that although such communication may not be easy on the intellectual plane at the level of feelings shared in compassionate social action experience together there may be little difficulty
We have already suggested one source of the widespread belief that Buddhism is fatalistic and is indifferent to humanistic social action
This belief also appears to stem from a misunderstanding of the Buddhist law of Karma
In fact there is no justification for interpreting the Buddhist conception of karma as implying quietism and fatalism
The word karma mean volitional action in deeds words and thoughts which may be morally good or bad
To be sure our actions are conditioned but they are not inescapably determined
Though human behavior and thought are too often governed by deeply ingrained habits or powerful impulses still there is always the potentiality of freedom  or to be more exact of a relative freedom of choice
To widen the range of that freedom is the primary task of Buddhist mind training and meditation
The charge of fatalism is sometimes supported by reference to the alleged social backwardness of Asia
But this ignores the fact that such backwardness existed also in the West until comparatively recent times
Surely this backwardness and the alleged fatalistic acceptance of it stem from the specific social and political conditions which were too powerful for wouldbe reformers to contend with
But apart from these historic facts it must be stressed here that the Buddha's message of compassion is certainly not indifferent to human suffering in any form nor do Buddhists think that social misery cannot be remedied at least partly
Though Buddhist realism does not believe in the Golden Age of a perfect society nor in the permanence of social conditions yet Buddhism strongly believes that social imperfections can be reduced by the reduction of greed hatred and ignorance and by compassionate action guided by wisdom
From the many utterances of the Buddha illustrative of our remarks two may be quoted here
 Anguttara Nikaya Fours No

 Samyutta Nikaya Satipatthana Samy No

In this section we have introduced the special and distinctive quality of Buddhist social action
In the remainder of Part One we shall explore this quality further and show how it arises naturally and logically from Buddhist teaching and practice
Individual karmic behavior patterns are created by the struggles of the individual human predicament
They condition the behavior of the individual and in traditional Buddhist teaching the subsequent rounds of birth and rebirth
We suggest however that this karmic inheritance is also expressed as social karma
Specific to time and place different social cultures arise whether of a group a community a social class or a civilization
The young are socialized to their inherited culture
Consciously and unconsciously they assimilate the norms of the approved behavior  what is good what is bad and what is the good life for that culture
The social karma  the establishment of conditioned behavior patterns  of a particular culture is and is not the aggregate of the karma of the individuals who comprise the culture
Individuals share common institutions and belief systems but these are the results of many different wills both in the past and the present rather than the consequence of any single individual action
It is however individual karmic action that links the individual to these institutions and belief systems
Each individual is a lightreflecting jewel in Indra's net at the points where time and space intersect
Each reflects the light of all and all of each
This is the mysticism of sociology or the sociology of mysticism
Human societies too suffer the round of birth and rebirth of revolution and stability
Each age receives the collective karmic inheritance of the last is conditioned by it and yet also struggles to refashion it
And within each human society institutions social classes and subcultures as well as individuals all struggle to establish their identity and perpetuate their existence
Capitalist industrial society has created conditions of extreme impermanence and the struggle with a conflictcreating mood of dissatisfaction and frustration
It would be difficult to imagine any social order for which Buddhism is more relevant and needed
In these conditions egotistical enterprise competitive conflict and the struggle for status become great social virtues while in fact they illustrate the import of the three rootcauses of suffering  greed hatred and delusion
These cravings argues David Brandon have become cemented into all forms of social structures and institutions
People who are relatively successful at accumulating goods and social position wish to ensure that the remain successful Both in intended and unintended ways they erect barriers of education finance and law to protect their property and other interests These structures and their protective institutions continue to exacerbate and amplify the basic human inequalities in housing health care education and income
They reward and encourage greed selfishness and exploitation rather than love sharing and compassion
Certain people's life styles characterized by greed and overconsumption become dependent on the deprivation of the many
The oppressors and oppressed fall into the same trap of continual craving
It should be added that communist revolution and invasion have created conditions and social structures which no less but differently discourage the spiritual search
Thus we see that modern social organization may create conditions of life which not only give rise to objective nonvolitionally caused suffering but also tend to give rise to subjective volitionally caused karmic suffering because they are more likely to stimulate negative karmic action than do other kinds of social organization
Thus some of us are born into social conditions which are more likely to lead us into following the Buddhist way than others
An unskilled woman factory worker in a provincial factory town is for example less likely to follow the Path than a professional person living in the university quarter of the capital city
A property speculator wheeling and dealing his samsaric livelihood anywhere is perhaps even less likely than either of them to do so
However all three may do so
Men and women make their own history but they make it under specific karmic conditions inherited from previous generations collectively as well as individually
The struggle is against nurture as well as nature manifested in the one consciousness
The present generation are living in this world under great pressure under a very complicated system amidst confusion
Everybody talks about peace justice equality but in practice it is very difficult
This is not because the individual person is bad but because the overall environment the pressures the circumstances are so strong so influential
In short Buddhist social action is justified ultimately and above all by the existence of social as well as individual karma
Immediately it is simply concerned with relieving suffering ultimately in creating social conditions which will favor the ending of suffering through the individual achievement of transcendent wisdom
But is it enough to take a beautiful little watering can to a flower dying in sandy sterile soil
This will satisfy only the waterer
But if we muster the necessary plows wells irrigation systems and organized labor what then will become of the spiritual life amongst all this busyness and conflict
We must next consider this fundamental question
Answer YES and NO
Buddhism is essentially pragmatic
Buddhism is in one sense something that one does
It is a guide to the transformation of individual experience
In the traditional Buddhist teaching the individual sets out with a karmic inheritance of established volitions derived from his early life from earlier lives and certainly from his social environment a part of his karmic inheritance
Nevertheless the starting point is the individual experiencing of life here and now
Our train of argument began with the anxiety the profound sense of unease felt by the individual in his naked experience of life in the world when not masked by busyness objectives diversions and other confirmations and distractions
Buddhism teaches that all suffering whether it be anxiety or more explicitly karmic broughtuponourselvessuffering or external suffering accidental and inevitable through war disease old age and so on  arise ultimately from the deluded belief in a substantial and enduring self
In that case what need has the individual Buddhist for concern for other individuals let alone for social action since his prime task is to work on himself in order to dissolve this delusion
Can he only then help others
The answer to these questions is both yes and no
This does not mean halfway between yes and no
It means yes and no
It means that the answer to these fundamental questions of Buddhist social action cannot ultimately be logical or rational
For the Buddhist Middle Way is not the middle between two extremes but the Middle Way which transcends the two extremes in a higher unity
Different traditions of Buddhism offer different paths of spiritual practice
But all depend ultimately upon the individual becoming more deeply aware of the nature of his experience of the world and especially of other people and hence of himself and of the nature of the self
To learn the way of the Buddha is to learn about oneself
To learn about oneself is to forget oneself
To forget oneself is to experience the world as pure object  to let fall one's own mind and body and the selfother mind and body
Meditation both reveals and ultimately calms and clarifies the choppy seas and terrifying depths of the underlying emotional life
All the great traditions of spiritual practice Buddhist  and nonBuddhist  emphasize the importance of periods of withdrawal for meditation and reflection
Their relative importance is not our present concern
However in all Buddhist traditions the training emphasizes a vigilant mindfulness of mental feelings in the course of active daily life as well as in periods of withdrawal
It all advocates the parallel development of habitual forms of ethical behavior
We need not regard life as worth boycotting or indulging in
Life situations are the food of awareness and mindfulness We wear out the shoe of samsara by walking on it through the practice of meditation
The same message comes across forcefully in the Zen tradition For penetrating to the depths of one's true nature nothing can surpass the practice of Zen in the midst of activity The power or wisdom obtained by practicing Zen in the world of action is like a rose that rises from the fire
It can never be destroyed
The rose that rises from the midst of flames becomes all the more beautiful and fragrant the nearer the fire rages
It is open to us if we wish to extend our active daily life to include various possible forms of social action
This offers a strong immediate kind of experience to which we can give our awareness practice
Less immediately it serves to fertilize our meditation  dung for the field of bodhi Thirdly it offers wider opportunities for the cultivation of sila  the habituation to a selfless ethic
The above remarks are about taking social action
They refer to the potential benefits of social action for individual practice
They are less reasons for social action than reasons why a Buddhist should not desist from social action
The mainspring of Buddhist social action lies elsewhere it arises from the heart of a ripening compassion however flawed it still may be by ego needs
This is giving social action with which we shall be concerned in the next section
Social action as a training in selfawareness may be a discipline more appropriate to some individual temperaments and indeed to some cultures and times than to others
We are not concerned with advocating it for all Buddhists but simply to suggesting its legitimacy for such as choose to follow it
For Buddhism has always recognized the diversity of individual temperaments and social cultures that exist and has offered a corresponding diversity of modes of practice
As we have noted the significance of social action as mindfulness training is of course incidental to that profound compassionate impulse which more  or less  leads us to seek the relief of the suffering of others
Our motives may be mixed but to the extent that they are truly selfless they do manifest our potential for Awakening and our relatedness to all beings
Through our practice both in the world and in withdrawn meditation the delusion of a struggling self becomes more and more transparent and the conflicting opposites of good and bad pain and pleasure wealth and poverty oppression and freedom are seen and understood in a Wisdom at once serene and vigilant
This Wisdom partakes of the sensitivity of the heart as well as the clarity of thought
In this Wisdom in the words of RH
Blyth things are beautiful  but not desirable ugly  but not repulsive false  but not rejected
What is inevitable like death is accepted without rage what may not be like war is the subject of action skillful and the more effective because again it is not powered and blinded by rage and hate
We may recognize an oppressor and resolutely act to remove the oppression but we do not hate him
Absence of hatred disgust intolerance or righteous indignation within us is itself a part of our growth towards enlightenment
Such freedom from negative emotions should not be mistaken for indifference passivity compromise loving our enemy instead of hating him or any other of these relativities
This Wisdom transcends the Relativities which toss us this way and that
Instead there is an awareness alert and dispassionate of an infinitely complex reality but always an awareness free of despair of selfabsorbing aggression or of blind dogma an awareness free to act or not to act
Buddhists have their preferences and in the face of such social cataclysms as genocide and nuclear war they are strong preferences but they are not repelled into quietism by them
What has been said above has to be cultivated to perfection by one following the Bodhisattva ideal
We are inspired by it but very few of us can claim to live it
Yet we shall never attain the ideal by turning our backs upon the world and denying the compassionate Buddha nature in us that reaches out to suffering humanity however stained by self love those feelings may be
Only through slowly Wearing out the shoe of samsara in whatever way is appropriate to us can we hope to achieve this ideal and not through some process of incubation
This Great Wisdom exposes the delusion the folly sometimes heroic sometimes base of human struggle in the face of many kinds of suffering
This sense of folly fuses with the sense of shared humanity in the form of compassion
Compassion is the everyday face of Wisdom
In individual spiritual practice though some will incline to a Way of Compassion and others to a Way of Wisdom but finally the two faculties need to be balanced each complementing and ripening the other
To summarize Buddhist or nonBuddhist it is our common humanity our Buddha nature that moves us to compassion and to action for the relief of suffering
These stirrings arise from our underlying relatedness to all living things from being brothers and sisters one to another
Buddhist spiritual practice whether at work or in the meditation room ripens alike the transcendental qualities of Compassion and Wisdom
Social action starkly confronts the actor with the sufferings of others and also confronts him with his own strong feelings which commonly arise from such experience whether they be feelings of pity guilt angry partisanship or whatever
Social action is thus a powerful potential practice for the follower of the Way a skillful means particularly relevant to modern society
Finally it is only some kind of social action that can be an effective and relevant response to the weight of social karma which oppresses humanity and which we all share
All social action is an act of giving but there is a direct act which we call charitable action whether it be the UNESCO Relief Banker's Order or out all night with the destitutes' soup kitchen
Is there anything about Buddhism that should make it less concerned actively to maintain the caring society than is Christianity or humanism
Whoever nurses the sick serves me said the Buddha
In our more complex society does this not include the active advancement and defense of the principles of a national health service
The old phrase as cold as charity recalls numerous possibilities for selfdeception in giving to others and in helping them
Here is opportunity to give out goodness in tangible form both in our own eyes and those of the world
It may also be a temptation to impose our own ideas and standards from a position of patronage
David Brandon who has written so well on the art of helping reminds us that respect is seeing the Buddha nature in the other person
It means perceiving the superficiality of positions of moral authority
The other person is as good as you
However untidy unhygienic poor illiterate and bloodyminded he may seem he is worthy of your respect
He also has autonomy and purpose
He is another form of nature
There are many different ways in which individual Buddhists and their organizations can give help and relieve suffering
However charity begins at home If a Buddhist group or society fails to provide human warmth and active caring for all of its members in their occasional difficulties and troubles  though always with sensitivity and scrupulous respect for privacy  where then is its Buddhism
Where is the Sangha
In our modern industrial society there has been on the one hand a decline in personal and voluntary community care for those in need and on the other too little active concern for the quality and quantity of institutional care financed from the public purse that has to some extent taken its place
One facet of this which may be of particular significance for Buddhists is a failure to recognize adequately and provide for the needs of the dying
In recent years there has been a growing awareness of this problem in North America and Europe and a small number of hospices have been established by Christian and other groups for terminally ill people
However only a start has been made with the problem
The first Buddhist hospice in the West has yet to be opened
And less ambitiously the support of regular visitors could help many lonely people to die with a greater sense of dignity and independence in our general hospitals
Teaching is of course also a form of giving and helping
Indeed one of the two prime offenses in the Mahayana code of discipline is that of withholding the wealth of the Dharma from others
Moreover teaching the Dharma is one of the most valuable sources of learning open to a Buddhist
Here we are concerned primarily with the teaching of the Dharma to newcomers in Buddhism and with the general publicizing of Buddhism among nonBuddhists
Buddhism is by its very nature lacking in the aggressive evangelizing spirit of Christianity or Islam
It is a pragmatic system of sustained and systematic selfhelp practice in which the teacher can do no more than point the way and together with fellow Buddhists provide support warmth and encouragement in a long and lonely endeavor
There is here no tradition of instant conversion and forceful revelation for the enlightenment experience however sudden depends upon a usually lengthy period of careful cultivation
Moreover there is a tolerant tradition of respect for the beliefs and spiritual autonomy of nonBuddhists
Nevertheless a virtue may be cultivated to a fault
Do we not need to find a middle way between proselytizing zeal and aloof indifference
Does not the world cry out for a Noble Truth that leads to the cessation of suffering
The task of teaching the Dharma also gives individual Buddhists an incentive to clarify their ideas in concise explicit everyday terms
And it requires them to respond positively to the varied responses which their teaching will provoke in others
It will be helpful to treat the problem on two overlapping levels and to distinguish between publicizing the Dhamma and introductory teaching for enquirers who interest has thus been awakened
At both the above levels activity is desirable both by a central body of some kind and by local groups
The central body can costeffectively produce for local use introductory texts and study guides speakers' notes audiocassettes slide presentations and study kits combining all of these different types of material
It has the resources to develop correspondence courses such as those run by the Buddhist Society in the United Kingdom which offer a welltried model
And it will perhaps have sufficient prestige to negotiate time on the national radio and television network
Particularly in Western countries there are strong arguments for organizations representing the different Buddhist traditions and tendencies to set up a representative Buddhist Information and Liaison Service for propagating fundamental Buddhism and some first introductions to the different traditions and organizations
It would also provide a general information clearing house for all the groups and organizations represented
It could be financed and controlled through a representative national Buddhist council which with growing confidence between its members and between the different Buddhist organizations which they represented might in due course take on additional functions
Certainly in the West there is the prospect of a great many different Buddhist flowers blooming whether oriental or new strains developed in the local culture
This is to be welcomed but the kind of body we propose will become a necessity to avoid confusion for the outsider and to work against any tendency to sectarianism of a kind from which Buddhism has been relatively free
Local groups will be able to draw upon the publicity and teaching resources of national centers and adapt these to the needs of local communities
Regular meetings of such groups may amount to no more than half a dozen people meeting in a private house
Sensitively handled it would be difficult to imagine a better way of introducing a newcomer to the Dharma
Such meetings are worthy of wide local publicity
A really strong local base exists where there is a resident Buddhist community of some kind with premises convenient for meetings and several highly committed workers
Unfortunately such communities will understandably represent a particular Buddhist tradition or tendency and this exclusiveness may be less helpful to the newcomer than a local group in which he or she may have the opportunity to become acquainted with the different Buddhist traditions represented in the membership and in the program of activity
In many countries the schools provide brief introductions to the world's great religions
Many teachers do not feel sufficiently knowledgeable about introducing Buddhism to their pupils and may be unaware of suitable materials even where these do exist
There may be opportunities here for local groups and certainly the Information Service suggested above would have work to do here
Finally the method of introductory teaching employed in some Buddhist centers leaves much to be desired both on educational grounds and as Buddhist teaching
The Buddha always adapted his teaching to the particular circumstances of the individual learner he sometimes opened with a question about the enquirer's occupation in life and built his teaching upon the answer to this and similar questions
True learning and teaching has as its starting point a problem or experience posed by the learner even if this be no more than a certain illdefined curiosity
It is there that teacher and learner must begin
The teacher starts with the learner's thoughts and feelings and helps him or her to develop understanding and awareness
This is of course more difficult than a standard lecture which begins and ends with the teacher's thoughts and feelings and which may in more sense than one leave little space for the learner
It will exclude the teacher from any learning
It follows that unless the teacher is truly inspiring the Dharma talk is best used selectively to introduce and stimulate discussion or to summarize and consolidate what has been learned
Dharma teachers must master the arts of conducting open discussion groups in which learners can gain much from one another and can work through an emotional learning situation beyond the acquisition of facts about Buddhism
Discussion groups have become an important feature of many lay Buddhist and social action organizations in different parts of the world
They are the heart for example of the Japanese mass organization Rissho Kosei Kai which explores problems of work the family and social and economic problems
Political power may manifest and sustain social and economic structures which breed both material deprivation and spiritual degradation for millions of men and women
In many parts of the world it oppresses a wide range of social groupings  national and racial minorities women the poor homosexuals liberal dissidents and religious groups
Ultimately political power finds its most terrible expression in war which reaches now to the possibility of global annihilation
For both the oppressors and the oppressed whether in social strife or embattled nations karmic delusion is deepened
Each group or nation emphasizes its differences distinguishing them from its opponents each projects its own shortcomings upon them makes them the repository of all evil and rallies round its own vivid illusions and bloodwarming hates
Collective hating whether it be the raised fist or prejudice concealed in a quiet community is a heady liquor
Allied with an ideology hate in any form will not depart tomorrow or next year
Crowned with delusive idealism it is an awesome and murderous folly
And even when victory is achieved the victors are still more deeply poisoned by the hate that carried them to victory
Both the revolution and the counterrevolution consume their own children
Buddhism's Three Fires of delusion hatred and illwill and greed and grasping surely burn nowhere more fiercely
Contrariwise political power may be used to fashion and sustain a society whose citizens are free to live in dignity and harmony and mutual respect free of the degradation of poverty and war
In such a society of good heart all men and women find encouragement and support in making if they will the best use of their human condition in the practice of wisdom and compassion
This is the land of good karma  not the end of human suffering but the beginning of the end the bodhisattvaland the social embodiment of sila
This is not to be confused with the belief common among the socially and politically oppressed that if power could be seized then personal individual ideological change will inevitably follow
This absolutely deterministic view of conditioning is as onesided as the idea of a society of individuals each struggling with only his own personal karma in a private bubble hermetically sealed off from history and from other people
Political action thus involves the Buddhist ideal of approaching each situation without prejudice but with deserved circumspection in questions of power and conflict social oppression and social justice
These social and political conflicts are the great public samsaric driving energies of our life to which an individual responds with both aggression and selfrepression
The Buddha Dharma offers the possibility of transmuting the energies of the individual into Wisdom and Compassion
At the very least in faith and with good heart a start can be made
Buddhists are thus concerned with political action first in the direct relief of nonvolitionally caused suffering now and in the future and secondly with the creation of social karmic conditions favorable to the following of the Way that leads to the cessation also of volitionallycaused suffering the creation of a society of a kind which tends to the ripening of wisdom and compassion rather than the withering of them
In the third place political action turbulent and ambiguous is perhaps the most potent of the action meditations
It is perhaps because of this potency that some Buddhist organizations ban political discussion of any kind even at a scholarly level and especially any discussion of social action
There are circumstances in which this may be a sound policy
Some organizations and some individuals may not wish to handle such an emotionally powerful experience which may prove to be divisive and stir up bad feeling which cannot be worked upon in any positive way
This division would particularly tend to apply to party politics On the other hand such a discussion may give an incomparable opportunity to work through conflict to a shared wisdom
Different circumstances suggest different skillful means but a dogmatic policy of total exclusion is likely to be ultimately unhelpful
In this connection it is worth noting that any kind of social activity which leads to the exercise of power or conflict may stir up the fires in the same way as overtly political activity
Conflict within a Buddhist organization is cut from the same cloth as conflict in a political assembly and may be just as heady but the Buddhist context could make such an activity a much more difficult and delusive meditation subject
The danger of dishonest collusion may be greater than that of honest collusion
The dogmatism and vehemence with which some Buddhists denounce and proscribe all political involvement is the same sad attitude as the dogmatism and vehemence of the politicians which they so rightly denounce
To be lost in revolution or reform or conservatism is to be lost in samsara and the realm of the angry warrior deluded by his power and his selfrighteousness
To turn one's back upon all this is to be lost in an equally false idea of nirvana  the realm of the gods no less deluded by spiritual power and righteousness You do not truly speak of fire if your mouth does not get burnt
Effective social action on any but the smallest scale will soon involve the Buddhist in situations of power and conflict of political power
It may be the power of office in a Buddhist organization
It may be the unsought for leadership of an action group protesting against the closing of an old people's day care center
It may be the organizing of a fundraising movement to build a Buddhist hospice for care of the dying
It may be membership of a local government council with substantial welfare funds
It may be joining an illegal dissident group
In all these cases the Buddhist takes the tiger  his own tiger  by the tail
Some of the above tigers are bigger than others but all are just as fierce
Hence a Buddhist must be mindful of the strong animal smell of political power and be able to contain and convert the valuable energy which power calls up
A sharp cutting edge is given into his hands
Its use we must explore in the sections which follow
Buddhism and politics meet at two levels  theory and practice
Buddhism has no explicit body of social and political theory comparable to its psychology or metaphysics
Nevertheless a Buddhist political theory can be deduced primarily from basic Buddhism from Dharma
Secondly it can be deduced from the general orientation of scriptures which refer explicitly to a bygone time
We have already argued however that this can be done only in a limited and qualified way
Whatever form it may take Buddhist political theory like other Buddhist theory is just another theory
As it stands in print it stands in the world of the conditioned it is of samsara
It is its potential its spiritual implications which make it different from secular theory
When skillfully practiced it becomes a spiritual practice
As always Buddhist theory is like a label on a bottle describing the contents which sometimes is mistaken for the contents by zealous labelreaders
In that way we can end up with a lot of politics and very little Buddhism
This is not to decry the value of a Buddhist social and political theory  only its misuse
We have only begun to apply Buddhism as a catalyst to the general body of Western social science and most of the work so far has been in psychology
Such work in allied fields could be extremely helpful to Buddhists and nonBuddhists alike
The writings of some Buddhists from Sri Lanka Burma and elsewhere offer interesting examples of attempts to relate Buddhism to nationalism and Marxism
Earlier in the century Anagarika Dharmapala stressed the social teaching of the Buddha and its value in liberating people from materialistic preoccupations
U Nu the eminent Burmese Buddhist statesman argued that socialism follows naturally from the ethical and social teachings of the Buddha and another Burmese leader U Ba Swe held that Marxism is relative truth Buddhism absolute truth
This theme has been explored more recently in Trevor Ling's book Buddha Marx and God and Michal Edwarde's In the Blowing out of a Flame
Both are stimulating and controversial books
EF
Schumacher's celebrated book Small is Beautiful has introduced what he terms Buddhist economics and its urgent relevance to the modern world to many thousand of nonBuddhists
Of this we shall say more in a later section on the Buddhist good society
Buddhist social and political theory and policy can only be mentioned in passing in this pamphlet although we have earlier introduced the idea of social karma as of central importance
We are instead concerned here with problems and questions arising in the practice of social and political work by Buddhists and the nature of that work
The Buddhist faced with political thought let alone political action is straightaway plunged in the turbulent stream of conflict and partisanship and right and wrong
Let the reader perhaps prompted by the morning newspaper select and hold in his mind some particular controversial public issue or public figure
Now how does your Buddhism feel please
How does it feel when again some deeply held conviction is roughly handled at a Buddhist meeting or in a Buddhist journal
The tears and anguish that follow arguments and quarrels said the Buddha the arrogance and pride and the grudges and insults that go with them are all the result of one thing
They come from having preferences from holding things precious and dear
Insults are born out of arguments and grudges are inseparable with quarrels Similarly in the words of one of the Zen patriarchs The conflict between longing and loathing is the mind's worse disease
In all our relationships as Buddhists we seek to cultivate a spirit of openness cooperation goodwill and equality
Nonetheless we may not agree with another's opinions and in the final analysis this divergence could have to do even with matters of life and death
But hopefully we shall be mindful and honest about how we think and with what we feel and how our opponent thinks and feels
In such controversies are we each to confirm our own ego
Or each to benefit from the other in the search for wise judgment
Moreover in the words of the Dalai Lama when a person criticizes you and exposes your faults only then are you able to discover your faults and make amends
So your enemy is your greatest friend because he is the person who gives you the test you need for your inner strength your tolerance your respect for others Instead of feeling angry with or hatred towards such a person one should respect him and be grateful to him
We are one with our adversary in our common humanity we are two in our divisive conflict
We should be deluded if we were to deny either  if we were to rush either to compromise or to uncompromising struggle
Our conflict and our humanity may be confirmed or denied at any point along that line of possibilities which links the extremes but ultimately it will be resolved in some other less explicit sense
Sangharakshita expresses this paradox in his observation that it is not enough to sympathize with something to such an extent that one agrees with it
If necessary one must sympathize to such an extent that one disagrees
Zen Master Dogen advised that when you say something to someone he may not accept it but do not try to make him understand it rationally
Don't argue with him just listen to his objections until he himself finds something wrong with them Certainly we shall need much time and space for such wisdom and compassion as may inform us in such situations
If we do fight may our wisdom and compassion honor both our adversary and ourselves whether in compromise victory or defeat
 Shiki p

Our Small Mind clings to delusions of security and permanence
It finds neither of these in the world where on the contrary it experiences a sense of ambiguity complexity and uncertainty which it finds intolerable and which make it very angry when it is obliged to confront them
Small Mind prefers to see social economic and political phenomena in terms of black and white or Left and Right It likes to take sides and it clings to social dogmas both sophisticated and simple

To the extent that we have achieved Big Mind we perceive with equanimity what Small Mind recoils from as intolerable
We are freer to see the world as it is in all the many colors of the rainbow each merging imperceptibly into the next
In place of clinging to a few black white and gray compartments scrutiny is freed encouraged by the Buddha's discriminating and differentiating attitude

We shall not be surprised then that the personal map which guides the Wise through social and political realities may turn out to be disturbingly unconventional
Their reluctance readily to take sides arises not from quietism or an attachment to a compromise or a belief in the unreality of conflict as is variously the case with those guided by mere rules
On the contrary they may not even sit quietly throwing soothing generalizations into the ring as is expected of the religious
This seemingly uncomfortable seemingly marginal stance simply reflects a reality which is experienced with equanimity
However it does not require much equanimity to discover the deeper truths which underlie many current conventional truths
Conventional politics for example run from left to right from radicals through liberals and conservatives to fascists
Some radicals are for example as dogmatic and authoritarian in practice as fascists and to their ultimate detriment they hate no less mightily
And again some conservatives are equally dogmatic because of an awareness of the subtle organic nature of society and hence the danger of attempts at instant restructuring
Similarly an ideology such as Marxism may be highly complex but has been conveniently oversimplified even by quite well educated partisans both those for and those against the theory
The present Dalai Lama is one of those who have attempted to disentangle an authentic Marxism which he believes is not without relevance to the problems of a feudal theocracy of the kind that existed in Tibet from the sort one sees in countless countries claiming to be Marxist but which are mixing up Marxism and their national political interests and also their thirst for world hegemony
The Wise person sees clearly because he does not obscure his own light he does not cast the shadow of himself over the situation
However even an honest perception of complexity commonly paralyzes action with Yes that's all very well but On the other hand it is also true that Contemplative wisdom is a precious thing but true Wisdom reveals itself in positive action  or inaction Though a person may through Clear Comprehension of Purpose keep loyal to the social ideal his Clear Comprehension of Suitability may counsel inaction or just waiting
In a social action situation the complexity and ambiguity to which we refer is strongly felt as ethical quandary uncertainty as to what might be the best course of action
Even in small organizations all power is potentially corrupting the power wielded is soon lost in a thicket of relative ethics of means and ends confused of greater and lesser evils of long term and short term goals
This is not a game It is the terrible reality of power wealth and suffering in the world and the confusing of good and delusion
It cannot be escaped it can only be suffered through
We cannot refuse life's most difficult problems because we have not yet attained to Wisdom
We simply have to do our mindful and vigilant best without guilt or blame
That is all we have to do
The First Precept of Buddhism is to abstain from taking life
But it must be made clear that the Buddhist Precepts are not commandments they are good resolutions sincere aspirations voluntarily undertaken
They are signposts
They suggest to us how the truly Wise behave beyond any sense of self and other
Evil springs from delusion about our true nature as human beings and it takes the characteristic forms of hatred aggression and driving acquisitiveness
These behaviors feed upon themselves and become strongly rooted not only in individuals but in whole cultures
Total war is no more than their most spectacular and bloody expression
In Buddhism the cultivation of sila by attempting to follow the Precepts is an aspiration toward breaking this karmic cycle
It is a first step towards dissolving the egocentricity of headstrong willfulness and cultivating heartfelt awareness of others
The Precepts invite us to loosen the grip unclench the fist and to aspire to openhandedness and openheartedness
Whether and to what extent he keeps the Precepts is the responsibility of each individual
But he needs to be fully aware of what he is doing
The karmic force of violent behavior will be affected by the circumstances in which it occurs
For example a diminished responsibility may be argued in the case of conscripts forced to kill by an aggressive government
And there is surely a difference between wars of conquest and wars of defense
Ven
Walpola Rahula described a war of national independence in Sri Lanka in the nd century BC conducted under the slogan Not for kingdom but for Buddhism and concludes that to fight against a foreign invader for national independence became an established Buddhist tradition since freedom was essential to the spiritual as well as the material progress of the community
We may deplore the historic destruction of the great Indian Buddhist heritage in the middleages undefended against the Mongol and Muslim invaders
It is important to note however that according to Buddhism there is nothing that can be called a 'just war'  which is only a false term coined and put into circulation to justify and excuse hatred cruelty violence and massacre
It is an unfortunate fact well documented by eminent scholars such as Edward Conze and Trevor Ling that not only have avowedly Buddhist rulers undertaken violence and killing but also monks of all traditions in Buddhism
Nonetheless Buddhism has no history of specifically religious wars that is wars fought to impose Buddhism upon reluctant believers
Violence and killing are deeply corrupting in their effect upon all involved and Buddhists will therefore try to avoid direct involvement in violent action or in earning their living in a way that directly or indirectly does violence
The Buddha specifically mentioned the trade in arms in living beings and flesh
The problem is whether in today's global village we are not all in some degree responsible for war and violence to the extent that we refrain from any effort to diminish them
Can we refrain from killing a garden slug and yet refrain for fear of political involvement from raising a voice against the nuclear arms race or the systematic torture of prisoners of conscience in many parts of the world
These are questions which are disturbing to some of those Buddhists who have a sensitive social and moral conscience
This is understandable
Yet a wellinformed Buddhist must not forget that moral responsibility or karmic guilt originate from a volitional and voluntary act affirming the harmful character of the act
If that affirmation is absent neither the responsibility for the act not karmic guilt rest with those who through some form of pressure participate in it
A slight guilt however might be involved if such participants yield too easily even to moderate pressure or do not make use of escape routes existing in these situations
But failure to protest publicly against injustice or wrongdoings does not necessarily constitute a participation in evil
Voices of protest should be raised when there is a chance that they are heard
But voices in the wilderness are futile and silence instead is the better choice
It is futile indeed if a few wellmeaning heads try to run against walls of rock stone that may yield only to bulldozers
It is a sad fact that there are untold millions of our fellowhumans who do affirm violence and use it for a great variety of reasons
They are unlikely to be moved by our protests or preachings being entirely obsessed by divers fanaticisms or power urges
This has to be accepted as an aspect of existential suffering
Yet there are still today some opportunities and nations where a Buddhist can and should work for the cause of peace and reducing violence in human life
No efforts should be spared to convince people that violence does not solve problems or conflicts
The great evil of violence is its separation unto death of us and them of my righteousness and your evil
If you counter violence with violence you will deepen that separation through thoughts of bitterness and revenge
The Dhammapada says Never by hatred is hatred appeased but it is appeased by kindness
This is an eternal truth Buddhist nonviolent social action seeks to communicate persuade and startle by moral example
One should conquer anger through kindness wickedness through goodness selfishness through charity and falsehood through truthfulness
The Buddha intervened personally on the field of battle as in the dispute between the Sakyas and Koliyas over the waters of the Rohini
Since that time history has provided us with a host of examples of religiously inspired nonviolent social action skillfully adapted to particular situations
These are worthy of deep contemplation
Well known is Mahatma Gandhi's nonviolent struggle against religious intolerance and British rule in India and also the Rev
Martin Luther King's black people's civil rights movement in the United States
A familiar situation for many people today is the mass demonstration against authority which may be conducted either peacefully or violently
As Robert Aitken Roshi has observed the point of disagreement even the most fundamental disagreement is still more superficial than the place of our common life He recalls the case of a friend who organized an antinuclear demonstration at a naval base passing through a small town in which virtually every household had at least one person who gained his livelihood by working at the base
Consequently when the friend visited every single house before the demonstration he hardly expected to win the people over to his cause
But he did convince them that he was a human being who was willing to listen to them and who had faith in them as human beings
We finally had our demonstration with four thousand people walking through this tiny community nobody resisted us nobody threw rocks
They just stood and watched September p

And yet again situations may arise in which folly is mutually conditioned but where we must in some sense take sides in establishing the ultimate responsibility
If we do not speak out then we bow only to the conditioned and accept the endlessness of suffering and the perpetuation of evil karma
The following lines were written a few days after Archbishop Oscar Romero of the Central American republic of El Salvador had been shot dead on the steps of his chapel
Romero had roundly condemned the armed leftist rebel factions for their daily killings and extortions
However he also pointed out that these were the reactions of the common people being used as a production force under the management of a privileged society The gap between poverty and wealth is the main cause of our trouble And sometimes it goes further It is the hatred in the heart of the worker for his employer If I did not denounce the killings and the way the army removes people and ransacks peasants' homes I should be acquiescing in the violence March 
Finally there is the type of situation in which the truly massive folly of the conflict and of the contrasting evils may leave nothing to work with and there is space left only for personal sacrifice to bear witness to that folly
Such was the choice of the Buddhist monks who burnt themselves to death in the Vietnam war  surely one of the most savage and despairing conflicts of modern times in which a heroic group of Buddhists had for some time struggled in vain to establish an alternative third force
The social order to which Buddhist social action is ultimately directed must be one that minimizes nonvolitionally caused suffering whether in mind or body and which also offers encouraging conditions for its citizens to see more clearly into their true nature and overcome their karmic inheritance
The Buddhist way is with its compassion its equanimity its tolerance its concern for selfreliance and individual responsibility the most promising of all the models for the New Society which are an on offer
What is needed are political and economic relations and a technology which will
Help people to overcome egocenteredness through cooperation with others in place of either subordination and exploitation or the consequent sense of righteous struggle against all things
Offer to each a freedom which is conditional only upon the freedom and dignity of others so that individuals may develop a selfreliant responsibility rather than being the conditioned animals of institutions and ideologies

The emphasis should be on the undogmatic acceptance of a diversity of tolerably compatible material and mental ways whether of individuals or of whole communities
There are no short cuts to utopia whether by social engineering or theocracy
The good society towards which we should aim should simply provide a means an environment in which different ways appropriate to different kinds of people may be cultivated in mutual tolerance and understanding
A prescriptive commonwealth of saints is totally alien to Buddhism
The good society will concern itself primarily with the material and social conditions for personal growth and only secondarily and dependently with material production
It is noteworthy that the th Dalai Lama on his visit to the West in saw nothing wrong with material progress provided man takes precedence over progress
In fact it has been my firm belief that in order to solve human problems in all their dimensions we must be able to combine and harmonize external material progress with inner mental development The Dalai Lama contrasted the many problems like poverty and disease lack of education in the East with the West in which the living standard is remarkably high which is very important very good Yet he notes that despite these achievements there is mental unrest pollution overcrowding and other problems
Our very life itself is a paradox contradictory in many senses whenever you have too much of one thing you have problems created by that
You always have extremes and therefore it is important to try and find the middle way to balance the two
EF
Schumacher has concisely expressed the essence of Buddhist economics as follows
Schumacher then outlines a Buddhist economics in which production would be based on a middle range technology yielding on the one hand an adequate range of material goods and on the other a harmony with the natural environment and its resources

The above principles suggest some kind of diverse and politically decentralized society with cooperative management and ownership of productive wealth
It would be conceived on a human scale whether in terms of size and complexity of organization or of environmental planning and would use modern technology selectively rather than being used by it in the service of selfish interests
In Schumacher's words It is a question of finding the right path of development the Middle Way between materialist heedlessness and traditionalist immobility in short of finding 'Right Livelihood' Clearly all the above must ultimately be conceived on a world scale
Today we have become so interdependent and so closely connected with each other that without a sense of universal responsibility irrespective of different ideologies and faiths our very existence or survival would be difficult
This statement underlines the importance of Buddhist internationalism and of social policy and social action conceived on a world scale
The above is not offered as some kind of blueprint for utopia
Progress would be as conflictridden as the spiritual path of the ordinary Buddhist  and the world may never get there anyway
However Buddhism is a very practical and pragmatic kind of idealism and there is as always really no alternative but to try
A systematic review of the different kinds of Buddhist organization for social action which have appeared in different parts of the world is beyond the scope of this pamphlet
Some considerable research would be required and the results would merit at least a separate pamphlet
Later we shall introduce three contrasting movements which are in some sense or others examples of Buddhist social action
Each is related more or less strongly to the particular social culture in which it originated and all should therefore be studied as illustrative examplesincontext and not necessarily as export models for other countries
They are however very suggestive and two of the three have spread beyond their country of origin
Social action needs to be organized and practiced in such a way as to build upon its potential for spiritual practice and to guard against its seductions
Collective labor with fellowBuddhists raises creative energy encourages positive attitudes and engenders a strong spirit of fellowship
The conflicts disagreements obstacles and discouragements which will certainly be met along the way offer rich meditation experiences and opportunity for personal growth so long as scrupulous mindfulness is sustained
The meditator will learn as much about himself in a contentious meeting as he will in the meditation hall
Both kinds of experience are needed and they complement one another
Social action is a great ripener of compassion out of the bitterness of the experiences which it commonly offers
Yet like nothing else it can stir up the partisan emotions and powerfully exult the opinionated ego
The busy patronizing evangelist not only gives an undercover boost to his own ego he also steals another person's responsibility for himself
However these dangers are comparatively speaking gross and tangible when set against the no less egoenhancing seduction of OtherWorldliness and dharmaridden pietism
Such spiritual materialism as Chogyam Trungpa calls it has long been recognized as the ultimate and most elusive kind of selfdeception which threatens the follower of the spiritual path
The seduction lies in being carried away by our good works in becoming subtly attached to the new goals and enterprises we have set ourselves so that no space is left in our busily structured hours in which some saving strength of the spirit can abide
Here is opportunity to learn how to dance with time  the river in which we go fishing as Thoreau called it instead of neatly packaging away our lives in it or letting it dictate us
And in committee lies the opportunity of slowly turning the hot lusty partisanship of selfopinionated confirmation into the kind of space and dialogue in which we can communicate and can even learn to love our most implacable opponents
It is therefore important that both the individual and the group set aside regular periods for meditation with periods of retreat at longer intervals
It is important also that experience and the feel of the social action project should as far as possible be shared openly within the Buddhist group
In our view the first social action of the isolated Buddhist is not to withhold the Dharma from the community in which he or she lives
However modest one's own understanding of the Dharma there is always some first step that can be taken and something to be learned from taking that step
Even two or three can be a greater light to one another and many forms of help are often available from outside such as working together through a correspondence course for example or listening to borrowed audiocassettes
For the reasons given earlier it is important that social action projects should where possible be undertaken by a Buddhist group rather than each individual doing his own thing And since the Buddhist group will in most Western countries be small and isolated it is important that the work be undertaken in cooperation with likeminded nonBuddhists
This will both use energies to better effect since social action can be very time and energyconsuming and create an even better learning situation for all involved
Forms of social action which are high on explicit giving of service and low on conflict and power situations will obviously be easier to handle and to give oneself to though still difficult in other respects
For example organizing and participating in a rota of visits to lonely longstay hospital patients would contrast in this respect with involvement in any kind of local community development project
In this section we are concerned with the significance of Buddhist residential communities both as manifestations and examples of the good society and as centers of social outreach
We may distinguish four possible kinds of activity here
In the first place any healthy spiritual community does by its very existence offer to the world a living example not only of the Good Life but also of the Good Society
Certain spiritual values are made manifest in its organization and practice in a way not possible in print or in talk
On the other hand the purely contemplative and highly exclusive community can do this only in some limited special and arguable sense
In the second place where the members of such a community undertake work as a community economically then to that extent the community becomes a more realistic microcosm of what has to be done in the wider world and a more realistic model and example of how it might best be done
Thirdly such communities are commonly teaching and training communities
This may be so in formal terms in that they offer classes and short courses and also longer periods of training in residence in which the trainees become veritable community members
And it may be true in terms of the openness of the community to outsiders who wish for the present to open up their communication with the community through some participation in work ritual teaching meditation
Fourthly the community might involve itself in various kinds of outside community service development or action beyond that of teaching and beyond the necessarily commercial services which may sustain the community's Right Livelihood Examples might be running a hospice for the terminally ill providing an information and advice center on a wide range of personal and social problems for the people of the local community and assisting  and maybe leading  in various aspects of a socially deprived local community
The spiritual community thus becomes more strongly a community within a community
In this kind of situation would the spiritual community draw strength from its service to the social the lay community creating an upward spiral of energy
Or would the whole scheme founder through the progressive impoverishment and corruption of the spiritual community in a vicious downward spiral
In the Eastern Buddhist monastic tradition the first and third aspects are present
In contrast to Christian monasticism monks are not necessarily expected to be monks for life and the monasteries may have an important function as seminaries and as long and short stay teaching and training centers
On the other hand economically such communities are commonly strongly sustained by what is predominantly Buddhist society
In the West there are now similar communities in all the main Buddhist traditions
Although these are to some extent sustained also by lay Buddhist contributions their income from training and teaching fees may be important
And whether it is or not it is clear that their actual and potential training and teaching role is likely to be very important in nonBuddhist societies in which there is a growing interest in Buddhism
A good example is the Manjusri Institute in the United Kingdom which is now seeking official recognition for the qualifications which it awards and which could eventually become as much part of the national education system as say a Christian theological college
Such an integration of Buddhist activity into the pattern of national life in the West is of course most welcome and opens up many new opportunities for making the Dharma more widely understood
The above developments may be compared with the communities which form the basis of the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order
In these our second aspect that of Right Livelihood is found in addition to the first and third
The FWBO was founded in in the United Kingdom by the Ven
Maha Sthavira Sangharakshita a Londoner who spent twenty years in India as a Buddhist monk and returned with the conviction that the perennial Buddhism always expresses itself anew in each new age and culture
The FWBO is concerned with building what it calls the New Society in the minds and practice of its members
Opening the FWBO's London Buddhist Center Ven
Sangharakshita was reported as saying that the New Society was a spiritual community composed of individuals who are truly human beings selfaware emotionally positive people whose energies flow freely and spontaneously who accept responsibility for their own growth and development in particular by providing three things firstly a residential spiritual community secondly a cooperative Right Livelihood situation and thirdly a public center offering classes especially in meditation
The FWBO does in fact follow a traditional Mahayana spiritual practice but within this framework it does have as the quotation above suggests a strong Western flavor
This owes much to the eleven cooperatives by which many of the eighteen autonomous urban communities support themselves
These businesses are run by teams of community members as a means of personal and group development
They include a printing press graphic design business photographic and film studio metalwork forge and shops and cafes
Membership of the communities varies between four and thirty people and often the community members pool their earnings in a common purse The FWBO comprises Order members Mitras and Friends
Each community is autonomous and has its own distinctive character
Attached to communities are seven Centers through which the public are offered talks courses and instruction in meditation
Regular meetings of Chairmen of Centers and other senior Order members supported by three central secretariats are planned for the future but it is not intended to abridge the autonomy of the constituent communities each of which is a separately registered legal body
The FWBO is growing very rapidly not only in the United Kingdom but also overseas with branches in Finland the Netherlands New Zealand Australia the USA and interestingly in India where a sustained effort is being made to establish centers
We refer in this section to the fourth aspect distinguished early in the previous sectionb namely various possible kinds of service and support which may be given by organized Buddhists to the local community in which they live
The FWBO does not undertake this kind of activity and in fact there do not appear to be any major examples of it in the West
Arguably if this kind of work is undertaken at all it might more likely be initiated by a nonresidential lay Buddhist group whose members as householders and local workers may have strong roots in their town or neighborhood
As an example of what can be achieved by a relatively small group of this kind we quote the following Autumn p

Peter Donahoe writes 'We have endeavored to provide a center which can function in relation to a whole range of different needs a place of charity and compassion where all are welcomed regardless of race color sex or creed welcomed to come to terms with their suffering in a way which is relative to each individual' However on the whole it is only in the East in societies in which Buddhist culture is predominant or important that there are sufficiently committed Buddhists to play a part in extensive community service and development projects
For example in Japan there are several such movements and we shall refer in the next section to one example  Soka Gakkai a movement which also plays a number of other roles
We must first however turn our attention to a preeminent example of a Buddhistinspired movement for community development the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement of Sri Lanka
Sarvodaya means awakening of all and Shramadana means sharing of labor making a gift of time thought and energy
This well describes what is basically a village selfhelp movement inspired by Buddhist principles and founded in as part of a general national awakening
It is now by far the largest nongovernmental voluntary organization in Sri Lanka
The Movement learned in its earlier days how very important noneconomic factors are in community development and its projects combine spiritualcultural with socioeconomic development
One important element that cannot be improved upon in Buddhist villages in particular is the unique place of the temple and the Buddhist monk the one as the meeting place the other as the chief exponent of this entire process Founded on traditional culture Sarvodaya Shramadana is ultimately a nonviolent revolutionary movement for changing man and society At the same time it aims to retain the best in the traditional social and cultural fabric of the community
Village development projects are undertaken on the initiative of the villagers themselves
To begin with the community is made aware of the historic causes that led to the impoverishment and disintegration of the community and of its cultural and traditional values
Economic regeneration is only possible if there is a restoration of social values within the village
It is emphasized that the community itself must take the initiative in removing obstacles to development and in learning the new skills needed to carry through a change of program
The volunteers brought in to help serve only as a catalyst
Action is focused initially on Shramadana Camps in which villagers and outside volunteers work together upon some community project such as a road or irrigation channel
The experience of such Camps helps to develop a sense of community
Local leaders working through village groups of farmers of youth of mothers and others emerge to take increasing responsibility for a more or less comprehensive development program
This may include preschool care for the underfives informal education for adults health care programs and community kitchens with cooperation with State agencies as appropriate
By Sarvodaya was reaching villages and was running preschools
Essential to these community development programs in Sarvodaya Shramadana's system of Development Education programs operating through six Institutes and through the Gramodaya centers each of which coordinates development work in some twenty to thirty villages
The movement also provides training in selfemployment for the youth who compose the largest sector of the unemployed
Although the main thrust of activity has been in rural areas the Movement is also interested in urban community development where conditions are favorable and there is local interest
The main material support for the movement comes from the villagers themselves although financial and material assistance has also been received from overseas
It is argued that the basic principles of Sarvodaya Shramadana can be adapted to developed as well as developing countries and Sarvodaya groups are already active in West Germany the Netherlands Japan and Thailand
The rich countries also have to helped to change their purely materialistic outlook and strike a balance with spiritual values added to the materialistic values of their own communities so that together all can build a new One World social order
Although there may be exceptional circumstances in certain countries as a general rule there are strong arguments against Buddhist groups explicitly aligning themselves with any political party
It is not just that to do so would be irrelevantly divisive
As we have noted in section there are deeper underlying social and political realities which crosscut the conventional political spectrum of left right and center
Nevertheless Buddhism like other great religious systems inevitably has political implications
To some extent these seem to be relatively clear and in other senses they are arguable and controversial
Religion has its own contribution to make to politics and ultimately it is the only contribution to politics that really matters
It has failed both politically and as religion it falls either into the extreme of being debased by politics or of rejecting any kind of political involvement as a kind of fearful taboo
The fear of creating dissension among fellow Buddhists is understandable but if Buddhists cannot handle conflict in a positive and creative way then who can
On closer examination we shall find that it is not politics that requires our vigilance so much as the problems of power and conflict inherent in politics
Indeed a better use of the term political would be to describe any kind of power and conflict situation
In this sense a Buddhist organization may be more intensely and unhappily political in managing its spiritual and practical affairs than if and when its members are discussing such an outside matter as conventional politics
Indeed any such discussion of social and political questions may be banned by a Buddhist society which may be in fact intensely political in terms of underlying power and conflict with which its members have not really come to terms
All kinds of organizations have problems of power and conflict and derive their positive dynamism from the good management of these but the dangers of selfdelusion seem to be greater in religious bodies
When we meet Buddhists and get to know them we find that even when they do not express explicit opinions on political and social matters it is clear from other things they say that some are inclined to a conservative establishment stance some are of a radical inclination and others more dissident still
Since the diversities of THIS and THAT exist everywhere else in the conditioned world even Buddhists cannot pretend to exclude themselves from such disturbing distinctions
This is not really in question
What is in question is their ability to handle their differences openly and with Buddhist maturity
And as we have tried to show earlier this maturity implies a progressive diminution of emotional attachment to views of THIS and THAT so that we no longer need either in order to sustain our identity in the world and have in some sense transcended our clinging by a higher understanding
We still carry THIS or THAT but lightly and transparently and manageably  without egoweight
If we did not still carry them how could we feel the Compassion for samsara for ourselves as well as others
Alan Watts wrote a suitably controversial little pamphlet on this subject entitled Beat Zen Square Zen and Zen
The following passage may be found helpful to our present discussion what the author has to say about Zen is surely no less applicable to Buddhism as a whole
Watts argues that the Westerner who wishes to understand Zen deeply must understand his own culture so thoroughly that he is no longer swayed by its premises unconsciously
He must really have come to terms with the Lord God Jehovah and with his HebrewChristian conscience so he can take it or leave it without fear or rebellion
He must be free of the itch to justify himself
Lacking this his Zen will be either 'beat' or 'square' either a revolt from the culture and social order or a new form of stuffiness and respectability
For Zen is above all the liberation of the mind from conventional thought and this is something utterly different from rebellion against convention on the one hand or adapting foreign conventions on the other
In the West individual Buddhists have been particularly attracted to pacifist disarmament and environmentalist movements and parties
These movements have profound concerns which arguably undercut the expediencies of conventional party politics
On the other hand are they not made the more attractive by a certain political innocence as yet uncorrupted and unblessed by the realities of power
And do they not also underestimate the karma of power and property
However in Western and other nonBuddhist countries Buddhist political action of any kind is little more than speculative
Buddhists are few in number and their energies are necessarily fully occupied with learning and teaching
Teaching is the major form of social action and we have already discussed certain social action implications of the spiritual community
Social action at most verges upon certain possible kinds of service to the wider community or even participation in community development
We have already suggested the merit of such enterprises
But as to politics using the word conventionally in the West and at the present time that can be no more than a matter for discussion in Buddhist groups
As always individual Buddhists and perhaps informal groups will decide for themselves about political action or inaction
However in countries where there are strong Buddhist movements well rooted in society some kind of political stance and action seems unavoidable and indeed logical and natural though conventional party political alignments may generally be avoided
For example Sarvodaya Shramadana's success at the higher levels of village selfdevelopment depends on the extent that unjust economic arrangements such as ownership of means of production eg land in the hands of a few administrative system and political power structures are changed in such a way that the village masses become the true masters of their own selves and their environment
That the present government has gone very far in this direction is amply demonstrated when one examines the radical measures that have already been taken
For large and explicitly Buddhist movements filing a variety of different roles from the devotional to the socalled New Religions which have become particularly important in Japan in the postwar period
With their strong emphasis on pacifism brotherly love and mutual aid these organizations have done much to assist the recovery of the Japanese people from the trauma of military aggression and the nuclear explosions which terminated it
Soka Gakkai is perhaps the most striking of these Japanese Buddhist sociopolitical movements
It is a lay Buddhist organization with over fifteen million adherents associated with the NichirenShoShu sect
Soka Gakkai has an ambitious education and cultural program and has founded its own university high school and hospital
It also has a political party Komeito  the Clean Government Party which as early as returned twentyfive parliamentary candidates to the Japanese lower house elected with five percent of the national vote
The party has continued to play an important part in Japanese political life basing itself on the principles of Buddhist democracy and opposition to rearmament
Soka Gakkai is a populist movement militant evangelical and well organized pledged to stand forever on the side of the people and to devote itself to carrying out the movement for the human revolution
More specifically its political achievements have included a successful confrontation with the mineowners of Hokkaido
Attitudes to Soka Gakkai understandably differ widely
It has been criticized by some for its radicalism and by others for its conservatism certainly it has been criticized on the grounds of dogmatism and aggressiveness
Certainly it is imbued with the nationalist fervor of Nichiren the th century Buddhist monk who inspired it
Although it has some claims to missionary work in other countries Soka Gakkai appears to have a more distinctive national flavor than the other social action groups we have looked at and to be less suitable for export
Elsewhere we have already quoted the words of the Dalai Lama emphasizing the active global responsibility of Buddhists and the importance above all of what he calls Universal Responsibility and the Good Heart In all countries will be found nonBuddhists whether religionists or humanists who share with us a nonviolent nondogmatic and nonsectarian approach to community and world problems and with whom Buddhists can work in close cooperation and with mutual respect
This is part of the Good Heart to which the Dalai Lama refers
I believe that the embracing of a particular religion like Buddhism does not mean the rejection of another religion or one's own community
In fact it is important that those of you who have embraced Buddhism should not cut yourself off from your own society you should continue to live within your own community and with its members
This is not only for your sake but for others' also because by rejecting your community you obviously cannot benefit others which actually is the basic aim of religion
Mr
Emilios Bouratinos and his colleagues of the Buddhist Society of Greece have framed certain farsighted proposals for the rehumanization of society which have Buddhist inspiration but which seek to involve nonBuddhist ideological groups with the aim of reaching some common ground with them on the organization of society
Mr
Bouratinos argues that Buddhists should address themselves to all people somehow inspired from within  whether they be religionists or not
This is indispensable for we Buddhists are a tiny minority in the West and yet we must touch the hearts of many if this world is to survive in some meaningful fashion
Certainly in the West many Buddhists will maintain that it is necessary to take one step at a time and that for the present our individual and collective action must go into the inner strengthening of our faith and practice
They would doubtless agree on the importance of teaching the Dharma which we have characterized as one of the important forms of social action but they would argue that the seduction of other kinds of social action and the drain of energy are greater than the opportunities which it can afford for wearing out the shoe of samsara They would argue that the best way to help other people is by personal example
This pamphlet concedes some possible truth to the above position but also offers a wide range of evidence to the contrary to which in retrospect the reader may now wish to return
Whatever we may feel about it certainly the debate is a worthwhile one since as we have seen it points to the very heart of Buddhism  the harmony or creative equilibrium of Wisdom and Compassion
And as in all worthwhile debates the disagreement and still more the possible sense of disagreeableness which it engenders offers each of us a valuable meditation
The needs and aptitudes of individual differ and our debate will also appear differently to readers in different countries with different cultural backgrounds
Though we are brothers and sisters to one another as Buddhists each must light his or her own way
To the enquiring reader who has little knowledge of Buddhism and yet who has managed to stay with me to the end I offer my apologies if I have sometimes seemed to forget him and if my explanations have proved inadequate
For
 Tseng Ts'an
To a world knotted in hatreds and aggression and a host of follies grand and mean heroic and base Buddhism offers a unique combination of unshakable equanimity and a deeply compassionate practical concern
And so may we tread lightly through restless experience riding out defeats and discouragements aware always of the peace at the heart of things of the freedom that is free of nothing

The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The following stories written by Hellmuth Hecker have been translated from the German Buddhist magazine Wissen and Wandel XVIII XXLI 
They are published here with their kind permission
While every effort has been made by the translator to conform to the original writing some changes had to be made for the sake of clarity
The stories of Bhadda Kundalakesa and Patacara have been enlarged and filled in
Grateful acknowledgment is made to Ven
Khantipalo for his assistance in improving the style and content of this narrative
His new translations of verses of the Therigatha and the Dhammapada from the original Pali have helped to make these stories come alive
It is hoped that this booklet will serve as an inspiration to all those who are endeavoring to tread in the Buddha's footsteps
At the time of the Buddha a daughter was born to the foreman of the guild of garlandmakers in Savatthi
She was beautiful clever and well behaved and a source of joy to her father
One day when she had just turned sixteen she went to the public flower gardens with her girlfriends and took three portions of fermented rice along in her basket as the day's sustenance
When she was just leaving by the city gate a group of monks came along who had come down from the monastery on the hill to obtain almsfood in town
The leader among them stood out one whose grandeur and sublime beauty impressed her so much that she impulsively offered him all the food in her basket
He was the Awakened One
He let her put her offering into his alms bowl
After Mallika  without knowing to whom she had given the food  had prostrated at his feet she walked on full of joy
The Buddha smiled
Ananda his attendant who knew that the fully Enlightened One does not smile without a reason asked therefore why he was smiling
The Buddha replied that this girl would reap the benefits of her gift this very same day by becoming the Queen of Kosala
This sounded unbelievable because how could the Maharaja of Benares and Kosala elevate a woman of low caste to the rank of Queen
Especially in the India of those days with its very strict caste system this seemed quite improbable
The ruler over the United Kingdoms of Benares and Kosala in the Ganges Valley was King Pasenadi the mightiest Maharaja of his day
At that time he was at war with his neighbor the King of Magadha
The latter had won a battle and King Pasenadi had been forced to retreat
He was returning to his capital on the horse that had been his battle companion
Before entering the city he heard a girl sing in the flower gardens
It was Mallika who was singing melodiously because of her joy in meeting the Illustrious Sage
The King was attracted by the song and rode into the gardens Mallika did not run away from the strange warrior but came nearer took the horse by its reins and looked straight into the King's eyes
He asked her whether she was already married and she replied in the negative
Thereupon he dismounted lay down with his head in her lap and let her console him about his illluck in battle
After he had recovered he let her mount his horse behind him and took her back to the house of her parents
In the evening he sent an entourage with much pomp to fetch her and made her his principal wife and Queen
From then on she was dearly beloved by the King
She was given many loyal servants and in her beauty she resembled a goddess
It became known throughout the whole kingdom that because of her simple gift she had been elevated to the highest position in the State and this induced her subjects to be kind and generous towards their fellow men
Wherever she went people would joyously proclaim That is Queen Mallika who gave alms to the Buddha 
After she had become Queen she soon went to visit the Enlightened One to ask him something which was puzzling her
Namely how it came about that one woman could be beautiful wealthy and of great ability another be beautiful but poor and not very able yet another although ugly be rich and very able and finally another be ugly poor and possess no skills at all
These differences can constantly be observed in daily life
But while the ordinary person is satisfied with such common place terms as fate heredity coincidence and so on Queen Mallika wanted to probe deeper as she was convinced that nothing happens without a cause
The Buddha explained to her in great detail that all attributes and living conditions of people everywhere were solely dependent on the extent of their moral purity
Beauty was caused by forgiveness and gentleness prosperity due to generous giving and skillfulness was caused by never envying others but rather being joyful and supporting their abilities
Whichever of these three virtues a person had cultivated that would show up as their destiny usually in some mixture of all of them
The coming together of all three attributes would be a rarity
After Mallika had listened to this discourse of the Buddha she resolved in her heart to be always gentle towards her subjects and never to scold them to give alms to all monks brahmans and the poor and never to envy anyone who was happy
At the end of the Enlightened One's discourse she took refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and remained a faithful disciple for the rest of her life

She showed her great generosity not only giving regular alms but also by building a large ebonylined hall for the Sangha which was used for religious discussions

She exhibited her gentleness by serving her husband with the five qualities of a perfect wife namely always rising before him and going to bed after him by always obeying his commands always being polite and using only kind words
Even the monks praised her gentleness in their discussions about virtue
Soon she was to prove that she was also free of jealousy
The King had made up his mind to marry a second chief wife and brought a cousin of the Buddha home as his betrothed
Although it is said that it is in the nature of women not to allow a rival into her home Mallika related to the other wife without the slightest malice
Both women lived in peace and harmony at the Court
Even when the second wife gave birth to a son the crown prince and Mallika had only a daughter she was not envious
When the King voiced disappointment about the birth of a daughter the Buddha said to him that a woman was superior to a man if she was clever virtuous wellbehaved and faithful
Then she could become the wife of a great King and give birth to an almighty Ruler
When the daughter Princess Vajira had grown up she became Queen of Magadha and thereby the ancestress of the greatest Indian Emperor Asoka who ruled Magadha years later
After Mallika had become a faithful lay devotee of the Buddha she also won her husband over to the teaching
And that happened in this way One night the King had a succession of sixteen perturbing dreams during which he heard gruesome unfathomable sounds from four voices which uttered Du Sa Na So When the King woke up from these dreams great fear seized him and sitting upright and trembling he awaited the sunrise
When his Brahman priests asked him whether he had slept well he related the terror of the night and asked them what one could do to counteract such a menace
The Brahmans declared that one would have to offer great sacrifices and thereby pacify the evil spirits
In his fear the King agreed to that
The Brahmans rejoiced because of the gifts they would surely reap and busily began to make preparations for the great sacrifice
They scurried about building a sacrificial altar and tied many animals to posts so they could be killed
For greater efficacy they demanded the sacrifice of four human beings and these also awaited their death tied to posts
When Mallika became aware of all this activity she went to the King and asked him why the Brahmans were so busily running about full of joyous expectation
The King replied that she did not pay enough attention to him and did not know his sorrows
Thereupon he told her of his dreams
Mallika asked the King whether he had also consulted the first and foremost of Brahmans about the meaning and interpretation
He replied that she first had to tell him who was the first and foremost of Brahmans
She explained that the Awakened One was foremost in the world of Gods and men the first of all Brahmans
King Pasenadi decided to ask the Awakened One's advice and went to Prince Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's Monastery
He related to the Buddha what had taken place in his dreams and asked him what would happen to him
Nothing the Awakened One replied and explained the meaning to him
The sixteen dreams which he had were prophecies showing that the living conditions on earth would deteriorate steadily due to the increasing moral laxity of the kings
In a meditative moment King Pasenadi had been able to see future occurrences within his sphere of interest because he was a monarch concerned with the wellbeing of his subjects
The four voices which he had heard belonged to four men who had lived in Savatthi and had been seducers of married women
Because of that they were reborn in hell and for years they drowned in redhot cauldrons coming nearer and nearer to the fire which intensified their unbearable suffering
During another years they slowly rose up in those iron cauldrons and had now come to the rim where they could once again at least breathe the air of the human realm
Each one wanted the speak a verse but because of the gravity of the deed could not get past the first syllable
Not even in sights could they voice their suffering because they had long lost the gift of speech
The four verses which start in Pali with du sa na so were recognized by the Awakened One as follows
After the King had heard these explanations he became responsive to the request of the compassionate Queen and granted freedom to the imprisoned men and animals
He ordered the sacrificial altar to be destroyed

The King who had become a devoted lay disciple of the Buddha visited him one day again and met a wise and welllearned layman there
The King asked him whether he could give some daily Dhamma teaching to his two Queens
The layman replied that the teaching came from the Enlightened One and only one of his immediate disciples could pass it on to the Queens
The King understood this and requested the Buddha to give permission to one of his monks to teach
The Buddha appointed Ananda for this task
Queen Mallika learned easily in spite of her uneducated background but Queen Vasabhakhattiya cousin of the Buddha and mother of the crownprince was unconcentrated and learned with difficulty

One day the royal couple looked down upon the river from the palace and saw a group of the Buddha's monks playing about in the water
The king said to Queen Mallika reproachfully Those playing about in the water are supposed to be Saints Such was namely the reputation of this group of the socalled seventeen monks who were quite young and of good moral conduct
Mallika replied that she could only explain it thus that either the Buddha had not made any rules with regard to bathing or that the monks were not acquainted with them because they were not amongst the rules which were recited regularly
Both agreed that it would not make a good impression on lay people and on those monks not yet secure if those in higher training played about in the water and enjoyed themselves in the way of untrained worldly people
But King Pasenadi wanted to avoid blackening those monks' characters and just wanted to give the Buddha a hint so that he could lay down a firm rule
He conceived the idea to send a special gift to the Buddha to be taken by those monks
They brought the gift and the Buddha asked them on what occasion they had met the King
Then they told him what they had done and the Buddha laid down a corresponding rule

One day when the King was standing on the parapet of the palace with the Queen and was looking down upon the land he asked her whether there was anyone in the world she loved more than herself
He expected her to name him since he flattered himself to have been the one who had raised her to fame and fortune
But although she loved him she remained truthful and replied that she know of no one dearer to herself than herself
Then she wanted to know how it was with him Did he love anyone  possibly her  more than himself
Thereupon the King also had to admit that selflove was always predominant
But he went to the Buddha and recounted the conversation to find out how a Saint would consider this
The Buddha confirmed his and Mallika's statements
 Ud translated by Ven
anamoli
One day the Buddha said to a man whose child had died Dear ones those who are dear bring sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair  the suffering that results from a clinging love
In spite of the clearly visible proof the man could not understand this
The conversation was reported to the King and he asked his wife whether it was really true that sorrow would result from love
If the Awakened One has said so O King then it is so she replied devotedly
The King demurred that she accepted every word of the Buddha like a disciple from a guru
Thereupon she sent a messenger to the Buddha to ask for more details and then passed the explicit answer on to her husband
She asked him whether he loved his daughter his second wife the crownprince herself and his kingdom
Naturally he confirmed this these five things were dear to him
But if something happened to these five Mallika responded would he not feel sorrow lamentation pain grief or despair which comes from loving
Then the King understood and realized how wisely the Buddha could penetrate all existence Very well then Mallika continue to venerate him And the King rose uncovered his shoulder prostrated deferentially in the direction where the Blessed One was wont to stay and greeted him three times with Homage to the Blessed One the Holy One the fully Awakened One
But their lives also did not remain quite without conflict
One day an argument arose between the couple about the duties of the Queen
For some reason the King was angry at her and treated her from then on as if she had disappeared into thin air
When the Buddha arrived at the palace the next day for his meal he asked about the Queen who had always been present at other times
Pasenadi scowled and said What about her
She has gone mad because of her fame The Buddha replied that he himself had raised her up to that position quite unexpectedly and should become reconciled with her
Somewhat reluctantly the King had her called
Thereupon the Buddha praised the blessing of amity and the anger was forgotten as if it had never happened

But later on a new tension arose between the couple
Again the King would not look at the Queen and pretended she did not exist
When the Buddha became aware of this he asked about her
Pasenadi said that her good fortune had gone to her head
Immediately the Awakened One told an incident from a former life
Both were then heavenly beings a deva couple who loved each other dearly
One night they were separated from each other because of the flooding of a stream
They both regretted this irretrievable night which could never be replaced during their lifespan of a thousand years
And during the rest of their lives they never let go of each other's company and always remembered to use this separation as a warning so that their happiness would endure during that whole existence
The King was moved by this story and became reconciled to the Queen
Mallika then spoke this verse to the Buddha
A third time the Buddha told of an occurrence during one of the former lives of the royal couple
At that time Pasenadi was a crownprince and Mallika his wife
When the crownprince became afflicted with leprosy and could not become King because of that he resolved to withdraw into the forest by himself so as not to become a burden to anyone
But his wife did not desert him and looked after him with touching attention
She resisted the temptation to lead a carefree life in pomp and splendor and remained faithful to her ugly and illsmelling husband
Through the power of her virtue she was able to effect his recovery
When he ascended to the throne and she became his Queen he promptly forgot her and enjoyed himself with various dancing girls
It is almost as difficult to find a grateful person the Buddha said as it is difficult to find a Holy One

Only when the King was reminded of the good deeds of his Queen did he change his ways asked her forgiveness and lived together with her in harmony and virtue

Queen Mallika committed only one deed in this life which had evil results and which led her to the worst rebirth
Immediately after her death she was reborn in hell though this lasted only a few days
When she died the King was just listening to a Dhamma exhortation by the Buddha
When the news reached him there he was deeply shaken and even the Buddha's reminder that there was nothing in the world that could escape old age disease death decay and destruction could not immediately assuage his grief

His attachment  from love comes sorrow  was so strong that he went to the Buddha every day to find out about the future destiny of his wife
If he had to get along without her on earth at least he wanted to know about her rebirth
But for seven days the Buddha distracted him from his question through fascinating and moving Dhamma discourses so that he only remembered his question when he arrived home again
Only on the seventh day would the Buddha answer his question and said that Mallika had been reborn in the Heaven of the Blissful Devas He did not mention the seven days she had spent in hell so as not to add to the King's sorrow
Even though it was a very shorttermed sojourn in the lower realms one can see that Mallika had not yet attained streamentry during her life on earth since it is one of the signs of a streamenterer that there is no rebirth below the human state
However this experience of hellish suffering together with her knowledge of Dhamma could have quickened Mallika's last ripening for the attainment of streamentry
At one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi at Jeta Grove Anathapindika's Monastery
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Lord and having done so paid his respects and sat down nearby
Now at that time Queen Mallika died
A certain man then approached the King and whispered in his ear Your Majesty Queen Mallika has died At those words king Pasenadi was filled with grief and depression and with shoulders drooping head down he sat glum and with nothing to say
The Lord saw the king sitting there like that and spoke to him in this way
Great king there are these five circumstances nottobegot by monk brahman deva Mara Brahma or by anyone in the world
What are the five
That what is of the nature to decay may not decay is a circumstance nottobegot by a monk or by anyone in the world
That what is of the nature to be diseased may not be diseased is a circumstance nottobegot by a monk or by anyone in the world
That what is of the nature to die may not die is a circumstance nottobegot by a monk or by anyone in the world
That what is of the nature to be exhausted may not be exhausted is a circumstance nottobegot by a monk or by anyone in the world
That what is of the nature to be destroyed may not be destroyed is a circumstance nottobegot by a monk or by anyone in the world
Great king for an uninstructed ordinary person what is of the nature to decay does decay what is of the nature to be diseased does become diseased what is of the nature to die does die what is of the nature to be exhausted is exhausted and what is of the nature to be destroyed is destroyed  and when these things happen to him he does not reflect It's not only for me that what is of the nature to decay decays that what is of the nature to be destroyed is destroyed but wherever there are beings coming and going dying and being born for all those beings what is of the nature to decay decays what is of the nature to be destroyed is destroyed and if I when there is decay in what is of the nature to decay when there is destruction in what is of the nature to be destroyed should grieve pine and lament and crying beat the breast and so fall into delusion food would not be enjoyed my body would become haggard work would not be done and enemies would be pleased while friends would be depressed
Then when there is decay in what is of the nature to decay disease in what is of the nature to be diseased death in what is of the nature to die exhaustion in what is of the nature to be exhausted destruction in what is of the nature to be destroyed he grieves pines and laments and crying beats his breast and so falls into delusion
This is called an uninstructed ordinary person pierced by the poisoned dart of grief he just torments himself
Great king for the instructed Noble Disciple what is of the nature to decay does decay and what is of the nature to be destroyed is destroyed and when these things happen to him he does reflect It's not only for me that what is of the nature to decay decays that what is of the nature to be destroyed is destroyed but wherever there are beings coming and going dying and being born for all those beings what is of the nature to decay decays what is of the nature to be destroyed is destroyed and if I when there is decay in what is of the nature to decay when there is destruction in what is of the nature to be destroyed should grieve pine and lament and crying beat the breast and so fall into delusion food would not be enjoyed my body would become haggard work would not be done and enemies would be pleased while friends would be depressed
Then when there is decay in what is of the nature to decay disease in what is of the nature to be diseased death in what is of the nature to die exhaustion in what is of the nature to be exhausted destruction in what is of the nature to be destroyed he does not grieve or pine or lament he does not beat his breast and fall into delusion
This is called an instructed Noble Disciple
Drawn out is the poisoned dart of grief with which the uninstructed ordinary person torments himself
Free of grief free from the dart the Noble Disciple has quenched himself completely
Great king these are the five circumstances nottobegot by monk brahman deva Mara Brahma or by anyone in the world
Just as there were two foremost disciples in the order of monks namely Sariputta and Moggallana likewise the Buddha named two women as foremost amongst nuns namely Uppalavanna and Khema
The name Khema means wellsettled or composed or security and is a synonym for Nibbana
The nun Khema belonged to a royal family from the land of Magadha
When she was of marriageable age she became one of the chief consorts of King Bimbisara
As beautiful as her appearance was equally beautiful was her life as the wife of an Indian Maharaja
When she heard about the Buddha from her husband she became interested but she had a certain reluctance to become involved with his teaching
She felt that the teaching would run counter to her life of sensepleasures and indulgences
The king however knew how he could influence her to listen to the teaching
He described at length the harmony the peace and beauty of the monastery in the Bamboo Grove where the Buddha stayed frequently
Because she loved beauty harmony and peace she was persuaded to visit there
Decked out in royal splendor with silk and sandalwood she went to the monastery
The Exalted One spoke to her and explained the law of impermanence of all conditioned beauty to her
She penetrated this sermon fully and still dressed in royal garments she attained to enlightenment
Just like the monk Mahakappina  a former king  she likewise became liberated through the power of the Buddha's words while still dressed in the garments of the laity
With her husband's permission she joined the Order of Nuns
Such an attainment almost like lightning is only possible however where the seed of wisdom has long been ripening and virtue is fully matured
An ordinary person hearing Khema's story only sees the wonder of the present happening
A Buddha can see beyond this and knows that this woman did not come to full liberation accidentally
It came about like this In former times when a Buddha appeared in the world then Khema in those past lives also appeared near him or so it has been recounted
Due to her inner attraction towards the highest Truth she always came to birth wherever the bearer and proclaimer of such Truth lived
It is said that already innumerable ages ago she had sold her beautiful hair to give alms to the Buddha Padumuttara
During the time of the Buddha Vipassi ninetyone eons ago she had been a teacher of Dhamma
Further it is told that during the three Buddhas of our happy eon which were previous to our Buddha Gautama she was a lay disciple and gained happiness through building monasteries for the Sangha
While most beings mill around heaven or hell realms during the lifetime of a Buddha Khema always tried to be near the source of wisdom
When there was no Buddha appearing in the world she would be reborn at the time of PaccekaBuddhas or Bodhisattas
In one birth she was the wife of the Bodhisatta who always exhorted his peaceful family like this
One day Khema's only son in this life was suddenly killed by the bite of a poisonous snake yet she was able to keep total equanimity
Another time  so it is told  she was she daughterinlaw of the Bodhisatta many times a great Empress who dreamt about receiving teaching from the Bodhisatta and then actually was taught by him
It is further recounted that as a Queen she was always the wife of he who was later Sariputta who said about her
This husband in former lives was a righteous king who upheld the ten royal virtues Generosity morality renunciation truthfulness gentleness patience amity harmlessness humility justice
Because of these virtues the king lived in happiness and bliss
Khema too lived in accordance with these precepts

Only because Khema had already purified her heart and perfected it in these virtues in many past lives she was now mature enough and had such pure and tranquil emotions that she could accept the ultimate Truth in the twinkling of an eye
The Buddha praised her as the nun foremost in wisdom
A story goes with that King Pasenadi was traveling through his country and one evening he arrived at a small township
He felt like having a conversation about Dhamma and ordered a servant to find out whether there was a wise ascetic or priest in the town
The servant sounded everyone out but could not find anyone whom his master could converse with
He reported this to the King and added that a nun of the Buddha lived in the town
It was the saintly Khema who was famed everywhere for her wisdom and known to be clever possessing deep insight had heard much Dhamma and was a speaker of renown knowing always the right retort
Thereupon the king went to the former Queen greeted her with respect and had the following conversation with her
Thereupon the King wanted to know why the Buddha had rejected these four questions
First we must try to understand what these questions imply
The first question corresponds with the view of all those beings whose highest goal is to continue on after death spurred on by craving for existence
The answer that an Awakened One continues to exist after death is the one given by all other religions including later interpretations of Buddhism
The second answer that the Enlightened One does not exist after death would be in keeping with craving for nonexistence ie annihilation
Because of an urge for definite knowledge and certainly a definition is sought which could claim that the five aggregates of form feeling perception mental formations and consciousness  which make up the sum total of all existence  are completely dissolved and disappear upon the shedding of an Awakened One's body and that deliverance consisted in that mere fact of dissolution
The third answer seeks a compromise everything impermanent in an Awakened One would be annihilated but the permanent aspect the essence his actual person would remain
The fourth answer tries to get out of the predicament by formulating a neithernor situation which is meant to be satisfying
All four formulas have been rejected by the Buddha as wrong view
They all presuppose that there is an I distinct from the world while in reality I and world are part of the experience which arises because of consciousness
Only the Enlightened Ones can actually see this or those who have been their disciples and unless this understanding is awakened the assumption is made that an I and essentially permanent self is wandering through samsara gradually ascending higher and higher until it is dissolved which is liberation this is a belief held by some
Others conclude from this that the Buddha teaches the destruction of the self But the Buddha teaches that there is no I or self which can be destroyed that it has never existed and has never wandered through samsara
What we call I and what we call world are in reality a constantly changing process always in flux which always throws up the illusion of I and world born in the present and speculated upon in the past and future
The way to liberation is to stop speculating about the I to become free from habitual views and formulas and come to the end of the mind's illusory conjuring
Not through increasing the thought processes about phenomena but through mindfulness of the arising of phenomena which leads to reducing the chatter in the mind can liberation be attained
Everything we see hear smell taste touch and think anything that can be contained in consciousness no matter how wideranging and pure it is has arisen due to causes therefore it is impermanent and subject to decay and dissolution
Everything which is subject to decay and change is notself
Because the five clungto aggregates are subject to destruction they are not my self are not mine I cannot prevent their decay their becoming sick damaged faulty and their passing away
The conclusion that the self must then be outside of the five aggregates does not follow either because it too is a thought and therefore belongs to one of the five clungto aggregates
Any designation of the Enlightened One after death is therefore an illusion born out of compulsion for naming and cannot be appropriate
Whoever has followed the teaching of the Awakened One as Khema did is greatly relieved to see that the Buddha did not teach the destruction of an existing entity nor the annihilation of a self
But on the contrary those not instructed by the Exalted One live without exception in a world of perpetual destruction of uncontrollable transiency in the realm of death
Whatever they look upon as I and mine is constantly vanishing and only upon renouncing these things which are unsatisfactory because of their impermanence can they reach a refuge of peace and security
Just as the lion's roar of the Exalted One proclaimed Open are the doors to the deathless who has ears to hear come and listen
Khema tried to explain this to the King with a simile
She asked him whether he had a clever mathematician or statistician who could calculate for him how many hundred thousand or hundredthousand grains of sand are contained in the river Ganges
The King replied that that is not possible
The nun then asked him whether he knew of anyone who could figure out how many gallons of water are contained in the great ocean
That too the King considered impossible
Khema asked him why it is not possible
The King replied that the ocean is mighty deep unfathomable
Just so said Khema is the Exalted One
Whoever wished to define the Awakened One could only do so through the five clungto aggregates and the Buddha no longer clungto them
Released from clinging to form feeling perception mental formations and consciousness is the Enlightened One mighty deep unfathomable as the great ocean
Therefore it was not appropriate to say he existed or did not exist or existed and did not exist nor did he neither exist nor not exist
All these designations could not define what was undefinable
Just that was liberation liberation from the compulsion to stabilize as self the constant flux of the five aggregates which are never the same in any given moment but only appear as a discharge of tensions arising from mental formations
The King rejoiced in the penetrating explanation of the nun Khema
Later on he met the Enlightened One and asked him the same four questions
The Buddha explained it exactly as Khema had done even using the same words
The King was amazed and recounted his conversation with the wise nun Khema the arahant

In Rajagaha the capital of the kingdom of Magadha lived a girl of good family named Bhadda
Her parents protected her very carefully because she had a passionate nature and they were afraid that she would be hurt due to her attraction to men
One day from her window Bhadda saw how a thief was being led to the place of execution
He was the son of a Brahman but had a strong tendency towards stealing
She fell in love with him at first sight
She convinced her father that she could not live without him and so he bribed the guards who let the condemned man escape
Soon after the wedding the bridegroom became obsessed with the desire to get his wife's jewelry
He told her he had made a vow that he would make an offering to a certain mountain deity if he could escape execution
Through this ruse he managed to get Bhadda away from his home
He wanted to throw her down from a high cliff to gain possession of her valuable ornaments
When they came to the cliff he brusquely told her about his intention
Bhadda in her distress likewise resolved to a ruse that enabled her to give him a push so that it was he who fell to his death
Burdened by the enormity of her deed she did not want to return to lay life
Sensual pleasures and possessions were no longer tempting for her
She became a wandering ascetic
First she entered the order of Jains and as a special penance her hair was torn out by the roots when she ordained
But it grew again and was very curly
Therefore she was called Curlyhair
The teaching of the Jain sect did not satisfy her so she became a solitary wanderer
For fifty years she traveled through India and visited many spiritual teachers thereby obtaining an excellent knowledge of religious scriptures and philosophies
She became one of the most famous debaters
When she entered a town she would make a sandpile and stick a roseapple branch into it and would announce that whoever would engage in discussion with her should trample upon the sandpile
One day she came to Savatthi and again erected her little monument
At that time Sariputta  the disciple of the Buddha with the greatest power of analysis  was staying at the Jeta Grove
He heard of the arrival of Bhadda and as a sign of his willingness for debate he had several children go and trample on the sandpile
Thereupon Bhadda went to the Jeta Grove to Anathapindika's Monastery accompanied by a large number of people
She was certain of victory since she had become used to being the winner in all debates
She put a number of questions to Sariputta
He answered all of them until she found nothing more to ask
Then Sariputta questioned her
Already the first question affected Bhadda profoundly namely What is the One She remained silent unable to discern what the Elder could have been inquiring about
Surely he did not mean God or Brahman or the Infinite she pondered
But what was it then
The answer should have been nutriment because all beings are sustained by food
Although she was unable to find an answer and thereby lost the debate she knew that here was someone who had found what she had been looking for during her pilgrimage of half a century
She chose Sariputta as her teacher but he referred her to the Buddha
The Awakened One preached Dhamma to her at Mount Vulture Peak and concluded with the following verses
Just as the wanderer Bahiya was foremost amongst monks who attained arahantship faster than anyone else she was foremost amongst nuns with the same quality
Both grasped the highest Truth so quickly and so deeply that admittance to the Order followed after attainment of arahantship
Mind and emotions of both of them had long been trained and prepared so that they could reach the highest attainment very quickly
Bhadda's verses have been handed down to us in the collection of the Verses of the Elder Nuns as she summarizes her life
 
 
There lived in Savatthi a girl called Gotami in poor circumstances belonging to the lowest caste
Because she was very thin and haggard a real beanpole everyone called her the haggard Gotami
When one saw her walking around tall and thin one could not fathom her inner riches
One could truly say about her
She was despondent because due to her poverty and lack of attractiveness she was unable to find a husband
But one day it suddenly happened that a rich merchant who appreciated her inner wealth and considered that more important than her outer appearance married her
However the husband's family despised her because of her caste her poverty and her looks
This animosity caused her great unhappiness especially because of her beloved husband who found himself in conflict between love for his parents and love for his wife
But when Kisagotami gave birth to a baby boy the husband's whole clan finally accepted her as the mother of the son and heir
Her relief about this changed attitude was immense and a great burden was taken from her
Now she was totally happy and contented
The boy grew up and soon started playing outside full of energy and joy
However one day her happiness showed itself to be based on an illusion
Her little son died suddenly
She did not know how to bear this tragedy
Beyond the usual love of a mother for her child she had been especially attached to this child because he was the guarantee for her marital bliss and her peace of mind
His death made her fear that her husband's family would despise her again and that they would blame her saying she was karmically unable to have a son
Kisagotami must have done some very despicable deeds to have this happen to her people would say
And even her husband might reject her now
All such ideas and imaginings revolved in her mind and a dark cloud descended upon her
She simply refused to accept the fact that the child was dead and became obsessed with the fantasy that her child was only sick and that she had to get medicine for him
With the dead child in her arms she ran away from her home and went from house to house asking for medicine for her little son
At every door she begged Please give me some medicine for my child but the people replied that medicine would not help any more the child was dead
But she did not understand what they were saying to her because in her mind she had resolved that the child was not dead
Others laughed at her without compassion
But amongst the many selfish and unsympathetic people she also met a wise and kind person who recognized that her mind was deranged because of grief
He advised her to visit the best physician namely the Buddha of the ten powers who would know the right remedy
She immediately followed this advice and ran to Prince Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's Monastery where the Buddha was staying
She arrived in the middle of a discourse being given by the Buddha to a large congregation
Totally despairing and in tears with the corpse of the child in her arms she begged the Buddha Master give me medicine for my son The Awakened One interrupted his teaching and replied kindly that he knew of a medicine
Hopefully she inquired what that could be
Mustard seeds the Enlightened One replied astounding everyone present
Joyfully Kisagotami inquired where she should go to obtain them and what kind to get
The Buddha replied that she need only bring a very small quantity from any house where no one had died
She trusted the Blessed One's words and went to the town
At the first house she asked whether any mustard seeds were available
Certainly was the reply
Could I have a few seeds she inquired
Of course she was told and some seeds were brought to her
But then she asked the second question which she had not deemed quite as important whether anyone had died in this house
But of course the people told her
And so it went everywhere
In one house someone had died recently in another house some time ago
She could not find any house where no one had died
The dead ones are more numerous than the living ones she was told
Towards evening she finally realized that not only she was stricken by the death of a loved one but this was the common human fate
What no words had been able to convey to her her own experience  going from door to door  made clear to her
She understood the law of existence the being fettered to the always reoccurring deaths
In this way the Buddha was able to heal her obsession and bring her to an acceptance of reality
Kisagotami no longer refused to believe that her child was dead but understood that death is the destiny of all beings
Such were the means by which the Buddha could heal griefstricken people and bring them out of their overpowering delusion in which the whole world was perceived only in the perspective of their loss
Once when someone was lamenting the death of his father the Buddha asked him which father he meant the father of this life or the last life or the one before that
Because if one wanted to grieve then it would be just as well not only to feel sorrow for the one father
Another time a griefstricken person was able to see reality when the Buddha pointed out to him that his son would be reborn and that he was only lamenting for an empty shell
After Kisagotami had come to her senses she took the child's lifeless body to the cemetery and returned to the Enlightened One
He asked her whether she had brought any mustard seed
She gratefully explained how she had been cured by the Blessed One
Thereupon the Master spoke the following verse to her
Because her mind had matured and she had won insight into reality it was possible for her to become a streamwinner after hearing the Buddha proclaim just that one verse
She asked for admittance into the Order of Nuns
After having spent some time as a nun practicing and studying Dhamma she watched her lamp one evening and compared the restlessly hissing flames with the ups and downs of life and death
Thereupon the Blessed One came to her and again spoke a short verse
When she heard these lines she was able to shed all fetters and became one of the arahants the fully Enlightened Ones
Ninetytwo eons ago in one of her former lives she had been the wife of a Buddhatobe at the time of the Buddha Phussa
During the time of the last Buddha before the Sage of the Sakyas namely Buddha Kassapa she had been a King's daughter who became a nun

In the collection of Verses of the Elder Nuns her stanzas can be found in which she describes the great joy the Buddha imparted to her
Therefore she praises friendship with the Noble and Holy Ones
The compassion of the Buddha the most noble friend of all had saved her from all suffering experienced in this and former lives
She used as her model the heartrending example of the nun Patacara who had also been afflicted with temporary insanity after the death of not only husband and two sons but also parents and brothers
Because women's longing for men is so deeply ingrained the Buddha said For a man does the woman strive From this attachment is born the torture of jealousy the lack of selfreliance and the despair of loneliness
Only when one penetrates a woman's suffering in this way can one realize the full impact of Kisagotami's gratitude towards the Buddha who showed her the way
So she says
After she attained to arahantship she was able to see her past lives and could now say
The third part of her verses finalizes her joy in finding liberation and release from all suffering
When Mara as he had done so often before with other nuns came to tempt her to distract her from meditation and asked her whether she was lusting for man now that her child was dead she immediately replied discerning the ruse
Addressing Mara as friend she shows her lack of fear and her equanimity
Grumbling sullenly Mara disappeared just as before when he had tried in vain to fetter other nuns to the realm of birth and death
The nun Kisagotami rising to holiness from lowliest birth was praised by the Buddha as amongst the seventyfive greatest nuns
There was a housewife in Savatthi who had ten children
She was always occupied with giving birth nursing upbringing educating and arranging marriages for her children
Her children were her whole life
She was therefore known as Sona with many children
She was rather like Migara's mother of the same city though the latter had twenty children
We may find such an abundance of offspring in one family somewhat strange today
However this was not uncommon in Asia and even in some parts of the West
Sona's husband was a lay follower of the Buddha
After having practiced moral conduct according to the precepts for several years while living the household life he decided that the time had come to enter into the holy life and so he became a monk
It was not easy for Sona to accept this decision yet she did not waste her time with regrets and sorrow but decided to live a more religiously dedicated life
She called her ten children and their husbands and wives together turned her considerable wealth over to them and asked them only for support for her necessities
For a while all went well
She had sufficient support and could spend her time in religious activities
But soon it happened that the old woman became a burden to her children and childreninlaw
They had not been in agreement with their father's decision and even less did they agree with their mother's devout attitude and religious speech
Indeed they thought of their parents as foolish because they would not indulge in the pleasures their wealth could purchase
They considered their parents mentally unstable religious fanatics this attitude made them despise their mother
They quickly forgot that they owed all their riches to their mother that she had lavished many years of care and attention on them
Looking only at the present moment they considered the old woman a nuisance
The words of the Buddha that a grateful person is as rare in the world as one who becomes a Noble One proved true again in this case
The increasing disdain by her children was an even greater pain for Sona than the separation from her husband
She became aware that waves of bitterness arose in her that reproaches and accusations intermingled
She realized that what she had taken to be selfless love pure mother's love was in reality self love coupled with expectations
She had been relying on her children completely and had been convinced that she would be supported by them in her old age as a tribute to her long years of solicitude for them that gratitude appreciation and participation in their affairs would be her reward
Had she not looked at her children as an investment then as an insurance against the fear and loneliness of old age
In this manner she investigated her motives and found the truth of the Enlightened One's words in herself
Namely that it was a woman's way not to rely on possessions power and abilities but solely on her children while it was the way of the ascetic to rely on virtue alone
Her reflections brought her to the decision to enter the Order of Nuns so that she could develop the qualities of selfless love and virtue
Why should she remain in her home where she was only reluctantly accepted
She looked upon the household life as a gray existence and pictured that of a nun as brilliant and so was ready to follow here husband's path
She became a nun a Bhikkhuni in the order of the Buddha's followers
But after a while she realized that she had taken her selflove along
The other nuns criticized her behavior in many small matters
She had entered the Sangha as an old woman and had dozens of habits and peculiarities which were obstacles in this new environment
She was used to doing things in a certain way and the other nuns did them differently
Sona soon realized that it was not easy to reach noble attainments and that the Order of Nuns was not the paradise she had envisioned  just as she had not found security with her children
She also understood that she was still held fast by her womanly limitations
It was not enough that her weaknesses were abhorrent to her and that she was longing for more masculine traits
She also had to know what to do to effect the change
She accepted the fact that she had to make tremendous efforts not only because she was already advanced in years but also because until now she had only cultivated female virtues
The masculine characteristics which she was lacking were energy and circumspection
Sona did not become discouraged nor thought of the Path as too difficult
She had the same sincerity and steadfastness as her sisternunSoma who said
It became clear to Sona that she had to develop courage and strength to win victory over her willfulness and her credulity
She realized that it was necessary to practice mindfulness and selfobservation and to implant into her memory those teachings which could be at her disposal when needed to counteract her emotions
What use would be all knowledge and vows if she were carried away by her emotions and her memory fail her when it was most needed
These were the reasons which strengthened Sona's determination and willpower to learn the Buddha's discourses
Through many a night thereby she attained the ability to memorize them
Furthermore she took pains to serve her sisternuns in a loving way and to apply the teachings constantly
After having practiced in this way for some time she attained not only the assurance of nonreturner but became an arahant fullyenlightened a state she had hardly dared to hope for in this lifetime
It happened without any special circumstances to herald it
After she had made a wholehearted commitment to perfect those abilities which she lacked no matter what the cost she drew nearer to her goal day by day
One day she was liberated from the very last fetter
The Buddha said about her that she was foremost of the nuns who had energetic courage

In the Verses of the Elder Nuns she describes her life in five verses
 
Sona's sisternuns who had formerly been her severe critics and who had thought that because of her age she would not be able to change now apologized to her sincerely and endeavored to follow her good example
When she was born Nanda was lovingly welcomed by her parents  the father of the Buddha and his second wife
Her name means joy contentment pleasure and was given when parents were especially joyful about the arrival of a baby
Nanda was extremely wellbred graceful and beautiful
To distinguish her from others by the same name she was later called RupaNanda one of delightful form or sometimes SundariNanda beautiful Nanda
In due course many members of her family  the royal house of the Sakyans  left the household for the homeless life influenced by the amazing fact that one of their clan had become the fullyenlightened Buddha
Amongst them was her brother Nanda her cousins and finally her mother together with many other Sakyan ladies
Thereupon Nanda also took this step but it is recorded that she did not do it out of confidence in the teacher and the teachings but out of love for her relatives and a feeling of belonging with them
One can easily imagine the love and respect accorded the graceful halfsister of the Buddha and how touched the people were by the sight of the lovely royal daughter so near in family ties to the Blessed One wandering amongst them in the garb of a nun
But it soon became obvious that this was not a good basis for a nun's life
Nanda's thoughts were mainly directed towards her own beauty and her popularity with the people traits which were resultants of former good actions
These resultants now became dangers to her since she forgot to reinforce them with new actions
She felt that she was not living up to the high ideals the people envisioned for her and that she was far from the goal for which so many nobleborn clansmen had gone into the homeless life
She was sure that the Blessed One would censure her on account of this
Therefore she managed to evade him for a long time
One day the Buddha requested all the nuns to come to him one by one to receive his teaching but Nanda did not comply
The Master let her be called specially and then she appeared before him ashamed and anxious by her demeanor
The Buddha addressed her and appealed to all her positive qualities so that she listened to him willingly and delighted in his words
When the Blessed One knew that the talk had uplifted her had made her joyful and ready to accept his teaching he did not immediately explain absolute reality to her as is often mentioned in other accounts frequently resulting in noble attainment to his listener
Because Nanda was so taken up with her physical beauty the Buddha used his psychic powers to conjure up the vision of an even more beautiful woman who then aged visibly and relentlessly before her very eyes
Thereby Nanda could see compressed within a few moments what otherwise one can only notice in people through decades  and often because of proximity and habit one does not even fully comprehend the fading away of youth and beauty the decay the appearance of wrinkles and gray hair
The vision affected Nanda deeply she was shaken to the center of her being
After having shown her this graphic picture the Buddha could explain the law of impermanence to her in such a way that she penetrated the truth of its completely and thereby attained the knowledge of future liberation  streamentry
As a meditation subject the Buddha gave her the contemplation of the impermanence and foulness of the body
She persevered for a long time with this practice faithful and courageous day and night as she described in her verses
 
Because Nanda had been so infatuated with her physical appearance it had been necessary for her to apply the extreme of meditations on bodily unattractiveness as a countermeasure to find equanimity as balance between the two opposites
For beauty and ugliness are just two kinds of impermanence
Nothing can disturb the cool peaceful heart ever again
Later the Buddha raised his halfsister as being the foremost amongst nuns who practiced Jhana
This meant that she not only followed the analytical way of insight but put emphasis on the experience of tranquillity
Enjoying this pure wellbeing she no longer needed any lower enjoyments and soon found indestructible peace
Although she had gone into homelessness because of attachment to her relatives she became totally free and equal to the One she venerated
In the days when India was the fortunate home of an Awakened One a husband and wife lived within its borders with an only daughter who was exceedingly beautiful
Their family life was a happy and harmonious one
Then one day pestilence broke out in their hometown
Amongst those fleeing from the disaster area was also this family with their grownup daughter
They went to Kosambi the capital of the kingdom of Vamsa in the valley of the Ganges
The municipality had erected a public eatinghall for the refugees
There the daughter Samavati went to obtain food
The first day she took three portions the second day two portions and on the third day only one portion
Mitta the man who was distributing the food could not resist from asking her somewhat ironically whether she had finally realized the capacity of her stomach
Samavati replied quite calmly On the first day her father had died and so she only needed food for two people on the second day her mother had succumbed to the dreaded disease and so she only needed food for herself
The official felt ashamed about his sarcastic remark and wholeheartedly begged her forgiveness
A long conversation ensued
When he found out that she was all alone in the world he proposed to adopt her as his fosterchild
She was happy to accept and was now relieved of all worries about her livelihood
Samavati immediately began helping her foster father with the distribution of the food and the care of the refugees
Thanks to her efficiency and circumspection the former chaos became channeled into orderly activity
Nobody tried to get ahead of others any more nobody quarreled and everyone was content
Soon the Finance Minister of the king Ghosaka became aware that the public food distribution was taking place without noise and tumult
When he expressed his praise and appreciation to the fooddistributor the official replied modestly that his fosterdaughter was mainly responsible for this
In this way Ghosaka met Samavati and was so impressed with her noble bearing that he decided to adopt her as his own daughter
His manager consented even if somewhat woefully because he did not want to be in the way of Samavati's fortune
So Ghosaka took her into his house and thereby she became heiress of a vast fortune and became part of the most exalted circles of the land
The king who was living in Kosambi at that time was Udena
He had two chief consorts
One was Vasuladatta whom he had married both for political reasons and because she was very beautiful but these were her only assets
The second one Magandiya was not only very beautiful but also very clever though without heart
So the King was not emotionally contented with his two wives
One day king Udena met the charming adopted daughter of his Finance Minister and fell in love with her at first sight
He felt magically attracted by her loving and generous nature
Samavati had exactly what was missing in both his other wives
King Udena sent a messenger to Ghosaka and asked him to give Samavati to him in marriage
Ghosaka was thrown into an emotional upheaval
He loved Samavati above all else and she had become indispensable to him
She was the delight of his life
On the other hand he knew his king's temperament and was afraid to deny him his request
But in the end his attachment to Samavati won and he thought Better to die than to live without her
As usual King Udena lost his temper
In his fury he dismissed Ghosaka from his post as Finance Minister and banned him from his kingdom and did not allow Samavati to accompany him
He took over his minister's property and locked up his magnificent mansion
Samavati was desolate that Ghosaka had to suffer so much on her account and had lost not only her but also his home and belongings
Out of compassion for her adopted father to whom she was devoted with great gratitude she decided to make an end to this dispute by voluntarily becoming the king's wife
She went to the Palace and informed the King of her decision
The king was immediately appeased and restored Ghosaka to his former position as well as rescinding all other measures against him
Because Samavati had great love for everyone she had so much inner strength that this decision was not a difficult one for her
It was not important to her where she lived whether in the house of the Finance Minister as his favorite daughter or in the palace as the favorite wife of the king or in obscurity as when she was in the house of her parents or as a poor refugee  she always found peace in her own heart and was happy regardless of outer circumstances
Samavati's life at the court of one of the Maharajas of that time fell into a harmonious pattern
Amongst her servants there was one named Khujjuttara the hunchbacked Outwardly she was illformed but otherwise very capable
Everyday the Queen gave her eight gold coins to buy flowers for the women's quarters of the palace
But Khujjuttara always bought only four coins worth and used the rest for herself
One day when she was buying flowers again for her mistress from the gardener a monk was taking his meal there
He was of majestic appearance
When he gave a discourse to the gardener after the meal Khujjuttara listened
The monk was the Buddha
He directed his discourse in such a way that he spoke directly to Khujjuttara's heart
And his teaching penetrated into her inner being
Just from hearing this one discourse so well expounded she attained streamentry
Without quite knowing what had happened to her she was a totally changed person
The whole world which had seemed so obvious and real to her until now appeared as a dream apart from reality
The first thing she did that day was to buy flowers for all of the eight coins
She regretted her former dishonesty deeply
When the Queen asked her why there were suddenly so many flowers Khujjuttara fell at the Queen's feet and confessed her theft
When Samavati forgave her magnanimously Khujjuttara told her what was closest to her heart namely that she had heard a discourse by the Buddha which had changed her life
She could not be specific about the contents of the teaching but Samavati could see for herself what a wholesome and healing influence the teaching had had on her servant
She made Khujjuttara her personal attendant and told her to visit the Monastery every day to listen to the Dhamma and then repeat it to her
Khujjuttara had an outstanding memory and what she had heard once she could repeat verbatim
Later on she made a collection of discourses she had heard from the Buddha or one of his enlightened disciples during these days at Kosambi and from it developed the book now called Itivuttaka composed of small discourses
When king Udena once again told his beloved Samavati that she could wish for anything and he would fulfill it she wished that the Buddha would come to the palace daily to have his food there and propound his teaching
The king's courier took the message of this perpetual invitation to the Buddha but he declined and instead sent his cousin Ananda
From then on Ananda went to the palace daily for his meal and afterward gave a Dhamma discourse
The Queen had already been well prepared by Khujjuttara's reports and within a short time she understood the meaning and attained to streamentry just as her maidservant had done
Now through their common understanding of the Dhamma the Queen and the maid became equal
Within a short time the teaching spread through the whole of the women's quarters and there was hardly anyone who did not become a disciple of the Awakened One
Even Samavati's stepfather the Finance Minister Ghosaka was deeply touched by the teaching
Similarly to Anathapindika he donated a large monastery in Kosambi to the Sangha so that the monks would have a secure and satisfying shelter
Every time the Buddha visited Kosambi he stayed in this Monastery named Ghositarama and other monks and holy people also would find shelter there
Through the influence of the Dhamma Samavati became determined to develop her abilities more intensively
Her most important asset was the way she could feel sympathy for all beings and could penetrate everyone with lovingkindness and compassion
She was able to develop this faculty so strongly that the Buddha called her the woman laydisciple most skilled in metta

This allpervading love was soon to be tested severely
It happened like this The second main consort of the king Magandiya was imbued with virulent hatred against everything Buddhist Once her father had heard the Buddha preach about unconditional love to all beings and it had seemed to him that the Buddha was the most worthy one to marry his daughter
In his naive ignorance of the rules of the monks he offered his daughter to the Buddha as his wife
Magandiya was very beautiful and had been desired by many suitors already
The Buddha declined the offer but by speaking a single verse about the unattractiveness of the body caused her father and mother to attain the fruit of nonreturning
This was the Buddha's verse as recorded in the Sutta Nipata
But Magandiya thought that the Buddha's rejection of her was an insult and therefore hatred against him and his disciples arose in her
She became the wife of King Udena and when he took a third wife she could willingly accept that as it was the custom in her day
But that Samavati had become a disciple of the Buddha and had converted the other women in the palace to his teaching she could not tolerate
Her hatred against everything connected with the Buddha now turned against Samavati as his representative
She thought up one meanness after another and her sharp intelligence served only to conjure up new misdeeds
First she told the King that Samavati was trying to take his life
But the King was well aware of Samavati's great love for all beings so that he did not even take this accusation seriously barely listened to it and forgot it almost immediately
Secondly Magandiya ordered one of her maidservants to spread rumors about the Buddha and his monks in Kosambi so that Samavati would also be maligned
With this she was more successful
A wave of aversion struck the whole order to such an extent that Ananda suggested to the Buddha that they leave town
The Buddha smiled and said that the purity of the monks would silence all rumors within a week
Hardly had King Udena heard the gossip leveled against the Order than it had already subsided
Magandiya's second attempt against Samavati had failed
Some time later Magandiya had eight specially selected chickens sent to the King and suggested that Samavati should kill them and prepare them for a meal
Samavati refused to do this as she would not kill any living beings
Since the King knew of her allembracing love he did not lose his temper but accepted her decision
Magandiya then tried for a fourth time to harm Samavati
Just prior to the week which King Udena was to spend with Samavati Magandiya hid a poisonous snake in Samavati's chambers but the poison sacs had been removed
When King Udena discovered the snake all evidence pointed towards Samavati
His passionate fury made him lose all control
He reached for his bow and arrow and aimed at Samavati
But the arrow rebounded from her without doing any harm
His hatred could not influence her loving concern for him which continued to emanate from her
When King Udena regained his equilibrium and saw the miracle  that his arrow could not harm Samavati he was deeply moved
He asked her forgiveness and was even more convinced of her nobility and faithfulness
He became interested in the teaching which had given such strength to his wife
When a famous monk named Pindola Bharadvaja stayed at the Ghosita Monastery the King visited him and discussed the teaching with him
He learned that the young monks according to the Buddha's advice instead of having contact with women tried to attain the feelings as towards a mother sister or daughter thereby they overcame their dependence on the opposite sex and could live joyously as celibates in spite of their youth
At the end of the discourse the King was so impressed that he took refuge in the Buddha and became a lay disciple

Samavati had been thinking about the wonders of the Dhamma and the intricacies of karmic influences
One thing had led to another she had come to Kosambi as a poor refugee then the fooddistributor had given her shelter the Finance Minister had taken her on as his daughter then she became the King's wife her maidservant had brought the teaching to her and she became a disciple and streamwinner
Subsequently she spread the teaching to all the women in the palace then to Ghosaka and now lastly also to the King
How convincing Truth was
She often thought in this way and then permeated all beings with lovingkindness wishing them happiness
The King now tried more determinedly to control his passionate nature and to subdue greed and hate
His talks with Samavati were very helpful to him in this respect
Slowly this development culminated in his losing all sexual craving when he was in Samavati's company as he was trying to attain the feelings towards women of mother sister and daughter in himself
While he was not free of sexual desire towards his other wives he was willing to let Samavati continue on her Path to emancipation unhindered
Soon she attained to the state of oncereturner and drew nearer and nearer to nonreturner an attainment which many men and women could achieve in laylife in those days
Magandiya had suspended her attacks for some time but continued to ponder how to harm the Buddha through Samavati
After much brooding she initiated a plan
She brought some of her relatives to her point of view and uttered slander against Samavati to them
Then she proposed to kill her
So that it would not attract attention but would appear to be an accident the whole women's palace was to be set on fire
The plan was worked out in all details
Magandiya left town some time beforehand so that no suspicion could fall on her
This deed of arson resulted in skyhigh flames which demolished the wooden palace totally and the women residing in it were all killed including Samavati
The news of this disaster spread around town very quickly
No other topic of conversation could be heard there
Several monks who had not been ordained very long were also affected by the agitation and after their almsround they went to the Buddha and inquired what would be the future rebirth of these women lay disciples with Samavati as their leader
The Awakened One calmed their excited hearts and diverted their curiosity about this most interesting question of rebirth by answering very briefly Amongst these women O monks there are some disciples who are streamenterers some who are oncereturners and some who are nonreturners
None of these lay disciples failed to receive the fruits of their past deeds 
The Buddha mentioned here the first three fruits of the Dhamma streamentry oncereturner and nonreturner
All these disciples were safe from rebirth below the human realm and each one was securely going towards the final goal of total liberation
This was the most important aspect of their lives and deaths and the Buddha would not elucidate any further details
Once he mentioned to Ananda that it was a vexation for the Enlightened One to explain the future births of all disciples who died

The Buddha later explained to some monks who were discussing how unjust it was that these faithful disciples should die such a terrible death that the women experienced this because of a joint deed they had committed many lifetimes ago
Once Samavati had been Queen of Benares
She had gone with her ladiesinwaiting to bathe and feeling cold she asked that a bush be burned to give some warmth
She saw only too late that a monk  a Pacceka Buddha  was sitting immobile within the bush he was not harmed however because one cannot kill Awakened Ones
The women did not know this and feared that they would be blamed for having made a fire without due caution
Thereupon Samavati had the deluded idea to pour oil over this monk who was sitting in total absorption so that burning him would obliterate their mistake
This plan could not succeed however but the bad intention and attempt had to carry karmic resultants
In this lifetime the ripening of the result had taken place
The Buddha has declared that one of the favorable results of the practice of Metta is the fact that fire poison and weapons do no harm to the practitioner
This has to be understood in such a way during the actual emanation of lovingkindness the one who manifests this radiance cannot be hurt just as Samavati proved when the king's arrow did not penetrate her
But at other times fire could incinerate her body
Samavati had become a nonreturner and was therefore free of all sensual desire and hate and no longer identified with her body
Her radiant soft heart was imbued with the four divine abidings and was unassailable and untouched by the fire
Her inner being could not be burned and that which was burned was the body only
It is a rare happening that one of the Holy Ones is murdered or that one of the Buddhas is threatened with murder and equally rare is it to find that one perfected in metta and attained to nonreturner should die a violent death
All three types of persons however have in common that their hearts can no longer be swayed by this violence
Samavati's last words were It would not be an easy matter even with the knowledge of a Buddha to determine exactly the number of times our bodies have thus been burned with fire as we have passed from birth to birth in the round of existences which has no conceivable beginning
Therefore be heedful Those ladies meditated on painful feeling and so gained the Noble Paths and Fruits
Two thousand years after the Parinibbana of the Buddha in soldiers burned a Buddhist Monastery in Japan and all the monks inside were burned to death
The last thing the soldiers heard before everything burned down were the words of the Abbot
Referring to the tragedy of the fire at Kosambi the Buddha spoke the following verse to the monks
King Udena was overwhelmed with grief at Samavati's death and kept brooding about who could be the perpetrator of this ghastly deed
He came to the conclusion that it must have been Magandiya
He did not want to question her directly because she would deny it
So he thought of a ruse
He said to his Ministers Until now I have always been apprehensive because Samavati was forever seeking an occasion to slay me
But now I shall be able to sleep in peace The Ministers asked the king who it could have been that had done this deed Only someone who really loves me the king replied
Magandiya had been standing near and when she heard that she came forward and proudly admitted that she alone was responsible for the fire and the death of the women and Samavati
The King said that he would grant her and all her relatives a boon for this
When all the relatives were assembled the King had them burned publicly and then had the earth plowed under so that all traces of the ashes were destroyed
He had Magandiya executed as a massmurderess which was his duty and responsibility but his fury knew no bounds and he still looked for revenge
He had her killed with utmost cruelty
She died an excruciating death which was only a foretaste of the tortures awaiting her in the nether world after which she would have to roam in samsara for a long long time to come
Soon King Udena regretted his revengeful and cruel deed
Again and again he saw Samavati's face in front of him full of love for all beings even for her enemies
He felt he had removed himself from her even further than her death had done because of his violent fury
He began to control his temper more and more and to follow the Buddha's teachings ardently
Two women who had been friends of Samavati were so moved by this tragedy and saw the impermanence of all earthly things so clearly that they entered the Order of Nuns
One of them soon became an arahant fully enlightened and the other one after twentyfive years of practice
Samavati however was reborn in the realm of the Pure Abodes where she would be able to reach Nibbana
The different results of love and hate could be seen with exemplary clarity in the lives and deaths of these two Queens
When one day the monks were discussing who was alive and who dead the Buddha said that Magandiya while living was dead already while Samavati though dead was truly alive and he spoke these verses
The Buddha declared Samavati to be foremost among those female lay disciples who dwell in lovingkindness

 Commentary to Anguttara Nikaya Vol
I Path of Purification p
Patacara was the beautiful daughter of a very wealthy merchant of Savatthi
When she was sixteen years old her parents put her in a sevenstory high tower on the top floor surrounded by guards to prevent her from keeping company with any young man
In spite of this precaution she became involved in a love affair with a servant in her parents' house
When her parents arranged a marriage for her with a young man of equal social standing she decided to elope with her lover
She escaped from the tower by disguising herself and the young couple went to live in a village far away from Savatthi
The husband farmed and the young wife had to do all the menial chores which formerly had been performed by her parents' servants
Thus she reaped the results of her deed
When she became pregnant she begged her husband to take her to her parents' house to give birth there saying to him that father and mother always have a soft spot in their hearts for their child no matter what has happened
However her husband refused on the grounds that her parents would surely subject him to torture or imprisonment
When she realized that he would not give in to her pleas she decided to make her way to her parents by herself
When the husband found her gone and was told by the neighbors of her decision he followed her and tried to persuade her to return
However she would not listen to him
Before they could reach Savatthi the birthpains started and soon a baby son was born
As there was no more reason to go to her parents' house they turned back and resumed their family life in the village
Sometime later she became pregnant again
And again she requested her husband to take her home to her parents
Again he refused and she took matters in her own hands and started off carrying the older child
When her husband followed her and pleaded with her to return with him she would not listen but continued on her way
A fearful storm arose quite out of season with thunder and lightning and incessant rain
Just then her birthpains started and she asked her husband to find her some shelter
The husband went searching for material for a shelter and set about to chop down some saplings
A poisonous snake bit him at that moment and he fell dead instantly
Patacara waited for him in vain and after having suffered birth pains a second son was born to her
Both children screamed at the top of their lungs because of the buffeting of the storm so the mother protected them with her own body all night long
In the morning she placed the newborn baby on her hip gave a finger to the older child and set out upon the path her husband had taken with the words Come dear child your father has left us After a few steps she found her husband lying dead his body rigid
She wailed and lamented and blamed herself for his death
She continued on her journey to her parents' house but when she came to the river Aciravati it was swollen waistdeep on account of the rain
She was too weak to wade across with both children so she left the older child on the near bank and carried the baby across to the other side
Then she returned to take the firstborn across
When she was midstream an eagle saw the new born baby and mistook it for a piece of meat
It came swooping down and in spite of Patacara's cries and screams flew off with the baby in its talons
The older boy saw his mother stop in the middle of the river and heard her loud yells
He thought she was calling him and started out after her
Immediately he was swept off by the strong current
Wailing and lamenting Patacara went on her way halfcrazed by the triple tragedy that had befallen her losing husband and both sons within one day
As she came nearer to Savatthi she met a traveler who was just coming from the city
She inquired about her family from him but at first he refused to answer her
When she insisted he finally bad to tell her that her parents house had collapsed in the storm killing both of them as well as her brother and that the cremation was just taking place
When she heard that her reason left her because her grief was too much to bear
She tore off her clothes wandered around weeping and wailing not knowing what she was doing or where she was going
People pelted her with stones and rubbish and chased her out of the way
At that time the Buddha was staying at the Jeta Grove Anathapindika's Monastery
He saw Patacara approaching from afar and recognized that in a past life she had made an earnest resolve to become a nun well versed in the Law
Therefore he instructed his disciples not to obstruct her but to let her enter and come near him
As soon as she was close to the Buddha through his supernatural powers she regained her right mind
Then she also became aware of being naked and in her shame she crouched upon the ground
One of the layfollowers threw her a cloak and after she had wrapped herself in it she prostrated at the feet of the Buddha
Then she recounted to him the tragedy that had befallen her
The Teacher listened to her with compassion and then made it clear to her that these painful experiences she had gone through were only tiny drops in the ocean of impermanence in which all beings drown if they are attached to that which rises and ceases
He told her that all through many existences she had wept more tears over the loss of dear ones than could be contained in the waters of the four oceans
He said
This exposition of the Awakened One penetrated her mind so deeply that at that moment she could completely grasp the impermanence of all conditioned things
When the Enlightened One had finished his teaching she had attained the certainty of future liberation by becoming a streamwinner
She practiced diligently and soon realized final deliverance
She said
It had been enough for her to see the water trickle down the slope to recognize the whole of existence each life a longer or shorter trickle in the flood of craving
There were those that lived a short time like her children those  like her husband  who lived a little longer or her parents who lived longer yet
But all passed by a constant change in a neverending rising and ceasing
This thoughtprocess gave her so much detachment that she attained to total emancipation the following night
The Buddha said about Patacara that she was the foremost Keeper of the Vinaya amongst the Nuns
Patacara was thereby the female counterpart of the monk Upali
That she had chosen the Rules of Conduct as her central discipline is easy to understand because the results of her former indulgences had become bitterly obvious to her
She learned in the Sangha that an intensive study of the rules was necessary and purifying and brought with it the security and safety of selfdiscipline she learned not to become complacent through wellbeing or anxious and confused through suffering
Because of her own experiences she had gained a deep understanding for the human predicament and could be of great assistance to her fellow nuns
She was a great comfort to those who came to her in difficulties
The nun Canda said that Patacara showed her the right path out of compassion and helped her to achieve emancipation

Another nun Uttara II reported how Patacara spoke to the group of nuns about conduct and discipline
Uttara took Patacara's words to heart and said
Thereby this nun too was able to attain to the three True Knowledges and final liberation
In the Verses of the Elder Nuns we have a record of Patacara's instructions to the nuns and their resultant gains
 
Patacara was able to effect the change from a frivolous young girl to a Sangha Elder so quickly because from previous births she had already possessed this faculty
During the previous Buddha's existence it is said that she had been a nun and had lived the holy life for many many years
The insights gained thereby had been hidden through her actions in subsequent lives
But when the next Buddha appeared in the world she quickly found her way to him the reason unbeknown to herself spurred on by her suffering
Relentlessly attracted to the Awakened One and his doctrine she entered into the homeless life and soon attained to eternal freedom
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Seven weeks after the recluse Siddhattha Gotama attained Supreme Enlightenment and came to be known as the Buddha he gave his first discourse to the group of five ascetics with whom he had been associated six years earlier
These five ascetics were Kondañña Bhaddiya Vappa Mahanama and Assaji
By the first discourse the Buddha set in motion the Wheel of the Law
He explained to the five ascetics why he had discarded the two extremes of indulgence and mortification he declared that he had discovered the Middle Way which is the Noble Eightfold Path leading to Enlightenment he expounded the Four Noble Truths and convinced the five ascetics that he had attained Supreme Enlightenment
At the end of the first discourse the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Kondañña thus all that is subject to arising is subject to cessation The Venerable Kondañña then told the Buddha that he wished to go forth under the Blessed One and asked for Full Admission which he received
With further instruction by the Buddha the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the Ven
Vappa the Ven
Bhaddiya the Ven
Mahanama and the Ven
Assaji in this order
They too knew thus all that is subject to arising is subject to cessation These four ascetics too expressed their wish to go forth under the Blessed One and asked for Full Admission which they received
At this stage then the first five disciples of the Buddha had insight only into the impermanence of anything which had a conditioned origin
It was at this stage that the Buddha gave his second discourse
Between the first and second discourses the Buddha had in his instructions to the five disciples analyzed the sentient being into five aggregates
These five were material form feelings perceptions volitional states and consciousness
The Buddha showed that the sentient being was made up of these five aggregates only
The disciples had to have this knowledge to follow the second discourse
Having thus instructed the five disciples the Buddha gave the discourse on the Noself characteristic of existence
Noself is one of the three characteristics of existence the other two being impermanence and unsatisfactoriness
These three are interrelated and one cannot be taken apart from the other two
They are found only in the teaching of the Buddha
Impermanence may appear obvious to some who see the gross origin and disappearance of animate and inanimate entities
However the Buddha's teaching goes beyond the gross and obvious and extends also to the mind including its most subtle and sublime level
He taught that anything which has an origin exists only for a fleeting moment and that what appears to be compact and stable both animate and inanimate is from moment to moment arising and perishing
This fact can be experienced by one who follows the Noble Eightfold Path
Unsatisfactoriness is a fact of life regardless of whether those critical of the Buddha's teaching label this as pessimism or not
The First Noble Truth explains why this existence is essentially unsatisfactory
Some do not accept this view because for the time being all appears to be going well for them some see it in others but do not give it much thought because it does not affect them some are unable to see this unsatisfactoriness due to mental impairment or gross ignorance some would accept that life has its suffering and resign themselves to it stating that it is all due to original sin The Buddha did not hesitate to focus full attention on this characteristic of existence and did so because he was aware of its cause and knew that others too could realize this for themselves
The cause of this unsatisfactoriness is found in the other two characteristics of existence
Noself means that there is no permanent unchanging entity in anything animate or inanimate
With regard to the animate this implies the absence of a soul which either emanated from a divine source or was created by a divine being
Biblical religions bless only the human being in the whole of the animal kingdom with this soul
The Noself doctrine is found only in the teaching of the Buddha
At least an intellectual grasp of this characteristic of existence is needed to appreciate the Buddha's teaching
It is only when insight is gained in this respect that progress can be made along the Path to full enlightenment
The second discourse can be analyzed into the following parts
Introduction A statement is made by the arahant Ananda to the First Council of the five hundred arahants who met at Rajagaha two months after the Buddha's Parinibbana for the purpose of rehearsing the Law and the Discipline as expounded by the Buddha
A categorical statement is made by the Buddha with reference to each of the five aggregates namely the material form and the mental components which are feeling perception volitional states and consciousness
The Buddha also explains in this section of the discourse the reasons for his statements
The Buddha questions the five disciples as to whether each of the five aggregates is permanent or impermanent
The disciples agree that the aggregates are impermanent
Then on further questioning they agree that what is impermanent is unsatisfactory
Going on to the next logical conclusion they agree that what is impermanent unsatisfactory and changing cannot really belong to anyone nor can it be said that these aggregates form an abiding essence in a sentient being
Conclusions are drawn from the foregoing analysis in respect of each of the aggregates in any form whatsoever
The result of this analysis which is insight into the true nature of a sentient being leads to initial disenchantment with the aggregates then detachment and equanimity and final emancipation
The five disciples were delighted with the Buddha's discourse and all attained enlightenment so that at the end of this discourse there were six arahants in this world
There is an implication here that unless one gains insight into the Noself characteristic of existence it is not possible to start on the path to Enlightenment
Of the ten fetters that bind us down to wanderings in Samsara belief in a soul is the first to be broken
Hence the profound importance of this discourse
This second discourse was on a discovery which was revolutionary in human thought
Before the Buddha's time and even after religious teachers emphasized the existence of an abiding soul
A skeptic would say that this soulless doctrine is one of hopelessness and despair and equates a sentient being to an automaton
On the contrary the Noself doctrine gives the sentient being the highest sense of responsibility the greatest amount of encouragement the highest measure of hope and is conducive to contentment which will be reflected in the disciple's attitude to other fellow beings which is the only way to put an end to all the strife on this earth
Can we verify for ourselves the truth of this aspect of the Buddha's teaching
The Buddha urged his disciples to investigate the Dhamma
In fact this investigation is the second of the seven enlightenment factors
In order to convince ourselves about the truth of this doctrine we have to follow the Noble Eightfold Path
By constant mindfulness and insight meditation we will know whether this teaching is true or not
The bodily form is subject to disease decay and death over which we have no ultimate control
The body does not decide to move stand sit or lie down
These movements are always preceded by a mental directive
So the ultimate truth is that we cannot state that 'the body is mine' or 'I am the body' We do however use these terms but this usage is only a conventional expression
The mental components arise exist for a moment and then perish
They arise dependent on conditions so here again according to the ultimate truth we cannot state that the 'mental components are mine' or 'I am the mental components'
Now according to this teaching of Noself wherein lies the responsibility the hope and the possibility of enlightenment
As regards bodily form we have no ultimate control over it
Even the Buddha and the arahants suffered bodily afflictions
Disease decay and death cannot be prevented
The young die through accident or disease
Living brings in its trail all the signs of decay
Kamma alone decides the fate of this bodily form
All we can do in this present existence is to avoid the two extremes which the Buddha discarded namely indulgence and mortification
The rest will happen to the bodily form regardless of our interference
This does not mean that when the body is afflicted by accident or disease no attempt should be made to alleviate such affliction if ways and means were available
A negative attitude in this respect would amount to one of the extremes namely mortification
The Buddha too had a physician and his name was Jivaka
On the other hand it is different with the mental components
These arise dependent on conditions which are intimately connected with what are called the roots which are either unwholesome or wholesome found in various combinations and degrees in all worldlings that is in those who have not reached Sainthood
The unwholesome roots are
In a person tainted with greed and lust the mental components will be predominantly those associated with greed and lust
As a result volition will produce actions bodily verbal and mental which will reflect these taints and bring in their trail unpleasant consequences in accordance with the Law of Action and Reaction
The same applies to the other two roots of an unwholesome nature
Even though our past unwholesome volitions are resulting now in painful and unpleasant feelings perceptions and consciousness we can accept these with wisdom and set out on a favourable course by replacing the unwholesome roots by wholesome ones that is
In the discourse the Buddha said that with reference to any of the aggregates because there is no self the possibility does not exist whereby it could be said may my be thus and may my not be thus The conclusion to be drawn from this is that it is futile to expect returns from prayer appeal entreaty or offering to an outside source or by wishing and just hoping for the best
The Buddhist teaching is that we have to make the effort ourselves
Help we may get from outside in the form of salutary advice and association with the wise but in the final analysis as stated in verse of the Dhammapada striving should be done by ourselves the Tathagatas are only teachers How do we strive
It is by following the Eightfold Path
The unwholesome roots are replaced by wholesome ones as progress is made and the end of the Path is reached the Saints have neither unwholesome nor wholesome roots theirs actions are kammically inoperative and this is the summum bonum of the Dhamma
This striving is by no means easy
The Buddha was realistic about this
In verse of the Dhammapada it is stated By degrees little by little from time to time a wise person should remove his own impurities as a smith removes of silver
Confidence in the Threefold Refuge diligent application and patience will take the disciple along the Path
What then is the cause of this delusion that a self or soul exists
It is purely subjective born of ignorance and nourished by the roots both unwholesome and wholesome
It is lack of insight into the most profound statement ever made that bare phenomena roll on There is no doer but only the action there is no speaker but only the utterance there is no thinker but only the thought
The Noself doctrine leads to harmlessness contentment and peace
In contrast it would be pertinent to refer briefly to some of the repercussions of the Self or Soul Doctrine
Even in very ancient times the sentient being as a result of stimuli from the senses in different forms had the subjective impression that there was something abiding in himself which may be called the Self or Soul
He also had the notion that this entity had the capacity to possess and own animate and inanimate objects
His survival depended on protecting this self
Apart from his own efforts towards this end when the situation seemed to be beyond his control or when events occurred that he could not understand he looked for someone outside of himself for protection and to provide an answer to the mysterious
This outside source had to be someone better than any of his fellow beings
It had to be supernatural
In times of calamity he looked up to the supernatural for help to ward off the danger
At times he also made bargains with the supernatural to improve his lot perhaps in comparison with that of his fellow beings
Even at this socalled primitive stage repercussions of the self view were harmful
He would resort to anything to preserve the self and its possessions and obviously for his own gain he had to please his protector usually by making sacrifices of innocent animals or even humans
Then there started arriving on the scene different individuals of mystic temperaments who claimed that they had revelations of the supernatural
They not only made this claim but also said they had a message for mankind from the supernatural
They said that the soul was created by the supernatural being emanated from that source and that this soul must be purified so that at the termination of this existence on earth the soul will live in everlasting happiness in communion with the supernatural
As a result of the appearance of these intermediaries between the supernatural and the mortal being organized theistic religion started
The message these intermediaries brought was not necessarily mild and peaceful
It doomed to eternal damnation anyone who did not believe the message it exhorted the believer to spread the message even by force it brooked no questioning regarding the validity of the message it gave no explanation for the diversities incongruities and misfortunes seen in this existence except to say that it was the will of the supernatural
Each group of believers insisted that its intermediary was the only genuine one and from a sense of loyalty fear or selfinterest or combination of all bloody conflicts arose between the followers of the different theistic religions and they continue even to this day
Mention must also be made of another section of mankind of relatively recent origin who reacting violently to the social evils of theism went to the other extreme and have abandoned all spiritual values are not concerned with a life hereafter and devote all their energy and skill to further the material aspects of existence
In pursuit of this they have caused and are still causing considerable suffering among fellow beings
They are as pernicious as anyone else who forcibly imposes views and philosophies on others
Progress on the material side alone is not enough
True happiness and contentment result from an emancipated mind and from nothing else
The discourse is given in full each section being given first in Pali faced by a literal English translation
By including the Pali it is hoped that it will stimulate some to study this inspiring language
What appears to be repetitions are in fact not so
One must bear in mind that the discourse contains a pronouncement that is the most lofty and revealing in human thought that has ever been made
Like presentday legal documents nothing was taken for granted and nothing unnecessary was said
When the bodily form is afflicted the relevant part of the discourse can be recalled to one's mind and the same could be applied when feelings perceptions volitional states and consciousness arise and fall
It is hoped that reproduction of the discourse in full will be of benefit to the Buddha's disciples

Thus it was heard by me
At one time the Blessed One was living in the deer park of Isipatana near Benares
There indeed the Blessed One addressed the group of five monks
Form O monks is notself if form were self then form would not lead to affliction and it should obtain regarding form 'May my form be thus may my form not be thus' and indeed O monks since form is notself therefore form leads to affliction and it does not obtain regarding form 'May my form be thus may my form not be thus'
Feeling O monks is notself if feeling were self then feeling would not lead to affliction and it should obtain regarding feeling 'May my feeling be thus may my feeling not be thus' and indeed O monks since feeling is notself therefore feeling leads to affliction and it does not obtain regarding feeling 'May my feeling be thus may my feeling not be thus'
Perception O monks is notself if perception were self then perception would not lead to affliction and it should obtain regarding perception 'May my perception be thus may my perception not be thus' and indeed O monks since perception is notself therefore perception leads to affliction and it does not obtain regarding perception 'May my perception be thus may my perception not be thus'
Mental formations O monks are notself if mental formations were self then mental formations would not lead to affliction and it should obtain regarding mental formations 'May my perception be thus may my mental formations not be thus' and indeed O monks since mental formations are notself therefore mental formations lead to affliction and it does not obtain regarding mental formations 'May my mental formations be thus may my mental formations not be thus'
Consciousness O monks is notself if consciousness were self then consciousness would not lead to affliction and it should obtain regarding consciousness 'May my consciousness be thus may my consciousness not be thus' and indeed O monks since consciousness is notself therefore consciousness leads to affliction and it does not obtain regarding consciousness 'May my consciousness be thus may my consciousness not be thus'
What do you think of this O monks
Is form permanent or impermanent
Impermanent O Lord
Now that which is impermanent is it unsatisfactory or satisfactory
Unsatisfactory O Lord
Now that which is impermanent unsatisfactory subject to change is it proper to regard that as 'This is mine this I am this is my self'
Indeed not that O Lord
What do you think of this O monks
Is feeling permanent or impermanent
Impermanent O Lord
Now that which is impermanent is it unsatisfactory or satisfactory
Unsatisfactory O Lord
Now that which is impermanent unsatisfactory subject to change is it proper to regard that as 'This is mine this I am this is my self'
Indeed not that O Lord
What do you think of this O monks
Is perception permanent or impermanent
Impermanent O Lord
Now what is impermanent is it unsatisfactory or satisfactory
Unsatisfactory O Lord
Now that which is impermanent unsatisfactory subject to change is it proper to regard that as 'This is mine this I am this is my self'
Indeed not that O Lord
What do you think of this O monks
Are mental formations permanent or impermanent
Impermanent O Lord
Now those that are impermanent are they unsatisfactory or satisfactory
Unsatisfactory O Lord
Now those that are impermanent unsatisfactory subject to change is it proper to regard them as 'They are mine this I am this is my self'
Indeed not that O Lord
Now what do you think of this O monks
Is consciousness permanent or impermanent
Impermanent O Lord
Now what is impermanent is that unsatisfactory or satisfactory
Unsatisfactory O Lord
Now what is impermanent unsatisfactory subject to change is it proper to regard it as 'This is mine this I am this is my self'
Indeed not that O Lord
Therefore surely O monks whatever form past future or present internal or external coarse or fine low or lofty far or near all that form must be regarded with proper wisdom according to reality thus 'This is not mine this I am not this is not my self'
Therefore surely O monks whatever feeling past future or present internal or external coarse or fine low or lofty far or near all that feeling must be regarded with proper wisdom according to reality thus 'This is not mine this I am not this is not my self'
Therefore surely O monks whatever perception past future or present internal or external coarse or fine low or lofty far or near all that perception must be regarded with proper wisdom according to reality thus 'This is not mine this I am not this is not my self'
Therefore surely O monks whatever mental formations past future or present internal or external coarse or fine low or lofty far or near all those mental formations must be regarded with proper wisdom according to reality thus 'These are not mine this I am not this is not my self'
Therefore surely O monks whatever consciousness past future or present internal or external coarse or fine low or lofty far or near all that consciousness must be regarded with proper wisdom according to reality thus 'This is not mine this I am not this is not my self'
O monks the wellinstructed noble disciple seeing thus gets wearied of form gets wearied of feeling gets wearied of perception gets wearied of mental formations gets wearied of consciousness
Being wearied he becomes passionfree
In his freedom from passion he is emancipated
Being emancipated there is the knowledge that he is emancipated
He knows 'birth is exhausted lived is the holy life what had to be done is done there is nothing more of this becoming' This the Blessed One said
Pleased the group of five monks were delighted with the exposition of the Blessed One moreover as this exposition was being spoken the minds of the group of five monks were freed of defilements without attachment
Indeed at that time there were six arahants in the world
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
 Theragatha verse
Near the capital of the kingdom of Magadha there were several townships
In one of them Kolita Moggallana was born in a Brahmanic family which claimed descent from Mudgala one of the ancient seers
Thus this clan was named the Moggallans The small town was inhabited entirely by Brahmans and was ultraconservative Kolita's father was born of the most prominent family from which usually the town's mayor was appointed
Being a member of such a high caste and of the town's most respected family his father was almost like a petty king
Thus Kolita grew up in an environment of wealth and honor knowing of no sorrows
He was educated entirely in the Brahmanic tradition which was based on the law of the seeds and ripening of actions
As a matter of course that education included the belief in a life beyond making it part and parcel of everyday life and its rituals
Kolita's family lived on very friendly terms with another Brahmanic family from a neighboring village
On the very day of Kolita's birth also to the other family a son was born whom they named Upatissa
When the children grew up they became friends and soon they were inseparable
Whatever they did they did together whether it was play or study pleasure or work
Always they were seen together and their undisturbed friendship was to last for life for more than eighty years
They never quarreled nor bore a grudge against each other
Always they lived amicably and stuck together in whatever difficulties
Yet in their character dispositions they were quite different
Upatissa was more of a pioneer type daring and enterprising while Kolita's way was to preserve to cultivate and to enrich what he had gained
Also their place within their families was different
Kolita was the only child but Upatissa had three brothers and three sisters
To both their friendship meant so much and filled their daily life to such an extent that as young men they had little interest in the other sex though they were not quite free from the lightheartedness and indulgences of their youthful age
Each of them was the leader of a group of friends with whom they undertook many kinds of play and sport in high spirits
When they went to the river Kolita's companions came on horse back and those of Upatissa were carried in palanquins
It was similar with Francis of Assisi he too had been the leader of a group of playboys and like him both friends too had been enamored by the intoxications of youth health and life
In Rajagaha Magadha's capital there was annually a great public celebration with popular shows and amusements which was called the hill festival Of course both friends too went to enjoy it
They had places reserved for them from where they could easily watch the entertainments
When there was something to laugh they to joined in the laughter and when there was something fascinating they too got excited
They enjoyed these entertainments so much that they went there also for a second day and continued to watch keenly the performances which were a mixture of folksy comedies and old legends
But the heightening of their joyful mood which they had expected failed to come
Still they had their places reserved for the third day too as a new program of entertainments had been announced in glowing terms
They slept badly that night as the impressions of the previous day still haunted their minds
While thus kept awake Kolita thought What's the use of all that for us
Is there really anything worthwhile to be seen
What benefit does it give
After a few years these glamorous actors will be old and feeble they will leave the stage of life and continue their migrations through existence driven by their cravings
The same it is with us
These actors cannot help themselves to solve the problem of existence
How then can they help us
We just waste here our time instead of thinking of our liberation
Upatissa too had spent a restless night and quite similar thoughts had come to him
He reflected how these ancient myths and legends dramatized in those performances actually concerned the reality of rebirth but the jokes and frolics overlaying those ideas in the plays pretended that there was only this present life one need be concerned with
Was this not an artificial suppression and repression of truth by vain illusions
When on the morning of the third day they went to their places at the festival Kolita said to his friend What is the matter with you
You are not as merry as you have been
What depresses you His friend replied Tell me what is the use to us of all these pleasures of eye and ear
It is absolutely useless and worthless
What I would rather do is seek a way of release from that devastating law of impermanence a way to liberation from the fleeting illusions of life which alluringly haunt us and yet leave us empty
That is what went through my head and made me think
But you too dear Kolita look anything else but cheerful Kolita replied I have felt the same as you did
Why should we stay any longer here in this unholy vanity show
We should seek the way to the Holy When Upatissa heard that his friend had the very same wish he happily exclaimed That is a good thought that came to us independent from each other
We have wasted our life and our time long enough with all those unprofitable things
But if one earnestly seeks a teaching of deliverance one has to give up home and possessions and go forth as a homeless pilgrim free of worldly and sensual bonds rising above them like a feathered bird
So the two friends decided to take the life of ascetics who then as they still do now wandered in large numbers along the roads of India in search of a spiritual teacher a Guru who could guide them
When they told their followers about their decision these young men were so impressed that most of them joined in that spiritual quest
So all of them gave up home life took off the sacred Brahmanic thread cut hair and beard and put on the pale earthcolored garments of religious wanderers
Discarding all distinguishing marks and privileges of their caste they entered the classless society of ascetics
It was about the same time when Prince Siddhattha married that Kolita and Upatissa left behind their worldly homes and started upon their quest for inner peace and salvation
Together with their friends they began a period of training under a spiritual teacher just as the Bodhisatta did later
At that time there were many teachers with many different views
Some of them even taught amoralism others taught fatalism and again others taught materialism
Both friends realized the hollowness of such teachings early enough and thus did not take them too seriously
In Rajagaha however there was one teacher who appealed to them
His name was Sanjaya who according to tradition was identical with Sanjaya Belatthaputta mentioned in the Pali canon as one of the six nonBuddhist teachers
Under him the group of friends was ordained which added considerably to Sanjaya's reputation
What did he teach them
The texts do not provide an answer to this question in a way we are used to but only some key ideas are briefly indicated which for the Indian of those days was sufficient for making them understand the substance of these teachings
Contrary to other ascetic teachers who made definite dogmatic statements about specific topics Sanjaya posed what may be called the deepest existential problems in a more comprehensive way
Firstly Is there another world beyond our empirical surface experience
Secondly After the death of this material body does one appear in that other world by way of a purely mental birth process as a spontaneously arisen being
Thirdly Whatever action one had committed in this carnal existence be it good or bad will it take effect in the next life be it of a spiritual or human type by way of reward or punishment thus constituting our destiny
Fourthly What finally is the destiny of a Perfected One after death
In which way is it possible to conceive and describe his state or condition
Whenever such questions were raised by ancient Indian thinkers four alternative types of answers were thought to be possible affirmation negation partial affirmation and partial negation neither affirmation nor negation
Sanjaya however taught that with regard to the questions mentioned none of those four positions was acceptable as a solution they all contained unresolvable contradictions and therefore one should refrain from any judgment about these problems
Here it may be noted that from the four sets of antinomies which often occur in the Pali scriptures only the fourth set is identical with Sanjaya's problems namely the one concerning the afterdeath state of a Perfected One
While other ascetic teachers as a solution of their problems always advocated one of the four logical alternatives  yes no yes and no neithernor  Sanjaya did not commit himself to any of them
Especially he did not commit himself dogmatically to the unprovable assertion that there is no world beyond no mindmade body no law of Karma and no survival after death
In that attitude he clearly differed from the materialists of his time
He rather taught that in view of the unresolvable nature of these problems one should keep to a stance of detachment and impartiality not tolerating the slightest bias towards approval or disapproval of any of these theories and their consequences
From that we can see that he was a confirmed agnostic and skeptic of a peculiar brand who tried to convert the purely negative Ignorabimus into a definite philosophical attitude
In some ways he was what we nowadays would call an existentialist
He taught so to speak a kind of dialectical existentialism instead of dialectical materialism
An Indian king Ajatasattu reported to the Buddha the following talk he had with the ascetic Sanjaya
Thus Lord did Sanjaya of the Belattha clan when asked what was the immediate fruit and advantage in the life of a recluse show his manner or prevarication
 Digha Nikaya No adapted from the translation by TW
Rhys Davids
But Kolita and Upatissa who at that time had not found any better teacher were attracted by Sanjaya as they must have felt that his philosophical stance was something more than mere evasion
Yet after a short time they realized that Sanjaya did not know what they were searching for a cure for the illness of universal suffering
Besides they intuitively felt sure that there actually was another world that there were mindborn beings and that there was a moral recompense of actions
In so far their understanding went beyond that of their skeptical teacher
Furthermore Sanjaya in total contradiction to his dogmatic skepticism had once declared that his best disciples had been reborn at such and such a place
Hence one day the two friends approached Sanjaya and asked him whether he had still other teachings to convey than those they had learned from him
To this he replied That is all
You know my entire teaching Hearing this they decided to leave and to continue their search
They felt that it was for finding liberation that they had left their families and not for the sake of endless and futile agnostic arguments
Thus for a second time they took up the life of wanderers in search of truth
Again they walked across India for many years from North to South from East to West
They endured the dust of the road and the tormenting heat the rain and the wind being spurred on by thoughts that moved the mind of many Indians

In their travels they met many ascetics and brahmans who had the reputation to be exceptionally wise
With them they had religious talks on God and world heaven and hell and on the meaning of life and the way of salvation
But with their keen and critical minds trained by Sanjaya's skepticism they very soon realized the emptiness of all those assertions and the learned ignorance of these philosophers
None of these teachers could answer their probing questions while the two friends themselves were quite able to reply when questioned
There is no record that tells us to which other teachers they had gone
But it would be surprising if the two truthseekers had not met such mystics and sages as for instance the seer Bavari of great meditative power or the two teachers of Formless Infinity whose disciple the Bodhisattva was for some time
But from their life story we can conclude that the two attained as little to the worldtranscending experience of liberation as the Bodhisattva did
What may have been the cause of that lack of attainment
There are two possibilities for spiritual seekers either to gain inner peace and serenity by deep meditation or to seek for a clear teaching about the meaning of existence in its entirety which encompasses the meaning of that inner peace
Those who had achieved such inner peace through meditation mostly gave up any further search as they had found an overwhelming bliss which they believed to be the goal
But at its best this bliss would last a few aeons in one of the celestial worlds and then its kammic force would be spent leaving the meditators in the same samsaric imprisonment as before
In former lives this must have happened often to the Bodhisattva as well as to Kolita and Upatissa
Though the two friends had no recollection of such previous experiences they obviously had an intuitive feeling that meditative bliss and its rewards were not the final goal but only a temporary relief within the continuing cycle of suffering
Hence their foremost quest was for clarity about the concatenation of existence how things hang together in this complex Samsara
But such clarity cannot be found without the help of a Buddha
Hence they had to continue their search until it had led them to the Buddha
In ages void of a Buddha's appearance their search would have been as futile as the recurring attainment enjoyment and again losing of Samadhi
It may have been an undefinable inner urge within them which did not allow them to rest until they had found the Buddha who like them had gone forth in search of liberation during the last years of their own quest
If even the Bodhisattva the future Buddha only in the pressing situation of a great spiritual crisis remembered the meditative experience of his young years and only then could see it and use it as a gate to liberation it was not to be expected that the two friends would find out by themselves that meditative absorption was to be used as a gate of access to higher stages of the mind's emancipation
They neither had the meditative experience nor the wide and independent mental range of a Buddha
This is one of the aspects of existential misery of prisonlike ignorance either one settles down at the gate regarding it as the mystics do as one's true home of peace and bliss or one bypasses it quickly
In retrospect the friends' wanderings in search of truth were just a going in circles in expectation of a Buddha's message of the liberating Path
Without knowing anything of the Buddha they gave up their life as wanderers and after about twenty years returned to their home country Magadha
This happened not long after the Buddha had set in motion the Wheel of the Dhamma at Benares
But the two friends still had not given up hope and they decided now to do their search separately for doubling their chances
They agreed among themselves that he who had first learned about a convincing path to the Deathless should quickly inform the other
At that time when both were about forty years old the Buddha had sent out the first batch of his disciples sixtyone in number and all of them saints so that they may proclaim the Teaching for the wellbeing and happiness of men
The Buddha himself had gone to Rajagaha where the Maharaja of Magadha soon became his follower and donated to him the Bamboo Grove Monastery
At that monastery he lived when Kolita and Upatissa returned to Rajagaha staying at Sanjaya's place
One day Upatissa had gone to the town while Kolita had stayed back at their dwelling
Kolita saw his friend returning but never had he seen him like that his entire being seemed to be transformed his appearance was buoyant and radiant
Eagerly Kolita asked him
Your features are so serene dear friend and your complexion is so bright and clear
Should it have happened that you have found the road to the Deathless
Upatissa then replied It is so dear friend the Deathless has been found He then reported how it happened
In town he had seen a monk whose behavior impressed him so deeply that he addressed him and asked who his teacher was
The monk whose name was Assaji was one of the first five disciples of the Buddha and one of the sixty one saints
Assaji replied that he was a disciple of the ascetic of the Sakya clan
When Upatissa begged him to explain his teacher's doctrine Assaji said that he could not do so as he had been ordained only a few months ago
He could only tell him in brief the quintessence of the teaching
When Upatissa said that he would be satisfied knowing just the gist of the teaching in short Assaji replied by way of that short stanza which was to become famous wherever the Buddha's teaching spread in the centuries and millennia that followed
This is the original Pali text and its translation
In literal translation
When Upatissa heard this stanza the vision of truth arose in him on the spot and the very same happened to Kolita when he listened to the stanza retold by his friend
He too realized Whatever arises is bound to vanish
The realization that was evoked by this stanza may be called a truly mystical event
For us these four lines do not contain an explanation explicit enough for a full understanding
The deeper and wider meaning of the stanza reveals itself only to those who have trained themselves for long in wisdom and renunciation and have reflected long upon the impermanent and the Deathless the conditioned and the Unconditioned
This stanza will have such a revolutionary impact only on those who are so singleminded that they have become accustomed to investigate things only in those terms of the conditioned and Unconditioned
As the two friends were inwardly prepared Assaji's stanza had the power to lead them to the attainment of streamentry which bestows the first vision of the Deathless beyond the transience of phenomenal existence where death ever reigns
In a flash of awakening they had seen the Uncreated
Here it is of interest to note that the three monks who were closest to the Buddha Ananda and the two Chief Disciples did not attain to streamentry by the Buddha's own instruction but through the guidance of others Ananda through his Sanghateacher the arahant Punna Mantaniputta Upatissa through the arahant Assaji and Kolita even through one who was not an arahant but only a streamenterer
For making such an attainment possible Kolita needed to possess strong confidence in his friend as well as in truth and Kolita did have this confidence
After Kolita had listened to that powerful stanza he asked at once where the Great Ascetic the Perfected One was staying
Hearing that he was staying nor far away at the Bamboo Grove Monastery he wished to go there immediately
But Upatissa asked him to wait saying Let us first go to Sanjaya and tell him that we have found the Deathless
If he can understand he is sure to make progress towards the truth
But if he cannot comprehend at once he may perhaps have confidence enough to join us when we go to see the Master
Then on listening to the Awakened One himself he will certainly understand
Thus the friends went to their former Master and said Listen O Teacher listen
A fully Awakened One has appeared in the world
Well proclaimed is his teaching and his monks live the fully purified life of ascetics
Come with us to see him But Sanjaya could not bring himself to join them but on the contrary offered them to take over the leadership of his following along with him as his equals
If they accepted this they would gain a great reputation because spiritual teachers enjoyed at that time the highest respect
But the two replied that they would not mind remaining pupils for life whether under him or under the Buddha
But they would ask him to make up his mind now as their own decision was final
Sanjaya however torn by indecision lamented I cannot no I cannot
For so many years I have been a teacher and had a large following of disciples
Should I now become a pupil again it would be as if a mighty lake were to change into a miserable puddle  Thus he was moved by conflicting sentiments his longing for truth and the desire to keep his superior position contended within him
Yet the urge to preserve his status was stronger and he yielded to it
At that time Sanjaya had about five hundred disciples
When they learned that the two friends had decided to follow the Buddha spontaneously all of them wanted to join
But when they noticed that Sanjaya remained behind half of them wavered and returned to their accustomed habitat
Sanjaya seeing that he had lost so many of his disciples was stricken by grief and despair so much that as the texts tell hot blood spurted from his mouth
Now the two friends at the head of the two hundred and fifty fellow ascetics approached the Bamboo Grove
There the Buddha was just teaching Dhamma to his monks and when he saw the two friends approaching the Awakened One said Here monks they are coming the two friends Kolita and Upatissa
They will be my Chief Disciples a blessed pair Having arrived all saluted respectfully the Buddha raising their folded palms to the forehead and bowing at the feet of the Master
Then the two friends spoke May we be permitted O Lord to obtain under the Blessed One the GoingForth and the Full Admission Then the Blessed One responded Come monks well proclaimed is the Teaching Live now the Life of Purity for making an end of suffering These brief words served to bestow ordination on the two friends and their following
From now Upatissa was called Sariputta that means the son of Sari which was the name of his mother
Kolita was called MahaMoggallana the Great One of the Moggallana clan to distinguish him from other monks of that clan such as GanakaMoggallana and GopakaMoggallana
After all of them had obtained ordination the Buddha addressed the two hundred and fifty disciples and explained to them the Teaching in such a way that before long they attained to the first stage of emancipation streamentry and in due course became arahants
Sariputta and Moggallana however went into solitude but this time separate from each other
Sariputta remained in the vicinity of Rajagaha and went to meditate in a cave called Bear's Den From there he walked to the city for his alms which afforded him the opportunity to listen often to the Buddha's discourses
What he had heard from the Master he independently worked over in his own thoughts and he methodically penetrated to clear understanding of the mind and its laws
He needed fourteen days for reaching Sainthood the utter destruction of all Taints
Moggallana however for reasons not known to us chose as his abode the forests near the village of Kallavalaputta in Magadha
With great zeal he meditated there while sitting or walking up and down
But in these efforts he was often overcome by sleepiness
Though he did not wish to fall asleep he was unable to keep his body erect and his head upright
There were times when he had to keep his eyes open even by force of will
If one thinks of the tropical heat the strain of his long years of a wandering life and the inner tensions he had gone through one can well understand that now at the end of his quest his body reacted by fatigue
But the Awakened One with a great teacher's solicitude for his disciples did not lose sight of him
With his supernormal vision he perceived the difficulties of the new monk and by magic power he appeared before him
When Moggallana saw the Master standing before him a good part of his fatigue had already vanished
Now the Awakened One asked him
Well then Moggallana at whatever thought drowsiness befalls you to that thought you should not give attention and not dwell on that thought
Then by doing so it is possible that your drowsiness will vanish
But if by doing so drowsiness does not vanish then you should reflect upon the Teaching as you have heard and learned it you should ponder over it and examine it closely in your mind
Then by doing so it is possible that your drowsiness will vanish
But if by doing so drowsiness does not vanish then you should repeat in full detail the Teaching as you have heard and learned it
Then by doing so it is possible that drowsiness will vanish
But if by doing so drowsiness does not vanish then you should pull both earlobes and rub your limbs with your hand
Then by doing so it is possible that drowsiness will vanish
But if by doing so drowsiness does not vanish you should get up from your seat and after washing your eyes with water you should look around in all directions and upwards to the stars and constellations
Then by doing so it is possible that your drowsiness will vanish
But if by doing so drowsiness does not vanish you should give attention to the perception of light to the perception of day as by day so by night as by night so by day
Thus with your mind clear and unclouded you should cultivate a mind that is full of brightness
Then by doing so it is possible that your drowsiness will vanish
But if by doing so drowsiness does not vanish then with your senses turned inward and your mind not straying outward you should take to walking up and down being aware of going to and fro
Then by doing so it is possible that your drowsiness will vanish
But if by doing so drowsiness does not vanish you may mindfully and clearly aware lie down lionlike on your right side placing foot on foot keeping in mind the thought of rising and on awakening you should quickly get up thinking 'I must not indulge in the comfort of resting and reclining in the pleasure of sleeping'
Thus Moggallana should you train yourself
 Anguttara Nikaya VII 
Here the Buddha gives Moggallana a graded sequence of advice how to overcome drowsiness
The first and best device is not to pay attention to the thought causing or preceding the state of drowsiness
This is however the most difficult method
If one does not succeed with it one may summon some energizing thoughts or one may reflect upon the excellence of the Teaching or recite parts of it by heart
If these mental remedies do not help one should turn to bodily activity as for instance pulling one's ears shaking the body activating the circulation by rubbing one's limbs refreshing one's eyes with cold water and at night looking at the grandeur of the starry sky which may make one forget one's petty drowsiness as it happened to the monk of old who spoke the following verse
 Theragatha v trans
by CAF
Rhys Davids
If all that too does not help then he may recall the inner light of which many mystics speak and which arises in the meditations of a purified mind that has turned away from the world
Then in his practice he will be unconcerned about day or night because an inner light is shining within him
Then with his selfradiant mind he will be able to leave behind like a Brahmadeity the whole realm of days and nights as perceived by the senses
This indicated that Moggallana had experienced such states before so that the Buddha could refer to them as something known to Moggallana
This Perception of Light is mentioned in the rd Discourse of the Digha Nikaya as one of four ways of developing samadhi and as leading to Knowledge and Vision
If this method too does not help he should walk up and down mindfully and thus by resorting to bodily movement try to get rid of fatigue
If however none of these seven devices proves helpful he may just lie down and rest for a short while
But as soon as he feels refreshed he should quickly get up without allowing drowsiness to return
The Buddha's instruction on that occasion did however not stop there but continued as follows
Further Moggallana should you train yourself in this way 'I shall not speak contentious talk' Thus should you train yourself
If there is contentious talk there is sure to be much wordiness with much wordiness there will be excitement he who is excited will lose selfcontrol and if uncontrolled his mind will be far from finding concentration
Here the Awakened One points out two ways of behavior which lead to excitement and restlessness and both of them arise from too close a social contact of the monk with the laity
In one case there is the desire for recognition on the part of the monk who is proud of his status and expects respect from the laity
But if lay people pay more attention to their own business than to him he soon becomes unsure of himself is perturbed and upset
In the other case there is the intellectual delight in discussions in the conceit of one who knows better or in the pleasure of defeating others in debate
By all this one's mental energy is diverted into unprofitable channels and wasted in futile excitement
One is slack and careless in practicing the Way if one cannot keep the senses under control or allows one's mind to get excited or easily diverted
Such a condition is far from the unification of mind and inner peace obtained in meditation
After the Awakened One had instructed him on the overcoming of sleepiness and the avoidance of excitement Moggallana asked the following question
Herein Moggallana a monk has learned this 'No thing is fit to be clung to' When a monk has learned that no thing is fit to be clung to he fully knows every thing by fully knowing every thing he fully comprehends every thing when fully comprehending everything whatever feeling he experiences be it pleasant painful or indifferent he with regard to these feelings abides contemplating impermanence contemplating dispassion contemplating cessation contemplating relinquishment
When thus abiding he is not attached to anything in the world without attachment he does not hanker and without hankering he reaches within himself complete extinction 'Ceased has rebirth lived is the holy life done is the task there is no more of this or that state' thus he knows
After Moggallana had received all these personal instructions of the Master he devoted himself again to his training with great ardor
With still greater vigor he fought against the five inner hindrances
During his many years of ascetic life he already had to a great extent suppressed sensual desire and illwill which are the first and the second of these hindrances
Now with the help given by the Buddha he conquered sloth and torpor the third hindrance then he overcame the fourth hindrance restlessness and worry by avoiding unprofitable social contacts
Finally he gave up doubt the fifth hindrance by following the concluding instruction of the Buddha contemplating on the transiency of all phenomena and thus severing emotional attachment
By overcoming the five hindrances he was able to gain the experience of meditative states transcending the world of materiality and by his penetrative knowledge of existential reality he approached the gate to Nibbana
He first attained and enjoyed the overwhelming bliss of the first meditation that state of mystical absorption of mind
Yet gradually some worldly ideas intruded again claiming his attention
When thus he fell back to the level of the mental hindrances the Buddha came to his help again
This time however not with detailed instructions as before but with a brief indication that helped him to get over the impasse
The Exalted One warned him he should not lightheartedly believe to be secure in the attainment of the first Jhana but to gain more firmness in it so that his mind becomes fully immersed in it and unified
When Moggallana followed that advice his state of concentration in the first Jhana was no longer disturbed by mundane thoughts
Having thus found a firm footing on the first Jhana he gained the second absorption which he called the noble silence because all thoughts are silenced in it
Thus he advanced up to the fourth absorption
As he later told he had practiced the absorptions in a twofold way first by cultivating the Ways of Power and then by the Liberations
On his path towards the final Deliverance by Wisdom the absorptions served as stages to the Ways of Powers which led to various kinds of supernormal faculties and also opened up many gateways to wisdom
This twofold approach was his strong point when he became an arahant a Saint
For attaining to the Liberation of Mind the absorption led him to the eight Liberations culminating in the four formless absorptions
On his way to become one Liberated in Both Ways he used the fourth absorption as basis for both
In doing so he gained the Signless Concentration of Mind which is free from all that marks conditioned existence and which affords a glimpse of the Signless Element Nibbana
But this attainment too was not final as yet
For even here he lapsed into a subtle enjoyment of it
Such refined attachment is still a delusive sign or mark superimposed on a high spiritual attainment of greatest purity
But aided by the Master's instructions he could free himself from these last fetters and attain to perfect Deliverance of Mind and Deliverance by Wisdom in all their fullness and depth
Thus the venerable MahaMoggallana had become one of the Saints
He admitted that he could well say about himself that Supported by the Master a disciple may obtain the great state of the superknowledges
This entire development took place within one single week
These were indeed seven days of a tremendous impact with a significance far beyond that of its individual relevance
One must try to imagine the intensity and depth of Moggallana's determination during this short period because for a person with such a wide range of great natural gifts it was an especially heroic effort to undertake within his own active mind that hard struggle to cut through all those fetters binding him to this world of vast potentialities
It has been reported that the Buddha in the four hours of the first watch of the night of his Enlightenment remembered world periods
The appearance of timespace may have dissolved by way of contraction or something similar must have happened to Moggallana when an immensity of inner experience was condensed into one short week
Here notions of measurable duration of time fail entirely
Immured in the prison of the senses one week is no more than seven days for an ordinary person who is unaware of the infinities that burst through the limits of the common time concepts
Moggallana as he later said attained sainthood by quick penetration that is in one week but his progress was difficult requiring the helpful prompting of the Master
Sariputta too attained sainthood by quick penetration but his progress was smooth see Anguttara IV 
Moggallana had advanced to sainthood more speedily than Sariputta because the Buddha directed and inspired him personally and intensively but Sariputta was superior to him in regard to the independence of his progress
In the th text of the Longer Discourses the Awakened One speaks of six Buddhas of the past and says that each of them had two chief disciples and one attendant and elsewhere he says that all the Buddhas of the past and future had or will have one preeminent pair of disciples
When a Perfectly Awakened One is going to appear these three are as necessary to him just as the ministers of war of the interior and of finance are necessary to a king
The Buddha himself uses this comparison with a state's administration
He spoke of Ananda who could remember all discourses of the Buddha as the Treasurer of the Teaching of Sariputta as its general in command and of Moggallana as child's nurse
Of these four two groups of two had certain things in common the Buddha and Ananda belonged to the warrior caste and were born on the same day Sariputta and Moggallana however were Brahmans and likewise born on the same day
This affinity showed itself also in their lives
Ananda was always with the Buddha since the time when he started to be his attendant he followed him like a shadow whereas Moggallana was almost inseparable from Sariputta and nearly always together with him
Whenever the Buddha in advancing years felt physically tired these three men were the only ones whom he asked to expound the Teaching on his behalf
This happened for instance at Kapilavatthu when Moggallana gave a long discourse on sensecontrol as remedy against being submerged in the flood of the six sense impressions
After Sariputta and MahaMoggallana had attained Sainthood the Buddha announced to the Order that they were his chief disciples
Some of the monks were surprised and began to grumble why the Master did not treat with such distinction those ordained first the men of the first hour as for instance the Group of Five or Yasa or the three Kassapas
Why did he overlook them and give prominence to those who had entered the Order last and were young in seniority
To this the Awakened One replied that each reaps according to his merit
For aeons Sariputta and Moggallana had been progressing towards this state by gradually cultivating the necessary faculties
Others however had developed on different lines
Although both chief disciples were of another caste and from another region than the Buddha's their special position within the community of saints was an outcome of the Law of Karma
In many ways the Buddha had spoken in praise of this noble pair of disciples
 Samyutta Nikaya 
 Samyutta Nikaya 
 Majjhima Nikaya No

The characterization of the two in the last text may be interpreted as follows
Sariputta urges his pupils to cut through the first and basic fetters and thus helps them to attain streamentry
In this way he converts men by vigorously diverting them from the futility of the round of existence and guides them into the zone of safety
Sariputta like a mother watches and guides the first steps on the path of emancipation or it may be said he causes or at least assists the birth of final emancipation in the pupil
Moggallana however leads on those who thus far have been saved guiding them along their way upwards he supports them in their practice of meditation up to sainthood in the same way as he himself was helped by the master he is like a wetnurse nourishing the strength and sustaining the growth of the pupil
Both aspects are found perfectly united in a Fully Awakened One but in Sariputta and Moggallana they were separate qualifications
Though both were liberated in both ways yet with Sariputta the major emphasis was on wisdom and with Moggallana on the meditative Liberation of the Mind
This fact found perfect expression when these two spiritual sons of the Buddha had to look after Rahula the Buddha's own son
As every newly ordained monk Rahula had two teachers one in knowledge and one in conduct
Sariputta was appointed as his teacher in knowledge and Moggallana as his teacher in conduct and spiritual practice
Once Sariputta said to his friend that compared with Moggallana's great supernormal powers he was like a small splinter of rock set against the mighty Himalayas
Moggallana however replied that compared with Sariputta's power of wisdom he was like a tiny grain of salt set against a big salt barrel
About the differing range of wisdom the Buddha once said that there are questions which only he could conceive and answer but not Sariputta there are other questions which only Sariputta could clarify but not Moggallana' and there are those which only Moggallana could solve but not the other disciples
Thus the two chief disciples were like a bridge between the supreme qualities of the Buddha and the capacities of the other disciples
When Devadatta voiced his claim to lead the Order the Buddha said that he would not entrust anybody with the leadership of the Sangha not even his two chief disciples let alone Devadatta
Between the highpoint of discipleship Sariputta and Moggallana on one end of the scale and at the other Devadatta the most depraved of the disciples there is a long and varied line of others with different degrees of accomplishments and virtues
It is characteristic that the only slander uttered against the chief disciples came from a follower of Devadatta
The monk Kokalika wishing to malign them told the Buddha that the two had evil intentions which in fact was the case with Devadatta
The Buddha however replied Don't say so Kokalika don't speak like that
Let your heart have glad confidence in Sariputta and Moggallana
They are capable monks
But Kokalika in spite of this emphatic admonition persisted in his slander
According to the old texts Devadatta and Kokalika were reborn in a state of utter suffering in the deepest hellish abode while Sariputta and Moggallana won the highest bliss Nibbana
In the canonical scriptures there are many reports about common activities of the two Chief Disciples who were the best assistants of their master in taking care of the Order
Both did much work for the advancement and benefit of the community of monks
Their activities directed to maintain inner concord stability and discipline within the Order deserve special mention
At the request of the Buddha they brought about the banishment of an extremely reckless and undisciplined group of monks known as group of six on whom the Buddha's admonition had no effect as reported in Majjhima Nikaya No
It was on account of them that a great part of the disciplinary rules of the Order had to be proclaimed
Finally they behaved in such a frenzied way that on the Buddha's bidding Sariputta and Moggallana at the head of the virtuous monks had to banish those six from the place of their mischief which was near Kitagiri
Thereafter most of them left the Order
Above all the two great disciples were able to achieve that those newly ordained monks who had fallen away having been instigated by Devadatta returned to the Buddha's fold and to the right conduct of monk life
When at that time Sariputta gave his exhortation to those misguided monks he showed his power of thoughtreading while Moggallana used his magic powers
Also the following incident led to a strengthening of concord in the Order Once when Sariputta was treated with hostility by a certain monk and was wrongly accused by him Moggallana and Ananda called together all the monks so that for their instruction and edification they could hear Sariputta's dignified answer to those accusations
Once when Moggallana was ill the Buddha went to see him and gladdened him by a discourse on the seven Factors of Enlightenment
Inspired by it Moggallana regained mastery over his body and recovered
The two chief disciples often lived together in one cell of the monastery and they held many dialogues in the presence and for the benefit of their fellow monks as shown in the Discourse on Stainlessness and frequently they gave discourses to the monks
Some of those given by Moggallana are for instance those in Majjhima Nikaya No Anguttara Nikaya X and Samyutta Nikaya
They also spent much of their time in giving seminarlike instructions to their disciples
Besides they had conversations with Anuruddha about the meaning of the four Foundations of Mindfulness and the difference between a Noble Learner and a person who has finished his learning
Both chief disciples were highly praised by the Awakened One for their beneficial work which however left them unmoved by pride as they were saints
Such a situation occurred when they were seated near the Buddha and were both immersed in deep concentration focused on the Recollection of the Body
Then the Buddha spoke one of the following two verses to each of them first to Sariputta and then to Moggallana
 Udana III 
It happened only once that the Buddha preferred Moggallana's attitude in a certain matter to that of Sariputta
The Master after having dismissed from his presence some noisy and unmannered monks later asked his two chief disciples what they had thought when he sent away those monks
Sariputta said he thought that the Master wanted to enjoy a blissful abiding in the present and that they the chief disciples were to do the same
But the Buddha reproached him saying that he should not have such thoughts again
Then the Buddha turned to Moggallana with the same question
Moggallana replied that he too had thought the Master wanted to enjoy the bliss of jhana but if so then it would have been Sariputta's task to take care of the community of monks and to look after them
The Buddha praised him and said that if both his chief disciples took care of the community it would be as good as if he himself looked after the monks
In the discourse about the disciples who excelled in special capacities and qualities the Buddha said that Moggallana was foremost among the Bhikkhus who possessed magical faculties
One day when Moggallana with some of his disciples walked up and down the Buddha told his monks that Moggallana possessed great supernormal powers and so did his pupils thus beings congregate according to their nature and disposition
There were of course also other prominent disciples highly skilled in one or the other of the various magical powers
But they mastered only some of them the monk Anuruddha and the nun Sakula for instance possessed the supernormal vision of the Divine Eye the monk Sobhita and the nun Bhadda Kapilani could recollect far into the past the monk Sagalo had masterly control of the fire element Cula Panthaka was skilled in astral travel and Pilinda excelled in communication with heavenly beings
Maha Moggallana however was perfect master of the magical faculties in a very comprehensive way
He mastered the various kinds of supernormal powers altogether surpassing in them the other disciples
He also excelled by far the nun Uppallavanna who was foremost among the nuns in regard to magical faculties
For appreciating the old reports on Moggallana's magical faculties one ought to know how such things can be possible at all
The world of socalled matter as perceived through our five senses  which today's physicists conceive as a manifestation of energy  is only a small section of that much wider reality which consists of other vibrational forms of energy
Inklings of it under terms like antimatter Psipower the Astral or Prana have penetrated into our range of experience
As we perceive only the narrow sector of our human world we are inclined to regard its limited laws as absolutes
But the universe as experienced by the wise is much larger and the laws in force in it have also an impact upon our own world
It is that impact of different laws which is called a miracle
But whenever a higher or wider world manifests itself the true miracle is that people can be so imprisoned within their narrow outlook that they just ignore all what is beyond their limited faculties in spite of the fact that the effects of those other forces and laws are undeniably present
But whosoever as the Buddha and Moggallana has highly developed his capacity to experience that wider reality with his higher sense faculties refined by cultivating the Four Ways of Power will realize a sheer infinite widening of experience in space and time
His horizon and experiential knowledge will grow universal and immeasurable transcending all boundaries and limitations
When Sariputta asked to which type of monk those assembled would give the highest praise Moggallana replied that from his point of view such a monk would be truly brilliant who can engage best in dialogues and discussions on the Teaching
Later the Buddha confirmed that Moggallana was indeed a very capable speaker on Dhamma
In fact talks on Dhamma gain in range and depth when they issue from an experience that transcends the realm of the senses
The more one had widened one's consciousness by such experiences the more one had to say
One who has personal experience of those many avenues of liberating wisdom will best be able to conduct talks on Dhamma and make them lively and stimulating
Examples of such discourses given by MahaMoggallana are M
and A S S 
We shall now turn to what the Buddhist canonical texts relate about Moggallana's supernormal faculties presenting the material grouped according to the types of faculties concerned
Once on an Uposatha day the Buddha sat silently throughout the whole night in front of the assembly of monks
When the morning dawned he only said This assembly is impure Thereupon Moggallana surveyed with his mind the entire assembly from monk to monk and saw that one monk was entirely corrupted
He went towards him and asked him to leave
When that monk did not move though asked thrice Moggallana took him by the arm led him out of the hall and bolted the door
Then he begged the Exalted One to recite the Rules of Monastic Discipline as the assembly was now pure again

Once the Master stayed together with a community of five hundred monks who all were saints
When Moggallana joined them he at once discerned in his heart that all these monks were cankerfreed Arahats
Then one of these saintly monks who on his part cognized Moggallana's supernormal perception rose from his seat and praised Moggallana in the following verses
 Samyutta Nikaya 
A third report says Once while the venerable Anuruddha was meditating in solitude he considered how by means of the four Foundations of Mindfulness the Noble Path that leads to the extinction of suffering can be perfected
Then Moggallana penetrating Anuruddha's mind by his own appeared before him through supernormal power and requested him to describe in detail this method of practice
One evening when Sariputta went to see Moggallana he found his features had such a strikingly serene expression that Sariputta felt moved to ask Moggallana whether he had dwelt in one of the peaceful abodes of mind
Moggallana replied that he had dwelt only in one of the less refined abodes but that he had been engaged in a talk on the Teaching
On being asked with whom he had such a talk he replied that it had been with the Exalted One
Sariputta remarked that the Master was now dwelling very far away in Savatthi while they themselves were here in Rajagaha
Did Moggallana by way of his supernormal power go to the Buddha or did the Buddha come to him
Moggallana replied that neither had been the case
It was rather the Divine Eye and the Divine Ear which had been purified and perfected in both of them that enabled them to have a Dhamma talk on the mental faculty of energy
Then Sariputta exclaimed that Moggallana being endowed with powers so great might be able to live through an entire aeon like a Buddha if he so wished

With the Divine Ear Moggallana could also hear the voices of nonhuman beings deities spirits etc and receive messages from them
So for instance a spirit had warned him against Devadatta who harbored evil intentions towards the Buddha and planned a plot against him

As mentioned above Moggallana with his Divine Eye was able to perceive the Buddha over a longdistance

Once the following happened
While Sariputta was sitting in quiet meditation a wanton demon hit him on the head
Moggallana saw it and asked his friend whether he had felt much pain
Sariputta smiled and said that he had just felt a slight touch of headache
Them Moggallana praised his strength of concentration but Sariputta said that Moggallana had been able to see that demon while he himself could not

Once Moggallana saw with the Divine Eye how King Pasenadi had been defeated in battle by the Licchavis but that afterwards he had gathered his troops again and vanquished the Licchavis
When Moggallana told this some monks accused him that he had falsely boasted about his supernormal faculties which is a disciplinary offense making a monk subject to expulsion from the Order
The Buddha however explained that Moggallana had told only what he saw and what had actually happened

Above all he often saw the operation of the law of Kamma and its fruits
Again and again he saw how human beings due to their evil actions that harmed fellowbeings were reborn among unhappy ghosts undergoing much suffering while others by their charitable deeds rose upwards to lower heavenly worlds that were close to the human plane
He often gave instances of this for exemplifying the law of kamma
The reports about this are too numerous for including them here
In two books of the Pali canon dealing with the ghost realm and the heavenly abodes nine respectively fiftyone of such reports are given
From this it can be readily understood why Moggallana was famous as one who knew the worlds beyond as well as the workings of Kamma
The reports are too numerous for inclusion but at least one of his recorded in the Samyutta Nikaya should be mentioned here
Once Moggallana lived on Vulture's Peak near Rajagaha together with the Bhikkhu Lakkhana one of the thousand Brahman ascetics who had been converted together with UruvelaKassapa
One morning when they had descended from the peak for going on almsround in the town Moggallana smiled when they reached a certain place on the road
When his companion asked him for the reason Moggallana said that now it was not the right time to explain it he would tell it in the presence of the Master
When they later met the Buddha Lakkhana repeated his question
Moggallana now said that at that spot he had seen many miserable ghosts flying through the air chased around and tormented by various kinds of afflictions and sufferings
The Buddha confirmed this as absolutely true and added that he himself spoke only reluctantly about such appearances because people with superficial minds would not believe it
Then the Buddha out of his universal knowledge explained what propensities and behavior had brought those ghosts seen by Moggallana to their present pitiable position
Just as a person may bend his stretched arm or stretch his bent arm so quickly was Moggallana able to depart bodily from the human world and reappear in a celestial realm
Repeatedly he made use of this capacity for instructing other beings and looking after the affairs of the Order
Thus he taught the Gods of the Thirtythree the Factors of streamentry or tested Sakka King of Gods whether he had understood the teaching about the extinction of craving
Once when the Buddha was preaching for three months in one of the heavenly worlds Moggallana appeared in that heaven and informed the Master of happenings in the Order asking him for instructions
He visited not only the gods of the Sensesphere but also those of the Brahma world
Thus he appeared before a Brahma deity who believed that there were no ascetics capable of entering his realm and through questioning and supernormal feats Moggallana shook the selfassurance of that deity
Or he appeared in front of a Brahma named Tissa  who formerly had been a monk and had died recently  and gave him instructions about streamentry and the realization of final deliverance
Moggallana also had mastery over what appears to be solid matter
Once there were monks staying at a monastery who were negligent and of distracted minds busying themselves too much with material trifles
Learning of this the Buddha asked Moggallana to shake their excessive faith in materiality by a supernormal feat and to stir them on to renewed and serious effort
In response to the Buddha's request Moggallana pushed the building with his big toe so that the entire monastery called The Terrace of Migara's Mother shook and trembled as if there was an earthquake
By this experience the monks were so deeply stirred that they became again receptive when the Buddha instructed them explaining the four Roads to Power from which Moggallana's great supernormal prowess derived
When Moggallana visited Sakka in his heavenly realm and saw that Sakka was living rather lightheartedly and was captivated by the heavenly sense pleasures of his world forgetful of the Teaching Moggallana performed a similar magic feat by shaking slightly the celestial palace called Banner of Victory in which Sakka took much pride
This had a shock effect on Sakka too and he now recalled the teaching on the extinction of craving which the Buddha had briefly taught him not long ago
It was the same teaching by which the Buddha had once helped Moggallana to attain sainthood
Once there was a famine in the area where the Buddha and his community of monks stayed and the monks could not obtain sufficient food
On that occasion Moggallana asked the Buddha whether he may overturn the ground so that the nourishing substance underneath would be accessible and could be eaten
But the Buddha told him not to do so as this would cause the destruction of a large number of living beings
Then Moggallana offered to open by his magical power a road to the Uttara Kuru country so that the monks could go there for alms
This too was rejected by the Buddha
But all survived the famine unharmed even without such supernormal devices
This was the only occasion when the Buddha disapproved of Moggallana's suggestions
Moggallana's supernormal power expressed itself also in his ability to bring things from long distances by his magical locomotion
Thus for instances he brought lotus stalks from the Himalayas when Sariputta was ill and needed them for medicine
He also fetched a shoot of the Bodhi tree for Anathapindika to be planted at the Jetavana Monastery
But when his fellowmonk Pindola asked him to prove the superiority of the Buddha's Sangha over the sectarians by magically bringing down a precious bowl that had been hung up in town so high that nobody could take it down Moggallana refused saying that Pindola himself possessed sufficient powers to do it
But when Pindola actually performed that feat the Buddha rebuked him a monk should not display supernormal powers for the sake of impressing the laity
About his recollection of his own former existences Moggallana spoke only once in the th Discourse of the Middle Length Discourses
With that text we shall deal in the following chapter
In the Jatakas the stories about the Buddha's former existences it is reported that the Buddhatobe and Moggallana had lived together quite often
In no less than thirtyone lives the Buddha and Moggallana had met and in thirty of them Moggallana and Sariputta had lived together
So strong was the bond that already in previous lives had connected these three
To be sure the thirtyone which have been recorded is a very small number compared with the infinity of lives through which every being in Samsara has passed
Yet some general conclusions concerning Moggallana can be drawn from them
It is of course not possible to reproduce here these thirtyone Jatakas with all their details and embellishments
Only some general points can be mentioned here which are important for understanding Moggallana's life and personality
The first thing we find from the Jatakas is his close relationship to the Bodhisatta
Moggallana and Sariputta were often his brothers his friends or his Ministers
Sometimes they were his disciples as ascetics or even his teachers
Sometimes Sariputta is the son and Moggallana the general of the royal Bodhisatta
When the Buddha was Sakka King of Gods they were the moon and the sungod respectively
The second point worth to be noticed is the relationship of Sariputta to Moggallana
When in the Jataka stories both are seen to traverse all the heights and depths of Samsara they sometimes play quite inferior parts in relation to the main figures of the respective stories
There appears a certain lawfulness in the stories in so far as in most cases the difference between them is larger to the degree in which their level of rebirth is lower and there is less difference when their rebirth is on a higher level
When reborn as animals they rarely were equals and mostly Sariputta was born in a higher species of animals
Thus they were snake and rat snake and jackal man and jackal
When born as human beings in worldly careers Sariputta was always in a higher position than Moggallana as a royal prince and royal minister royal minister and son of a slave charioteer of the royal Bodhisatta and charioteer of king Ananda
Once Moggallana was the moon god and Sariputta the wise ascetic Narada
But when both are ascetics or deities they are mostly of equal states
But once it happened that Sariputta was only the moon god and Moggallana the superior sun god once Sariputta was the king of the Nagas and Moggallana the king of their foes the Supannas
The only time when Moggallana appears in the Jatakas without Sariputta is a life in which he holds the office of Sakka King of Gods
In Majjh he admonishes one of his successors to that office
At that time as Sakka he also appeared on earth to a miser in order to urge on him the virtue of giving and thus to lead him to a better rebirth
But another time when Sariputta and Moggallana lived on earth they were stingy merchants who had buried much money
After death they were reborn close to their buried treasure but as a snake and a rat
There is also a story in which Moggallana was reborn as a jackal
Seeing a dead elephant he was so greedy for its flesh that he crept through an intestinal aperture right into the elephant's belly ate as much as he could but was then unable to get out again suffering mortal fear  an impressive symbol of the perils of sensual enjoyment
In the famous Jataka about the Law of the Kuru people Moggallana is a keeper of grain stores and Sariputta a merchant
Both were very careful in observing the law of notstealing
Half a year before the Final Passing Away of the Awakened One death separated the two friends for the last time
Sariputta died on the fullmoon day of the month Kattika it was at his birth place in his parental home far away from Moggallana
Just as their attainment of sainthood occurred at different places they were also separated in death though they had been so close to each other for a long time
Soon after the death of Sariputta Mara the embodiment of evil and the Lord of Death claimed Moggallana's mortal frame by entering his bowels
He could not make him possessed by entering his head because he had access only to the lowest Chakra
Moggallana however told him calmly to get out and away as he had well recognized him
Mara was very surprised that he had been found out so soon and in his delusion he thought that even the Buddha would not have recognized him so quickly
But Moggallana read his thoughts and ordered him again to get away
Mara now escaped through Moggallana's mouth and stood at the hut's door post
Moggallana told him that he knew him not only from today but was aware of his karmic past and his descent
In that way Moggallana manifested here three supernormal faculties the Divine Eye telepathy and recollection of past lives
It was only on this occasion reported in Majjhima Nikaya No that Moggallana spoke of his recollection of his own distant past
The following is the gist of what he told
The first Buddha appearing in our fortunate aeon with five Buddhas was Kakusanda
He lived when the lifespan of man was years and when the first darkening of the golden age became evident because of a king's lack of concern and the occurrence of the first theft
Because of that man's vital energy became reduced to half
At that time Moggallana was Mara chief of demons lord of the lower worlds and his name was Mara Dusi
He had a sister by name of Kali whose son was to become the Mara of our age
Hence Moggallana's own nephew was now standing in front of him at the door post
While being the Mara of that distant time Moggallana had attacked a chief disciple of the previous Buddha by taking possession of a boy and making him throw a potsherd at the holy disciple's head so that blood was flowing
When the Buddha Kakusandha saw this he said Verily Mara knew no moderation here  because even in satanic actions there might be moderation
Under the glance of the Perfect One the astral body of Mara Dusi dissolved on the spot and reappeared in the deepest hell
Just a moment ago he had been the overlord of all the hellish worlds and now he himself was one of hell's victims
A moment ago he had been the greatest torturer and now he himself was undergoing one of those terrible torments
Such is the rapid change in samsaric situations
For many thousands of years Moggallana had to suffer in hell as a punishment for his frivolity towards a saint
Ten thousand years he had to spend alone in a hellish pool having a human body and the head of a fish just as Pieter Breughel had painted such beings in his pictures of the hells
Whenever two lances of his torturers crossed in his heart he would know that a thousand years of his torment had passed
After this encounter with Mara which once more brought to his mind the terrors of Samsara from which he now was free forever Moggallana felt that the time of his last existence was running out
Being a saint he saw no reason for making use of his ability to extend by an act of will his life span up to the end of this aeon and he calmly allowed impermanence to take its lawful course
As many great sages of the East and many saints of the Buddha did he left behind a kind of autobiography in verses in which he summarized how he as a liberated one had passed through all the situations of his life unperturbed and unshaken
Events that completely overwhelmed others left him calm
His verses in the Theragatha could be summed up by saying that none of Samsara's upheavals appeared to him extraordinary nor could anything disturb the equipoise of his sainthood
The Dukkha of the world no longer touched him as he lived in a peace that transcended all the pain and restlessness of existence
The verses begin with events of his life in this world
Wherever others craved for possessions he as a forest hermit was content in an austere life of few wants
Once when a harlot tried to seduce him he rejected her just as the Buddha had rejected Mara's daughters
When Sariputta his best friend died he was not agitated by sorrow as was Ananda who had not yet become an arahant but remained unshaken in his serenity
Then the verses turn to events of a supernormal nature as his shaking a monastery building with his toe and his undisturbed meditation in a mountain cleft in the midst of thunder and lightning
Living with mind pacified in remote places he a true heir of the Buddha is venerated even by Brahma
The following verses are addressed to a superstitious Brahman of wrong views who on seeing Maha Kassapa going for alms had abused him
Moggallana warns him against the dangers of such conduct and urges him to respect the saints
He then praises Sariputta and it seems that the next verses are Sariputta's own praise of Moggallana
He now reviews his attainments and rejoices in the consummation of the goal of his monk life
The last verses are identical with those concluding his encounter with Mara recorded in Majjhima Nikaya No
and briefly related above
The Awakened One surrounded by many of his monks passed away peacefully during a meditative absorption which he entered with perfect mastery
Sariputta's death in his parental home likewise with fellow monks in attendance was similarly serene though unlike the Buddha he had been ill before his end
Ananda died at the age of before which he entered with meditative skill the fire element so that his body vanished in a blaze as he did not wish to burden anyone by his funeral
Considering the serene death of the Master and these two disciples one would have expected that in the case of MahaMoggallana too the final dissolution of the body at death would take place in external circumstance of a similarly peaceful nature
But in Moggallana's case it was very different though the gruesome nature of his death did not shake his firm and serene mind
He passed away a fortnight after his friend Sariputta namely on the newmoon day of the month Kattika in the autumn
The Great Decease of the Buddha took place in the fullmoon night of the month Vesakha that is half a year after the death of his two chief disciples
The Buddha was in his th year when he passed away while both Sariputta and MahaMoggallana died at
These were the circumstances of Moggallana's death
After the death of Nathaputta the leader of the ascetic Order of the Jains there arose among his followers bitter contentions about his teaching and consequently there was a loss of devoted adherents and of support
The Jains had also learned what Moggallana reported from his celestial travels that virtuous devotees of the Buddha were seen to have a heavenly rebirth while followers of other sects lacking moral conduct had fallen into miserable subhuman states of existence
This too contributed to the decline in the reputation of other sects including the Jains
Particularly the very lowest type of Jains in Magadha were so enraged about that loss of public esteem and support that they wanted to get rid of Moggallana
Without investigating the causes in themselves they projected blame externally and concentrated their envy and hate on MahaMoggallana
Hesitating to commit a murder themselves they conceived another plan
Even in those days there were professional criminals ready to do a killing for payment
There are always unscrupulous men willing to do anything for money
So some evilminded Jains hired such a gang and ordered them to kill Moggallana
At that time MahaMoggallana lived alone in a forest hut at Kalasila
After his encounter with Mara he knew that the end of his days was near
Having enjoyed the bliss of liberation he now felt the body to be just an obstruction and burden
Hence he had no desire to make use of his faculties and keep the body alive for the rest of the aeon
Yet when he saw the brigands approaching he just absented himself by using his supernormal powers
The gangsters arrived at an empty hut and though they searched everywhere could not find him
They left disappointed but returned on the following day
On six consecutive days Moggallana escaped from them in the same way
His motivation was not the protection of his own body but saving the brigands from the fearsome karmic consequences of such a murderous deed necessarily leading to rebirth in the hells
He wanted to spare them such a fate by giving them time to reconsider and abstain from their crime
But their greed for the promised money was so great that they persisted and returned even on the seventh day
Then their persistence was rewarded for on that seventh day Moggallana suddenly lost the magic control over his body
A heinous deed committed in days long past had not yet been expiated and the ripening of that old Kamma confronted him now just as others are suddenly confronted by a grave illness
Moggallana realized that he was now unable to escape
The brigands entered knocked him down smashed all his limbs and left him lying in his blood
Being keen on quickly getting their reward and also somewhat ill as ease about their dastardly deed the brigands left at once without a further look
But Moggallana's great physical and mental strength was such that his vital energies had not yet succumbed
He regained consciousness and was able to drag himself to the Buddha
There in the Master's presence at the holiest place of the world at the source of the deepest peace Moggallana breathed his last
The inner peace in which he dwelt since he attained to sainthood never left him
It did not leave him even in the last seven days of his life which had been so turbulent
But even the threat of doom was only external
This is the way of those who are finally healed and holy and are in control of the mind
Whatever Kamma of the past had been able to produce a result in his present life nevertheless it could affect only his body but no longer him because he no longer identified himself with anything existing only impermanently
This last episode of Moggallana's life however showed that the law of moral causality has even greater power than the supernormal feats of this master of magic
Only a Buddha can control the karmic consequences acting upon his body to such an extent that nothing might cause his premature death
Sariputta and MahaMoggallana were such wonderful disciples that the Buddha said the assembly of monks appeared empty to him after their death
It was marvelous he said that such an excellent pair of disciples existed
But it was marvelous too that in spite of their excellence there was no grief no lamentation on the part of the Master when the two had passed away
Therefore inspired by the greatness of the two chief disciples may a dedicated follower of the Dhamma strive to be his own island of refuge have the Dhamma as his island of refuge not looking for any other refuge having in it the powerful help of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness
Those who are thus filled with keen desire to train themselves in walking on the Noble Eightfold Path they will certainly pass beyond the realms of darkness which abound in Samsara
So the Master assures
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Kamma concerns everyone
We make it a great deal of it every day while we are awake
We decide whether or not to get up  kamma
Let's have a cup of tea breakfast  maybe some greed is involved so bad kamma
We sympathize with someone's sickness and give help  good kamma
We get flustered because the bus is late to take us to work  bad kamma
Once we're there perhaps we get impatient with someone or angry with them or threaten them  worse and worse kamma
But perhaps we are generous and kindly to someone there  excellent kamma
Work brings on dull mental states then we shake ourselves out of that listlessness and resentment and vigorously try to get back to mindfulness
In the crowded bus returning home someone stamps on one's foot one curses  bad kamma  but after quick reflection one realizes Ah no mindfulness and this is good kamma
At home at last one comforts the sick then plays with the children and tells them some Jataka stories  all good kamma
But then tired and dull one switches the radio on and not listening to it leaves it going as a sound to drown silence then one eats too much and feels lethargic  bad kamma
But perhaps instead one pays respect to the Buddhaimage does some chanting and then meditates  all kinds of good kamma
When the body is tired one goes to sleep holding some meditation subject in mind  good kamma
All these decisions choices and desires are kammas made in the mind
More kamma is made when one talks after having decided
Still more kamma is added if after this one acts as well
Good and bad kamma are distinguished by the roots of the actions
What is one's motivating force when one helps the sick
This is a case where there are various possibilities
Is it just because one wants rich Aunty's money when she dies or out of genuine compassion
Obviously in the latter case much better kamma is made
But there are examples where there is no doubt
One's toes are stamped on and one curses this can never be good kamma simply because it is rooted in hatred
Or one gobbles down too much food  just greedrooted kamma in this case
Again those dull or daydream periods at work not looking at things as they are at all this is rooted in delusion
When any of the mentally defiled states of mind has arisen when these three roots of evil are in control then bad kamma is sure to be made
Once it is made there is no way of erasing it or changing it and some day or other it will begin to fruit
The fruit of bad kamma is never happiness as we can read in these discourses
It always comes up as pain anguish frustration or the limitation of opportunities
Who wants them
Then make no more bad kamma
Everyone has laid in a stock already quite capable of giving rise to sufferings for lifetimes to come
There is no need to increase it
Everyone wants happiness
But it too arises conditionally
Now a great producer of happiness is the making of good kamma
What is good about it
It is rooted in nongreed or in nonhate or finally in nondelusion
The sure way to gain happiness then is to make good kamma as much as possible every day
It is only people who make a real effort to grow in Dhamma who have any chance to succeed in meditation on the path to final liberation
Whatever one's goal in this life  happiness here and now a good rebirth in the future or to end the whole birth and death process by attainment of Nibbana one cannot go wrong by making good kamma
And what about those who do not believe in kamma and its fruits
They still make it whether they believe or not
And they get the fruits of the kamma they make too
But the doing not the believing is the important thing
There were some strange people around in the Buddha's days believing some strange things  but that is no different from our own days when people still believe the most odd offbalance ideas
In this sutta we meet some people who believed that by imitating animals they would be saved
Maybe they're still with us too
Belief is often one thing action another
While beliefs sometimes influence actions for other people their beliefs are quite separate from what they do
But the Buddha says all intentional actions whether thoughts speech or bodily actions however expressed are kamma and lead the doer of them to experience a result sooner or later
In this sutta the Buddha classifies kamma into four groups
Dark kamma does not give a bright result nor does bright kamma lead to dark result
Kamma can be mixed where an action is done with a variety of motives some good some evil
And that kind of kamma also exists which gives up attachment to and interest in the other three and so leads beyond the range of kamma
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Koliyan country there is a town of the Koliyans called Haliddavasana
Then Punna a son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic and also Seniya a naked dog duty ascetic went to the Blessed One and Punna the ox duty ascetic paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side while Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic exchanged greetings with the Blessed One and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished he too sat down at one side curled up like a dog
When Punna the oxduty ascetic sat down he asked the Blessed One Venerable sir this naked dogduty ascetic Seniya does what is hard to do he eats his food when it is thrown on the ground
That dog duty has long been taken up and practiced by him
What will be his destination
What will be his future course
Enough Punna let that be
Do not ask me that
A second time A third time Punna the oxduty ascetic asked the Blessed One Venerable sir this naked dogduty ascetic Seniya does what is hard to do he eats his food when it is thrown on the ground
That dog duty has long been taken up and practiced by him
What will be his destination
What will be his future course
Well Punna since I certainly cannot persuade you when I say 'Enough Punna let that be
Do not ask me that' I shall therefore answer you
Here Punna someone develops the dog duty fully and unstintingly he develops the doghabit fully and unstintingly he develops the dog mind fully and unstintingly he develops dog behavior fully and unstintingly
Having done that on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the company of dogs
But if his view is such as this 'By this virtue or duty or asceticism or religious life I shall become a god or some god' that is wrong view in his case
Now there are two destinations for one with wrong view I say hell or the animal womb
So Punna if his dog duty is perfected it will lead him to the company of dogs if it is not it will lead him to hell
When this was said Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic wept and shed tears
Then the Blessed One told Punna son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic Punna I could not persuade you when I said 'Enough Punna let that be
Do not ask me that' Venerable sir I am not weeping that the Blessed One has spoken thus
Still this dog duty has long been taken up and practiced by me
Venerable sir there is this Punna a son of the Koliyans and an ox duty ascetic that ox duty has long been taken up and practiced by him
What will be his destination
What will be his future course
Enough Seniya let that be
Do not ask me that A second time A third time Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic asked the Blessed One Venerable sir there is this Punna a son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic that ox duty has long been taken up and practiced by him
What will be his destination
What will be his future course
Well Seniya since I certainly cannot persuade you when I say 'Enough Seniya let that be
Do not ask me that' I shall therefore answer you
Here Seniya someone develops the ox duty fully and unstintingly he develops the ox habit fully and unstintingly he develops the ox mind fully and unstintingly he develops the ox behavior fully and unstintingly
Having done that on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the company of oxen
But if his view is such as this 'By this virtue or duty or asceticism or religious like I shall become a god or some god' that is wrong view in his case
Now there are two destinations for one with wrong view I say hell or the animal womb
So Seniya if his ox duty is perfected it will lead him to the company of oxen if it is not it will lead him to hell
When this was said Punna a son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic wept and shed tears
Then the Blessed One told Seniya the naked dog duty ascetic Seniya I could not persuade you when I said 'Enough Seniya let that be
Do not ask me that' Venerable sir I am not weeping that the Blessed One has spoken thus
Still this ox duty has long been taken up and practiced by me
Venerable sir I have confidence in the Blessed One thus 'The Blessed One is capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I may abandon this ox duty and that this naked dogduty ascetic Seniya may abandon that dog duty' Then Punna listen and heed well what I shall say
Yes venerable sir he replied
The Blessed One said this
Punna there are four kinds of kamma proclaimed by me after realization myself with direct knowledge
What are the four
There is dark kamma with dark ripening there is bright kamma with bright ripening there is darkandbright kamma with darkandbright ripening and there is kamma that is not dark and not bright with neitherdarknorbright ripening that conduces to the exhaustion of kamma
What is dark kamma with dark ripening
Here someone produces a bodily process with affliction he produces a verbal process with affliction he produces a mental process with affliction
By so doing he reappears in a world with affliction
When that happens afflicting contacts touch him
Being touched by these he feels afflicting feelings entirely painful as in the case of beings in hell
Thus a being's reappearance is due to a being he reappears owing to the kammas he has performed
When he has reappeared contacts touch him
Thus I say are beings heirs of their kammas
This is called dark kamma with dark ripening
And what is bright kamma with bright ripening
Here someone produces a bodily process not with affliction he produces a verbal process not with affliction he produces a mental process not with affliction
By doing so he reappears in a world without affliction
When that happens unafflicting contacts touch him
Being touched by these he feels unafflicting feelings entirely pleasant as in the case of the Subhakinha the gods of Refulgent Glory
Thus a being's reappearance is due to a being he reappears owing to the kammas he has performed
When he has reappeared contacts touch him
Thus I say are beings heirs of their kammas
This is called bright kamma with bright ripening
What is darkandbright kamma with darkandbright ripening
Here someone produces a bodily process both with affliction and not with affliction verbal process mental process both with affliction and not with affliction
By doing so he reappears in a world both with and without affliction
When that happens both afflicting and unafflicting contacts touch him
Being touched by these he feels afflicting and unafflicting feelings with mingled pleasure and pain as in the case of human beings and some gods and some inhabitants of the states of deprivation
Thus a being's reappearance is due to a being he reappears owing to the kammas he has performed
When he has reappeared contacts touch him
Thus I say are beings heirs of their kammas
This is called darkandbright kamma with darkandbright ripening
What is neitherdarknorbright kamma with neitherdarknorbright ripening that leads to the exhaustion of kamma
As to these any volition in abandoning the kind of kamma that is dark with dark ripening any volition in abandoning the kind of kamma that is bright with bright ripening and any volition in abandoning the kind of kamma that is darkand bright with darkandbright ripening this is called neitherdarknorbright kamma with neitherdarknorbright ripening
These are the four kinds of kamma proclaimed by me after realization myself with direct knowledge
When this was said Punna a son of the Koliyans and an oxduty ascetic said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent Master Gotama
The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing the hidden showing the way to one who is lost holding up a lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight to see forms
I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
But Seniya the naked dogduty ascetic said Magnificent Master Gotama The Dhamma has been made clear for those with eyesight to see forms
I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
I would receive the going forth under Master Gotama and the full admission
Seniya one who belonged formerly to another sect and wants the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline lives on probation for four months
At the end of the four months bhikkhus who are satisfied in their minds give him the going forth into homelessness and also the full admission to the bhikkhus' state
A difference in persons has become known to me in this
Venerable sir if those who belonged formerly to another sect and want the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline live on probation for four months and at the end of four months bhikkhus who are satisfied in their minds give them the going forth into homelessness and the full admission to the bhikkhus' state I will live on probation for four years and at the end of the four years let bhikkhus who are satisfied in their minds give me the going forth into homelessness and the full admission to the bhikkhus' state
Seniya the naked dog duty ascetic received the going forth under the Blessed One and he received the full admission
And not long after his full admission dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and selfcontrolled the venerable Seniya by realization himself with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and abode in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
He had direct knowledge thus Birth is exhausted the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more of this to come
And the venerable Seniya became one of the arahants
You want long life health beauty power riches high birth wisdom
Or even some of these things
They do not appear by chance
It is not someone's luck that they are healthy or another's lack of it that he is stupid
Though it may not be clear to us now all such inequalities among human beings come about because of the kamma they have made individually
Each person reaps his own fruits
So if one is touched by short life sickliness ugliness insignificance poverty low birth or stupidity and one does not like these things no need to just accept that that is the way it is
The future need not be like that provided that one makes the right kind of kamma now
Knowing what kamma to make and what not to make is the mark of a wise man
It is also the mark of one who is no longer drifting aimlessly but has some direction in life and some control over the sort of events that will occur
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's Park
Then Subha the student Todeyya's son went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
When he had done so Subha the student said to the Blessed One
Master Gotama what is the reason what is the condition why inferiority and superiority are met with among human beings among mankind
For one meets with shortlived and longlived people sick and healthy people ugly and beautiful people insignificant and influential people poor and rich people lowborn and highborn people stupid and wise people
What is the reason what is the condition why superiority and inferiority are met with among human beings among mankind
Student beings are owners of kammas heirs of kammas they have kammas as their progenitor kammas as their kin kammas as their homingplace
It is kammas that differentiate beings according to inferiority and superiority
I do not understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama's utterance spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaning
It would be good if Master Gotama taught me the Dhamma so that I might understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama's utterance spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaning
Then listen student and heed well what I shall say
Even so Master Gotama Subha the student replied
The Blessed One said this
Here student some woman or man is a killer of living beings murderous bloodyhanded given to blows and violence merciless to living beings
Due to having performed and completed such kammas on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell
If on the dissolution of the body after death instead of his reappearing in a state of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell he comes to the human state he is shortlived wherever he is reborn
This is the way that leads to short life that is to say to be a killer of living beings murderous bloodyhanded given to blows and violence merciless to living beings
But here some woman or man having abandoned the killing of living beings abstains from killing living beings lays aside the rod and lays aside the knife is considerate and merciful and dwells compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
Due to having performed and completed such kammas on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination in the heavenly world
If on the dissolution of the body after death instead of his reappearing in a happy destination in the heavenly world he comes to the human state he is longlived wherever he is reborn
This is the way that leads to long life that is to say to have abandoned the killing of living beings to abstain from killing living beings to lay aside the rod and lay aside the knife to be considerate and merciful and to dwell compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
Here student some woman or man is one who harms beings with his hands or with clods or with sticks or with knives

This is the way that leads to sickness that is to say to be one who harms beings with one's hands or with clods or with sticks or with knives
But here some woman or man is not one who harms beings with his hands or with clods or with sticks or with knives
Due to having performed and completed such kammas on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination If instead he comes to the human state he is healthy wherever he is reborn
This is the way that leads to health that is to say not to be one who harms beings with his hands or with clods or with sticks or with knives
Here student some woman or man is angry much given to rage even when little is said he is furious angry illdisposed resentful he shows illtemper hate and surliness

This is the way that leads to ugliness that is to say to be furious angry illdisposed resentful and to show illtemper hate and surliness
But here some woman or man is not angry or much given to rage even when much is said he is not furious angry illdisposed resentful nor does he show illtemper hate or surliness
Due to having performed and completed such kammas on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination If instead he comes to the human state he is beautiful wherever he is reborn
This is the way that leads to beauty that is to say not to be angry or given to much rage even when much is said not to be furious angry illdisposed or resentful or to show illtemper hate or surliness
Here student some woman or man is envious he envies begrudges and harbors envy about others' gains honor veneration respect salutations and offerings
Due to having performed and completed such kammas on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a state of deprivation If instead he comes to the human state he is insignificant wherever he is reborn
This is the way that leads to insignificance that is to say to be envious to envy begrudge and harbor envy about others' gain honor veneration respect salutations and offerings
But here some woman or man is not envious he does not envy begrudge or harbor envy about others' gain honor veneration respect salutations and offerings
Due to having performed and completed such kammas on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination If instead he comes to the human state he is influential wherever he is reborn
This is the way that leads to influence that is to say not to be envious not to envy begrudge or harbor envy about others' gain honor veneration respect salutations and offerings
Here student some woman or man is not a giver of food drink cloth sandals garlands perfumes unguents bed roof and lighting to monks or brahmans
Due to having performed and completed such kamma on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a state of deprivation If instead he comes to the human state he is poor wherever he is reborn
This is the way that leads to poverty that is to say not to be a giver of food drink cloth sandals garlands perfumes unguents bed roof and lighting to monks and brahmans
But here some woman or man is a giver of food drink cloth sandals perfumes unguents bed roof and lighting to monks and brahmans
Due to having performed and completed such kamma on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination If instead he comes to the human state he is rich wherever he is reborn
This is the way that leads to riches that is to say to be a giver of food drink cloth sandals garlands perfumes unguents bed roof and lighting to monks and brahmans
Here student some woman or man is obdurate and haughty he does not pay homage to whom he should pay homage or rise up for whom he should rise up or give a seat to whom he should give a seat or make way for whom he should make way or worship him who should be worshipped or respect him who should be respected or revere him who should be revered or honor him who should be honored
Due to having performed and completed such kammas on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a state of deprivation If instead he comes to the human state he is lowborn wherever he is reborn
This is the way that leads to low birth that is to say to be obdurate and haughty not to pay homage to whom he should pay homage nor rise up for nor give a seat to nor make way for nor worship nor respect nor revere nor honor him who should be honored
But here some woman or man is not obdurate or haughty he pays homage to whom he should pay homage rises up for whom he should rise up gives a seat to whom he should give a seat makes way for whom he should make way worships him who should be worshipped respects him who should be respected reveres him who should be revered honors him who should be honored
Due to having performed and completed such kammas on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination If instead he comes to the human state he is highborn wherever he is reborn
This is the way that leads to high birth that is to say not to be obdurate or haughty to pay homage to whom he should pay homage to rise up for to give a seat to to make way for to worship respect revere honor him who should be honored
Here student some woman or man when visiting a monk or brahman does not ask 'What is wholesome venerable sir
What is unwholesome
What is blamable
What is blameless
What should be cultivated
What should not be cultivated
What by my doing it will be long for my harm and suffering
Or what by my doing it will be long for my welfare and happiness' Due to having performed and completed such kammas on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a state of deprivation If instead he comes to the human state he will be stupid wherever he is reborn
This is the way that leads to stupidity that is to say when visiting a monk or brahman not to ask 'What is wholesome Or what by my doing it will be long for my welfare and happiness'
But here some woman or man when visiting a monk or brahman asks 'What is wholesome venerable sir Or what by my doing it will be long for my welfare and happiness' Due to having performed and completed such kammas on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination If instead he comes to the human state he is wise wherever he is reborn
This is the way that leads to wisdom that is to say when visiting a monk or brahman to ask 'What is wholesome venerable sir Or what by my doing it will be long for my welfare and happiness'
So student the way that leads to short life makes people shortlived the way that leads to long life makes people longlived the way that leads to sickness makes people sick the way that leads to health makes people healthy the way that leads to ugliness makes people ugly the way that leads to beauty makes people beautiful the way that leads to insignificance makes people insignificant the way that leads to influence makes people influential the way that leads to poverty makes people poor the way that leads to riches makes people rich the way that leads to low birth makes people lowborn the way that leads to high birth makes people highborn the way that leads to stupidity makes people stupid the way that leads to wisdom makes people wise
Beings are owners of kammas student heirs of kammas they have kammas as their progenitor kammas as their kin kammas as their homingplace
It is kammas that differentiate beings according to inferiority and superiority
When this was said Subha the student Todeyya's son said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent Master Gotama
The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing the hidden showing the way to one who is lost holding up a lamp in the darkness for those with eyes to see forms
I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
From today let Master Gotama accept me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
This celebrated sutta shows some of the complexities of kamma and its results
Beginning with a strange view expressed by a confused wanderer and a confused answer given by a bhikkhu the Buddha then gives his Great Exposition of Kamma which is based upon four types of people
The Buddha then shows how wrong views can arise from only partial understanding of truth
One can see the stages of this a mystic sees in vision an evildoer suffering in hell this confirms what he had heard about moral causality so he says evildoers always go to hell and dogma hardens and becomes rigid when he says Only this is true anything else is wrong The stages of this process are repeated for each of the four persons after which the Buddha proceeds to analyze these views grounded in partial experience and points out which portions are true and which are dogmatic superstructure which is unjustified
Finally the Buddha explains his Great Exposition of Kamma in which he shows that notions of invariability like the evildoer goes to hell are much too simple
The minds of people are complex and they make many different kinds of kamma even in one lifetime some of which may influence the last moment when kamma is made before death which in turn is the basis for the next life
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Feeding Place
Now on that occasion the venerable Samiddhi was living in a forest hut
Then the wanderer Potaliputta walking and wandering for exercise came to the venerable Samiddhi and exchanged greetings with him and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
When he had done so he said to the venerable Samiddhi
I heard and learned this friend Samiddhi from the monk Gotama's lips 'Bodily kammas are vain verbal kammas are vain only mental kammas are true' But there is actually that attainment having entered upon which nothing is felt at all
Not so friend Potaliputta do not say thus do not misrepresent the Blessed One it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One the Blessed One would not say so 'Bodily kammas are vain verbal kammas are vain only mental kammas are true' And there is actually that attainment having entered upon which nothing is felt at all
How long is it since you went forth friend Samiddhi
Not long friend three years
There now what shall we say to the elder bhikkhus when the young bhikkhu fancies the Master is to be defended thus
After doing intentional kamma friend Samiddhi by way of body speech or mind what does one feel
After doing an intentional kamma friend Potaliputta by way of body speech or mind one feels suffering
Then neither agreeing nor disagreeing with the words of the venerable Samiddhi the wanderer Potaliputta got up from his seat and went away
Soon after the wanderer Potaliputta had gone the venerable Samiddhi went to the venerable Ananda and exchanged greetings with him and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
When he had done so he told the venerable Ananda all his conversation with the wanderer Potaliputta
When this was said the venerable Ananda told him Friend Samiddhi this conversation should be told to the Blessed One
Come let us go to the Blessed One and having done so let us tell him about this
As he answers so we shall bear it in mind
Even so friend the venerable Samiddhi replied
Then they went together to the Blessed One and after paying homage to him they sat down at one side
When they had done so the venerable Ananda told the Blessed One all the venerable Samiddhi's conversation with the wanderer Potaliputta
When this was said the Blessed One told the venerable Ananda
I do not even know the wanderer by sight Ananda
How could there have been such a conversation
The wanderer Potaliputta's question ought to have been answered after analyzing it but this misguided man Samiddhi answered it without qualification
When this was said the venerable Udayin said to the Blessed One 'But venerable sir supposing when the venerable Samiddhi spoke he was referring to this namely 'Whatever is felt is suffering' Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda See Ananda how this misguided man Udayin interferes
I knew Ananda that this misguided man Udayin would unreasonably interfere now
To begin with it was the three kinds of feeling that were asked about by the wanderer Potaliputta
If when this misguided man Samiddhi was asked he had answered the wanderer Potaliputta thus 'After doing an intentional kamma by way of body speech and mind to be felt as pleasure he feels pleasure after doing an intentional kamma by way of body speech and mind to be felt as pain he feels pain after doing an intentional kamma by way of body speech and mind to be felt as neitherpainnorpleasure he feels neitherpainnorpleasure'  by answering him thus Ananda the misguided man Samiddhi would have given the wanderer Potaliputta the right answer
Besides Ananda who are the foolish thoughtless wanderers of other sects that they will understand the Tathagata's Great Exposition of Kamma
if you Ananda would listen to the Tathagata expounding the Great Exposition of Kamma
This is the time Blessed One this is the time Sublime One for the Blessed One to expound the Great Exposition of Kamma
Having heard it from the Blessed One the bhikkhus will bear it in mind
Then listen Ananda and heed well what I shall say
Even so venerable sir the venerable Ananda replied
The Blessed One said this
Ananda there are four kinds of persons existing in the world
What four
Here some person kills living beings takes what is not given misconducts himself in sexual desires speaks falsehood speaks maliciously speaks harshly gossips is covetous is illwilled and has wrong view
On the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell
But here some person kills living beings and has wrong view
On the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination in the heavenly world
Here some person abstains from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sexual desires from false speech from malicious speech from harsh speech from gossip he is not covetous is not illwilled and has right view
On the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination in the heavenly world
But here some person abstains from killing living beings and has right view
On the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell
Here Ananda in consequence of ardor endeavor devotion diligence and right attention some monk or brahman attains such concentration of mind that when his mind is concentrated he sees with the heavenly eyesight which is purified and surpasses the human that some person kills living beings here takes what is not given misconducts himself in sexual desires speaks falsehood speaks maliciously speaks harshly gossips is covetous is illwilled has wrong view
He sees that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell
He says 'It seems that there are evil kammas and that there is the result of misconduct for I have seen that a person killed living beings here had wrong view
I have seen that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell' He says 'It seems that one who kills living beings has wrong view will always on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell
Those who know thus know rightly those who know otherwise are mistaken in their knowledge' So he obstinately misapprehends what he himself has known seen and felt insisting on that alone he says 'Only this is true anything else is wrong'
But here in consequence of ardor endeavor devotion diligence and right attention some monk or brahman attains such concentration of mind that when his mind is concentrated he sees with the heavenly eyesight which is purified and surpasses the human that some person kills living beings here has wrong view
He sees that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world
He says 'It seems there are no evil kammas there is no result of misconduct
For I have seen that a person killed living beings here had wrong view
I have seen that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world' He says 'It seems that one who kills living beings has wrong view will always on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world
Those who know thus know rightly those who know otherwise are mistaken in their knowledge' So he obstinately misapprehends what he himself has known seen and felt insisting on that alone he says 'Only this is true anything else is wrong'
Here in consequence of ardor endeavor devotion diligence and right attention some monk or brahman attains such concentration of mind that when his mind is concentrated he sees with the heavenly eyesight which is purified and surpasses the human that some person abstains from killing living beings here has right view
He sees that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world
He says 'It seems that there are good kammas there is result of good conduct
For I have seen that a person abstained from killing living beings here had right view
I saw that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world' He says 'It seems that one who abstains from killing living beings has right view will always on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world
Those who know thus know rightly those who know otherwise are mistaken in their knowledge' So he obstinately misapprehends what he himself has known seen and felt insisting on that alone he says 'Only this is true anything else is wrong'
But here in consequence of ardor endeavor devotion diligence and right attention some monk or brahman attains such concentration of mind that when his mind is concentrated he sees with the heavenly eyesight which is purified and surpasses the human that some person abstains from killing living beings here has right view
He sees that on the dissolution of the body after death he has reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell
He says 'It seems that there are no good kammas there is no result of good conduct
For I have seen that a person abstained from killing here had right view
I saw that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell' He says 'It seems that one who abstains from killing living beings has right view will always on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell
Those who know thus know rightly those who know otherwise are mistaken in their knowledge' So he obstinately misapprehends what he himself has known seen and felt insisting on that alone he says 'Only this is true anything else is wrong'
Now Ananda when a monk or brahman says thus 'It seems that there are evil kammas there is the result of misconduct' I concede that to him
When he says thus 'For I have seen that some person killed living beings had wrong view
I saw that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell' I concede that to him
When he says thus 'It seems that one who kills living beings has wrong view will always on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell' I do not concede that to him
When he says thus 'Those who know thus know rightly those who know otherwise are mistaken in their knowledge' I do not concede that to him
When he obstinately misapprehends what he himself has known seen and felt and insisting on that alone he says 'Only this is true anything else is wrong' I do not concede that to him
Why is that
The Tathagata's knowledge of the Great Exposition of Kamma is different
Now when a monk or brahman says thus 'It seems that there are no evil kammas there is no result of misconduct' I do not concede that to him
When he says thus 'For I have seen that a person killed living beings had wrong view
I saw that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world' I concede that to him
When he says thus 'It seems that one who kills living beings has wrong view will always on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination in the heavenly world' I do not concede that to him
When he says thus 'Those who know thus know rightly those who know otherwise are mistaken in their knowledge' I do not concede that to him
When he obstinately misapprehends what he himself has known seen and felt and insisting on that alone he says 'Only this is true anything else is wrong' I do not concede that to him
Why is that
The Tathagata's knowledge of the Great Exposition of Kamma is different
Now when a monk or brahman says thus 'It seems that there are good kammas there is a result of good conduct' I concede that to him
When he says thus 'For I have seen that a person abstained from killing living beings here had right view
I saw that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world' I concede that to him

Why is that

Now when a monk or brahman says thus 'It seems that there are no good kammas there is no result of good conduct' I do not concede that to him
When he says thus For I have seen that a person abstained from killing living beings here had right view
I saw that on the dissolution of the body after death he had reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell I concede that to him
When he says thus 'One who abstains from killing living beings has right view will always on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell' I do not concede that to him
When he says thus 'Those who know thus know rightly those who know otherwise are mistaken in their knowledge' I do not concede that to him
When he obstinately misapprehends what he himself has known seen and felt and insisting on that alone he says 'Only this is true anything else is wrong' I do not concede that to him
Why is that
The Tathagata's knowledge of the Great Exposition of Kamma is different
Now Ananda there is the person who has killed living beings here has had wrong view
And on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell
But the evil kamma producing his suffering was done by him earlier or the evil kamma producing his suffering was done by him later or wrong view was undertaken and completed by him at the time of his death
And that was why on the dissolution of the body after death he reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell
But since he has killed living beings here has had wrong view he will feel the result of that here and now or in his next rebirth or in some subsequent existence
Now there is the person who has killed living beings here has had wrong view
And on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination in the heavenly world
But the good kamma producing his happiness was done by him earlier or the good kamma producing his happiness was done by him later or right view was undertaken and completed by him at the time of his death
And that was why on the dissolution of the body after death he reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world
But since he has killed living beings here has had wrong view he will feel the result of that here and now or in his next rebirth or in some subsequent existence
Now there is the person who has abstained from killing living beings here has had right view
And on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in a happy destination in the heavenly world
But the good kamma producing his happiness was done by him earlier or the good kamma producing his happiness was done by him later or right view was undertaken and completed by him at the time of his death
And that was why on the dissolution of the body after death he reappeared in a happy destination in the heavenly world
But since he has abstained from killing living beings here has had right view he will feel the result of that here and now or in his next rebirth or in some subsequent existence
Now there is the person who has abstained from killing living beings here has had right view
And on the dissolution of the body after death he reappears in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell
But the evil kamma producing his suffering was done by him earlier or the evil kamma producing his suffering was done by him later or wrong view was undertaken and completed by him at the time of his death
And that was why on the dissolution of the body after death he reappeared in the states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition in hell
But since he has abstained from killing living beings here has had right view he will feel the result of that here and now or in his next rebirth or in some subsequent existence
So Ananda there is kamma that is incapable and appears incapable there is kamma that is incapable and appears capable there is kamma that is capable and appears capable there is kamma that is capable and appears incapable
This is what the Blessed One said
The venerable Ananda was satisfied and he rejoiced in the Blessed One's words
ii
Wholesome kamma is followed by unwholesome deathproximate kamma which makes the former incapable of good result immediately
iiiA strong wholesome kamma will mature even before much accumulated unwholesome kamma
ivUnwholesome kamma is followed by wholesome deathproximate kamma which will mature first and is capable of good results
The brahmans of this discourse intelligent people asked a question about the causality of rebirth  why is one reborn in the states of deprivation while others make it to the heaven worlds
The Buddha then analyzes what kind of kamma will take one to a low rebirth
You see any of your own actions here
Then you know what to do about it for if one makes any of these ten courses of unwholesome kamma strong in oneself a result can be expected at least on the dissolution of the body after death if not in this life
The ten courses of wholesome kamma follow
They should be strengthened in oneself repeated frequently so that they become habitual
If one recognizes any of one's own actions among them then just guard against the conceit I am good
The last part of the sutta deals with the aspirations which one may have for rebirth at the time of death
Of course one's previously made kamma must be such that it will support such aspirations
A miser might aspire to riches but his kamma will give him poverty
If a person has kept the Uposatha and generally all the precepts and been generous and truthful as well this is the passport to heavenly birth
Beyond this it is necessary also to be proficient in jhana and one will gain rebirth among the Brahmas according to proficiency in this
For the next five Brahmaplanes the state of nonreturning is required while for the last four one must have gained the formless attainments
Finally one may aspire to no rebirth to arahantship but of course the aspiration alone is not sufficient  practice and sufficient insightwisdom are needed
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and eventually he arrived at a Kosalan brahman village called Sala
The brahman householders of Sala heard A monk called Gotama it seems a son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan has been wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and has come to Sala
Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect 'That Blessed One is such since he is arahant and Fully Enlightened perfect in true knowledge and conduct sublime knower of worlds incomparable teacher of men to be tamed teacher of gods and humans enlightened blessed
He describes this world with its gods its Maras and its Divinities this generation with its monks and brahmans with its kings and its people which he has himself realized through direct knowledge
He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with meaning and phrasing he affirms a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure' Now it is good to see such arahants
The brahman householders of Sala went to the Blessed One and some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side some exchanged greetings with him and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished sat down at one side some raised hands palms together in salutation to the Blessed One and sat down at one side some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One's presence and sat down at one side some kept silence and sat down at one side
When they were seated they said to the Blessed One Master Gotama what is the reason what is the condition why some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell and what is the reason what is the condition why some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world
Householders it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of unrighteous conduct that beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell
It is by reason of conduct in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of righteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world
We do not understand the detailed meaning of this utterance of Master Gotama's spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaning
It would be good if Master Gotama taught us the Dhamma so that we might understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama's utterance spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaning
Then householders listen and heed well what I shall say
Yes venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this
Householders there are three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
There are four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
There are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
And how are there three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
Here someone is a killer of living beings he is murderous bloodyhanded given to blows and violence and merciless to all living beings
He is a taker of what is not given he takes as a thief another's chattels and property in the village or in the forest
He is given over to misconduct in sexual desires he has intercourse with such as are protected by the mother father brother sister relatives as have a husband as entail a penalty and also with those that are garlanded in token of betrothal
That is how there are three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
And how are there four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
Here someone speaks falsehood when summoned to a court or to a meeting or to his relatives' presence or to his guild or to the royal family's presence and questioned as a witness thus 'So good man tell what you know' then not knowing he says 'I know' or knowing he says 'I do not know' not seeing he says 'I see' or seeing he says 'I do not see' in full awareness he speaks falsehood for his own ends or for another's ends or for some trifling worldly end
He speaks maliciously he is a repeater elsewhere of what is heard here for the purpose of causing division from these or he is a repeater to these of what is heard elsewhere for the purpose of causing division from those and he is thus a divider of the united a creator of divisions who enjoys discord rejoices in discord delights in discord he is a speaker of words that create discord
He speaks harshly he utters such words as are rough hard hurtful to others censorious of others bordering on anger and unconducive to concentration
He is a gossip as one who tells that which is unseasonable that which is not fact that which is not good that which is not the Dhamma that which is not the Discipline and he speaks out of season speech not worth recording which is unreasoned indefinite and unconnected with good
That is how there are four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
And how are there three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
Here someone is covetous he is a coveter of another's chattels and property thus 'Oh that what is another's were mine' Or he has a mind of illwill with the intention of a mind affected by hate thus 'May these beings be slain and slaughtered may they be cut off perish or be annihilated' Or he has wrong view distorted vision thus 'There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed no fruit and ripening of good and bad kammas no this world no other world no mother no father no spontaneously beings no good and virtuous monks and brahmans that have themselves realized by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world' That is how there are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma unrighteous conduct
So householders it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of unrighteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in states of deprivation in an unhappy destination in perdition even in hell
Householders there are three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
There are four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
There are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
And how are there three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
Here someone abandoning the killing of living beings becomes one who abstains from killing living beings with rod and weapon laid aside gentle and kindly he abides compassionate to all living beings
Abandoning the taking of what is not given he becomes one who abstains from taking what is not given he does not take as a thief another's chattels and property in the village or in the forest
Abandoning misconduct in sexual desires he becomes one who abstains from misconduct in sexual desires he does not have intercourse with such women as are protected by mother father brother sister relatives as have a husband as entail a penalty and also those that are garlanded in token of betrothal
That is how there are three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
And how are there four of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
Here someone abandoning false speech becomes one who abstains from false speech when summoned to a court or to a meeting or to his relatives' presence or to his guild or to the royal family's presence and questioned as a witness thus 'So good man tell what you know' not knowing he says 'I do not know' or knowing he says 'I know' not seeing he says 'I do not see' or seeing he says 'I see' he does not in full awareness speak falsehood for his own ends or for another's ends or for some trifling worldly end
Abandoning malicious speech he becomes one who abstains from malicious speech as one who is neither a repeater elsewhere of what is heard here for the purpose of causing division from these nor a repeater to these of what is heard elsewhere for the purpose of causing division from those who is thus a reuniter of the divided a promoter of friendships enjoying concord rejoicing in concord delighting in concord he becomes a speaker of words that promote concord
Abandoning harsh speech he becomes one who abstains from harsh speech he becomes a speaker of such words as are innocent pleasing to the ear and lovable as go to the heart are civil desired of many and dear to many
Abandoning gossip he becomes one who abstains from gossip as one who tells that which is seasonable that which is factual that which is good that which is the Dhamma that which is the Discipline he speaks in season speech worth recording which is reasoned definite and connected with good
That is how there are four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
And how are there three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
Here someone is not covetous he is not a coveter of another's chattels and property thus 'Oh that what is another's were mine' He has no mind of illwill with the intention of a mind unaffected by hate thus 'May these beings be free from enmity affliction and anxiety may they live happily' He has right view undistorted vision thus 'There is what is given and what is offered and what is sacrificed and there is fruit and ripening of good and bad kammas and there is this world and the other world and mother and father and spontaneously beings and good and virtuous monks and brahmans that have themselves realized by direct knowledge and declared this world and the other world' That is how there are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
So householders it is by reason of conduct in accordance with the Dhamma by reason of righteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution of the body after death reappear in a happy destination even in the heavenly world
If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish 'Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the warriornobles of great property' it is possible that on the dissolution of the body after death he may do so
Why is that
Because he observes conduct that is in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
If a householder who observes conduct is accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish 'Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the brahmans of great property' it is possible
If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma' I might reappear in the company of householders of great property' it is possible
If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish 'Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the gods of the Four Kings' it is possible that on the dissolution of the body after death he may do so
Why is that
Because he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish 'Oh that on the dissolution of the body after death I might reappear in the company of the gods of the base consisting of neitherperceptionnornonperception' it is possible that on the dissolution of the body after death he may do so
Why is that
Because he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct should wish 'Oh that by realization myself with direct knowledge I may here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of the heart and the deliverance by wisdom that are taintfree with exhaustion of taints' it is possible that by realization himself with direct knowledge he may here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of the heart and the deliverance by wisdom that are taintfree with exhaustion of taints
Why is that
Because he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma righteous conduct
When this was said the brahman householders of Sala said to the Blessed One
Magnificent Master Gotama
Magnificent Master Gotama
The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing the hidden showing the way to one who was lost holding up a lamp in the darkness for those with eyes to see forms
We go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
From today let Master Gotama accept us as followers who have gone to him for refuge for life
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
On the whole people have changed little in years
In those days when the Buddha was alive there were people living the householder's life with family responsibilities work to be done and money to be earned to continue life there were also those who were able to give up their home and families to leave all that is valued in the world for the sake of the cultivation of the heart in wisdom and compassion
They were supported by generous householders and in turn they gave their benefactors guidance in the difficulties and troubles of life guidance which was based on the peace and insight which they had developed
These two classes of people still exist among Buddhists the lay people with their many works and burdens and the bhikkhus and nuns whose only work is the Dhamma its study and practice
And they still support each other for their mutual benefit
This book is about the life and experiences of a bhikkhu who reached arahantship in the Buddha's days
It is also about how such a life is still possible now for those who wish to make the effort
But then someone might say What's the use of reading about monks and their lives A Buddhist might reply In the Buddha's days as now in Buddhist countries it was the custom for ordinary people to go and see bhikkhus those who were cultivating their minds and hearts to get some refreshment for their minds
Just as when the body is thirsty one drinks so when one's heart is thirsty it should have the chance to drink the Dhamma's nectar So let us as it were go to visit that monk called Talaputa and hear what he has to say
Before we go to 'see' him though we should know something about him as a person and why he decided to leave his home and become 'homeless' as a Buddhist monk
He lived at the time of the Buddha and had been trained from his youth as an actor
Steadily his fame grew until he became the manager of a traveling theatrical troupe of five hundred women a general figure which means a large company
This troupe of actors dancers and singers became very famous people coming from far and wide to attend performances
We do not know how Talaputa first heard of the Buddha but his acquaintance with the Dhamma was no doubt a gradual one
As he came to know more and more of the Dhamma his aspirations to be ordained as a bhikkhu became stronger
In his lay life he must have been a gifted poet and this ability he used to compose the verses of inspiration with which his stanzas begin
Let us see first why he wanted to become a bhikkhu
People become monks and nuns for various reasons some good some bad
Once the King of Kurus mentioned that people left their homes shaved their heads and put on the yellow robe because of old age sickness loss of relatives and loss of wealth
These are not the best reasons
But there are worse laziness and desire for an easy life to get one's belly filled for instance
There were such bhikkhus in the Buddha's days and now they can certainly be found in every Buddhist country
Talaputa tells why he became a bhikkhu first naming some of the bad reasons for doing so
He did not become a monk because he was a failure in ordinary life actually he was a great success
He was not driven into monkhood by some king's act of banishment nor because of some wrong he had done and fled to escape the consequences
It was not that he had a weak mind and so just did not know what to do
Not like this
He agreed with the wisdom in his own mind and gave up worldly life
He saw how difficult it is to practice all the Dhamma while leading a household life
The difficulties and problems which the Dhamma solves  the difficulties and troubles all called dukkha  have their source in the mind
If he was to disentangle the tangle of mind time was necessary  for mindful awareness of all actions for meditation to calm the mind for developing the penetrating wisdommind
The conditions necessary for this work were found in the way the Buddhist Order was organized
So he decided to become a bhikkhu
One time when the Buddha was staying in the Bamboo Grove at Rajagaha Talaputa visited the Buddha and after paying his respects to him asked this question
The Buddha did not answer when this question was asked even thrice
The fourth time he agreed to answer it In the case of those beings who were not freed of lust aversion and delusion before but were bound with the bonds of lust aversion and delusion in such cases a player who on the stage or in the arena brings about lustful averse or deluded states of mind so that such beings become still more lustful averse and deluded while he himself is heedless and slothful making others heedless and slothful  such a person on the dissolution of the body after death is reborn in the Hell of Laughter
And if his view is as you say 'that whatever player on the stage by counterfeiting the truth is reborn in the company of the Laughing Gods' then I declare that he is of wrong view
I declare that there will be reappearance in one of two destinations in hell or birth as an animal
When he heard these words Talaputa wept not as he explained to the Buddha because of the answer that he had received but because he had been led astray and deceived by his teachers
Then he praised the Buddha and asked for the Going Forth and the Admission to the Sangha as a bhikkhu
After living resolute and secluded he in no long time  a phrase which often means several years attained the Path and Fruit of the arahant
This is the bare account of how he became a bhikkhu and later achieved arahantship
It should be filled out with his aspirations which he made from time to time while he was still a layman
These are the first sixteen verses among his fiftyfive and show the mind of a dedicated layman aspiring to win insightwisdom
At this point all his verses will be given followed by some sketches and comments
Best of all for meditation caves are cool in hot weather warm in cold weather and silent
Those in the mountains high among rocks are less accessible places where it is easier to be alone apart from bats and other local inhabitants
Mountain caves are not for the sociable
You live in them alone
They are quiet and remote the sort of place that most people would dislike to live in just because of the silence
Because of craving people in general want to be mated
They need mate friend companion relatives  and other people generally
Without them they are uneasy
In Pali language one's 'second' is an idiom for one's wife but 'being with a second' is also craving
Being without a second is not to have craving
Mountain caves are the sort of place where progress towards being unmated with desire can be made
When you live alone in a solitary place with few wishes insight into impermanence becomes easier
How to see impermanence when the mind is distracted by a thousand and one people possessions and works
Only when all this entanglement has been given up is there a chance to penetrate to the truth of impermanence
These are good for meditation too
They have to be far from peoples' noisy houses and machines
A place to reach only on foot and where animals more or less wild also live happily
A bhikkhu intent on meditation likes such places which are not the favorite dwelling of ordinary people
The meditative bhikkhu is happy to spend nights and all seasons there wearing his robes made up out of pieces of cloth sewn together  worthless to a thief and colored an earthy yellowbrown  unattractive to the layman
Surrounded by cool green trees what will he make mine
The surroundings encourage a cool heart with no craving and a minimum of possessions  just his bowl and robes and a few other things
And it is likely that given this setting he will be able to slay greed aversion and delusion the Three Roots of Evil
These three cause all the trouble in this world
So when they have been known and seen through and through they disappear forever
Why should he not abide in bliss then
Talaputa wishes to live in such places free from fear Most people even though they live in the middle of cities where the numbers of people and the seeming regularity of buildings and services bolster their confidence against death are from being free of fear
To live in the woods alone where there are no amusements or distractions nothing to take the mind away from the basic fear  of seeing things as they really are empty of self  would be intolerable except to the ardent seeker of Dhamma
Where does he find it
In his own body unstable nest of dying and disease The brood raised in this nest is fear and oppression by aging and death
But this body seeing clear breaks up such fear
One fears what one does not understand
This means 'understand' on the deepest levels of insight
So either fear or understanding of Dhamma are born of this body according to the way one looks at it
In places with many people we may feel 'safe' enough but behind that facade of security lurks fear
It is a good test to go to wild and remote places and see how one can live there
With confidence and happiness
Or with longing to get back to familiar people places and habits
One should echo Talaputa and say When will it be
Creepers in tropical forests are sometimes of immense size
A huge trunk all twisted leans out from the ground towards some overhead support from which its branches twisting here and there drape whole trees with a greenery other than their own
The creeper's branches loop from one tree to the next out further
Craving is like this too
It has the huge and ancient trunk of ignorance all twisted round and round with wrong distorted views of reality
The cravingcreeper is supported by the forest of senseimpressions
It blankets and strangles true understanding of this world of this mind and body
And its branches spread out further and further
Even a poor man who cannot 'satisfy' his desires can grow a vast cravingcreeper in his heart
Often those in the position to 'satisfy' the unsatisfiable succeed only in making their cravingcreepers grow to monstrous proportions
Well this creeper's fruits are not wanted by people generally
Who wants fear or bodily pain or mental distress
Yet everyone grows the cravingcreeper
The answer to those poisonous fruits is not the doctor or the psychiatrist both of whom can only patch things up but the sharpened sword of wisdom made
With this sword the cravingcreeper can be cut down  during insight meditation
Nothing else will cut it down though
Lions are unafraid of other animals
So the Buddha is compared to a lion quite fearless and his bold truthfulness to the lion's roar  which still causes consternation among those who grasp at beliefs and views
The meditator seated upright and alert in some lonely place is like the lion too
Only such a person can draw that wisdom quick enough to cut off the defilements
The Buddha is shown routing with tranquil meditation and penetrative vision the hosts of Mara at the time of his Enlightenment
The Maras that he routs though pictured as hideous demons are really the more familiar Death Defilements of the mind and the processes of making Kamma
It is said that a deva called Mara also objects to beings going beyond his realm and tries to hinder this
Most people will consider the first three hindrance enough
Some get ordination as bhikkhus and with little or no training go off by themselves and live in the wilds
This is foolishness and often points out a person who cannot bear correction or the sort of person who says quickly I know when one tries to show him better ways of doing things
There is no hope that this person can grow in Dhamma
Probably he has and will increase only one thing wrong views
To have the company of other people sincerely practicing the Dhamma is a great support and help not only those who have reached one's level of development but those who far surpass it
It is very necessary to live with such Teachers who are worthy of one's respect and devoted service
They alone can give sure advice about difficulties in meditation
When one has no access to them then the Suttas the Visuddhimagga and the Commentaries must be one's source of advice
But they are called 'dead' Dhamma while the words of one's Teacher are 'living' Dhamma
The further people have gone along the Path of Dhamma the more respectful they are to the Triple Gem to their Teachers to their companions and friends and to the Dhamma as practiced
One way of judging where one has got to on the Path is to examine whether one esteems Dhamma or not
That sort of mind will never see things as they really are
For that it is necessary to subdue eye ear nose tongue body and mind  the six faculties
This is a warning to those who think that they can have their worldly pleasures AND the fruits of Dhamma too
This is just selfdeception another name for delusion
Lead and enjoy a worldly life or devote mind speech and body to the Dhamma  a finer enjoyment
In between there are various shades of Dhammapractice hindered by more or less worldly attachment
One should be honest with oneself about where one's at
Those who are Thus  who see things as they really are  they are the arahants the best Teachers most worthy of respect
But some people will object that was all right in the Buddha's days when there were arahants
Now there are none
This is not true
Wherever Dhamma is practiced intensively it may be expected that the final attainment will be reached
Both Thailand and Burma have great Teachers whose final attainment can be inferred from their Dhamma
In NE
Thailand for instance Venerable Acariya Mun and some of his disciples are believed to have won arahantship in modern times
When you stand on the top of Mount Vulture Peak and look down four or five hundred feet to the plain below enclosed by a ring of hills you see only scrubby jungle and rocks the site of the ancient city of Giribbaja
Perhaps it looked much the same in Talaputa's days with some ruins still remaining from the old city
Like other places we have described it was quiet and secluded
Few human beings went there though there are in any jungle plenty of nonhuman beings especially the insects and snakes mentioned by Talaputa
Living in such a place means having patience with and lovingkindness for all these other beings
Impatient and hottempered people cannot live comfortably under rocks or at the foot of trees because they soon come into conflict with other creatures
The coolhearted person is content with a simple resting place and does not worry about other beings
In fact when lovingkindness is strong in anyone he has no fear of tigers and snakes and they do not fear him and so cause him no trouble
Other discomforts face the jungledweller weariness hunger thirst and wind  and heavy rain too if the shelter is not waterproof
All these are a test of his equanimity so that when food drink and weather are not to his liking he does not get depressed shorttempered or retreat to more comfortable surroundings
All these things should be expected by a person bent on his own good
Few will find the Goal of Nibbana easy to reach for most the path is sure to be rough and winding so lovingkindness patience and equanimity are needed
The Four Noble Truths are easy to learn
but very hard to see in oneself as the Truth
Why is this
Generally we want to turn away from dukkha not face it
We turn away to distractions amusements anything to avoid looking at the unsatisfactory state of this mind and body and the world it experiences
Why do we not want to look at dukkha
Painful uncomfortable
Craving turns us away to look at something else and that very craving is the source of dukkha
What is craving then
Craving for sights sounds smells tastes touches thoughts  the six kinds of craving for experience of this world
But we crave not only the pleasures of the senses but also to exist
I want to go on on on I want to be here and now
I want to exist in some future life
This is craving for existence for being
But sometimes being becomes too painful because of disease misfortune or the acts of other people
Then one wishes for nonexistence the craving to end it all for death and nothingness
Due to the wrong view produced from this craving people commit suicide in many ways longing not to exist
Their longing a perverted craving for existence guarantees that they will exist though they will have to experience pain and suffering caused by dying
All this craving  for sensepleasures existence and nonexistence causes dukkha
This is what is meant by saying Craving is the condition for the arising of dukkha
When there is no more craving since the roots of evil  greed aversion and delusion  have been eradicated by the cultivation of moral conduct meditation and wisdom then there is the experience called Nibbana
While craving is present Nibbana cannot be known but when there is the seeing of this Third Noble Truth it is realized in one's heart which at that time is calm peaceful and blissful a peace to which there is no end for there is no source of disturbance in oneself which could end it
This is different from the peace gained through meditation which can be upset later by the arising of defilements
Meditation is the most important aspect of the Noble Eightfold Path though it cannot succeed unless the practicer's moral conduct is pure
It is based on this and leads to the highest development of wisdom the seeing of the Four Noble Truths in oneself combined with the emotionally purified states of renunciation lovingkindness and compassion
The Noble Eightfold Path which is the fourth Noble Truth is composed of factors which form groups of moral conduct meditation and wisdom

These Truths are very hard to see Now we may understand why this is so
Intellectually one may know them and occasionally remember them but see here means 'having penetrated with insight' so that one lives with them all the time so that one's life becomes the Noble Path itself
This world is on fire
With what does it blaze
Greed aversion and delusion are the fires that burn all beings here
These fires are kindled because of what
Pleasant feeling painful feeling and neutral feeling
How do they arise
Feeling arises dependent on contact that is contacts through forms sounds smells tastes touches and mental factors
These six types of contact arise when three factors are present the appropriate sense organ its objects and consciousness by way of that sense
We do not see all this as a raging blaze blinded as we are by ignorance and led on by craving
So we have to experience a lot of dukkha because we do not have either meditation's calm or wisdom We have to get burnt again and again until we are tired of burning tired of dukkha
Then we are ready to do something about ourselves
The first is taken as painful
It insults 'me' my big ego
The second is welcome because it inflates this ego and makes me feel good
So we fall down between this pair of opposites into rejection and acceptance out of which grow aversion and greed
Worldly ordinary people eagerly grasp gain and honor praise and happiness rejecting loss dishonor blame and suffering
These are the eight worldly dhammas inseparable from existence
The Noble Ones have equanimity towards them all
When you live in the country these things are all around you most of them of no particular value
Certainly you do not think These pieces of wood blades of grass and strands of creeper are me they are myself What one values as oneself is this body the various kinds of feelings mental events and the six sense consciousnesses
There is a great difference in one's attitude to that tree dying and this body dying
This shows our ignorance in that we identify a self an owner where there is none
The Rains in India and Southeast Asia last for months
A time of mud soaking forests and leeches
Not the time for a pleasant day's picnic in the woods
People stay in their villages and towns they cultivate rice but do not go much into the forest
So the Rains are when forests are most silent with few visitors
It is then that forest bhikkhus such as those who live with their Teachers in Northeast Thailand make great efforts to practice the Dhamma
Their Teachers as in the Buddhatime are those who See
The Undying the Deathless this is Nibbana
These words do not mean an eternal state but point out that which is not born and so does not die
In most people's minds birth and death are continuous as states of mind arise and pass away
The arahant when he experiences Nibbana goes beyond this birth and death
For the attainment of the Undying those mountain caves which we have talked about are ideal
And the peacock's cry close by might seem to say Come on
Don't be lazy
People then believed in an immense and nearly bottomless pit in the ocean perhaps a myth originating in sailors' tales about a whirlpool
Talaputa thinks that when he has developed in Dhamma he will be able to cross these stretches of water without even wetting his feet
If when he composed this verse he thought success in such powers necessarily marked an arahant then he was wrong
But he may have known that while some arahants have such powers fully developed others possessed less of them or none at all
Here he aspires to become an arahant who does possess them
They are not 'miraculous' but just a natural development of jhana and so can be obtained by both ordinary men and Noble Ones both Buddhists and believers in God or Gods
What is more powerful than this
No machines existed in those days so the elephant illustrated power and strength
This is what is needed to 'shun the marks of loveliness'  not to be captivated by them not even to get attached to them
Only when they are shunned by restraint of the senses is it possible to break up desire for sensual happiness Just the thing that we are all trapped in
But unless it is laid aside there is no chance of 'striving in concentrated states' that is the jhanas
And without them the mind is weak too weak to produce insight
The might strength and power needed to break up desire for sensual happiness comes from the jhanas
You might say Those arahants must have been gloomy old sticks seeing only ugliness But that is getting it all wrong
Not seeing beauty helps to calm the mind it is a phase of the training
Mountains valleys forest  all are beautiful to an arahant but he does not try to seize on them as 'me' and 'mine'
He sees beauty when he wants to and with no attachment
A person is really poor through not making wholesome kamma never doing good
Material poverty may last only for one life but the results of mentalemotional poverty can affect many lives
One is 'poor' when the debts of many evil kammas pile up while the 'creditors' which oppress such a person are the different sorts of resultant dukkha that he or she may perhaps begin to suffer even the very life when those actions have been done
The 'treasure' that a person finds can be explained in various ways the Three Jewels  the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha in which it is proper to feel confident or the seven Noble Treasures faith moral conduct shame fear of evil learning generosity and wisdom or the treasure of Noble attainment as streamwinner and so on which is meant here
The wealth of this world decays but 'attainment of the Teaching of the Greatest Sage' is undying riches
This concludes the stanzas which Talaputa composed while still aspiring for the Going Forth
After these aspirations there are three other verses on Going Forth followed by others upon The Practices of a Bhikkhu
This section leads on to the main part of the verses which concern The Mind in various ways
A few verses on Delight in the Forest are followed by one which indicates some success in the training
These verses as they are dealt with in the following pages are not in the order of the text but the number of the verse commented on has been indicated
This is one among many verses in which Talaputa holds a conversation with his mind
You could say But I thought that Buddhists taught that there was no self or soul among the changing patterns of mind and body
But here is Talaputa with two selves what he calls himself and his mind
How do you account for this The answer is that his 'conversation' is much like what goes on in our own heads when desires are countered by objections to them
Though there are just streams of mind and body processes yet there appear to be two people inside this skull one saying 'yes' and the other 'no'
In this particular verse the perversity of the untamed mind is wellillustrated
While a layman he aspired to be a bhikkhu but once he had left the household life and gone forth to homelessness his mind slackened and was no longer enthusiastic
A case of it's greener on the other side of the fence  just craving
So he thinks Come on
Stir yourself mind
Don't idle
The same theme
Here is his mind not pleased with bhikkhulife though that same mindstream has brought it about
Mind is full of craving
While it has dear ones friends relatives playing and loving sensual pleasures of the world the mind's craving has something to get involved with get entangled with
The craving mind is not satisfied with this of course but its appetite is dulled
It is when Talaputa has given up all this that the mind starts to get agitated
No distractions
No escapes from dukkha
When worldly escaperoutes are closed off then the craving mind is not pleased
Again Talaputa exhorts his mind  It's not like it used to be craving mind
You used to be in control but now I am a bhikkhu
The ruination brought on by craving is not for me What ruination
The ruins of disease decay and death again and again
People are ruined by the defilements in their own hearts they ruin their own futures and ruin other beings about them
The world is ruined by greed aversion and delusion the Roots of Evil
A good bhikkhu is not wrapped up by ruination instead having goneforth in the Buddha's Sasana he makes efforts to get beyond craving
How does he do this
By leading the kind of life where craving finds little to grab hold of
Take the bhikkhu's almsround as an example
For most people food is very much an object of craving so they try to get what they like and have as much as they like
A bhikkhu goes out with his black iron alms bowl and stands silently before people's houses to receive whatever they are pleased to offer him
He accepts food as it comes the poor with the good the tasteless with the tasty the disliked with the liked  which helps to cut down on craving
His head is shaven too so the craving and conceit connected with hair does not trouble him
And he wears no ornaments at all just brownishyellow robes so from a worldly point of view he may be unsightly but that is just another way of cutting down on craving
In this way he devotes himself to the Buddha's words
In the last verse the bhikkhu's exterior appearance was emphasized while this verse deals with his interior attitude while going on his almsround
What is that
As he passes shops he does not gaze in the windows or at the faces of people who pass by or who give him almsfood he is not attracted by sounds of music nor does he show disgust at any bad smells that may come his way his steps are steady neither showing off pretended calm by slow walking nor exhibiting many desires by rushing along
He just goes steadily having a mind to sensual pleasures unattached  content with what he gets
A mind like this he compares to the full moon shining clear at night  radiant with loving kindness and free from the clouds of defilements
Finally in the refrain that runs through many of these verses he reproaches his mind You used to tell me to act like this  meaning that now he does so the mind plays a different tune
The austere practices which the Buddha allowed bhikkhus to undertake also aim at lessening desires
Talaputa mentions some of them in this verse a forestdweller an almsman a graveyard dweller a ragrobewearer one never lying down is a bhikkhu who practices in three postures  walking standing and sitting  but does not lie down
He sleeps sitting up and in this way manages to restrict his hours of sleep  more time for meditation
These methods and others are practiced privately with only the practicer and his Teacher knowing about them
They are never advertised by wise bhikkhus who are not concerned either to get the admiration of others or much support from them
Such austerities as these were an important part of the practice leading to attainment of the arahants of old as today of Venerable Acariya Mun and his enlightened disciples in NE
Thailand who urge the young bhikkhus and novices training under them to use them
Visiting lay people who come to practice meditation are also expected to practice them such as eating only once a day another austere practice

Practices like these should never be ends in themselves but aids for controlling the errant mind
We have already come across Talaputa's dispute with his mind and now he is upbraiding it  You're not a wild elephant going where you like
You're my mind
Now it's time to get ready so don't grieve
Be joyful What should one get ready for
One should be prepared for the great battle against Mara and therefore put on the armor of the Dhamma
Talaputa longs for Nibbana while seeing that all of this conditioned world is impermanent unstable liable to arising and passing away and therefore unsatisfactory or dukkha
But this mind is still attached to the unstable and the frail At some other time it made a simile to urge him to give it all up A man with much labor plants fruit trees cultivates them for some years until they reach the fruitbearing stage and then when they are loaded with fruit about to ripen cuts them down
Rational
No but no madder than a person who with great effort has renounced family money pleasure and so on only to give way to some impulse which destroys the fruits of his renunciation
There is no safety from the whims of the mind until arahantship is reached though a certain security is won by the streamwinner
Still his mind goes back to habits made of old  while he was a layman in spite of the fact that when he still lived the household life his mind urged him to practice Dhamma to have few wishes to abandon the disparagement of others to still all dukkha  these things being praised by wise men
This is opposite to the world's way which is to have many desires and to cultivate them so that they increase
Generally too disparaging other people is popular in the world  it gives an outlet for our aversion while at the same time boosting our conceit
No wonder it's popular
And people are not concerned with stilling dukkha
When it gets too much to bear then they turn to other things or even take some treatment to reduce it to manageable proportions
They would be lost without dukkha because their conception of 'selfhood' is dukkha and where would they be without 'themselves'
Again grumbling at his mind  the mad mind the mind mad with defilements
There is no sharp dividing line between 'sane' and 'mad' so people are either more sane and less mad or more mad and less sane according to the development of wisdom or the strength of defilements
A madman who plays about senselessly is just the extreme development of ourselves and all of us like Talaputa before he attained arahantship are under the power of craving and defilement
The play that the mad mind shows us is this world several times distorted through the lenses of permanence happiness selfhood and beauty
This is how the mad mind causes us injury again and again through successive births high and low
His final question to his mind means What have I not done for you  and in this Talaputa is the same as everyone else  who follow the urges wishes and reasons of the mind whether or not it is defiled wishing to enjoy the play at all costs
Here the Buddha is quoted likening the mind to a monkey
Anyone who has watched monkeys will know why
They exhibit unrestrained lust and quarrelsome anger while they can do nothing for more than a few minutes before they get tired of it
They swing from one support to the next running and jumping and playing
Know anyone with a mind like that
For such a monkey mind a mantaming trainer is needed or else a great physician who can tell how it is to be cured
These are both epithets of the Buddha who is also He who speaks the best and Best among mankind And what does he say
It is very difficult to check the mind when one is not rid of lust Only the person who is prepared to loosen his hold on the pleasures of this world will succeed in taming the monkeymind
In other words you can't have it both ways
It's extremely foolish for us to check because we as blind foolish common men long have lain down in sensual desires which are varied sweet delightful Someone might object You can call yourself 'blind foolish and a common man' if you like but why should you insult me
I've got two eyes in my head came tops in school and I've got a family going back to the Conquest In reply a Buddhist might say You're blind because you don't understand about dukkha and its arising
You're foolish since you don't restrain yourself and so make bad kamma rooted in greed aversion and delusion which will bring you pain and suffering  more dukkha
And you're called a common man or an ordinary man like myself as you have not yet experienced the true nobility of streamwinning oncereturning nonreturning or arahantship
But people who make a certain amount of effort with generosity moral conduct and meditation are at least called 'beautiful ordinary men' while I fear that you may fall into the class of 'foolish ordinary men' What any kind of ordinary men get is birth again  that is what they desire but their desire is for what brings dukkha even to the extent that having been led on by sensual desires to make much evil kamma they bring themselves to perish in hell Here someone is sure to say Oh come you Buddhists don't believe in hell do you The answer is easy We don't believe in it
We understand it What does that mean Hells are not articles of faith but they can be understood by what the mind is capable of
Take two people one is gentle compassionate and generally unselfish always thinking how to help others  a happy smiling person the other is twisted up by hate bursting with anger and resentment ready to kill and torture
Now the first man is called 'a heavenly man' and dying with that slightly superhuman mind will gain a superhuman birth while the second even now is 'a hellish man' and when he dies with his evil kamma in mind with that subhuman mind he gains a very subhuman birth
Easy to explain But desire for any kind of birth human superhuman or subhuman is desire for dukkha because even the heavens so delightful are impermanent
And so are the hells
The name for pleasures in this verse may not please some people How disgusting to compare sensepleasure to vomit When one knows no better sensepleasures are fine but they are the cords of sensedesire which tie us down
Having loosened these cords one's mind discovers pleasure far superior to them heavenly or divine pleasures in the heavens of sensuality and of subtle form
Even these pleasures are nothing to one who has enjoyed the Paramasukha  the Sublime Happiness of Nibbana free of all attachments
Though one has not got this far yet if some of the pleasures of meditation have been experienced then other grosser worldly pleasure will seem to be like vomit
Who will want to eat what has been rejected
So who having tasted the pleasures of meditation and renunciation will go back to the bondage of the senses
Like the last this is a blunt verse
It tells the worldly person what he does not want to hear while anyone really devoted to Dhamma appreciates such straightforwardness
Desires delighting in life and enjoying any happiness are all the same as Mara
What is the power of Mara here
This means the strength of the defilements in one's heart whereby one is driven on to desire delight and enjoy
And though a person like this speaks of 'my mind' as though he is the owner truly as Talaputa points out he is only a servant of mind swept along by the mind's desires
So one knows where one's at
In the Dhamma there is no deceitfulness
Openness and Dhamma and of the people who practice it
Here is Talaputa's mind instructing him what he ought to do instructions which he thought up before his Goingforth and then found difficult to carry out afterwards
We have met the Four Noble Truths before and here three of them are presented as an exhortation
The cravedfor groups are the five constituents identified as a person body feeling perception mental formations and consciousness
Since they are impermanent and craved for or grasped at as me and mine they are the basis for the experience of dukkha
That from which arises ill is craving which should be abandoned with the help of insight wisdom
And making an end of ill here and now is another way of saying Nibbana
Some more instructions about dukkha
Impermanent things whether 'me' 'mine' or 'not me' 'not mine' are all unstable and so unreliable
But isn't that what everyone does
So how much security do we have
I'm secure says Mr
Moneybags
I'm secure says Mrs
Largeland
So who's secure
I'm secure
Don't want your wealth but I'm sure going to live long Even this body conventionally called 'mine' is changing all the time and can perish any moment
One has to see the danger in impermanent compounded things see them as dukkha so that one's grasping can be unwrapped from them
And they are void too
What does 'void' mean
This is not a metaphysical abstraction but a name for what is void of self
What is that
Body is void of self and so are feelings perceptions mental formations and consciousness
They have to be seen with insight as void empty ownerless
And dukkha has to be seen in the same way as really poisonous
As it is now we are attached to a whole heap of dukkha and think that it is productive of happiness
That illusion has got to go  to see dukkha as it really is
None of this can be done while the mind still wanders about in other words there is no insight unless a person has developed calm strongly first
When a person has succeeded with jhana the fully developed Right Concentration then insight becomes easy
Without strong calm the 'insight' that people have is either illusory or else so weak as to vanish quickly
When we feel cornered by dukkha we can go for a holiday 'a change of air'
While this may make us feel good it has not really solved the problem
Some who can afford it with time and money are always traveling round  It'll be better there they say
And they say it again when they get there about some other place
These days travel is easy even in the heavens so escape appears to be easy too but the end of dukkha is never found just by going elsewhere
Everywhere is the same which means all this world and any other
When they die many people hope to go to a heavenly world and they will do so if they die with a somewhat purified and elated mind
They hope that 'heaven' is perfection where dukkha cannot touch them
But asks a Buddhist how can a conditioned dependently arisen state of existence be perfectly free of dukkha
Don't you know that 'conditioned' means also 'impermanent' and that in turn signifies 'dukkha'
Your heavenly life may last long and be very pleasant indeed but it cannot possibly be eternal and so is not secure either
The Sensual Realm of hells animals ghosts human beings and heavens  all are unstable and oppressed  by dukkha
Then the Realm of Subtle Form  the Brahmaworld Heavens gained through the practice of jhana even that is all unstable and oppressed Further refined are the Heavens of the Formless Realms to which one may attain by practice of the formless concentrations  even such longenduring states are unstable and oppressed These are the three Becomings
One may become this or that here or there due to one's kamma but one does not get beyond dukkha
So where are you going mind to find happiness
There is only one answer
Round and round treads the ox hauling water or grinding grain just like the untrained mind which takes the impermanent for the permanent that which is dukkha to be happiness the notself as self and the unattractive as beautiful
These are the four perversions in which the unenlightened mind operates
No wonder there's dukkha
However if one makes up one's mind to serve the Buddha by practicing as much Dhamma as one can then the fetters and bonds including these four can at least be loosened in this life and possibly cut off completely
Why be a slave to this oxlike perverted mind
What else is it like
Mind is formless without any kind of body or material just a collection of processes
And it is a fartraveler how far and how quickly it goes in an instant
Supersonic jets are just creaking old oxcarts by comparison with the mind's speed
And mind is a wanderer alone since its various processes arise in a conditioned way upon the basis of what has gone before
And when one sees all the troubles that come of mind constantly drawn to the senses how troubled it is how lacking in peace and security then one is prepared to aspire to Nibbana
Notice the contrast between past lives when the mind's wishes and desires had been followed and Talaputa's present life in which he is not content to drift with the stream of sensedesires but makes an effort to cut across the current
The sensual mind does not like this and becomes discontented and angry
Talaputa accuses his mind of ingratitude since he had so long pandered to its desires and thus was forced to live in the dukkha caused by them
Minds are many and various and what appeals to one kind of mind experienced at one point in time may not be at all attractive to another type of mind occurring later
The only way out of such inner conflict is the cultivation of satipañña mindfulnessandwisdom and the best results are attained when one is guided in this by an experienced Teacher
The more confidence one has in that Teacher the greater will be the efforts that one makes to practice his teachings
This is the best way beyond the oceans of rebirths
In these next two verses Talaputa speaks of the mind as the source of whatever rebirths one has to experience
We make kamma all the time every day by every decision choice or volition
All those kammas have appropriate results inherent in them  and how many of them will it be possible to experience in this life
Combined with our craving for continuity or existence onwards from the moment of death these kammas can provide the bases for innumerable future lives
We may then become priests or aristocrats and from among the latter we may achieve rulership as king or president
Lives as merchants or workers are also brought on by an individual's past kamma
Someone is going to say at this point Oh you are proposing that rigid old caste structure just as the Bhagavad Gita does
I thought Buddhists were free of such ideas Reply In the Buddha's days brahmans were already imposing their fourcaste structure on society as part of a 'divine plan'
The Buddha did not agree with their ideas and made his Sangha of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis open to anyone of any caste
But he knew the truth that past kamma does determine where one is born
It shapes one's inclinations one's aptitudes and weaknesses
But that one should be completely controlled by past kamma as some believed is a fatalistic view making impossible new present kamma
Everyone has the chance to make good kamma now whatever their birth in this life They may then gain gods' estate in a heavenly rebirth at the end of this life provided that they have made the right kamma for it that is to say been generous truthful and never angry
Titans or demons are the resultant birth for them who love power and ruthlessness
Power is fine when only one or two have it so the powerful think but when reborn in this state everyone has it
Imagine the constant mauling brawling and wars much more a feature of demonic life than this human world
And the hells are more overpopulated than this world  by plenty of beings who loved to kill and torture other beings while they were human
As to animal rebirth if one wants it then the formula is to take delight only in what delights animals  to make oneself an animal in fact enjoying only food drink and sex
Or instead of an animalman one can be a ghostly man by avaricious hoarding never giving anything to anyone and then have to suffer life as a ghost miserable and beset by unsatisfied cravings
All this is brought about by the mind
When one knows about this the wise person does something about the wild mind
All the Dhamma taught by the Buddha is for the purpose of taming this mind and Talaputa has mentioned a few useful points in these verses
'Concentrations' is not really a good translation of jhana for which there is no English equivalent
The formula of the four jhanas had been repeated hundreds of times in the Suttas while one or more jhanas are also often mentioned
They are the perfection of concentration and the person who possesses ability with the jhanas has a wonderful inner refuge to which he can withdraw for refreshment and peace
When jhana has been obtained and mastered there is no need to try to meditate for one has reached the state of perfected meditation
The four jhanas for a Buddhist are not ends in themselves but are the basis for the successful practice of mindfulness leading to insight
The faculties and powers are different strengths of the same five factors faith effort mindfulness concentration wisdom
If one is to grow in the Dhamma in a balanced way then these factors must be balanced faith with wisdom effort with concentration while the fulcrum is mindfulness
The result of imbalance of these faculties can be seen in the holy men of many religions
The seven wisdomfactors lead to Enlightenment when fully developed
They are more commonly called 'enlightenmentfactors' and have been explained at length elsewhere
It is only through the development of deep meditation that they can be matured
The Buddha's Teaching is only made one's own experience through the Three Knowledges of remembrance of past lives with all details and particulars of the workings of kamma seeing for oneself how evil kamma will bear painful fruits but good kammas fruit in happiness and finally the knowledge of the exhaustion of the taints  the exhaustion of sensual desires being and ignorance
Once it is 'touched' or personally verified in this way that person is an arahant one who has finished the job with nothing to strive for but having seen nonself lives compassionately for others' benefit
Some more Dhamma to grow into
The Dhamma does not grow into oneself  it cannot be changed to suit oneself oneself the practicer must grow into the Dhamma that is adapt to the Dhamma become the Dhamma
That means changing oneself which is more trouble and less fun than changing the Dhamma
The Eightfold Path is what one should try to grow into since it leads directly to Nibbana
Under the heading of Wisdom in this Path comes Right View and Right Intention
The first understanding of the four Noble Truths is more intellectual to begin with deepening with experience to include one's understanding of all sides of life while the second purifies one's emotions so that relinquishment lovingkindness and compassion dwell in one's heart instead of lust illwill and cruelty
Whoever lives his life by these two factors of wisdom is a wise person indeed
Moral Conduct covers the next three factors Right Speech Right Action and Right Livelihood
The first is abstaining from falsehood malicious speech harsh speech and idle chatter
Do you pass this test
The second means refraining from killing living beings taking what is not given and wrong conduct in sexual pleasures
Are you pure in these three respects
The third factor covers all sorts of livelihood which involves hurtfulness or breaking any of the Five Precepts
How is your livelihood
The last section of the Path is concerned with developing the mind Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration which the Buddha defined in this way the first is twofold effort to rid the mind of evil and to cultivate it in goodness
There are various methods taught for this
The second is mindfulness to be cultivated towards the body feelings mental states and mental factors
If no effort is made no mindfulness will arise
With no mindfulness the last factor of Right Concentration cannot be perfected
This is the four jhanas which have been mentioned earlier
This is a short summary of the Eightfold Path
Only those who are with it in mind speech and body will make the utter destruction of all ill
The wrong path then the one not to follow is the Ignoble Eightfold Path
How much of your understanding and thought is Wrong View and Wrong Intention
Or how many of your actions of body and speech are Wrong Speech Wrong Action or Wrong Livelihood
And perhaps you are developing Wrong Effort Wrong Mindfulness and Wrong Concentration
Using wisdom one's way is not along this path but by making effort and becoming restrained from evil one may be established in the Path as a streamwinner for instance
This will occur when the causal process of both comingintobeing and passingoutofbeing have been penetrated with insight at which time one no longer believes in Dhamma but having verified it personally one is actually the Buddha's heir
It is then not the Buddha's Dhamma that one knows but one's own Dhamma seen for oneself
Firm firm in my aim says Talaputa and this is the only way to achieve anything in the Dhamma
Wavering doubts halfhearted practice lack of confidence in the Triple Gem lack of confidence in one's Teacher  all makes for indecisiveness and getting nowhere
People like to see progress in their Dhammapractice but this will never be seen without determination and firmness of mind which prevents one being deflected on to other matters
When the mind's aim is truly firm then what chance have defiled and egoistic thoughts
Talaputa is no longer in their power and even if they should arise he has enough mindfulness and wisdom not to follow them up so that they are cut off quickly
Nor can he be misled by feelings and thoughts relating to the body which he compares to something rather dangerous  a doubleended sack Or perhaps it is the comedy of relying upon and becoming attached to such a sack which must be constantly filled at the table and emptied at the latrine that he speaks of here
He goes further if a doubleended sack is bad enough what about a thing filled full and flowing with nine streams Recognize it
It is this body which has nine holes two eyes two ears two nostrils mouth anus and urinary duct
And through these holes flow various sorts of dirt eyedirt eardirt nosedirt spittle phlegm and vomit from the mouth and excrement and urine from the other two
None of them smell taste or look good yet they come from the inside of this precious sack which I proudly call 'my body'
How strange it is
But Talaputa will not be entangled in all this for he is determined to be a master not a slave of mind
People wish that their meditation was calm that their hindrances were subdued that their defilements were cut off but their untamed minds are stronger than these wishes and they are slaves to that untamed mind
Talaputa's practice and determination are such that Dhamma is in control Dhamma is master while defilements of any sort are slaves which obey orders instantly
That is his inward state
Outwardly he is quite happy with whatever comes  whatever robes almsfood resting place and medicines he obtains he is satisfied with them
He does not always seek for more and different clothes his three robes are enough
He is content too with the food people give him and is not concerned with flavors textures a 'balanced diet' and so on
Restingplaces cause him no trouble or expense  a cave the root of a tree a hollow among some boulders or a small hut provided by generous donors
And when he needs medicines he will be offered whatever is necessary to cure the body and if not he is not too much concerned
The catskin bag is an illustration of the necessary energy for taming the mind
It seems that catskin required a lot of work to cure it to make it supple so does the mind
For the mind to be supple is meant that one can do with it what one likes
Oh today I'll stay in third jhana for a change  if he can do so he has a supple welltamed mind
Bull elephants in the mating season can be dangerous
Ordinarily they are very strong but to this must be added a fiery temper when in rut and it will be a skillful trainer indeed who brings such an elephant under control
A great deal of energy will be necessary  as needed for taming the wild mind too
The wild elephant is used to going where it likes and when it likes
Nothing can stop it crashing through the forest
In the same way the wild mind goes anywhere any time and is not restrained at all as it crashes about in the jungle of desires
What has to be done is told in the next verse
I'll bind you by strength to the meditation base as elephant to post by a strong rope bound The 'meditation base' is the object of meditation provided by one's Teacher to fix the mind on such as Mindfulness of Breathing in and out Lovingkindness or Unattractiveness of the body
This like a strong post to which the mind is tied by the rope of mindfulness
Slowly the wild elephant learns that it cannot get away
But it has to be wellguarded for successful meditation cannot be mixed with what goes counter to it
If it is wellguarded the mind grows with mindfulness grows to become aware of many things it had not known before
This growth through insightwisdom goes on until the time of penetrating a Noble Path perhaps of streamwinning
At that moment there is no leaning on support or clinging to any of the becomings not to sensualdesire nor to subtle form nor even to the formless realm
If the Noble Path which has been entered is that of arahantship thereafter there is no support at all no leaning on any kind of existence
Here is real determination
Today I shall thoroughly restrain it Talaputa does not say I'll restrain it tomorrow or next year or when I retire or when the next Buddha Ariya Metteyya comes  he says today You might say It's easy for him a monk living in the wilds with no family problems no money troubles That's all he has to do It is true that some places make the mind's training easier but life in the forest without the comforts that many take for granted these days is not so easy
More to the point wherever one is one is always in the present
That future time when it will be easier to train one's mind is an illusion
When it comes round to being now it's just the same old now and things have not changed
So there is only one time to start NOW
Otherwise of course this wandering mind a wanderer will go on wandering where it wishes  from dukkha to more dukkha
Talaputa tells his mind Get me across the floods But these are not of water far more powerful are the four floods described by the Buddha
First is the flood of sensual desire
Who is not swept along by it
Enjoying life here means to be adrift upon this flood of delight in sights sounds smells tastes and touches
This first flood not only sweeps along human beings but also all the subhuman and even laps the devas in the heavens of sensual desire
A mighty flood indeed which is not even recognized by many people who are yet being whirled along in it
The second is the flood of existence the extent of which is even greater than the first
From the lowest of the hells through animals ghosts humans gods of sensual desire and the Brahma gods of subtle form and formlessness all these beings are borne along by this flood the desire for existence
A third flood holds all these beings within its bounds too the flood of views
'Views' means beliefs theories doctrines and dogmas which are proclaimed as 'true' but which cannot be verified through the practice of sila samadhi pañña
Views are a powerful support to the ego so that in Thai presentations of Dhamma one often comes across the combined term manaditthi  conceit and views
It is not surprising that 'views' are popular
Nor is it surprising that the Buddha's Teaching with its emphasis on taming the self then seeing self as empty and hollow is strongly disliked by some
And this flood of views has been the cause of innumerable wars and murders because of course I am right and you must be wrong
Views though they seem intellectually respectable can rouse terrible passions
The last flood of all the flood encompassing all floods is that of unknowing
In the power of this flood beings are tossed about upon the ocean of samsara
If they hold that dukkha is experienced because of no cause or from one First Cause of from the displeasure of numerous divine beings or merely from material change then they are lost in the samsaric ocean
Even Buddhists who have merely heard the Four Noble Truths can only be said to have a distant glimpse of the Further Shore if they make no effort to practice certainly they will not get there
Only those Buddhists who are determined to cut down their cravings through Dhammapractice will approach that shore called Nibbana
Only when the real causes of dukkha are dealt with will this fourth flood by crossed
Though immense floods to those who do not practice Dhamma they can be leapt across by one who does so intensively
The mind purified with wisdom does the leaping  no one leaping to nowhere but attaining liberation having done so
None of this will be accomplished until one has seen this world  unstable unsteady lacking any essence While one is convinced that this world is stable and steady and very real  to be taken exactly as one's senses perceive it and one's mind thinks about it  it cannot be seen with insight for one will not have the drive necessary to do anything about oneself
This drive is samvega  being deeply moved to stirred
The Buddha is the teacher who makes one look at the world as it really is sometimes he compelled a person to look whether he wanted to see or not
For looking truly at the world means perceiving the necessity of change and changing oneself can be a painful business
The Rains have just begun after the long dry hot season and the earth which has been bare and brown is now covered by a bright green carpet of new grass
This is the time too when leafless trees burst into flowers of many colors followed by fresh growths of pale green pink purple and many other shades
Talaputa will have been at ease in this season when it becomes cooler an ease he expresses in the words like a log I'll lie Someone might say Sounds to me as though he is living in solitude just to have a doze a lazy man avoiding work Though a log does rather paint a picture of inactivity even of decay that is not the meaning intended here
The Commentary says being ungrasping like a tree he lies down perhaps indicating that his ease and pleasure is not like the rest taken by people who do not train themselves
They grasp at the concept 'I am lying down' along with which can go lethargy and drowsiness and other defilements but Talaputa having made great efforts does not grasp in this way
Most people do not find a secluded spot in the mountains Soft as cotton down even if it is covered with fourinch grass But for a meditator who can easily attain jhana small discomforts of the body are easily overcome
He is not worried if his meditation seat is hard rock nor delighted if it is a soft cushion
Wherever he is that is a good place to meditate and since solitude is seldom accompanied by all mod
cons he is content with things as they come
This is not the mark of an idle person for while the dullwitted may be able to blot out discomfort by much sleep the way of the meditator is to become more aware
Aware of what
Aware of the dukkha instead of escaping from it
The mind of Talaputa like our own minds is up to its tricks again
When you get into those cool quiet woods with the rain streaming down and the thunder resounding and an occasional bird's cry how joyful your meditation will be But it does not always work out like that
Having got to a remote place perhaps one feels bored and wants to return to where there is more sense stimulation
Or perhaps one feels afraid as though that aloneness was a threat to one's self
Again the woods are attractive when the sun shines and the weather is warm but if one proposes to live there for a long time in all weathers then there may be some hardships to face
And the usual reaction to hardship is to seek enjoyment elsewhere but where will this be found in the wet woods
Maybe the sounds of the brightly plumaged birds on Giribbaja's peaks will not be sufficient entertainment for such a dissatisfied mind
But Talaputa must have overcome this kind of mind eventually so that wherever he was in the wilds and whatever the condition he always had equanimity if not happiness
One good result of meditation is that it makes one able to endure all sorts of conditions which without the development that meditation brings one could not bear
A point to check up on oneself
This means that at least one's temper is even when things do not go as one wishes or better than this one is joyful come what may a result of what one has experienced in meditation
Depression boredom and lethargy which might be the reactions of some are all born from the evil root of delusion while dissatisfaction anger and grumbling arise from the evil root of aversion
The good meditator is at least as joyful as the birds  and he has much greater cause for joy than them
The peacock is a very beautiful bird and even his strange cries amidst rocks and cliffs would be arresting
But one must admit that the peacock's beauty costs him something
All that magnificent plumage is a burden even to walk around in what to speak of flying
It appears too that peacocks are only too aware of their splendor and 'as vain as a peacock' is as true of the bird as of some people
He struts about and shows off his tail from prominent perch as though saying to human beings Poor featherless creatures do you not envy my plumes But when he comes to fly his journey is just a hop from tree to tree
The peacock is contrasted by the Buddha with the swan plain in color and lacking any ornaments but how well and how far he flies
This illustrates how householders are burdened with their wealth and possessions so that their spiritual flights go not very far not very long while bhikkhus through lack of ownership are able if they make the effort to fly far and strongly
At this point maybe someone says What about the lady Visakha or the merchant Anathapindika
They were householders of greater possessions and wealth than most people have yet they became streamwinners
Nor did they renounce all and enter the Sangha
And besides there are other examples Yasa's father and mother and Upali who at first followed the Jains  they were all rich people Ah but you must not generalize from a few special cases
These people were not ordinary householders for we are told that they had developed their special qualities in previous lives so that when they met the Buddha they quickly penetrated his words But there might be some of them around now so that entering the Sangha is not necessary for them
I might be one
How do I know There could be such people now certainly
But how you can tell whether you are one or not probably depends on whether you have been able to meet an arahant and penetrate the truth of his words
And one should not assume that one has such great merits
But in any case the life of a bhikkhu or a nun is not for everyone
If your kamma fixes you in a lay person's life with the responsibilities and burdens that it brings then you have to be content to make short hops from tree to tree But those 'short hops' can carry one far by regular practice every day
One should not expect arahantship in this life unless conditions internal and external are complete for gaining it  this is one extreme view
On the other hand neither should one think 'I cannot get anywhere'  the other extreme
Just keep on with regular meditation practice every day for an hour or however long one can spare with concentrated courses from time to time
A great deal can be done in this way and one will find that the peacock plumes drop off as one goes along
Here are some good places for meditation the peaks of mountains or their slopes open spaces forests or caves
All of them to be suited for meditation should be unfrequented by human beings
Other beings boar and antelope are mentioned may be found there but their presence is not so disturbing as human beings
Animals make small noises and only from time to time while humans these days especially are much noisier with their songs shouts and transistor radios
Some places which should be quiet such as caves can be noisy enough if converted into a shrine for instance
Talaputa tells himself that it will be fine when he gets to silent places
What his mind actually did is related elsewhere
More mountains and forests where Talaputa hopes to find peace
There are some who would say Well he's quite wrong to take off for those forests because if he could not find peace where he was then how would he find it elsewhere A Buddhist might answer Can you find peace in every place as much in one as another or are some places more favorable for meditation Most people have to answer that some places are conducive to meditation others not
The Buddha taught three kinds of solitude of which the first physical aloneness is conducive to the second the oneness of mind in jhana when the hindrances have been suppressed
This 'solitude' in turn is helpful for the final aloneness of the mind which has no more assets another way of speaking about arahantship
So if the second is to be attained the first is very useful as Talaputa found and has emphasized in his verses
Those who do not find that these three sorts of solitude follow each one upon the another are either people who have developed the first sort of solitude in past lives or those who are just playing about and pretending at meditation
So there is some reason why one meditates best in quiet and lonely places
In the last line of the verse there is something of a puzzle
Talaputa addressing his mind says Doubtless mind you will perish but the Commentary explains by the destruction of Samsara you will be established It is the defiled mind that gives rise to Samsara and the latter ceases through the destruction of ignorance and the exhaustion of craving
The purified mind is established since there is nothing that can shake it
Not the place where people on the whole like to dwell  unless on some wellprotected tour
Leopards and tigers are thrilling through binoculars or even outside the closed windows of one's car or coach but people are not so happy at their close approach if they have no weapons
Fear is in their hearts and from fear is born hatred and the desire to destroy
But what can a bhikkhu do
He never even touches weapons and would not use one even if it was at hand
Yet in Talaputa's days bhikkhus often lived in remote areas where large animals abounded
Often bhikkhus did not even have the protection of a hut as they lived at the foot of trees or in caves
What protection did they have
Their best protection was meditation for in proportion to their success in purifying the mind fear becomes less
When fear and anxiety no longer control the mind then a bhikkhu can live happily in a cave where there are snakes in a forest where tigers and leopards are commonly seen or near to the haunts of wild elephants
No bhikkhu comes to grief in such places if he cultivates two things mindfulness and lovingkindness
His mindfulness will prevent him from carelessly treading on snakes while his lovingkindness will break up fear of other beings
And if he feels the first stirrings of fear in his heart he can always recite one of the discourses suitable for such an occasion
There is the Discourse on the Supreme Banner for one who has gone to the forest to the foot of a tree to an empty hut in which the cure for fear trembling and horripilation is the Recollections of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
Then there is the wellknown Discourse on Lovingkindness which by awakening that quality in one's heart banishes fear
Animals know and fear a man who has fear while they are aware of the peaceful vibrations of the fearless meditator
If one is fearful still of wild animals and knows a great Teacher who stays in such a place it is a good test of oneself to ask permission to stay there with him
No harm will come to such meditators as is told in Venerable Acariya Mun's life story while they will learn how to deal with unfaced fears
Some people from urban surroundings are unable even to keep their calm over large hairy spiders so what will they do if 'hailed' by leopard or tiger
And if one cannot get over these fears how far can one's meditation go
In the kinds of situation which we have been talking about 'abandoning longing for the body' becomes rather easier
There are just not the facilities for pampering the body in such remote places
Whatever comforts are found they are simple more necessities than luxuries
While longing for the body is strong again how far can one get with meditation
One is just tied down to this bag of bones by all one's concerns for it
And how much dukkha comes from this
While if one can let go of grasping at it through meditation while still keeping it going through food and medicines much peaceful happiness can be experienced
Perhaps one will not fail to do this given an inspiring Teacher and aspiring fellowpracticers
Certainly one should not fail to achieve some Dhamma in this life for all the fearful conditions of this world though leopards and tigers may not be among them are ranged against the continuance of our lives individually and against the Buddhasasana collectively
The taming of a wild elephant has been mentioned already but here the untamed mind is compared to a horse which has not been broken in
An animal like this does not agree to go any direction except the one it chooses
Even if it endures a rider on its back it persists in going to the right and left instead of straight ahead making it necessary to pull on the reins frequently
The untamed mind also does not want to go straight along the Dhammapath
It is pulled to this object and that arising through the six bases and then prances and bucks about controlled by subsequently arisen defilements
It has no straightforwardness no steadiness
Faced with attending to just one subject of concentration or even just to one event at a time it is not happy and turns this way and that to find a way out
A tiresome mind
The trainer of the untamed bronco is mindfulness the mindfulness of the mindful mind
As practice goes on the wild unmindful mind loses strength and occurs less frequently while the mindful mind increases in strength its occurrence becoming normal
The training of one's own mind must precede the effective training of others
Lord Buddha would never have been known as the incomparable Trainer of tamable men  one who could tame such powerful or wayward characters as the ascetic Uruvela Kassapa the parricide king Ajatasattu or the bandit Angulimala even an animal such as the maddened elephant Nalagiri  if first he had not tamed his own mind
Having perfectly tamed that he was in a position to tame others
The same applies to his arahant disciples down to the present day having tamed themselves they are able to help beings
Or in the words of another simile used by the Buddha a person stuck in the mud can never pull out another in the same plight
But one who stands upon a firm dry bank can do so
Talaputa after striving with mindfulness compares his mind to a wellregulated horse which is headed straight towards Nibbana down the path Silasamadhipañña
This path is safe and blissful he says
Is this true
What brings danger and dukkha in this world
Isn't it the Roots of Evil greed aversion and delusion which make life dangerous and cause sufferings of mind and body
Then you may say But surely a person on a spiritual path is sure to encounter dukkha as a result of his striving This is true but such dukkha is not associated with defilements and danger moreover it will pass when the need for striving has gone
No dangers arise from the good practice of moral conduct nor from wellguided meditation and the same applies to insightwisdom
Trouble and tension arise from the lack of these pathfactors in one's life or from the wrong practice of them
This safe and blissful Path cannot be won by those who do not guard the mind
If one wants to experience it then half an hour of meditation in the morning followed by many hours of unmindfulness during the day will not lead to the desired result
Only if one's regular meditation practice is backed up by a steady effort at mindfulness during the day will there be success
One may be mindful of sense objects Careful
That sight leads to trouble Or else check up on thoughts Mindfulness
These thoughts lead to defilements and dukkha Or look into feelings These pleasant feelings may lead to lust and greed Watch out
Painful feelings are the basis for anger and hatred Have care
From neutral feelings arise delusion Keep on checking up in this way at work at leisure at home with friends or relations This is the way to succeed with guarding the mind
As success comes through this effort so one's feet are planted firmly on the safe and blissful Path
Our 'visit' to the venerable Talaputa Thera is now finished
We would have heard his verses and perhaps we would have listened to explanations along the same lines as those presented here
One difference would have been in the directness clarity and compelling truth of his words as he was an arahant and had seen Dhamma for himself
Even though he explained points of the Dhamma which we knew about already his explanations would be fresh and new as in our own days when one listens to the disciples of Venerable Acariya Mun Bhuridatta Mahathera
For instance though one had often heard the four Noble Truths yet Enlightened Teachers explain them in words which make one think Yes of course
But why did I never think of that They are able to phrase their explanations afresh since they have found the pure source of Dhamma but we are unable to do this as we are bound and limited by words and by concepts about Dhamma
Another advantage of listening to the 'live' Dhamma is that it can be uniquely fitted to the character of the hearer
Had we been listening to venerable Talaputa instead of reading this book he might have so taught the Dhamma that we were able to see it as he talked
As he taught so the Dhammatruth might have been penetrated until there was attainment of Path and Fruit
He perhaps could have helped us in this way
He would have known what abilities and troubles people had in their hearts hidden from those who do not have the knowledge of others' minds
Fortunately this knowledge and this way of teaching have come down to the present day among the great Teachers of NorthEast Thailand
The Dhamma of attainment as those Teachers say is still possible and the Noble Sangha is not yet extinct
Their way of practice adheres to the ancient tradition from Lord Buddha's days
They and their disciples and no doubt others in Burma still hold aloft the light of the Dhamma by which men and women can find the way out of the darkness of samsara  if they are able to and if they wish to
While this Dhammalight is still bright one can say with real hope for now and the future
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Thus spoke the Buddha
These ten great King are the virtues of the layfollower
He shares the joys and sorrows of the Order
He places the Dhamma first
He enjoys giving according to his ability
If he sees a decline in the Dispensation of the Teaching of the Buddha he strives for its strong growth
He has right views disregarding belief in superstitions and omens he will not accept any other teacher not even for the sake of his life
He guards his deeds and words
He loves and cherishes peace and concord
He is not envious or jealous
He does not live a Buddhist life by way of deception or hypocrisy
He has gone for refuge to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
 Milindapañha Ch
IV
Buddhism should not be thought to be a teaching for monks only as it is sometimes wrongly conceived
In a large number of his discourses the Buddha has given practical guidance for the lay life and sound advice to cope with life's difficulties
Many of our problems and difficulties for which some people blame circumstances and chance are if correctly viewed the result of ignorance or negligence
They could be well avoided or overcome by knowledge and diligence yet of course worldly happiness and security are never perfect they are always a matter of degree for in the fleeting there is nothing truly firm
The central problem of a lay Buddhist is how to combine personal progress in worldly matters with moral principles
He strives to achieve this by building his life on the foundation of the Fourth Noble Truth the Noble Eightfold Path and to shape his activities in accordance with it
The first step of this Path is Right Understanding by developing a life style in accordance with it the other factors of the Path result from it namely Right Thoughts Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration
The eight steps of the Path fall into the three divisions of Wisdom Morality and Mental Culture
The order of development is however Morality Mental Culture and Wisdom
The Path outlines the practice of Buddhism leading to its ultimate goal  Nibbana
As a householder the Buddhist is particularly concerned with Morality
Right Understanding however is the prerequisite
Right Effort is the training of the will and Right Mindfulness the allround helper
Progress to a lay Buddhist means the development of the whole man in society
It is therefore an advance on many fronts  the economic the moral and the spiritual the first not as an end in itself but as a means to an end the full flowing of the human being in the onwardcarrying stream of Buddhist ideas and ideals
Right Understanding is the beginning and the end of Buddhism without which one's vision is dimmed and the way is lost all effort misguided and misdirected
Right Understanding in the context of the layman's Dhamma provides a sound philosophy of life
Right Understanding the first step of the Path is seeing life as it really is the objective understanding of the nature of things as it truly is
All things that have arisen including the socalled being are nothing but incessant change therefore unsatisfactory and productive of suffering
It follows then that what is both impermanent and painladen cannot conceal within it anything that is solid substantial or unchanging  an eternal soul or an immanent abiding principle
Right Understanding implies further a knowledge of the working of kamma  the moral law of cause and effect
We reap what we sow in proportion to the sowing
Good begets good and evil evil
Kamma operates objectively and the results show themselves here or in the hereafter
That is to say consequences follow causes whether one believes in kamma or not even as a fall from a height will result in injury or even death irrespective of one's personal belief or disbelief in the force of gravity
Kamma is intentional or volitional action vipaka is the fruit or result and every action affects character for good or bad
We know that actions consciously performed again and again tend to become unconscious or automatic habits
They in turn whether good or bad become second nature
They more or less shape or mold the character of a person
Likewise the unconscious or latent tendencies in us including inborn human instincts are merely the results of actions done repeatedly in innumerable past lives extending far beyond childhood and the formative years of the present life
Kamma includes both past and present action
It is neither fate nor predestination
A Buddhist views life in terms of cause and effect his own birth included
Existence was not thrust on him by an unseen Deity to whose will he must blindly bend nor by parents for the mere fusing of two cells from mother and father does not by itself produce life
It was of his own causing of his own choice the kammic energy generated from the past birth produced life  made real the potential in the appropriate sperm and ovum of his human parents at the moment of conception endowing the new life with initial consciousness using the mechanism of heredity duly modified if necessary
The arising of a being here then means the passing away of another elsewhere
This changing personality that constitutes me  the physical and mental makeup that is I  the very environment into which I was born in which I acted and reacted is more of my own doing of my own choice of my own kamma of one's past actions and thoughts
It is just it is fair it is right what is is the sum of what was effects exactly balance causes
One gets precisely what one deserves even as the sum of two plus two is four never more nor less
Enough of the past that is dead
What remains is the everpresent now not even the future that's still unborn
The past is dead yet influences the present but does not determine it
The past and the present in turn influence the future that is yet to be
Only the present is real
The responsibility of using the present for good or bad lies with each individual
And the future still unborn is one's to shape
The socalled being which in fact is merely a conflux of mind and matter is therefore born of supported by and heir to his kamma
One is driven to produce kamma by tanha or desire which itself is threefold
Where there is tanha there is ignorance  blindness to the real nature of life and where there is ignorance there is tanha or craving
They coexist just as the heat and light of a flame are inseparable
And the beginning of ignorance cannot be known
Because of this lack of understanding of things as they truly are we often unmindful of the rights of others desire for grasp at cling to the wrong sorts of things the pleasures that money can buy power over others fame and name wishing to go on living forever
We hope that pleasures will be permanent satisfying and solid but find them to be passing unsatisfying and empty  as hollow as a bamboo when split
The result is frustration and disappointment disease and an irritating sense of inadequacy and insufficiency
If we don't get all our wishes we react with hate or take shelter in a world of delusive unreality or phantasy
To remedy this we must correct our understanding and thinking and see in our own experiences so near to us things as they truly are and first reduce and finally remove all shades of craving or desire that are the causes of this restlessness and discontent
This is not easy but when one does so by treading the noble Eightfold path one reaches a state of perfection and calm thereby bringing to an end the painladen cycle of birth and death
As long as there is desire birth leads to death and death to birth even as an exit is also an entrance
Each subsequent individual born is not the same as the preceding one nor is it entirely different but only a continuity that is to say each succeeding birth depends upon or emerges from the preceding one
And both birth and death are but the two sides of the same coin life
The opposite of life is not death as some fondly believe but rest  the rest and peace of Nibbana in contrast to the restlessness and turmoil that is life
Kamma as we have seen is volitional action
It implies making choices or decisions between broadly speaking skillful and unskillful actions
The former are rooted in generosity lovingkindness and wisdom leading to happiness and progress and therefore to be cultivated again and again in one's life
The good actions are Generosity Morality Meditation Reverence Service Transference of merit Rejoicing in other's good actions Hearing the Doctrine Expounding the Doctrine and Straightening one's views
The unskilled actions are rooted in greed hate and delusion leading to pain grief and decline and therefore to be avoided
There are ten such actions killing stealing sexual misconduct lying slandering harsh speech gossip covetousness illwill and false views
This division of actions is a natural outcome of the Universal Law of Kamma Kamma is one of the fixed orders of existence
Life is like a ladder
The human being occupies the middle steps
Above are the celestial worlds of bliss below the woeful states of sorrow
With every choice one moves upward or downward ascends or descends for each one is evolved according to one's own actions
Beings are not only owners of kamma but also their heirs
Actions fashion not only one's fortune how one shall be born dividing beings into inferior or superior in health wealth wisdom and the like but also shapes one's future where one shall be born whether in the human heavenly or animal world
In short one can progress or regress from the human state
A proper understanding of the Buddhist doctrine of kamma and rebirth can therefore improve and elevate the character of a person
Buddhism teaches above all moral responsibility  to be mindful of one's actions because of the inevitability of action being followed by reaction
One therefore strives one's best to avoid evil and to do good for one's own welfare as well as for the benefit of others
This conduct leads to peace within and without
It promotes soberness of mind and habit together with selfrespect and selfreliance
Finally this teaching fosters in us a feeling of allembracing kindness and tolerance toward all living beings and keeps us away from cruelty hate and conflict
Man as a whole has not made a steady progress toward moral and spiritual perfection
But the individual can pursue the ideal of a perfect man  the Arahant  free from greed hate and delusion by treading the Noble Eightfold Path comprising Sublime Conduct Mental Culture and Intuitive Insight
It is the perfection of human living by perfecting one's understanding and purifying one's mind
It is to know the Truth do the Truth and become the Truth
Such a one has gone beyond the force of all rebirthproducing kamma skillful and unskillful
He has attained the highest  Nibbana
As the Blessed One teaches with incomparable beauty
This in brief and simple outline is the Teaching of the Buddha as it affects the householder's life
It is at once an ideal and a method
As an ideal it aims at the evolution of a perfect Man  synonymous with the attainment of Nibbana  in this very life itself by one's own efforts
As a method it teaches us that the ideal can become real only by the systematic practice and development of the Noble Eightfold Path at the two levels  that of the monk and that of the layman
Each develops according to his ability and each according to his needs whereby man using the instrument of mind by his own endeavor comes to know himself train himself and free himself from the thralldom of base desire the blindness of hate and the mist of a delusive self to win the highest of all freedoms  freedom from error and ignorance
In this Noble Teaching there is no intellectual error based as it is on reason and in keeping with the finding of science no moral blindness for its ethics are truly lofty with a rational basis namely evolution in terms of kamma
That Buddhism is eminently practicable is clearly shown by the example of the great Indian Emperor Asoka when Buddhism became the shaping ideal of the State and Buddhist ideas and ideals were used to build a just and righteous society thus ushering in a period of great prosperity material moral and spiritual
It is the only true solution to the manifold problems in the modern world
To this we must now turn
Buddha was a rebel
He rebelled against the way of thought and the way of life of his age
To the philosophical concept of life as dynamic change of no being but becoming no thinker but thought no doer but deed  he added its social equivalent the doctrine of social fluidity and equality based on nobility of conduct
As the Buddha stated
What matters then is not the womb from which one came nor the societal class into which one was born but the moral quality of one's actions
As a tree is judged by its fruit so shall a man be judged by his deeds
In this way the doors of the Deathless and of the unconditioned freedom beyond and of social freedom here on earth were thrown open to all regardless of caste color or class
In his teaching all men unite lose identity even as do the waters of the rivers that flow into the sea
No caste class or race privileges existed among his lay followers or in the Order of the Sangha that he founded  a fitting complement to the doctrine of anatta
For the Buddha all men are one in that they belong to one species
Social classes and castes are nothing but functional or occupational groupings neither fixed nor inevitable
They are divisions of society manmade subject to change and resulting from social and historical factors
A social doctrine based on the alleged superiority of any caste class or race and advocating to keep it dominant by the use of force must necessarily lead to the perpetuation of social tensions and conflict and will never bring about harmony and the fraternity of men
The Buddha's doctrine of equality does not however imply that all men are alike physically or mentally
That would be identity
It does mean that each one should be treated equally with human dignity and given an equal chance to develop the faculties latent in each as all are capable of moral and spiritual progress and of human perfection in view of the common capacity and capability of humanity
Thus the Buddha's teaching of a classless society requires the progressive refinement of man's nature as shown by his actions and the development of his character
The Buddha was not only the first thinker in known history to teach the doctrine of human equality but also the first humanist who attempted to abolish slavery in which term is also included the traffic in and the sale of females for commercial purposes
In fact this is a prohibited trade for his followers
The character of a society depends on the beliefs and practices of its people as well as on its economy
An economic system based on Buddhist ethics and principles therefore seems the only alternative
The true nature of man is that he is not only a thinking and feeling creature but also a striving creature with higher aspirations and ideals
If he is aggressive and assertive he is also cooperative and creative
He is forever making not only things but himself
And the making of oneself by perfecting the art of living is the noblest of all creative aspirations yielding the highest happiness and satisfaction in life
Progress in the material side of life alone is not enough for human happiness as illustrated by today's affluent societies The pursuit of material pleasures in the hope that by multiplying them they will thereby become permanent is a profitless chase akin to chasing one's shadow the faster one runs the faster it eludes
True happiness contentment and harmony come from an emancipated mind
Any economic system is therefore unsatisfactory if based on a wrong set of values and attitudes and will fail in the fulfillment of its promises
The only effective remedy for the economic and social ills of the modern world is a more rational and and balanced economic structure based on Buddhist ideas and ideals
In a Buddhist economic system the people deliberately use the state power to maximize welfare both economic and social from a given national income
The methods employed are threefold economic planning a suitable fiscal policy and a comprehensive network of social services assuring to every member of the community as a right and as a badge of citizenship and fellowship the essentials of civilized living such as minimum standards of economic security health care housing and education without which a citizen cannot realize his humanity in full
In such a system production distribution and values take a different meaning in a new context
Economic activity will be pursued not as an end in itself but a means to an end  the allround development of man himself
There should be a revision of values
A person's worth for instance ought not be measured in terms of what he has but on what he is
In short man or the majority of men in society should be helped to see life in perspective
Knowledge and discipline may transform a society into a workshop or a military camp but it is the cultivation of a proper sense of values that will make it truly civilized
Perhaps this may be the clue to the paradox of the Western civilization that knows how to go through space and sail across the seas but not how to live on earth in peace
It is true that such a change of heart and system may in the present context of the world take a long time to realize
But what else is the alternative
It is futile to think that reform by revolution will remedy the ills of the world
In the opening stanza of the Dhammapada the Buddha declared the supremacy of mind over matter Mind precedes things dominates them creates them
However this must not be interpreted to mean that Buddhism is against social and economic reform
It is far from it
Buddhism stands for a society of equals in which justice and ethical principles shall supplant privilege and chaos
But reform must take place by peaceful persuasion and education without resorting to violence worthy aims must be realized by worthy means even as democracy must be maintained by the methods of democracy
Buddhism concedes that the economic environment influences character but denies that it determines it
A person can use his free will within limits and act according to his conscience irrespective of the social structure to which he belongs
It all depends on mind and its development
Society does not stand still
Like any other conditioned phenomenon it changes constantly and Buddhism teaches us that we cannot change society as something different from its members
Social progress is their progress social regress their regress
If the individual perfects his life thinks and acts clearly lives in accordance with the Dhamma and the moral law of kamma to that extent will there be social order and discipline
Initial improvements from within will result in corresponding changes without
Social order and discipline follow not preceded the state of mind of the individuals comprising that society
Society reflects the character of its people the better the people the better the society
Every society is a projection or extension of the collective personality of its members
But humanity in the mass can be influenced for good by the example of a few really noble and selfless men with vision and wisdom with ideas and ideals to live for and to die for
They provide the guiding star round which others too timid to lead but strong enough to follow cluster around and become willing followers
It is these few who set the standards for the many at the bottom and their impact and influence on the way of life and thought of the human race can be tremendous
The message they bring carries with it the indelible stamp of truth and is therefore never obsolete
Most outstanding among the great teachers is the Buddha Gotama
It is through his Teachings that all the Buddhist nations including Sri Lanka were molded and into the fabric of national life were woven the strands of his Teaching
It is then the duty of every genuine Buddhist to help to make known far and wide the Teaching of the Buddha in all its many aspects and thereby make possible tomorrow the seemingly impossible of today  a new and just socioeconomic order based on Buddhist ethics principles and practices
Such a society will be both democratic and socialistic with liberty equality fraternity and economic security for all not as ends in themselves but as means to an end  the full development of man into a wellrounded happy human being in the setting of the Teaching of Gotama the Buddha Guide Incomparable to a troubled world
A follower of the Buddha learns to view life realistically which enables him to adjust to everything that comes his way
Buddhism tells him the meaning and purpose of existence and his place in the scheme of things
It suggests the lines of conduct supported by cogent reasons by which he should live his daily life
It clarifies what his attitude should be to specific matters like self job sex and society
Thus it assists him in the business of living for to lead a full life four fundamental adjustments have to be made
He must be happily adjusted to himself and the world his occupation his family and his fellow beings
A Buddhist tries to see things as they really are
He remembers the instability of everything and understands the inherent danger in expecting to find permanence in existence
In this way he strives to insulate himself from potential disappointments
So a discerning lay Buddhist is not unduly elated or upset by the eight worldly conditions of gain and loss honor and dishonor praise and blame pleasure and pain
He does not expect too much from others nor from life and recognizes that it is only human to have one's share of life's ups and downs
He looks at life's events in terms of cause and effect however unpleasant or painful they may be
An understanding layman accepts dukkha as the results of his own kamma  probably a past unskillful action ripening in the present
He sees the connection between craving and suffering and therefore tries to reduce both the intensity and variety
As the Dhammapada states
Therefore he is mindful of a scale of values  knowing clearly what is really important to him as a Buddhist layman what is desirable but not so important and what is trivial
He tries to eliminate the nonessential and learns to be content with the essential
Such a person soon discovers that to need less is to live better and happier
It is a mark of maturity
It is progress on the path to inner freedom
One should wisely seek and carefully choose in one's actions and strive to maintain a Buddhist standard of conduct whatever disappointments life may bring
And when disappointments come one tries to look at them with some degree of detachment standing as it were apart from them
In this way a person gains a feeling of inner security and frees himself from fears anxieties and many other heavy burdens
This attitude to life and the world brings courage and confidence
How does a lay Buddhist view himself
In the Buddha Dhamma the human being is an impersonal combination of everchanging mind and matter
In the flux is found no unchanging soul or eternal principle
The self or soul is then a piece of fiction invented by the human mind
To believe in such an absurdity is to create another source of unhappiness
One should therefore see oneself as one truly is  a conflux of mind and matter energized by tanha or craving containing immense possibilities for both good and evil neither overestimating nor underestimating one's capacities and capabilities
One must also take care to recognize one's limitations and not pretend that they do not exist
It is simply a matter of accepting what one is and deciding to make the most of oneself
With this determination one's position in this world will be decided by one's efforts
And everyone has a place however humble it may be and a contribution to make as well
Seeing that no two are alike physically or psychologically in the light of kamma a wise person should therefore avoid comparing himself with others
Such profitless comparison can only lead to unnecessary sorrow and suffering
If he thinks that he is better than others he may become proud and conceited and develop a superiority feeling  of an inflated I If the person thinks he is worse than others he is liable to develop an inferiority feeling  of a deflated I and to withdraw from the realities and responsibilities of life
If he considers that he is equal to others there is likelihood of stagnation and disinclination to further effort and progress
So instead of keeping pace with or outdoing others socially financially and in other ways the understanding layman proceeds to do something more useful
He decides to take stock of himself to know himself his true nature in all aspects as a first step to improving it the secular the moral and the spiritual through careful selfexamination and observation by past performance and by the candid comments of sincere friends
Seeing himself as a whole he plans for life as a whole in the context of the Noble Eightfold Path
Such a plan when drawn up will include all important events of a normal layman's life including occupation marriage and old age
Lay happiness and security lies then in finding out exactly what one can do and in actually doing it
A plan like this brings order into an otherwise aimless and meaningless life prevents drift and indicates the right direction and drive
A thoughtful lay Buddhist will not simply do what others do
He can resist the pull of the crowd when necessary
He is ever mindful both of ends pursued and the means employed
He does not merely go through life aimlessly he goes knowing clearly where he wants to go with a purpose and a plan based on reality
To be born as a human being is hard but made easier in a Buddha Era  that is an age when his teachings are still remembered and practiced
The more reason then why a lay Buddhist should consciously direct his life for purposeful living with a right end by right endeavor to a right plan this is the quintessence of Buddha's teachings
Men work to satisfy the primary or basic urges of hunger thirst and sex as well a host of secondary wants and desires created by a commercial civilization such as ours
The Buddha's teaching is a teaching of diligence and right effort or exertion
The opposite of diligence is negligence  aimless drift sloth and laziness which are hindrances to both material and moral progress
It is the active man who lives purposefully who blesses the world with wealth and wisdom
So work is essential for happy living
Life without work would be an eternal holiday which is the hell of boredom
A large part of our waking life is spent earning a living
So it is easy to appreciate why we should be at least moderately happy in our job
But choosing a suitable career like choosing a marriage partner is one of the most important yet one of the most difficult tasks in life
The economic aspect of a community profoundly affects its other aspects
The Buddha says that society as with all conditioned phenomena has no finality of form and therefore changes with the passage of time
The mainsprings of social change are ideology and economics  for men are driven to action by beliefs and desires
Some systems emphasize the latter the Buddha the former for an economic structure can only influence but never determine man's thought
Man must live and the means of his livelihood are matters of his greatest concern
A hungry man is an angry man
And a man poisoned by discontent is hardly in a fit frame of mind to develop his moral and spiritual life
The spirit may be willing but the flesh may prove to be weak
Unemployment and economic insecurity lead to tension irritability and loss of selfrespect without which a healthy mental life is impossible
And one of the essential needs of a man is to feel he is wanted in the world
Of human rights the right of work should therefore be assured to all as a prerequisite for the good life
It is the duty of the state to uphold justice and provide for the material and spiritual welfare of its subjects
While Buddhism recognizes that bread is essential for existence it also stresses that man does not live by bread alone
This is not all
How he earns and why he does it are equally relevant
He should not gain a living by methods detrimental to the welfare of living beings  anakula ca kammanta a peaceful occupation as the Discourse on Blessings has it
So the Buddha forbade five kinds of trade to a lay Buddhist and refraining from them constitutes Right Livelihood the seventh step of the Path
They are trading in arms human beings flesh intoxicants and harmful drugs and poisons
These trades add to the already existing suffering in the world
Economic activity should also be regarded as a means to an end  the end being the full development of man himself
Work should serve men not enslave him
He should not be so preoccupied with the business of earning a living that he has no time to live
While income and wealth through righteous means will bring satisfaction and lay happiness the mere accumulation of riches for their own sake will only lead to unbridled acquisitiveness and selfindulgence resulting later in physical and mental suffering
The enjoyment of wealth implies not merely its use for one's own happiness but also the giving for the welfare of others as well
The Buddha further says that the progress prosperity and happiness of a lay person depends on hard and steady effort  rather discouraging no doubt to many people who want something for nothing
Efficiency in work be it high or humble makes a useful contribution to the production of socially desirable goods and services
It gives one's work meaning and interest besides enabling one to support oneself and one's family in comfort
Conservation and improvement of one's resources and talents acquired or inherited with balanced living living within one's income ensuring freedom from debt is a sure indicator of right seeing or understanding
Lastly a blameless moral and spiritual life should be the aim of right livelihood
Life is one and indivisible and the working life a part of the whole
The man who is unhappy at work is unhappy at home too
Unhappiness spreads
Likewise business life is part of life
The Dhamma of the Blessed One should therefore pervade and permeate one's entire life for only wealth rooted in righteous endeavor can yield true happiness
In the Maha Mangala Sutta the Buddha teaches us that
The essentials of happy family life are then a partnership of two parents with common aims attitudes and ideals who love respect and trust each other who love and understand their children on whom they in turn can depend for the same treatment and sound guidance grounded on true values living by Right Livelihood and supporting aged parents
In Buddhism however marriage is not a compulsory institution for all lay followers
It is optional
This brings us to the important question of sex
The sex instinct is a powerful impersonal impulse or force in us all to ensure the preservation of the race
Nature to make sure of its objective made the reproductive act of sexual union highly pleasurable so that it is inevitably sought by the individual for its own sake
There is no special mating season for humans and males and females may find that they are physically attracted at any time
Sex is an essential part of life
In some form or other it affects us every day and often ends in choosing a partner for life
It can make or mar a householder's life
What is the Buddhist attitude to sex
For a lay person there is nothing sinful or shameful in sex nor does it carry lifelong burdens of guilt
Sexual desires in its personal aspect is just like another form of craving and as craving leads to suffering
Sexual desire too must be controlled and finally totally eradicated
This happiness arises only at the third stage of Sainthood that of Anagami
When a lay Buddhist becomes an Anagami he leads a celibate life
But sexual behavior in its social context demands mindfulness of the fact that at least one other person's happiness is at stake and possibly that of another  a potential child
And children born of premarital relations when deprived and unwanted often develop into juvenile delinquents
Besides premarital sex may carry with it the risks of venereal infection
A compassionate Buddhist mindful of his own and others' welfare acts wisely and responsibly in sexual matters
Misconduct for a layman means sexual union with the wives of others or those under protection of father mother sister brother or guardian including one's employees
Adolescence is a period of stress and strain
It is at this time that the sex instinct becomes active and sensible parents should guide and help their children to adjust to the changes
This sexual energy could be diverted not merely to outdoor games and sports but also to creative activities like hand work gardening and other constructive activities
It is not easy for an unmarried adult to practice sexual selfrestraint till such time as he is able to marry
No doubt he lives in a sexdrenched commercial civilization where sex is seen heard sensed and thought of most the time
But the ideal of sex only within marriage is something worth aiming at
The Buddhist's ultimate objective is after all to be a Perfect Man  not a perfect beast
And a start has to be made some day somewhere  and now is the best time for it
At all times in a man's life it is mind that dominates man's actions
It is mind that makes one what one is
There is no doubt about this
Truly it is an encouraging fact  one tends to become what one wants to be
And if one wishes to be chaste one can be
One's life will then move irresistibly in the direction of its fulfillment
Much can be done by sublimating the instinct by diverting the energy in the sex impulse into other activities
Developing an occupational interest or hobbies or sports can divert the mind and provide suitable outlets
Moderation in eating is helpful
But what is most important is the guarding of thoughts regarding all sexual matters
One must also avoid situations and stimuli likely to excite sexual desires
When sensual desires do arise the following methods may be tried
Steps should also be taken to foster and maintain all that is wholesome as for instance wise friendship and keeping oneself usefully occupied at all times
If one has succeeded in meditative practice the happiness derived from it will be a powerful counterforce against sexual desires
This mindfulness is the only way to achieve selfmastery
It is a hard fight requiring patient and persistent practice nevertheless it is a fight worth waging and a goal worth winning
A lay Buddhist lives in society
He must adjust himself to other people to get on smoothly with them
Human relationships  the education of the emotions  are the fourth R in education and play an important part in everyday life
So instead of keeping pace with or outdoing others socially financially and in other ways the understanding layman proceeds to do something more useful
Happiness and security then lie in finding out exactly what one can do and doing it well
The lay person who practices morality by reason of his virtue gives peace of mind to those around him
He controls his deeds and words by following the third fourth and fifth steps of the noble Eightfold Path namely Right Speech Right Action and Right Livelihood or by observing the Five Precepts
Such regulated behavior flows from proper understanding of the Buddhist doctrine of kamma that a man is what he is because of action and the result of action
If one is genuinely trying to tread the path one's daily life should reflect it
So the Buddhist avoids killing living beings stealing sexual misconduct drugs intoxicants and harmful lying talebearing harsh words and idle talk
The Buddha's attitude toward stupefying drugs and intoxicants is clear and simple complete abstinence from both
And why
The immediate aim of a Buddhist layman is happiness and security here and now  in the present existence while his distant objective is the lasting peace and security of Nibbana and therewith freedom from repeated births and deaths with their attendant frustrations disappointments and the pain of temporal life
Now the one and only tool he has at his disposal to achieve both of these goals is the weapon of the mind which under the wise guidance of the Master's teaching he gradually learns to use with skill without ill to himself or others
And one of the best ways of impairing the efficiency of this precious mental instrument  to make it dull and blunt is to partake of intoxicating drinks and drugs
Even when taken in moderation they have a pernicious influence on the mind and on the body as well as on the character and the moral qualities
Under their baneful effects mind becomes confused and the drinker finds it difficult to distinguish between right and wrong good and bad the true and false
Such a person then wrongs himself wrongs those who live with him and wrongs society at large
On the other hand he who faithfully follows the Buddha's advice and abstains completely from the use of all intoxicants and harmful drugs is always sober in mind and is therefore able to exercise physical mental and moral control
Such a one has always a clear mind and can easily understand what is going on within and also without one's mind
But what of a Buddhist who as a rule refrains from alcoholic drinks and drugs but occasionally finds himself placed in a delicate situation such as when offered an intoxicating drink at a party given by his superior or at an important occasion
Should he accept or refuse
At least two possible courses are open to him he could politely decline excusing himself on medical grounds and ask instead for a nonalcoholic drink mindfully noting what is taking place and impress on his mind that even a single deviation from the ideal of total abstinence is to open the way even temporarily to heedlessness recklessness and mental confusion
Alcohol does impair the ability to think clearly to decide wisely and to perform any work of an exacting nature
If a Buddhist layman while aiming at absolute perfection occasionally lapses and is content with approximations he is free to do so  but at his own grave peril
Positively the Buddhist layman is kind and compassionate to all honest and upright pure and chaste sober and heedful in mind
He speaks only that which is true in accordance with facts sweet peaceable and helpful
Morality is a fence that protects us from the poisons of the outer world
It is therefore a prerequisite for higher spiritual aspirations and through it character shines
The development of personality on such lines results in charm tact and tolerance  essential qualities to adjust oneself to society and to get on well with other people
In the Sigalovada Sutta the Buddha explained to young Sigala the reciprocal relationship that should exist among the members of society
They are worth mentioning in brief parents have to look after their children and guide and educate them children have to respect their parents perform their duties and maintain family traditions teachers must train and instruct pupils in the proper way and pupils in turn must be diligent and dutiful a husband should be kind loyal and respectful of his wife supply her needs and give her due place in the home and she in return should be faithful understanding efficient industrious and economical in the performance of her duties friends should be generous sincere kindly and helpful to one another and a sheltering tree in time of need employers must be considerate to their employees give adequate wages ensure satisfactory conditions of work and service and they in return must work honestly efficiently and be loyal to their masters the laity should support and sustain the monks and other holy men who in turn should discourage them to do evil encourage them to do good expound the teaching and show the way to happiness
Buddhist morality is grounded on both thought and feeling
A Buddhist monk does social service when he himself while not engaging in the worldly life so teaches the Dhamma that he makes the lay followers better Buddhists and thereby induces them to take to social work which is an ideal practical form of the Four Sublime States Loving Kindness Compassion Sympathetic Joy and Equanimity besides their practice of these at the meditational levels
They should be the four cornerstones of genuine lay Buddhist life
The Four Sublime States form the foundation of individual and social peace and combine in them the realism of human nature and the idealism of youth to work for the social betterment out of natural sympathy and concern for fellowbeings
But social work to be of real value should spring from genuine love sympathy and understanding for fellowmen guided by knowledge and training
It is the living expression of Buddhist brotherhood
The cultivation of the neglect of these duties is a matter for each one of us but their promotion will undoubtedly foster healthier interpersonal relationships decrease social tension and irritability and appreciably increase social good stability and harmony
Life is full of stress and strain but we have to live in conditions as they are and make the best of them
Successful adjustment to life in the light of Buddha's teachings will however ensure the allround progress of the lay Buddhist maximizing happiness and minimizing pain
The Buddha names four kinds of lay happiness the happiness of possession as health wealth longevity wife and children the enjoyment of such possessions freedom from debt and a blameless moral and spiritual life
Yet even the happiest person cannot say when and in what form misfortune may strike him
Against suffering the externals of life will be of little or no avail
Real happiness and security are then to be sought in one's own mind to be built up by constant effort mindfulness and concentration
So the wise layman while being in this world will try to be less and less of it
He will train his mind to look at life mindfully with detachment and soon discover that modern civilization is by and large a commercial one for the benefit of a powerful minority at the expense of the unthinking majority based on the intensification and multiplication of artificial wants often by arousing and stimulating the undesirable and lower elements of human nature and that the increasing satisfaction of these wants leads not to peace and stillness of mind but only to chronic discontent restlessness dissatisfaction and conflict
He therefore decides to practice voluntary simplicity and finds a new freedom the less he wants the happier and freer he is
Thinking man realizes that there are but four essential needs for the body  pure food clothing shelter and medicine
Corresponding to these there are four for the mind  right knowledge virtue constant guarding of the sense doors and meditation
Bhavana or meditation is the systematic training and culture of the mind with Nibbana as its goal
The emotions are controlled the will is disciplined and the instinctive energies are diverted from their natural ends  led along the Four Great Efforts  to the sublimated ideal of a perfect Man or Nibbana
If there is an urgent felt need the ideal has the power of drawing out all one's instinctive impulses so that they are sublimated and harmonized giving satisfaction to the individual and therefore benefiting the community as well
Closely connected with our instincts are the emotions
By emotion is meant a feeling which moves us strongly
We get stirred up as it were
Examples of emotion are fear anger and strong sexual passion
When emotion floods the mind reason retreats or disappears and we often do things for which we repent later
So some emotional control is necessary for without it character cannot be developed and moral and spiritual progress is impossible
Fear is a common emotion that darkens our lives
It is anticipation of deprivations
One tries to live in two periods of time at once  the present and the future
To know how fear arises enables us to take the right steps for its removal
It results from wrong seeing not understanding things as they really are
Uncertainty and change are the keynotes of life
To each one of us there is only one thing that is truly ours is us our character as shown by our actions
As for the rest nothing belongs to us
We can visualize everything else being taken away save this
But this one's character nobody and nothing else can deprive one of
Why then go to pieces when all other things that are liable to break do break
Why fret about the fragility of the frail
Besides are we so careful of not taking other people's things as we are of preserving ours
Our past actions of depriving others may only end in others now depriving us
It is only fair and just
This attitude of detachment to life's storms is the only sound philosophy that can bring one a true security and a true serenity
Or again there is no such thing as justifiable anger in Buddhism for if one is in the right one should not be angry and if one is in the wrong one cannot afford to be angry
Therefore under any circumstances one should not become angry
A good way to secure emotional control is to practice noticing mindfully and promptly an incipient hindrance then of its own it tends to fade away
If done as often as possible it will be very effective
The five hindrances are undue attachment to sensual desire illwill laziness and inertia agitation and worry and doubt
The last here refers to indecision or unsteadiness in the particular thing that is being done
One must know exactly one's own mind  not be a Hamlet unable to decide because one is always mistrusting one's own judgment
Daily practice is the way to progress
Even a little practice every day brings a person a little nearer to his object day by day
The question of correct livelihood is of great importance for any practicing lay Buddhist
So also to the many meditators once they have done enough meditation courses and work on their own to realize that they must live a Dhamma life
Just what is Right Livelihood  how broad is the category of trades a disciple of the Buddha cannot ply
And how can one best work so that he is developing the other seven Path factors while earning a living
Is work a total waste  just a means to the end of supporting oneself in order to meditate
Or can one's job be used in a more constructive way so that it brings some direct benefit to those around us as well
These and many other related issues come to the mind of anyone who finds himself in the position of the Buddha's teachings and to a large extent each of us has to determine for himself the details of how to work out the livelihood aspects of his life
In this essay an attempt is made simply to outline how we can try to use the Noble Eightfold Path in relation to our work  whether it is in an office or a factory in the city or country whether it is indoors or outdoors white collar or blue collar or neither
If the meditator succeeds in applying sila samadhi and pañña the three aspects of the Path at work as well as in all other life situations he will be growing in Dhamma even during the part of the day that is apparently devoted to nonDhamma work and at the same time he will be doing his job well and sharing his peace of mind and metta with those his livelihood brings him into contact with

Monks these five trades ought not to be plied by a laydisciple Trade in weapons trade in human beings trade in flesh trade in spirits and trade in poison
 Gradual Sayings III p

And what monks is wrong mode of livelihood
Trickery cajolery insinuating dissembling rapacity for gain upon gain And what monks is the right side of merit that ripens unto cleaving to a new birth
Herein monks an ariyan disciple by getting rid of wrong livelihood earns his living by a right mode of living
 Middle Length Sayings III pp

The fields of livelihood which the Buddha prohibited to his lay followers as listed in the initial quotation above are limited to those in which the disciple would be directly on his own responsibility involved in breaking one or more of the Five Precepts which are the very basic moral rules for the Buddhist layman
Anyone who is attempting to develop morality concentration and wisdom to grow in compassion and insight cannot deal in weapons of any sort at any level of the business because by doing so he would be involving himself in causing harm or injury to others for his own monetary gain
These days the probability of trading in human beings as slaves or for prostitution is limited but certainly any job with such overtones is to be avoided
Breeding animals for slaughter as meat or for other uses that may be made of the carcasses is not allowed because this obviously implies breaking the First Precept I shall abstain from killing
Similarly anyone trying to follow the teachings of the Buddha should avoid hunting and fishing nor can he be an exterminator of animals
Dealing in alcohol or intoxicating drugs would be making oneself directly responsible for encouraging others to break the Fifth Precept I shall abstain from all intoxicants
While by no means everyone we meet is trying to keep these precepts still to help others directly in breaking any of them is certainly wrong livelihood
If we manufacture deal in or use insecticides or other kinds of poisons in our work we are engaging to some degree in wrong livelihood because here too we are breaking the First Precept and directly encouraging others to do so as well
However the motivation behind the use of such material has a great deal to do with the depth of the kamma being created
A doctor rightly gives drugs which are harmful to bacteria and viruses not because he hates the bugs but in order to help cure the human being
Here the good more than balances the bad
But if we go about applying poison to ratholes and cockroaches' hideouts with anger or aversion toward the pests we would be generating considerably strong bad kamma
But these five are the only ways of earning a living which are to be strictly avoided by one who is walking on the Path
Other fields of endeavor may seem trivial to the meditator investigating the job market or they may appear to be just helping others to create more tanha or they may involve some indirect responsibility in wrong speech or action  but we must find our work within the context of the society from which we come and within the framework of available job opportunities
It is not possible first to go about setting up the ideal Dhamma community and then find work within it so we must live in the society and serve its members to the best of our ability
Someone who finds Dhamma in middle age and is settled into a career with little reasonable possibility of shifting to one more strictly in accord with Right Livelihood can  and must  practice Dhamma as it is possible within his context
For example only rarely does an army officer serve in combat  the rest of the time there is ample scope for him to work wisely according to pañña in a detached way giving the necessary commands without being overly harsh
There are a substantial number of police officers in Rajasthan doing vipassana meditation who already are feeling the benefits of meditation in preserving law and order and dealing with criminals and the general public with little anger
Even people whose livelihood is solely dependent on hunting or fishing can at least develop dana and other virtues  as Burmese fishermen do  even if it is impossible for them to give up an incorrect mode of earning a living
After all an important reason for which serious Buddhists become monks is that the householder's life is full of dust and few positions for lay livelihood can allow one to be completely pure
Due to the interdependence of all phases of society and today's complex economic structures it is very difficult to live as a layman and keep the perfect sila the meditator strives for  a farmer has to use insecticides public health workers kill mosquitoes and their larvae a truck driver may sometimes have to transport arms or poison
Often one is in a position of having to exaggerate one's statements or omit disadvantageous facts even if one does not like it
So we must earn our livelihood as we have been trained and as we find a position for ourselves in society while constantly making an effort to grow in Dhamma
However if we let the Dhamma slide and allow our daily routine work to take over and become the thing of paramount importance then we have lost track of the goal we set for ourselves in being dedicated followers of the Buddha and especially serious vipassana meditators
One cannot use Dhamma for one's increased mundane profit and continue to grow in pañña at the same time because then desire for gain will be the root of one's very Dhamma practice and a complete distortion of the real purpose of Dhamma  the elimination of craving and so of suffering
Occupational work is a means to keep alive and to support one's dependents so that one can grow in Dhamma
Trying to use the Dhamma to help one achieve more at work and ignoring the Noble Eightfold Path or getting so involved in business that one cannot even sit for meditation an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening is making a farce of Dhamma  perhaps keeping the form but surely losing the essence of the Buddha's teaching
This is the way of dukkha productive of suffering
To alleviate dukkha one must live by the Eightfold Path earning one's livelihood within its context trying to practice sila samadhi and pañña  morality concentration and wisdom  at the workplace as well as while formally sitting in meditation
Once we have found a suitable job the more long range task begins  applying the Buddha's teachings at work
If we can keep sila only during meditation courses what serious benefit have we gained from such training periods
If we lose all our mindfulness concentration and wisdom when we are confronted with the vibrations of a big city or the workplace where is our wisdom
To grow in Dhamma we have to try constantly to apply the whole of the Noble Eightfold Path in all life's circumstances and some of the more challenging situations we will come across are very likely to be those we meet during working hours
Jobs are particularly important occasions to keep carefully to the Path for a number of reasons usually we do not have the support of the Sangha while at work and so are completely on our own work tends to arouse all previous thought associations and our deepseated conditionings of greed competition and aversion so many of our waking hours are inevitably involved in simply earning a living
Yet if we rightly apply the Path factors on the job we are still assured of moving toward success in the supramundane field and we are quite apt to find that these factors enable us to do well in our chosen mundane work as well
Let us first examine the relationship at work between the three sila factors of Right Speech Right Action and Right Livelihood
Right Livelihood was outlined in the first quotation from the Buddha
But Right Livelihood will not be really pure unless it includes Right Speech and Right Action as well
We have to strive with determination to keep all the Five Precepts while we work at a job as well as for the rest of the time
The forms of wrong speech and wrong action to be avoided are all those in which lying backbiting or harming of others would be involved
If we are honest in our speech and actions our employers will certainly be pleased with our work and we will be growing in Dhamma by confronting our mind's opposing tendencies we will note when the mind tries to find the easy way out or to blame others for our own errors
If we are running our own business we must be scrupulously honest in our dealings with our customers and avoid all trickery cajolery dissembing We can make a reasonable profit for services we perform of bringing our commodity to the consumer but we must not let ourselves get caught up in the businessman's perpetual tendency toward rapacity for gain upon gain The merchant plays an important role and function in the community but the meditatorbusinessman must always keep in mind that his job is to serve the society and provide for the needs of his family  not to make the maximum amount of money with the least effort as he might previously have perceived it
Whatever our work situation is  in an office factory or shop  we will always feel the benefits of keeping sila
If we do not indulge in gossip or slander  office or academic politics  but keep clearly to the side of right and honesty in every situation that arises with other workers or our employers we will find that we are less often at the receiving end of other people's anger
In fact if we are really able to keep on the Path at work we may well find ourselves in the position of peacemaker or mediator between the opposing sides in many a workplace dispute  and in such a role we will certainly be serving others
To practice Right Action at work we must scrupulously avoid anything even remotely related to stealing for our own personal gain
The less we are involved in anyone else's taking what was not intended for him the better off we are as well
So it is beneficial to all to dissuade other workers from stealing from the establishment liberating materials or otherwise misappropriating the employer's property
On the other hand the kammic implications for us in occasionally having to exaggerate a bit at the boss's behest or to do the firm's accounts in a legally dubious way they have always been done once in a while are not so severe because the full responsibility for such occasional acts is not with us
However we do bear some responsibility in these situations and if the job seems to require chronic dishonesty in speech or action and this situation cannot be altered by discussion with the employer then it may be necessary to change jobs
But we have to keep a balanced perspective and not keep running after the perfect work  part of the dukkha of the householder's life is the necessity to function in an immoral society while keeping one's own mind clear
So if we have chosen work which does not involve us in killing or trading in living beings or poisons or in dealing in intoxicants we are earning a Right Livelihood
And if while on the job we carefully avoid lying stealing and the associated forms of wrong speech and action we are doing our work and simultaneously practicing sila on the Path
The samadhi section of the Path during meditation has effects in the mundane world for Right Effort Mindfulness and Concentration will contribute greatly to our success in our career
Right Effort at work as elsewhere must be neither overexertion nor laziness but a Middle Path
For a businessman to spend all his waking hours involved in the concerns of his firm means that he is consumed with some strong tanha either for making money or for some particular set of circumstances to come about and this is in direct contradiction with living the Dhamma life
On the other hand the employee who sees how inane his work is or how absurd it is to put two pieces into a car on an assembly line for eight hours a day or that his job just helps people keep revolving in dukkha and so sits back and does only the barest minimum required of him means to be overcome by defilement of sloth and torpor and probably illwill as well
Right Effort at work means doing our best to accomplish the tasks before us  without becoming mindlessly absorbed or involved in them to the point of forgetting equanimity and without the inertia that comes of a belligerent mind which thinks itself to be superior to the position it is in
Unrelenting effort in the mundane sphere is summarized by the Buddha in a discourse on the householder's life to the lay disciple Dighajanu
By whatsoever activity a householder earns his living whether by farming by trading by rearing cattle by archery by service under the king or by any other kind of craft at that he becomes skillful are tireless
He is endowed with the power of discernment as to the proper ways and means he is able to arrange and carry out duties
This is called the accomplishment of unrelenting effort
Samma sati Right Mindfulness or Awareness is the next factor of the samadhi section of the Path and there are several ways in which the mindfulness we gain from vipassana will help us on the job
Herein Dighajanu whatsoever wealth a householder is in possession of obtained by work and zeal collected by the strength of this arm by the sweat of his brow justly acquired by right means such he husbands well by guarding and watching so that kings may not seize it thieves may not steal it nor fire burn it nor water carry it off nor illdisposed heirs remove
This is the accomplishment of watchfulness
The quality of mindfulness mentioned by the Buddha here is not the same as the sammasati of the Noble Eightfold Path but this watchfulness is a byproduct of mindfulness important to the layfollower
The more the meditator has developed awareness in the supramundane field the more careful he will be in all situations of life  meditative household or work
If one's mindfulness is not Right however then one will be apt to take this injunction of the Buddha's as license to indulge in great upadana that is in clinging by all possible means to what one regards as one's own
This kind of ignorancebased watchfulness will only lead to dukkha
What we have to learn to do is care for the possessions we have acquired so that we and our dependents can make best use of them but without making the error of expecting them to last indefinitely nor of considering them as a personal possession fully in one's own control
To want only to give away one's hardearned or inherited goods to anyone who expresses a desire for them is folly
Dana or charity can earn us great merit but only when done in wisdom and when the quality of the recipient also helps to determine how much merit is earned
Material possessions in themselves are not the fetters that keep us in dukkha so having fewer things or more for that matter will not necessarily bring more happiness it is our attachment to them that is the bondage that must be eliminated
So if we apply Right Mindfulness to the proper taking care of our things we are only intelligently providing for our own welfare and for that of those who are dependent on us not necessarily generating more tanha
Increased awareness or mindfulness is intertwined with improved concentration in enhancing our performance at work
Greater awareness of all the parameters of a situation will enable a businessman to make more accurate decisions a workman to avoid accidents and a teacher to really communicate information to his students
In addition to this mindfulness of external situations we also have to try to be mindful of our own minds and bodies while we work as well as the rest of the time of course
Once we become fairly established in the tradition of vedananupassana we have acquired a ready technique for keeping mindfulness always with us
Continual change is always going on in our bodies so at no time can it be said that there are no sensations since it is the impermanent nature of the body which causes the sensations
Once we have acquired the skill of feeling these sensations while we are engaged in daily activities we would do well to keep some degree of awareness of the anicca feelings or of anapana awake all the time
Then no matter how difficult or how boring or how exhausting be the tasks that we are faced with we will find that we have a relatively equanimous and balanced mind with which to face them because we will be alternating mindmoments of mindfulness and wisdom relating to the ultimate nature of our mindandbody with the mindmoments that are of necessity fully engaged in the mundane work at hand
Meditators engaged in contemplating the feelings who have practiced the technique for some time find that this mindfulness of the sensations which are caused by the continual flux that is the nature of the body keeps them in a balanced and detached frame of mind in all kinds of trying situations  and certainly work experiences can sometimes be difficult enough to make it well worth our while to develop the skill of keeping the mindfulness of anicca always with us
Concentration the last of the samadhi section of the Path obviously is vital to anyone in any task he attempts
The meditator will find that vipassana has enhanced his onepointedness and this skill will be applied in all the spheres of life including work
But he must be sure that even at work this concentration is not rooted in strong craving or illwill otherwise the meditator may fall into the trap of squandering pure Dhamma for material gain by using the enhanced concentration without the other aspects of the Path sila and pañña to balance it
Naturally it is always useful to keep one's mind clearly focused on the job at hand  if the mind is constantly running off in various directions toward irrelevant objects our work will be slowed down and perhaps inadequately completed
As the mind is trained in vipassana meditation to be detached from not distracted by the pleasure and pains of the senses we will find that when we are working we will have less and less difficulty concentrating on what has to be done at this time and tend to worry less about the past or future
This does not mean that we do not plan our purchases or work schedule or ignore the future implications of decisions taken now
We do all these kinds of activities we make all needed choices and decisions but once such action has been taken the mind settles back down into the job of the present without being hampered and held back by worries about the past or fears of the future
An artist or mechanic or craftsman is much better at his creating if his concentration is clear and his mind stays firmly with the materials at hand
A doctor's or lawyer's understanding of his client's situation will be correspondingly increased as his concentration on what the client describes is improved  he cannot practice his profession at all without a fair amount of concentration
Certainly all kinds of teaching and learning depend on onepointedness of mind
A merchant or farmer or businessman will be much better equipped to solve the difficulties of his work if he can carefully concentrate on all aspects of the problems at hand distinguish relevant from tangential issues and sort out appropriate solutions
Concentration is one of the mental factors that is present in any mindmoment but the degree to which it is developed varies considerably between individuals
A vipassana meditator generally has a welldeveloped faculty of concentration due to his mental training and if he puts this ability to appropriate use in the workplace he will in this way gain mundane benefits from his meditation
The remaining sections of the Noble Eightfold Path fall into the category of wisdom
Sammaditthi Right Understanding or Right View means the ability to see things as they are in their true nature by penetrating through the apparent truth
This means understanding the anicca dukkha and anatta nature of all phenomena mental and physical that is their impermanency unsatisfactoriness and egolessness
This understanding should be applied to everyday life  including our work
Right Understanding also requires a basic understanding of the Four Noble Truths  of Suffering its Cause its Cessation further of the Law of Kamma or moral cause and effect and the Doctrine of Dependent Origination
By means of Right Thought sammasankappa the remaining PathandWisdomfactor one considers all that happens in life with a mind that is free of greed and of hatred
For this discussion of the Noble Eightfold Path in the work situation it is not necessary to separate Right Thought from Right Understanding as without one the other could not exist in such situations
To apply wisdom at work means always trying to keep the mind equanimous and detached while it is engaged in the necessary mundane activities and interaction with other people
So if the boss gets annoyed and shouts at us we remind ourselves that he is at that moment suffering and generating more suffering for himself
We try to do the right thing if he is pointing out a reasonable fault and in any case we attempt to send him metta and not let anger arise in reaction to his sparks
Whenever a businessman or professor or other professional gets so involved in his work that it occupies his mind all the time keeping it scheming up more plans or solving problems without rest or even time for meditation he is acting on the basis of ignorance not of wisdom
He has forgotten that all the phenomena he is dealing with are primarily operating according to laws of cause and effect and that his own will and decisions can only do one part of any job the remainder is beyond his control
One is not seeing anatta the egoless nature of external phenomena if he develops tremendous craving for the results of his work
Anicca change and decay is inherent in all phenomena but we often slip into ignorance of this factor and unreasonably try to prolong favorable business conditions or consider our resources infinite or get attached to any particular situation
If we forget the Four Noble Truths at work especially the First and Second  dukkha and tanha as the cause of dukkha  we will be continuing to generate more and more unhappiness for ourselves as our craving grows in intensity
Job situations especially since they involve money are very likely to bring up the strong conditioning for craving we all have from the past and if this desire is not observed with wisdom we will be continually digging deeper mental ruts that will inevitably lead to future misery
To avoid this we have to train our minds to see how no situation however apparently pleasant it may seem to be is actually desirable because no situation can last all are anicca the state of craving is itself one of unhappiness and all craving must lead in the direction of future dukkha
And of course the opposite situation in which the mind reacts with aversion to the circumstances be they workrelated or otherwise is precisely the same  both clinging and aversion are tanha
If the market for our product is favorable at present if our superiors are pleased with our work if we are getting good grades at the university or if any other pleasant situation arises in the course of our work we would do well to recall that this situation too is unsatisfactory
Pleasant experiences bring dukkha because they cannot last forever and any mind which still has conditioning of tanha and avijja will try to cling to what it likes striving to perpetuate the pleasant feelings
If we keep the First and Second Noble Truths in mind when we encounter both happy and unhappy states on the job our minds will be able to remain detached and calm and perfectly equanimous  the only kind of happiness that can endure  no matter what vicissitudes we have to face
At any moment we may run into material gain or loss be famous or infamous receive praise or blame experience happiness or pain
But if the mind remains free from clinging if it has seen dukkha in all craving then none of this can really touch us and we are sure of inner peace no matter what the outer circumstances may be
Recalling the law of cause and effect cultivating this aspect of pañña at work is quite important and useful
To create good kamma the mind has to try to remain free of clinging and aversion so we have to keep a close watch on our reactions if we are not to prolong the misery of samsara
We should not however expect that just because we have thought of this and are trying to keep ourselves away from tanha that this freedom will easily come about  this would be forgetting the anatta egolessness nature of the mind
Only gradually can we recondition the mind to operate in channels based on wisdom by reminding ourselves whenever we notice an unwholesome reaction that such actions lead only to dukkha and that nothing at all is worth getting attached to or developing aversion toward
In this way over a long period of time we will notice how the force of our reactions does diminish
So when our superior yells at us and we in turn get angry we just note the reaction and the sensations that arise see their foolishness and as soon as we can just let go of them
If a business deal is pending and we are getting more and more tense about it as the days go by we may not be able to just give up the tension but if we observe how this particular conditioning of the mind is happening with some part of the mind detached and with the sensations we are no longer reinforcing the tension sankharas and so the next time they arise they will be weaker
Becoming impatient with the unwholesome tendencies of the mind cannot change them and in fact this would be generating more unwholesome tendencies of a slightly different sort
If the aversion to work keeps coming up never mind just observe that too with the anicca sensations and slowly it will decrease in frequency and intensity
Pañña can and must be applied in all situation
It may not be as powerfully clear as when we are meditating but if we neglect it during the part of the day while at work we are not living by the totality of the Path and without trying to understand all the situations of life in their ultimate nature we cannot expect to progress toward the goal of liberation from all suffering
When we have undertaken the task of removing all the causes of suffering  which is what it means to be a serious vipassana meditator  we have committed ourselves to a fulltime job
To grow in the wisdom that can remove dukkha one must at all times try to practice all the aspects of the Noble Eightfold Path
This is the Way taught by the Buddha that enables us to find for ourselves real and lasting peace and happiness
When we are engaged in our mundane work of earning a livelihood we must be sure to keep our sila as pure as possible
Vipassana meditation will have increased our samadhi and we must be sure that it is Right Concentration we apply on the job along with balanced Effort
Mindfulness of the true nature of the external experiences and internal phenomena we come into contact with when working must be kept alive
And finally pañña Right Understanding and Right Thought must be developed with respect to our relationships with our coworkers the various conditions at the workplace and the functioning of our minds while engaged in earning a livelihood
As we practice the Noble Eightfold Path and live the life of a laydisciple of the Buddha meditating while working and living in society we will find ourselves growing in Dhamma while simultaneously serving all those we come into contact with in some fashion or the other
And just this is the essence of the Dhamma life  to eradicate the causes of one's own suffering by purifying the mind and with the mind thus freed of greed hatred and ignorance full of metta and compassion help others in their own quest for real happiness
MAY ALL BEINGS BE PEACEFUL
What does it feel like when one has fairly recently embarked on a course of Buddhism
The answers will vary a great deal no doubt but there ought to be some general characteristics and some problems common to the majority of newborn Buddhists in the West
Let us assume that you are a person who has quite recently or within the last year or so begun to take Buddhism seriously as a personal way of life
You may by now be just looking round a bit in your new mental surroundings and trying to take stock of what has happened now that the first novelty of the situation has worn off
You have I sincerely hope tried to do a bit of meditation though it would not surprise me in the least to hear that you have found this difficult and disappointing
If so I would like to tell you straight away that you should not be discouraged
This is quite the normal thing
Meditation may seem disappointing and even almost useless for quite a long time but if you persevere in it results are bound to come
But these results may not be at all the sort of thing you expect
And you may not even be the person who first becomes aware of them
So press on regardless and don't look for results
If you can see the point of this piece of advice you have already in fact made useful progress
Insights often come very subtly
People's motives for taking up Buddhism may vary a great deal on the surface
But fundamentally you have probably come to it because in one way or another it seems to promise you security
If you haven't realized before that this was a good part of your motive you might usefully use your next meditation period trying to find out whether I was right or not
If you have realized this then you may agree that you find the formula I go to the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha for refuge strangely comforting
And so it should be in one way even though fundamentally you have to learn to be a refuge unto yourself This is perhaps the first of the many paradoxes you will encounter attempting to tread the Buddhist path
Now if we consider this problem of security a little further we soon find that we do indeed crave for it
The obvious reason is that we feel life frankly unnerving in fact because insecure
Here then we find straight away two of the three Marks of Existence all things are marked by impermanence and suffering
Because they  and we  are impermanent they are frustrating and cause us all kinds of anguish
Buddhism offers a way out of this situation by treading the Noble Eightfold Path
I am assuming that having taken the first step you are now familiar with the Four Noble Truths and the steps of this Path
So I just want to mention a few points which may arise at this stage
The first step of the path is known as Right Understanding or Right View
This is seeing things as they are
There are large areas of experience which we would much rather know nothing about
This is the origin of repression to use a Freudian term which is misleadingly translated
The German for repression in the psychoanalytical sense is Verdrangung thrusting away It is really successful selfdeception
Getting rid of our repressions is therefore not doing what we like as seems to be popularly imagined but ceasing to deceive ourselves
Fundamentally Buddhism is just a technique of selfundeception
This is not easy though sometimes it may be fun
It needs some study of theory as well as practice
It is perfectly true that you never gain enlightenment by intellectual knowledge alone but if you haven't studied the theory to some extent you will almost certainly never be able to start properly on the practice
Before you can develop your intuition you must know what it is  or at least what it isn't  and selfdeception in this respect seems to come terribly easy to many people
Intuition or as I much prefer to call it insight is not an emotion but the best way to develop it is by getting to know one's emotions as thoroughly as possible
When these emotions have been really seen for what are they no longer stand in the light
Now the biggest emotional blockage we have is that which surrounds the egoidea
Since it is to the ultimate elimination of this idea that the whole Buddhist training is directed it may be as well to have a good look at it
In so doing we may get a shock
By the ego in Buddhism we mean of course the concept of I am though this is much more a feeling than a purely intellectual concept  which is the very reason why it is so much more difficult to uproot
From the psychological point of view we must take it to include not only what in Freudian terms is called the ego but also the id and even the superego
Though not wholly adequate the Freudian conception goes a good way toward giving us the basic idea
This ego of ours is a complex and dynamic set of functions which are not by any means all conscious or under any form of normal conscious control
Its nature is in fact blind ignorance and it fights desperately to maintain that ignorance
It is most important for us to realize from the outset that this is the case because this is the rootcause of all our troubles
The three unhealthy roots of human nature are greed hatred and ignorance and all our suffering is due to these three
Ignorance is the most fundamental and greed and hate spring from it
Now the power of ignorance is broken by knowledge which is seeing correctly
So all we have to do is to learn to see
AVIDYA unwitting or not seeing is no mere passive principle  it is an active force which opposes discovery of the truth at every turn
No need to look for an external devil the Father of Lies is within every one of us
We all know the story of the Emperor's new clothes
In Buddhism the precise opposite of this situation occurs the clothes go walking in the procession but there's no emperor inside them
The whole show is laid on for the honor and glory of a character who doesn't really exist
Here then is our second paradox and it is certainly no less startling than the first one the ego is the most ruthlessly gluttonous alldevouring monster there is and yet really all the time there's no such thing
All its activities without exception are simply a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing How can we solve this riddle
How can we ever come to grasp the nature of this peculiar monster that has no mouth and no belly yet gobbles up the entire world
Clearly there must be a sense in which the self exists and another sense in which it doesn't
Let us first of all have a frank look at it in the sense of something existing
It is not a pretty sight
Underneath all our lofty ideals our pious thoughts and holy aspirations we are all alike
Our little personal petty self is the really important thing to us
It is out to grab all it can get whether in the way of affection and admiration and sympathy or of more apparently tangible satisfactions in the way of sex money power nice things to eat and drink and smell and touch and hear  all sorts of things and it doesn't care in the very least how it gets them
We don't all want  at least consciously  all of these things perhaps but we usually want a lot of credit for not wanting some of them or at least doing without them even if by necessity rather than choice
All these are aspects of greed including the last which is of course conceit
They are the things the ego fattens on
Equally impressive and perhaps even more horrifying is the list of items under the heading of hate we are all capable in our minds of murderous rage sadism treachery and disloyalty of every conceivable kind
Until we have found and identified the seeds of all these things in our own hearts we cannot claim to have made much progress in selfknowledge
Of course most of us will never yield to such impulses which may only be very faint but until a higher stage of development has been reached they will not be totally eliminated as tendencies
The most likely way in which they may find some outward expression will be perhaps in the form of overemotive indignation at the acts of hate committed by somebody else
What can we do about this situation
First face it
Second penetrate to its roots
Buddhism is not something airyfairy or romantic it is practical
It is first and last something to do
To penetrate to the roots of greed hatred and delusion is not very easy and it requires certain methods or techniques
But the great thing is to keep going at and not be diverted by irrelevancies interesting bypaths plausible excuses or pseudomystical fantasies born of conceit and ignorance
A certain discipline is required in fact
This can be summed up in one word  restraint
Restraint is not repression
In its simplest form it can be something as apparently easy as sitting still
It is just not automatically yielding to every impulse that arises while not on the other hand pretending that that impulse does not exist
A good part of Buddhism in modern terms is salesresistance cultivating at least a degree of immunity to the appeals of the outside world which are today constantly attempting quite deliberately and purposefully to arouse new desires within us
It is being deaf to the blandishments of the hidden persuaders whether from within or without or better perhaps hearing them without reacting
Who is the rich man who like the camel cannot pass through the eye of the needle
He is not only the millionaire the expenseaccount johnnie the takeover charlie he is anybody who has too many mental encumbrances too many wants
Here then is an exercise sit down with a straight back for ten minutes resolved not to make a single voluntary bodily movement during that time and just observe what happens
You may get some surprises but whatever happens you are bound to learn something
If you find as will probably be the case that a lot of thoughts and mental images arise try to discover where they come from to catch them at the very moment of arising
You won't succeed easily but you will begin to see something of the mechanism of desires and emotions and this is immensely valuable
Perhaps the most widespread meditational practice in all schools of Buddhism is anapanasati or mindfulness of breathing
Just watch the ebb and flow of your breath without interfering and as far as you can manage with undivided attention
This is the surest way to achieve calm concentration selfknowledge and insight
There is no Buddhism worthy of the name without practice but study is also required
This is especially so in the West where we have not the background of Buddhist thought which exists in Eastern countries
We have to learn as adults what Eastern people have absorbed from childhood
The study of Buddhist theory should therefore not be neglected
Those who deny its necessity do so usually out of conceit laziness or ignorance  or a combination of all three
The obvious problem which arises here is Where shall I start There are many schools of Buddhism and their scriptures even those readily available in English are voluminous
There is Theravada and Mahayana in the form of Zen Tibetan Buddhism and several other varieties
There are numerous books about most of them
Unguided and indiscriminate reading will only lead to mental indigestion
The obvious thing is to get down to basics
If we ask where these basic principles are set out the answer is in the Pali Canon of the Theravada school
In fact the seeds of all later socalled Mahayana developments are there in this basic Buddhism
The only reason why some people find Theravada Buddhism apparently unsatisfying is its seemingly negative approach
In the Mahayana schools there is greater explicit stress on two things compassion and the higher wisdom
But we need not worry
Compassion grows inevitably as one trains oneself in Buddhism and the higher wisdom cannot be gained until the lower wisdom has been developed
It is to this task that the basic training is directed
Before we can begin to grasp the nature of Reality which is transcendental we must first grasp the nature of the mundane the phenomenal world as our senses present it to us
This basically means knowing ourselves
Knowing ourselves means facing our own insecurity
Recognizing the equal insecurity of others is compassion
Why do we feel so insecure
If we can answer this question we are on the right track
It is due to our recognition that all things are transient
We seek to achieve a stability in the world which by the very nature of things cannot be
But Buddhism teaches us more than this all things are not only transient they are empty This applies to our precious selves as much as to anything else
Man said the Buddha is a mere compound of five things the five khandhas or aggregates
He has a physical body feelings perceptions emotional reactions and consciousness
None of these constitutes any sort of a self which is permanent and unchanging nor is there any such thing outside of them
His consciousness is just a series of states of awareness conditioned by the other factors reaching back into a limitless past
All we are actually aware of is the present moment or rather consciousness is just that awareness
There is no separate entity behind it which is aware
In the jargon of some modern philosophers everything about man is contingent or adjectival not substantival
The further implications of this must be left for study and meditation but this is a fundamental principle of all Buddhism
The search for a self behind all this is futile
If you don't believe this you can try to take up the Buddha's challenge and find it
There may well be a strong feeling of resistance to the acceptance of this point
If so this feeling itself should be very carefully examined
It is the basis of our habitual egoreactions
We want so badly to have a self and we expend a vast amount of energy in trying to build one up and support it in every way we can think of
That fundamentally is why we feel insecure in the world
One could usefully devote a good deal of time meditating on this point alone
The most notable contribution made to psychology by Alfred Adler was his analysis of the inferiority complex
People who for one reason or another feel inferior says Adler tend to overcompensate and present an appearance of conceit and aggressiveness
Since Adler's psychology is very much one of social adaptation at not perhaps a very profound level he did not pursue this idea as far as he might have done
But as far as it goes it is quite good Buddhism though we might prefer to rename his complex the insecurity complex We might even go so far as to say that for the Buddhist everybody's ego practically consists of an inferiority or insecurity complex for such an assumption certainly explains a great deal
Every form of ostentation we may indulge in is a way of bolstering up the ego whether in cruder or subtle form
The large car which seems designed as wide as possible is as much an example of egoboosting as the padded shoulders worn by the tough indeed the resemblance is sometimes striking
Of course the compensation for insecurity may take a reverse form of exaggerated modesty and simpering sweetness or of unnecessary and slightly ostentatious selfsacrifice
This latter is a form of compensation we may choose when all else fails and it has the advantage of making us feel very holy
Martyrdom is in fact the last consolation of a disappointed ego
And the hallmark of a person who has really gone far in the conquest of self is genuine unobtrusiveness
The formula of Dependent Origination shows by selecting twelve prominent factors how it is that we go round and round the weary circle of rebirths and how karma operates
It is not a simple formula of causation but rather of conditioning
Ignorance is a necessary condition for our being here  hence if we were not ignorant we would not have been reborn
And birth is a necessary condition for death  if we had never been born we could not die
Thus too feeling based on senseimpression is a necessary condition for the arising of craving if there were no such feeling there would be no craving
But we can stop the craving from arising or at least prevent its developing into grasping
This is the point at which karma comes into play
Karma is volitional activity born of desire and as such produces pleasant or unpleasant results in the future
Whatever condition of body and mind we happen to be in now is due to our past karma it is vipaka or karmaresultant
In accordance with the vipaka we are liable to act in the future but if we have understanding we can control our future actions and thus their future effects
The aim of Buddhist training of whatever school is to break away from the cycle of becoming
This means somehow attaining the Transcendental Reality which is not karmabound and therefore permanent secure and free from suffering
We do not as unenlightened individuals know what this is at best we have a vague intuition of something wholly other
Its true nature is hidden from us by the veils of our ignorance
The state of enlightenment is called Nirvana which is be it noted selfless
This means that we cannot grasp it as long as the selfconcept is operative
It is beyond the realm of duality which is that of subject and object or self and otherthanself
Probably most people have at times had a feeling while in the normal sense wide awake as if really they were dreaming and would soon wake up
This is actually quite true as far as the first part is concerned
Life as we know it is in one sense a dream
The Buddha was the Awakened One and our normal state is perhaps somewhere about halfway between ordinary sleep and true enlightenment or wakefulness
We can therefore usefully regard the Buddhist training if we like as a way of making ourselves wake up
Sometimes in sleep we become aware of being asleep and want to wake up
Eventually we succeed but it is often a struggle
The struggle to wake up to enlightenment is far greater than this because the resistance is stronger
The resistance is stronger for a very simple reason to the ego it seems like death
This is fair enough since in fact it is the death of ego
And since we have no real experience of the egoless state it is unimaginable and therefore we are skeptical about it but this skepticism too really springs from fear
We should have to give up all our attachments to attain it and that is too high a price to pay
We are like the rich young man to whom Christ said Sell all that thou hast and give it to the poor He went sorrowfully away
What then must we do now that we have taken the first step and embarked on the course of Buddhism
We need to have a chart and compass to help us on our way
But first we have to know where we are supposed to be going
The goal of Buddhism is Enlightenment or Awakening or Nirvana the Deathless State which is the end of all suffering and frustration the one permanent and supremely desirable thing
Buddhism claims to be a way of attaining this
There are five factors to be developed which if they are predominant in our minds will tend increasingly to bring us to the goal
They are Faith Energy Mindfulness Concentration and Wisdom
The first of these may come as a surprise to some people
I thought they may say you didn't have to have faith in Buddhism In fact faith is an important factor to develop
We can call it confidence or trust if we prefer it
But unless we have some confidence that there is such a goal as Nirvana we shall not even start taking Buddhism seriously at all and we need also to trust the Buddha as the teacher who has shown the way to reach that goal
At the very least we need to be free from the sort of nihilistic skepticism which is so common today and which prevents us from believing wholeheartedly in anything worthwhile
When we say I take refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha we are expressing faith in the Teaching and the Order of monks who have preserved it and handed it on
If we have faith we next need to put forth effort so we need energy
Right Effort is a step of the Eightfold Path
It means getting rid of wrong states of mind and developing right ones
Clearly a certain amount of vigor is required to do this and faith will strengthen our will to persevere
Clearing up our mental muddle calls for increased selfknowledge and this is gained by Mindfulness
Mindfulness is being aware of one's own nature and observing one's own reactions being fully cognizant of what one is about all the time
It is developed by training such exercises as mindfulness on breathing and on walking being especially beneficial
With full mindfulness selfdeception becomes impossible
It is the way of uncovering the subterfuges of the ego
The Buddha described it as the one and only way to the liberation of beings
It is an absolutely indispensable factor in all Buddhist training
Being mindful one is too in some degree automatically concentrated but the practice of mental concentration can be carried further to samadhi which is mental onepointedness
By a combination of these two factors the mind can be sharpened to an instrument capable of cutting through the veils of egocreated illusion
The last of the five factors is Wisdom
Wisdom in this connection means discernment
It includes investigation of all mental phenomena to their essence which is voidness
When this lower still mundane wisdom has been sufficiently developed a basis has been created for the arising of the higher InsightWisdom the perfection of which is Enlightenment
When this has been attained the job is done
But these factors must be developed in such a manner that they are properly balanced
Faith must be balanced with Wisdom and Energy with Concentration
Faith without Wisdom can overreach itself and turn into that kind of blind faith which Buddhism does not encourage
On the other hand Wisdom without Faith is sterile
Energy unaccompanied by Concentration can easily lead to restlessness while Concentration without sufficient Energy leads to sloth
It is the function of Mindfulness by watching over the other factors to see that the proper balance between them is maintained
These five factors are called indriyas or ruling factors This means that they can and should dominate the mind and give it direction
They are the five guides to keep us on the way
Having taken the first step and with these as guides but especially under the leadership of Mindfulness let us walk on
One way of regarding the Buddhist training is to consider it under the aspect of detachment
Detachment is one of those simple things which we discover to be very profound and in its higher stages intensely difficult
By becoming progressively more detached one gradually penetrates to the heart of Buddhism
Its importance is repeatedly stressed under various aspects throughout the whole range of the Buddhist scriptures
For instance in the formula describing how one enters the first jhana Detached from sensual objects O monks detached from unwholesome states of mind the monk enters into first jhana which is accompanied by initial and sustained application is born of detachment and filled with rapture and joy The second jhana is then said to be born of concentration We thus see that detachment is a prerequisite for all concentration
The calm and concentrated mind is the detached mind
While this is obvious enough when we stop to think about it it may help us to realize why it is that even in purely mundane matters we so often fail to concentrate our minds
We all know the picture of the man with furiously knitted brows and a wet towel round his head who is desperately trying to concentrate on some problem
Of course he usually fails
The reason surely is not far to seek he is going about it precisely the wrong way
He is not detached
He is in fact very much attached
He may be detached from senseobjects for the moment but not from unwholesome states of mind
His state of mind is probably dominated by uddhaccakukkucca restlessness and worry and so long as this remains the case he will probably get nowhere with his problem
His body too reflecting this mental tension is probably tense and strained
He should first try to relax physically as well as mentally and then he might make some progress
At this point perhaps we might pause to consider an objection which is not infrequently made to the cultivation of detachment
There are people who positively regard it as morally wrong to be detached
One should not they say become detached and aloof from life but should be actively involved in it  engage as the French say
For them detachment is the equivalent of that opprobrious term we used to hear so much about  escapism Their argument is of course a very simple one there is so much evil in the world of one kind or another that it is our job to go out and fight it
Now I am not going to argue that such people  let us call them as a generic term crusaders as opposed to introspectives  do not on occasion do a lot of good
A society which has a few dedicated crusaders is certainly in its mundane way healthier than one that discourages or represses their activities
They often succeed in abolishing or at least reducing much genuine evil
Let us take off our hats to them and perhaps even on occasion join or support them
But let us also consider their position a little more closely
Why does the average crusader function as he does  irrespective of the particular cause he elects to take up
What really makes him tick
The answer to this question may put the whole matter in a rather different light
Most of our crusader friends whether they go in for party politics or for other similar perhaps semipolitical causes they believe in are convinced that they do so out of love for their fellowbeings whether human or animal
In part this is certainly true
They do passionately want to help the poor the sick the oppressed the suffering
Yet in fact their motives are usually not quite as pure as they themselves honestly believe them to be
The key to the situation lies I think in the word passionately They are under the sway of emotions not all of which are in the Buddhist view entirely healthy
Conceit often plays a large if probably quite unconscious part
And surprisingly often too they are really moved far more by hate than by lovingkindness
Hatred even of the oppressor or the criminal is not really the right motive because it is not grounded in the right view
I am not seeking to disparage these people or belittle their efforts but merely to elucidate something of their attitude in the context of my theme which is detachment
So let us take a concrete example one where I was and remain wholeheartedly in agreement with their aims
In Britain we have abolished capital punishment rightly I believe though the increase in crime in recent years has led to demands for its reintroduction
Those who campaign for this even claim to be in the majority though I doubt if this is true and I certainly do not share their viewpoint
They too are crusaders and their reaction is certainly an emotional one
They really seek without knowing it a safe or legitimate outlet for their own aggression
These emotions are in turn rooted in their own basic feelings of insecurity
The trouble is of course that such emotions as these when held collectively are always much worse than when merely held by and individual not only on account of being multiplied but because of being at a more primitive level
It is possible though I hope and believe unlikely that pressures for the reintroduction of capital punishment in Britain will build up again to a serious point
Should this be the case those who wish to oppose such a trend will need to be very careful indeed of their own state of mind
They must not let themselves be trapped in an opposite emotional reaction
They will need to find a way of reducing the buildup of emotional tension so that in a calmer atmosphere wiser counsels may have a chance to prevail
Emotional appeals would anyway in such a situation probably be useless since the stronger emotions would be ranged on the other side
If you want in fact to abolish capital punishment you must not want to hang the executioner
Supporters of capital punishment often claim that its opponents show too much sympathy for the murderer and not enough for his victim
It does not seem too much to ask that a Buddhist  or a Christian  should be able to feel compassion for both and even for the hangman as well for he is certainly not creating much good karma for himself
I am not at all arguing that a Buddhist should necessarily and always stand aloof from such campaigns as the  now  rather theoretical one mentioned
I am arguing that whatever he does he should know his own true motives his real emotional reasons for either acting or not acting
I would also suggest that it is truly necessary for society as a whole as for the individual concerned that there should be those who in fact keep aloof from the current problems that happen to agitate the world at any moment
It is not for our crusading friends to disparage those who are genuinely detached
If the crusader for say capital punishment is a victim of his own unresolved aggression and insecurity how often is not his opponent in virtually the same case
A slight shift in viewpoint or circumstances and sometimes the roles are even reversed
The reformer looks around him and sees something wrong in society
This is usually not difficult as there are plenty of things wrong with most societies and it may be almost a matter of chance what particular evil or abuse he happens to pick on
What does he do then
He becomes what is significantly called an agitator
Now you can only agitate others if you yourself are agitated
What has really happened to our wouldbereformer is that his own emotions having been suitably stirred up he feels it his duty to go out and stir up the emotions of other people
I know
I have gone through this phase myself
If you suggest to him that he should first calm his own emotions he is aggrieved thereby developing some more agitation
He will probably tell you that this is the easy way out and he may even admit that in any case he doesn't know how to do it  thereby incidentally contradicting the notion that it is easy Of course if you can get him that far it may be possible to indicate to him the contradiction involved
If he cannot help himself to that extent how can he expect to be able to help others
Even in the field of Buddhism there are those who seem to think they can become Bodhisattvas and liberate all beings without first liberating themselves
They should take to heart the words of the great Zen patriarch Huineng who told his pupils to deliver an infinite number of sentient beings of our own mind
Let us leave worldproblems now and turn to the problem of our own minds
What is it that we have to get detached from
In a sense of course it is from the outside world
That at least is how it seems to us
Let us not get involved in a metaphysical discussion about whether there really is an outside world or not
In point of fact from the standpoint of the Buddhist training it scarcely matters whether there is or not
Perhaps we just project the whole thing from some mysterious inner center
In any case what we have to get rid of is our excessive preoccupation with it  that is to say with the things of the senses
What actually happens is this we have an unsatisfactory feeling in the only place we can have it  within ourselves
This feeling may take many forms but whatever its precise nature or mode of manifesting it is something unpleasant ie what in Buddhism is known as dukkha
It may be quite vague in character but we feel it somehow nevertheless
We therefore look out into the world either to see what it is out there that is supposedly causing this dukkha or to help us forget it by grasping at something which we assume to be pleasant
The result in either case is not really very satisfying because we are not even looking in the right direction
Both the origin of dukkha and ensuring its continuance
But creatures of habit as we are we are strongly conditioned to look outside and indeed nature has equipped us to looking outside with some remarkably efficient senseorgans for doing so
With our outwardturned senses we can do various things about the world we see and hear smell taste and touch
We can try to grasp something outside and extract enjoyment from it
We can try to alter what we see in some way to make it conform more to our idea of what it ought to be like
Or we can vent our illtemper on it in a fit of destructiveness
There is a lot of this sort of senseless destructiveness about nowadays
There always has been really but we have now made it a special problem the problem of modern youth The truth is simply that modern youth has in some ways rather more opportunities for being destructive than is it used to have
This is due in large measure to the nature and values of the society we live in a society which has developed more efficient means of destruction than were ever dreamed of before
The fact that it has also developed more wealth and therefore more means of apparent enjoyment available to more people than ever before does not seem to have done very much to reduce the general feeling of dissatisfaction each one of us has deep down inside
All this of course goes a long way toward confirming the Buddhist analysis of the situation that the origin of this is suffering this dukkha lies in craving
Our society is built up all along the line
We accordingly have the simultaneous picture of more and more people craving for more and more things and quite often getting them and of both society and individuals showing more and more taste for bigger and bigger forms of motiveless destruction
Greed and hate in fact are perhaps more nakedly at work in our society than ever before
That means that they are at work in every one of us and they can only be dealt with in and by each one of us individually
Greed and hate arise from ignorance from not understanding not seeing the true situation as it really is
The individual is a microcosm of society and each one of us reflects this situation in some form individually
Now it may be very dreadful but so far nobody has found a way whereby society can collectively overcome its ignorance and set itself fundamentally to rights
Even the Buddha did not show a method of bringing this about  and if he couldn't find a way it is unlikely that anybody else will But for each individual there is a way
'Cease to do evil learn to do good
Purify your own mind that is the teaching of all Buddhas' And one of the prerequisites of purifying one's own mind is the cultivation of detachment
If we ask Detachment from what  the answer is from the five hindrances sensual craving and illwill sloth restless worry and indecision These are things we all know only too well and though their final conquest is difficult they are things we can detach our minds from temporarily with a little effort
The first two of these are obviously aspects of greed and hate
Probably we can see that there is a need to cut these down as much as possible
But if we fail to do so it may be at least in part because one of the other three hindrances is preventing us we may be too indolent or too excited or we may dither in a state of indecision and doubt
Now the trouble is that we may see quite clearly in a way that our emotions of say greed or hate or fear are overmastering us and yet feel quite unable to do anything about them
Then we probably dismiss the whole problem with the words Oh yes that's all very well but I just haven't got the willpower In fact it is just here that the value of detachment comes in
What we think of as failure of willpower may really be much more a failure of technique
Let us take the case of a man who as he thinks and as others probably also think cannot control his temper
The deeper reasons for this may be various but they will probably include some strong form of frustration or repression
It is not very difficult to see that the chances of gaining control of any situation are likely to be increased the more one understands the situation
Now what is called repression in psychology is really a thrusting away  in other words it is basically a refusal to see something a form of deliberate selfdeception
In order to gain insight into the situation we must have some willingness to understand it
So we need to realize here right at the outset that there is a form of clinging to ignorance
In order to cope with this there must be a degree of detachment  we must be able to regard the situation coolly and simply learn not to mind too much whatever it is we may be about to discover
We must be prepared to stop working on the old and foolish principle Where ignorance is bliss 'tis folly to be wise
It is possible that even this much of the chain of events may be fairly clear to us and yet we may still not feel able to go any further
Intellectual awareness of an emotional situation is not in itself enough though this does not mean it is of no use
It is just a preliminary stage and it should be strongly emphasized that progress is in stages
The desire for perfection at a single jump is just another obstacle born of impatience and conceit
It is not an allor nothing situation but a case of one step at a time Perhaps we have already laid a certain foundation on which progress can be made even without realizing it
For the man who has said to himself I haven't the will power to correct this fault has at least made one vital admission
He has in some measure accepted his own inadequacy  in fact he is too much aware of this
He has to learn that what he really lacks is not necessarily willpower as much as insight
The next step then is merely and simply to recognize this fact
It will prove more helpful than may at first appear
For in fact seeing ourselves as we are is the cure
The next step then is to find out why we do not already see ourselves as we are The answer is of course as already indicated that we don't want to that there is a clinging to ignorance
Why this should be so is perhaps after all not hard to see
To the person with normal eyesight physical blindness is a terrible thing
We can only too well imagine the feeling of helplessness and insecurity the blind person must suffer from
It is therefore not at all nice to think that though our physical eyes may be all right we suffer from mental blindness
So we prefer to be blind to the blindness
This is attachment to ignorance with a vengeance
No wonder it is frustrating for it is a terrible strain to keep up
Most of our unhealthy emotions are nothing but byproducts of this tension caused by deliberately keeping our mental eyes tight shut while all the time pretending they are wide open
Only the practice of mindfulness can help us here
What is mindfulness
There are professing Buddhists who are extremely vague about what mindfulness really is and there are even some who are so afraid of it that they go about telling themselves and others that it is not really necessary
In principle mindfulness is quite simple
It is just detached watching
Watching one's breathing is a method that suits practically everybody
First of all it brings calm which enables one to watch one's thoughts and emotions more easily and reduces the fear of what may come up  an important point sometimes
If mindfulness is pursued for a while some such experience as the following may occur a kind of unreal feeling may arise in which one seems to be aware of various emotional states without being fully involved in them
One may start thinking Am I really having this emotion or not
Am I somehow putting on an act What is really happening is that feelings are simply being experienced with detachment
And in such a state one can allow many things to come up to the surface which were previously repressed
But being detached one is not trapped by these emotional states and sees them as mere effects of past conditioning
And in this way they can be harmlessly dissolved
The interesting thing is that when such a situation is operative everything really seems to go on just as before with only one slight difference I am not fully in the situation
There may be even a distinct feeling of puzzlement as to precisely where I am anyway
Am I for instance the emotion or the watcher
Or neither or both
By following up this particular clue we may find that the practice leads us on further to a greater degree of understanding of the impersonality of all things  of our own fundamental egolessness in fact
The point is here simply that by becoming calm and detached we have so to speak accepted the unacceptable As a result of this practice we shall find a reduction in our own feeling of tension greater calm and most probably some increased insight into our own nature and the way things really work
We can now see the practical answer to our illtempered friend's problem
He cannot restrain his temper by willpower but by detached mindfulness he can gradually dissolve it
And the same applies of course to all our failings and weaknesses
But there is one form of attachment we must guard especially against because it makes the cure much more difficult
This is conceit
We all have conceit of course but if it is strong it is a particularly dangerous obstacle to progress
Conceit is really attachment to a false picture of the ego
Put negatively it is a refusal to accept oneself as one is
It may manifest in the feeling I cannot possibly have these weaknesses or I have overcome these weaknesses Combined with for instance sexual repression it may take the form of a sort of purity complex I am above all these horrid feelings of sex they no longer exist for me and the like
Perhaps this particular complex has become less common since greater openness on sexual matters has become usual
In any case it is clear that for a person who does have this kind of attitude the development of true detachment and hence mindfulness will be exceptionally difficult
We must not be ashamed to admit to ourselves that we possess our full share of all the normal human weaknesses
At this point there comes an interesting and subtle twist
You may say Yes I suppose that's true
But somehow there are a few things down there inside me which I just can't bring myself to face Now this is of course quite different from denying that they are there at all
It means in fact that repression ie selfdeception has not been completely successful
Now it may indeed be true that to face up fully to some of the contents of one's unconscious may be too hard to bear
It might be impossible to maintain detachment
Emotional involvement and perhaps even quite serious trouble might result
But there is still a way
What we can do is to accept honestly that precise situation There is a dark corner where I still dare not to look It is the mental equivalent of saying I have a sore place which I dare not touch The technique from then on is basically the same as before only at one remove
There is just a secondary emotion of fear to be dissolved before the primary situation which is the cause of that fear can be investigated
If that secondary fear is treated with the detachment we have used on other and less frightening emotions it too can be dissolved
Later we may even look back and wonder why it was that we ever feared to look in that particular dark corner
To sum up detachment is not a kind of selfish flight from the world but the necessary precondition for coping with the world
It is absolutely essential as a means of dealing with our own emotions
Nor is it in any way incompatible with charity or compassion  as indeed any doctor or nurse can tell you
It is no escapism as is sometimes alleged but its very opposite
The degree of physical detachment and withdrawal which the individual undertakes may vary considerably  obviously it will be much greater for the monk than for the average lay person
There can be no successful higher meditation without detachment from the things of the senses and it is an essential ingredient of Right Mindfulness
Incidentally it can even be quite fun
By being detached we can observe ourselves with ironic amusement
By so doing we may suddenly discover that some of the things about ourselves that we took with deadly seriousness are in fact extremely funny
In that way we may find that detachment actually enables us to enjoy our own dukkha
Dedicated to the memory of a great Buddhist Layman SF
de Silva 
Anicca Dukkha Anatta  Impermanence suffering and Egolessness  are the three essential characteristics of things in the Teaching of the Buddha
If you know Anicca correctly you will know Dukkha as its corollary and Anatta as ultimate truth
It takes time to understand the three together
Impermanence is of course the essential fact which must be first experienced and understood by practice
Mere bookknowledge of the BuddhaDhamma will not be enough for the correct understanding of Anicca because the experiential aspect will be missing
It is only through experiential understanding of the nature of Anicca as an everchanging process within you that you can understand Anicca in the way the Buddha would like you to understand it
As in the days of the Buddha so too now this understanding of Anicca can be developed by persons who have no bookknowledge whatsoever of Buddhism
To understand Impermanence one must follow strictly and diligently the Eightfold Noble Path which is divided into the three groups of Sila Samadhi and Pañña  Morality Concentration and Wisdom
Sila or virtuous living is the basis for Samadhi control of the mind leading to onepointedness
It is only when Samadhi is good that one can develop Pañña
Therefore Sila and Samadhi are the prerequisites for Pañña
By Pañña is meant the understanding of Anicca Dukkha and Anatta through the practice of Vipassana ie insight meditation
Whether a Buddha has arisen or not the practice of Sila and Samadhi may be present in the human world
They are in fact the common denominators of all religious faiths
They are not however sufficient means for the goal of Buddhism  the complete end of suffering
In his search for the end of suffering Prince Siddhattha the future Buddha found this out and worked his way through to find the path which would lead to the end of suffering
After solid work for six years he found the way out became completely enlightened and then taught men and gods to follow the Path which would lead them to the end of suffering
In this connection we should understand that each action  whether by deed word or thought  leaves behind an active force called Sankhara which goes to the credit or debit account of the individual according to whether the action is good or bad
There is therefore an accumulation of Sankhara with everyone which functions as the supplysource of energy to sustain life which is inevitably followed by suffering and death
It is by the development of the power inherent in the understanding of Anicca Dukkha and Anatta that one is able to rid oneself of the Sankhara accumulated in ones own personal account
This process begins with the correct understanding of Anicca while further accumulations of fresh actions and the reduction of the supply of energy to sustain life are taking place simultaneously from moment to moment and from day to day
It is therefore a matter of a whole lifetime or more to get rid of all one's Sankhara
He who has rid himself of all Sankhara comes to the end of suffering for then no Sankhara remains to give the necessary energy to sustain him in any form of life
On the termination of their lives the perfected saints ie the Buddhas and arahants pass into Parinibbana reaching the end of suffering
For us today who take to Vipassana Meditation it would suffice if we can understand Anicca well enough to reach the first stage of an Ariya that is a Sotapanna or streamenterer who will not take more than Seven lives to come to the end of suffering
The fact of Anicca which opens the door to the understanding of Dukkha and Anatta and eventually to the end of suffering can be encountered in its full significance only through the Teachings of a Buddha for so long as that Teaching relating to the Eightfold Noble Path and the ThirtySeven Factors of Enlightenment remains intact and available to the aspirant
For progress in Vipassana Meditation a student must keep knowing Anicca as continuously as possible
The Buddha's advice to monks is that they should try to maintain the awareness of Anicca Dukkha or Anatta in all postures whether sitting standing walking or lying down
Continuous awareness of Anicca and so of Dukkha and Anatta is the secret of success
The last words of the Buddha just before He breathed His last and passed away into Mahaparinibbana were Decay is inherent in all component things
Work out your own salvation with diligence This is in fact the essence of all His teachings during the fortyfive years of His ministry
If you will keep up the awareness of the Anicca that is inherent in all component things you are sure to reach the goal in the course of time
As you develop in the understanding of Anicca your insight into What is true of nature will become greater and greater so much so that eventually you will have no doubt whatsoever of the three characteristics of Anicca Dukkha and Anatta
It is then only that you will be in a position to go ahead for the goal in view
Now that you know Anicca as the first essential factor you would try to understand what Anicca is with real clarity as extensively as possible so as not to get confused in the course of practice or discussion
The real meaning of Anicca is that Impermanence or Decay is the inherent nature of everything that exists in the Universe  whether animate or inanimate
The Buddha taught His disciples that everything that exists at the material level is composed of Kalapas Kalapas are material units very much smaller than atoms which die out immediately after they come into being
Each kalapa is a mass formed of the eight basic constituents of matter the solid liquid calorific and oscillatory together with color smell taste and nutriment
The first four are called primary qualities and are predominant in a kalapa
The other four are subsidiaries dependent upon and springing from the former
A kalapa is the minutest particle in the physical plane  still beyond the range of science today
It is only when the eight basic material constituents unite together that the kalapa is formed
In other words the momentary collocation of these eight basic elements of behavior makes a man just for that moment which in Buddhism is known as a kalapa
The lifespan of a kalapa is termed a moment and a trillion such moments are said to elapse during the wink of a man's eye
These kalapas are all in a state of perpetual change or flux
To a developed student in Vipassana Meditation they can be felt as a stream of energy
The human body is not as it may appear a solid stable entity but a continuum of matter coexisting with mentality
To know that our very body is tiny kalapas all in a state of change is to know the true nature of change or decay
This change or decay occasioned by the continual breakdown and replacement of kalapas all in a state of combustion must necessarily be identified as Dukkha the truth of suffering
It is only when you experience impermanence as suffering that you come to the realization of the truth of suffering the first of the Four Noble Truths basic to the doctrine of the Buddha
Why
Because when you realize the subtle nature of Dukkha from which you cannot escape for a moment you become truly afraid of disgusted with and disinclined towards your very existence as mentalitymateriality and look for a way of escape to a state beyond Dukkha and so to Nibbana the end of suffering
What that end of suffering is like you will be able to taste even as a human being when you reach the level of sotapanna a streamenterer and develop well enough by practice to attain to the unconditioned state of Nibbana the Peace within
But even in terms of everyday ordinary life no sooner than you are able to keep up the awareness of Anicca in practice will you know for yourself that a change is taking place in you for the better both physically and mentally
Before entering upon the practice of Vipassana Meditation that is after Samadhi has been developed to a proper level a student should acquaint himself with the theoretical knowledge of material and mental properties ie of Rupa and Nama
For in Vipassana Meditation one contemplates not only the changing nature of matter but also the changing nature of mentality of the thoughtelements of attention directed towards the process of change going on within matter
At times the attention will be focused on the impermanence of the material side of existence ie upon Anicca in regard to Rupa and at other times on the impermanence of the thoughtelements or mental side ie upon Anicca in regard to Nama
When one is contemplating the impermanence of matter one realizes also that the thoughtelements simultaneous with that awareness are also in a state of transition or change
In this case one will be knowing Anicca in regard to both Rupa and Nama together
All I have said so far relates to the understanding of Anicca through bodily feelings of the process of change of Rupa or matter and also of thoughtelements depending upon such changing processes
You should know that Anicca can also be understood through other types of feeling as well
Anicca can be contemplated through feeling
Once can thus develop the understanding of Anicca through any of six sense organs
In practice however we have found that of all the types of feeling the feeling by contact of touch with the component parts of the body in a process of change covers the widest area for introspective meditation
Not only that the feelings by contact of touch with the component parts of the body is more evident than other types of feeling and therefore a beginner in Vipassana Meditation can come to the understanding of Anicca more easily through bodily feelings of the change of Rupa or matter
This is the main reason why we have chosen bodily feeling as a medium for quick understanding of Anicca
It is open to anyone to try other means but my suggestion is that one should be wellestablished in the understanding of Anicca through bodily feeling before any attempt is made through other types of feeling
There are ten levels of knowledge in Vipassana namely
Udayabbaya knowledge of the arising and dissolution of Rupa and Nama by direct observation
Bhanga knowledge of the rapidly changing nature of Rupa and Nama as a swift current or stream of energy in particular clear awareness of the phase of dissolution
Bhaya knowledge that this very existence is dreadful
Adinava knowledge that this very existence is full of evils
Nibbida knowledge that this very existence is disgusting
Muncitukamyata knowledge of the urgent need and wish to escape from this very existence
Patisankha knowledge of the fact that time has come to work with full realization for salvation with anicca as the base
Sankhara upekkha knowledge that the stage is now set to get detached from all conditioned phenomena and to break away from egocentricity
Anuloma knowledge that would accelerate the attempt to reach the goal
These are the levels of attainment which one goes through during the course of Vipassana Meditation in the case of those who reach the goal in a short time they can be known only in retrospect
Along with one's progress in understanding Anicca one may reach these levels of attainment subject however to adjustments or help at certain levels by a competent teacher
One should avoid looking forward to such attainments in anticipation as this will distract from the continuity of awareness of Anicca which alone can and will give the desired reward
Let me now deal with Vipassana Meditation from the point of view of a householder in everyday life and explain the benefit one can derive from it  here and now  in this very lifetime
The initial object of Vipassana Meditation is to activate the experience of Anicca in oneself and to eventually reach a state of inner and outer calmness and balance
This is achieved when one becomes engrossed in the feeling of Anicca within
The world is now facing serious problems which threaten all mankind
It is just the right time for everyone to take to Vipassana Meditation and learn how to find a deep pool of quiet in the midst of all that is happening today
Anicca is inside of everybody
It is within reach of everybody
Just a look into oneself and there it is  Anicca to be experienced
When one can feel Anicca when one can experience Anicca and when one can become engrossed in Anicca one can at will cut oneself off from the world of ideation outside
Anicca is for the householder the gem of life which he will treasure to create a reservoir of calm and balanced energy for his own wellbeing and for the welfare of the society
The experience of Anicca when properly developed strikes at the root of ones physical and mental ills and removes gradually whatever is bad in him ie the causes of such physical and mental ills
This experience is not reserved for men who have renounced the world for the homeless life
It is for the householder as well
In spite of drawbacks which make a householder restless in these days a competent teacher or guide can help a student to get the experience of Anicca activated in a comparatively short time
Once he has got it activated all that is necessary is for him to try and preserve it but he must make it a point as soon as time or opportunity presents itself for further progress to work for the stage of Bhangañana  the third level of knowledge in Vipassana
If he reaches this level there will be little or no problem because he should then be able to experience Anicca without much ado and almost automatically
In this case Anicca will become his base to which all his physical and mental activities return as soon as the domestic needs of daily life for such activities are over
However there is likely to be some difficulty for one who has not reached the stage of Bhanga
It will be just like a tugofwar for him between Anicca within and physical and mental activities outside
So it would be wise for him to follow the motto of work while you work play while you play
There is no need for him to be activating the experience of Anicca all the time
It should suffice if this could be confined to a regular period or periods set apart in the day or night for the purpose
During this time at least an attempt must be made to keep the attention focused inside the body with awareness devoted exclusively to Anicca that is to say his awareness of Anicca should go on from moment to moment so continuously as not to allow for the interpolation of any discursive or distracting thoughts which are definitely detrimental to progress
In case this is not possible he will have to go back to respirationmindfulness because Samadhi is the key to the contemplation of Anicca
To get good Samadhi Sila has to be perfect since Samadhi is build upon Sila
For a good experience of Anicca Samadhi must be good
If Samadhi is excellent awareness of Anicca will also become excellent
There is no special technique for activating the experience of Anicca other than the use of the mind adjusted to a perfect state of balance and attention projected upon the object of meditation
In Vipassana the object of meditation is Anicca and therefore in the case of those used to focusing their attention on bodily feelings they can feel Anicca directly
In experiencing Anicca in relation to the body it should first be in the area where one can easily get his attention engrossed changing the area of attention from place to place from head to feet and from feet to head at times probing into the interior
At this stage it must clearly be understood that no attention is to be paid to the anatomy of the body but to the formations of matter  the kalapas  and the nature of their constant change
If these instructions are observed there will surely be progress but the progress depends also on Parami and the devotion of the individual to the work of meditation
If he attains high levels of knowledge his power to understand the three characteristics of Anicca Dukkha and Anatta will increase and he will accordingly come nearer and nearer to the goal of the Ariya or noble saint which every householder should keep in view
This is the age of science
Man of today has no Utopia
He will not accept anything unless the results are good concrete vivid personal and hereandnow
When the Buddha was alive He said to the Kalamas
The timeclock of Vipassana has now struck  that is for the revival of BuddhaDhamma Vipassana in practice
We have no doubt whatsoever that definite results would accrue to those who would with an open mind sincerely undergo a course of training under a competent teacher  I mean results which will be accepted as good concrete vivid personal hereandnow results which will keep them in good stead and in a state of wellbeing and happiness for the rest of their lives
May all beings be happy and may Peace prevail in the world
Over the centuries Theravada Buddhist teachings have been preserved by and large in a monastic tradition
The requisite for the true practice has been the renunciation of worldly existence for a life behind walls or in the forest
Householders were left with the observances of morality almsgiving and worship to accrue merit for future lives when they could actually embark on the formal path to liberation
As the sutras themselves reveal however this was not the case at all when the Buddha was alive and preaching
Vast numbers of householders received the teaching and the practice as well and attained high levels of spiritual development
In the past few decades in the Theravada Buddhist countries there has been a general revival of interest in insight meditation among the robed Sangha and with it a spreading of the practice outside the monastery walls
This has in a sense revivified the whole outlook toward meditation practicalizing it in a way by focusing on two important aspects
First how can a man who does not have his entire life to devote to silence and contemplation approach meditation
And second what role can the meditative discipline play in worldly life
These problems were dealt with in great detail and with remarkable strength of imagination by one of the most important meditation masters of modern day Burma Thray Sithu U Ba Khin
He was well known within his country as an important Government servant for many years the Accountant General of the Union of Burma as well as the chairman of a number of important boards and commissions
At one time he held four such posts simultaneously was the father of six children and found the time to teach meditation at the International Meditation Center in Rangoon which was established under his guidance in the early s
The unique characteristics of his spiritual teaching stem from his situation as a lay meditation master in an orthodox Buddhist country
It was not appropriate for him to instruct monks so all of his practice was geared specifically to lay people
He developed a powerfully direct approach to Vipassana meditation that could be undertaken in a short period of intensive practice and continued as part of householding life
His method has been of great importance in the transmission of the Dhamma to the West because in his twenty five years at the Center he instructed scores of foreign visitors who needed no closer acquaintance with Buddhism per se to quickly grasp this practice of insight
Since U Ba Khin's demise in several of his commissioned disciples have carried on his work both within and outside of Burma
Hundreds of Westerners have received the instruction from SN
Goenka in India Robert Hover and Ruth Denison in America and John Coleman in England
In addition several of U Ba Khin's closest disciples still teach at the Center in Rangoon
What is the goal of Insight Meditation
And does it differ in any way for the man whose whole life is devoted to its practice and the man who earns a living and supports others
In the broadest sense there is no difference
The end of suffering is the goal
The experience of Nibbanic Peace within as U Ba Khin referred to it is the aim of the practice
But also the end of suffering each moment
Harmony between beings the end of internal tension the manifestation of lovingkindness the ability to perform one's daily tasks free from anger greed and anxiety
For the lay person and the monk it is the same
The way to proceed however differs at least at the outset
U Ba Khin understood that unlike the monk his students faced severe limitations of time to devote to their practice
Furthermore they had to function in a completely uncontrolled environment generally hostile to proper moral conduct and good concentration the requisites for insight
Thus he gave them a method that could withstand that pressure
In the short span of ten days most of his pupils could experience at least a glimpse of the reality within and continue expanding their awareness with two hours daily of formal meditation after they left the Center
This technique has three distinctive qualities to it
First is its emphasis on the development of sufficient onepointed concentration
Concerning this U Ba Khin wrote
 The Real Values of True Buddhist Meditation pp

The reason for the necessity of good concentration he felt was that with only a limited period of time available one's mind had to have a degree of penetrating power to really experience the inner reality on more than a conceptual level
He departed from the most traditional monastic view that concentration had to be developed to very high states requiring great time and isolation
But neither did he agree with the approach that began with little specific concentration training
He was interested in a sufficient level for the work of real insight
The second quality of his teaching was its focus on the characteristic of anicca impermanence
The Buddha described reality as having three marks or characteristics impermanence unsatisfactoriness and the absence of a real I or self
In the practice of mindfulness observance of just what is focusing the attention of these true marks of reality breaks down false view and weakens attachment U Ba Khin taught that the most direct access to understanding the process of life was through awareness of impermanence anicca
He felt that anicca is the most apparent and readily comprehensible of the three marks and that its understanding leads naturally to the others
So the observance of change or the alteration of all phenomenon at increasingly subtler levels was the real object of his Vipassana technique
The method itself was the systematic awareness of physical sensation in the body
As the Satipatthana Sutta of the Buddha makes clear the process of life is identical in every aspect of the mindbody continuum
Choose whichever you like and observe it closely enough and all of reality unfolds
U Ba Khin found that the unfolding is most dramatic and rapid in the physical sensation within the body
His students were directed to place their concentrated attention on that and become sensitive to the process of change observable in the tactile reaction of heat cold tingling pain numbness pressure or whatever was there
Simply observe the changing nature of the phenomenon within you he taught
Continued practice of the method as he points out in the following articles yields spiritual and worldly results as well
He maintained that a householder could enjoy the fruit of the Nibbanic experience in this lifetime
And he encouraged men not to be content with ritual practice of simple book knowledge of the teachings
In addition the practice as his disciple SN
Goenka terms it is an art of living
So convinced was U Ba Khin of the power of this method for clearing the mind that he insisted that all of his employees in the Accounts Department take a course of meditation from him and that a portion of the office be set aside for a meditation space
Mr
Robert Hover recounts the story that his teacher told him
Sometimes U Ba Khin attending particularly unfocused meetings of government with men of more biased minds would in the midst of heated argument rise from his chair and stand for some moments gazing out the window before returning to the conference table
His colleagues thought he was watching the world outside
In fact U Ba Khin explained he was busy within reestablishing mindfulness to deal with the demands of life

There are eight ways of giving
What eight
Spontaneously one gives or one gives out of fear or because of thinking 'He too has given me a gift' or because of thinking 'He will give me a present too' or because of thinking that it is good to give or because of thinking 'I cook but they do not since I cook it would not be proper for me to refuse giving to those who do not cook' or because of thinking 'By giving such a gift I shall earn a good reputation' or one gives because it ennobles the mind adorns the mind
There are eight reasons for giving
What eight
People may give out of affection or in an angry mood out of stupidity out of fear or because they think 'Such gifts have been given before by my father and grandfather and it was done by them before hence it will be unworthy of me to give up this old family tradition' or because of thinking 'By giving this gift I shall  after the body's breakup after death  be reborn in a happy realm of existence in a heavenly world' or because of thinking 'When giving this gift my heart will be glad and happiness and joy will arise in me' or one gives because it ennobles and adorns the mind
There are eight kinds of rebirth on account of giving
What eight
Herein monks a certain person makes a gift to a recluse or a brahman offering him food drink garments a vehicle flowers incense ointment bedding housing or lighting
In making the gift he hopes for a reward
He now notices noblemen of wealth brahmans of wealth or householders of wealth provided with the five sense pleasures and enjoying them
And he thinks 'Oh may I be reborn among them when I die when this body breaks up' And he sets his mind on that thought keeps to it firmly and fosters it
This thought of his aims at what is low and if not developed to what is higher it will lead him to just such a rebirth
After his death when his body breaks up he will be reborn among wealthy noblemen wealthy brahmans or wealthy householders
This however I declare only for the virtuous not for the unvirtuous for it is due to his purity monks that the heart's desire of the virtuous succeeds
Then again a certain person makes a gift to a recluse or a brahman offering him food or lighting
In making the gift he hopes for a reward
He now hears of the long life the beauty and the great happiness of deities in the realm of the Four Great Divine Kings  the Thirtythree gods  the Yaama gods  the Tusita gods  the gods of creative joy  the gods controlling others' creations and he wishes to be reborn among them
He sets his mind on that thought keeps to it firmly and fosters it
This thought of his aims at what is low and if not developed to what is higher it will lead him to just such a rebirth
After his death when his body breaks up he will be reborn among the deities in the realm of the Four Great Divine Kings the gods controlling others' creations
This however I declare only for the virtuous not for the unvirtuous for it is due to his purity monks that the heart's desire of the virtuous succeeds
Then again a certain person makes a gift to a recluse or a brahman offering him food or lighting
He now hears of the long life the beauty and the great happiness of the deities of Brahmaa's realm and he wishes to be reborn among them
He sets his mind on that thought keeps to it firmly and fosters it
This thought of his aims at what is low and if not developed to what is higher it will lead him to just such a rebirth
After his death when his body breaks up he will be reborn among the deities of Brahmaa's realm
This however I declare only for the virtuous not for the unvirtuous only for one free of lust not for one who is lustful
Because he is without lust monks the heart's desire of the virtuous succeeds
These monks are the eight kinds of rebirth on account of giving
There are monks three ways of making merit
What three
There are ways of making merit by giving by virtue and by meditation
There is a person who only to a small degree has practiced the making of merit by giving and likewise to a small degree he has practiced the making of merit by virtue but the making of merit by meditation he has not undertaken
This one after death when his body breaks up will be reborn among humans in an illfavored condition
Another person has practiced to a high degree the making of merit by giving as well as by virtue but the making of merit by meditation he has not undertaken
Such a one after death when his body breaks up will be reborn among humans in favorable conditions
Or he will be reborn in the company of the deities of the Four Great Divine Kings
And there the Four Great Divine Kings who had practiced to a very high degree the making of merit by giving and by virtue surpass the deities of their realm in ten things in divine life span divine beauty divine happiness divine power divine sights sounds smells tastes and touches
Or he will be reborn in the company of the Thirtythree gods
And there Sakka king of gods who had practiced to a very high degree the making of merit by giving and virtue surpasses
These monks are the three ways of making merit
There are monks eight outcomes of merit and goodness which are the nourishment of happiness and are very precious they yield happiness lead heavenwards and bring about what is desirable pleasing agreeable and enjoyable
What are these eight
Herein monks a noble disciple goes for refuge to the Buddha
This is the first outcome of merit and goodness which is a nourishment of happiness and is very precious it yields happiness leads heavenwards and brings about what is desirable pleasing agreeable and enjoyable
There is further a noble disciple who has gone for refuge to the Teaching to the Order of Monks
This is the second outcome the third outcome
There are further monks these five gifts known from early times known for long known by tradition ancient and unrejected not rejected before they are not rejected now and will not be rejected in future they are unrepudiated by intelligent recluses and brahmans
What are these five gifts
Herein monks a noble disciple gives up the taking of life and abstains from it
By abstaining from the taking of life the noble disciple gives to immeasurable beings freedom from fear gives to them freedom from hostility gives to them freedom from oppression
By giving to immeasurable beings freedom from fear hostility and oppression he himself will enjoy immeasurable freedom from fear hostility and oppression
This is the first of those great gifts and the fourth of the outcomes of merit
Further monks a noble disciple gives up the taking of what is not given and abstains from it
By abstaining from what is not given the noble disciple gives to immeasurable beings freedom from fear This is the second of those great gifts and the fifth of the outcomes of merit
Further monks a noble disciple gives up sexual misconduct and abstains from it
By abstaining from sexual misconduct the noble disciple gives to immeasurable beings freedom from fear This is the third of those great gifts and the sixth of the outcomes of merit
Further monks a noble disciple gives up wrong speech and abstains from it
By abstaining from wrong speech the noble disciple gives to immeasurable beings freedom from fear This is the fourth of those great gifts and the seventh of the outcomes of merit
Further monks a noble disciple gives up intoxicating drink and drugs causing heedlessness and abstains from them
By abstaining from intoxicating drink and drugs the noble disciple gives to immeasurable beings freedom from fear freedom from hostility and freedom from oppression
By giving to immeasurable beings freedom from fear hostility and oppression he himself will enjoy immeasurable freedom from fear freedom from hostility and freedom from oppression
This is the fifth of those great gifts and the eighth of the outcomes of merit
These monks are the eight outcomes of merit and goodness which are the nourishment of happiness and are very precious they yield happiness lead heavenwards and bring about what is desirable pleasing agreeable and enjoyable
Once the Blessed One was staying in the Brick Hall at Naadikaa
There he addressed the monks as follows
Mindfulness of death monks if cultivated and frequently practiced brings great fruit great benefit it merges in the Deathless ends in the Deathless
Therefore monks you should cultivate mindfulness of death
After these words of the Blessed One a certain monk said
Lord I cultivate mindfulness of death  And how do you cultivate it
I am thinking in this way Lord 'Oh were I to live just for one day and a night I would direct my mind on the Blessed One's teaching
Much indeed could then be done by me' Thus Lord do I cultivate mindfulness of death
I am thinking in this way Lord 'Oh were I to live but for a single day halfaday just for the time I need to eat one alms meal half an alms meal just for the time I need to chew and swallow four or five morsels of food just for the time I need to chew and swallow one morsel of food just for the time I breathe in after the outbreath or breathe out after the inbreath I would direct my mind on the Blessed One's teaching
Much indeed could then be done by me' Thus Lord do I cultivate mindfulness of death
After the monks had thus spoken the Blessed One said
The monks who say that they cultivate mindfulness of death with the thought 'Oh were I to live just for one day and a night just for the time needed to chew and swallow four or five morsels of food'  of these monks it must be said that they live indolently and that for the aim of destroying the taints they cultivate mindfulness of death in a slack way
But monks those who cultivate mindfulness of death with the thought 'Oh were I to live for the time I need to chew and swallow one morsel of food or for the time of breathing in after the outbreath or breathing out after the inbreath I would direct my mind on the Blessed One's teaching
Much indeed could then be done by me'  of these monks it can be said that they live diligently and that for the aim of destroying the taints they cultivate mindfulness of death ardently
Therefore monks you should train yourselves thus 'Diligently shall we live and for the aim of destroying the taints we shall cultivate mindfulness of death in an ardent way' Thus indeed O monks you should train yourselves 
Once the Blessed One was staying in the Brick Hall at Naadikaa
There he addressed the monks as follows
Mindfulness of death monks if cultivated and frequently practiced brings great fruit great benefit it merges in the Deathless ends in the Deathless
And how monks is it cultivated
When monks the day fades and night sets in or when the night is spent and the day breaks a monk should reflect thus 'Many might be the causes of my death a snake or a scorpion or a centipede may sting me and through that I may die
This would be a hindrance to me
Or I may stumble and have a fall or the food I ate may cause illness or bile phlegm or piercing gases may upset my health humans or nonhumans may assault me and through this I may die
That would be a hindrance to me'
Then that monk should further reflect thus 'Do I harbor in myself any evil and unwholesome qualities which are still undiscarded and would be a hindrance to me if I were to die tonight or during the day'
If on reflection that monk realizes that those evil unwholesome qualities are still in him then he should with strong resolve apply all his effort vigor and exertion mindfulness and clear comprehension for the sake of discarding them
Just as a man whose turban or hair is on fire will to extinguish the fire with strong resolve apply all his effort vigor and exertion mindfulness and clear comprehension even so should that monk resolutely apply all his effort for discarding his evil and unwholesome qualities
But if on reflection that monk realizes that there are in him no such evil and unwholesome qualities that might be a hindrance to him if he were to die tonight or during the day then he may well feel gladness and joy
By day and night he should train himself in everything that is beneficial
If monks mindfulness of death is cultivated in that way and is frequently practiced it will bring great fruit great benefit and it will merge in the Deathless will end in the Deathless
Once the Blessed One lived at Caalikaa on the Caaliya hill
There the venerable Meghiya who was at that time the Blessed One's attendant approached the Master saluted him respectfully and while standing at one side said
Lord I wish to go to Jantugaama for alms food  You may do as you think fit Meghiya
The venerable Meghiya dressing himself in the morning and taking robe and bowl entered Jantugaama for alms food
Having made the alms round and taken his meal he went to the bank of the Kimikaalaa river
There while walking about to stretch his legs he saw a pleasant and beautiful mango grove
Seeing it he thought Pleasant indeed is this mango grove it is beautiful
Truly it is fit for a clansman who wishes to make effort
If the Blessed One allows it I shall return to this mango grove for my efforts
And the venerable Meghiya went to see the Blessed One saluted him respectfully and sat down to one side
He then said Lord after my alms round in Jantugaama when I had taken my meal I went to the bank of the river Kimikaalaa and while walking there I saw a pleasant and beautiful mango grove which I thought fit for a clansman who wishes to make effort
If the Blessed One permits I shall go there and strive
Wait for a while Meghiya
We are now alone here
First let another monk come
But the venerable Meghiya repeated his request saying Lord for the Blessed One there is nothing further to achieve and nothing needs to be added to his achievement
But as for me Lord there is still more that I have to achieve and more to be added to what I have done
If the Blessed One permits I shall go to that mango grove and strive
Again the Blessed One asked him to wait and again the venerable Meghiya made his request for a third time
As you speak of striving Meghiya what can we say
You may do now as you think fit
The venerable Meghiya then rose from his seat saluted the Blessed One and keeping him to his right left for the mango grove
Having arrived he went deeper into the grove and sat down under a tree to spend the day there
But while staying in that mango grove three evil unwholesome thoughts constantly assailed him sensual thoughts thoughts of aversion and thoughts of aggressiveness
Then he thought Truly it is strange it is amazing
In faith have I gone forth from home into the homeless life and yet I am harassed by these three evil unwholesome thoughts thoughts of sensuality of aversion and of aggressiveness
Then the venerable Meghiya went back to the Blessed One and having saluted him he told him what had occurred and he exclaimed Truly it is strange it is amazing
In faith have I gone forth from home into the homeless life and yet I am harassed by these three evil unwholesome thoughts
If Meghiya the mind still lacks maturity for liberation there are five conditions conducive to making it mature
What five
The first thing Meghiya for making the immature mind mature for liberation is to have a noble friend a noble companion a noble associate
Further Meghiya a monk should be virtuous his life should be disciplined by the code of his monastic rules his conduct should be proper and also his resort seeing danger in the slightest fault he should train himself in the rules he has accepted
This is the second thing making the immature mind mature for liberation
Further Meghiya the talk in which a monk engages should befit an austere life and be helpful to mental clarity that is to say it should be talk on wanting little on contentment on solitude on seclusion on application of energy on virtue concentration wisdom deliverance and on the knowledge and vision of deliverance
If a monk has easily without difficulty opportunities for such talk this is the third thing making the immature mind mature for liberation
Further Meghiya a monk lives with his energy set upon the abandoning of everything harmful and the acquiring of everything beneficial he is steadfast and firm in his efforts not shirking the task as to things beneficial
This is the fourth thing making the immature mind mature for liberation
Further Meghiya a monk possesses wisdom he is equipped with the wisdom that perceives the rise and fall which is noble and penetrating and leads to the complete destruction of suffering
This is the fifth thing making the immature mind mature for liberation
Of a monk Meghiya who has a noble friend a noble companion and associate it can be expected that he will be virtuous that he will engage in talk befitting the austere life and helpful to mental clarity that his energy will be set upon the abandoning of everything harmful and the acquiring of everything beneficial that he will be equipped with the wisdom that leads to the complete destruction of suffering
Then Meghiya when the monk is firmly grounded in these five things he should cultivate another four things he should cultivate the reflection on the impurity for abandoning lust he should cultivate lovingkindness for abandoning aversion he should cultivate mindfulness of breathing for cutting off thoughts he should cultivate the perception of impermanence for eliminating the conceit 'I am' In one who perceives impermanence the perception of egolessness becomes firmly established and one who perceives egolessness attains to the elimination of the conceit 'I am' and in this very life he reaches Nibbaana
There are monks four powers
The power of wisdom the power of energy the power of an unblemished life and the power of benevolence
And what monks is the power of wisdom
As to those things which are good and held to be good bad and held to be so blameless and blameworthy and held to be so dark and bright and held to be so fit or unfit to be practiced and held to be so which are worthy and unworthy of noble ones and are held to be so  to see all these things clearly and to consider them well this is called the power of wisdom
And what monks is the power of energy
As to those things that are bad blameworthy dark unfit to be practiced unworthy of noble ones and which are held to be so  to rouse one's will to make an effort and stir up one's energy for giving up all these things and as to those things that are good blameless bright fit to be practiced worthy of noble ones and which are held to be so  to rouse one's will to make an effort and stir up one's energy for gaining all these things  this is called the power of energy
And what monks is the power of an unblemished life
Herein monks a noble disciple is unblemished in his deeds unblemished in his words unblemished in his thoughts
This is called the power of an unblemished life
And what monks is the power of benevolence
There are four ways of benevolence by gifts by friendly speech by helpful acts and by bestowal of equity
This is the best of gifts the gift of Dhamma
And this is the best of friendly speech to teach again and again Dhamma to those who wish for it and who listen attentively
And this is the best of helpful acts to arouse instil and strengthen faith in the unbeliever to arouse instil and strengthen virtue in the immoral to arouse instil and strengthen generosity in the niggard to arouse instil and strengthen wisdom in the unwise
And this is the best bestowal of equity if a streamwinner becomes equal to a streamwinner a oncereturner equal to a oncereturner a nonreturner equal to a nonreturner and an arahant equal to an arahant
This monks is called the power of benevolence
And this the four powers
Now monks a noble disciple endowed with these four powers has left behind five fears the fear for his livelihood the fear of disrepute the fear of embarrassment in assemblies the fear of death and the fear of an unhappy future destiny
A noble disciple will think 'No fear do I have for my livelihood
Why should I have fear about it
Have I not the four powers of wisdom energy unblemished life and benevolence
It is one who is foolish and lazy of blameworthy conduct in deeds words and thoughts and who has no benevolence  such a one might be in fear for his livelihood
'No fear do I have about disrepute or about embarrassment in assemblies nor have I fear of death or of an unhappy future destiny
Why should I have these fears
Have I not the four powers of wisdom energy unblemished life and benevolence
It is one who is foolish and lazy of blameworthy conduct in deeds words and thoughts and who has no benevolence  such a one might have all these fears'
Thus it should be understood monks that a noble disciple endowed with the four powers has left behind five fears
Once the Blessed One lived at Saavatthii in the Jeta Grove in Anaathapindika's monastery
At that time the venerable Saariputta approached the Blessed One
After saluting him respectfully and being seated he spoke to the Blessed One thus
I have completed now Lord the rains sojourn at Saavatthii and I wish to leave for a country journey  Yes Saariputta do as you think fit The venerable Saariputta rose from his seat saluted the Blessed One and keeping him to his right departed
Soon after the venerable Saariputta had left one of the monks said to the Blessed One The venerable Saariputta has hit me and without an apology has left on a journey
And the Blessed One called another monk and said Go monk and take my message to the venerable Saariputta saying 'The Master calls you brother Saariputta' and the venerable Saariputta responded saying Yes brother
Then the venerable MahaaMoggallaana and the venerable Aananda taking the keys went around the monks' lodgings and said Come revered sirs come
For today the venerable Saariputta will utter his lion's roar in the presence of the Blessed One
The venerable Saariputta approached the Blessed One and after saluting him sat down at one side
When he was seated the Blessed One said One of your fellow monks has made here a complaint saying 'The venerable Saariputta has hit me and without an apology has left on a journey' He Lord in whom mindfulness directed on the body is not present in regard to body such a one may well hit a fellow monk and leave without an apology
Just as Lord people throw upon the earth things clean and unclean dung urine spittle pus and blood yet for all that the earth has no revulsion loathing or disgust about it even so Lord do I dwell with a heart that is like the earth wide extensive and measureless without hostility and illwill
However he in whom mindfulness directed on the body in regard to body is not present he could well hit a fellow monk and leave without apology
Just as Lord people wash in water things clean and unclean dung urine spittle pus and blood yet for all that the water has no revulsion loathing or disgust about it even so Lord do I dwell with a heart that is like water wide extensive and measureless without hostility and illwill
However he in whom
Just as Lord fire burns things clean and unclean dung urine spittle pus and blood yet for all that the fire has no revulsion loathing or disgust about it even so Lord do I dwell with a heart that is like fire wide extensive and measureless without hostility and illwill
However he in whom
Just as Lord the wind blows over things clean and unclean dung urine spittle pus and blood yet for all that the wind has no revulsion loathing or disgust about it even so Lord do I dwell with a heart that is like the wind wide extensive and measureless without hostility and illwill
However he in whom 
Lord just as a dusting cloth wipes over things clean and unclean dung urine spittle pus and blood yet for all that the dusting cloth has no revulsion loathing or disgust about it even so Lord do I dwell with a heart that is like a duster wide extensive and measureless without hostility and illwill
However he in whom
Lord just as an outcaste boy or girl beggingvessel in hand and clad in rags enters a village or town with a humble heart even so Lord do I dwell with a heart like that of an outcaste youth a heart that is wide extensive and measureless without hostility and illwill
However he in whom
Lord just as a bull with his horns cut gentle well tamed and well trained when roaming from street to street from crossroad to crossroad will not hurt anyone with feet or horns even so Lord do I dwell like a bull with horns cut with a heart that is wide extensive and measureless without hostility and illwill
However he in whom
Lord just as a woman or man young youthful fond of adornment who has just washed the head would be filled with revulsion loathing and disgust if the carcass of a snake a dog or a man were to be slung around the neck even so Lord am I filled with revulsion loathing and disgust for this foul body of mine
However he in whom mindfulness directed on the body in regard to body is not present he could well hit a fellow monk and leave without apology
Lord just as if one were to carry around a bowl of liquid fat that is full of holes and crevices oozing and dripping even so Lord do I carry along this body that is full of holes and openings oozing and dripping
However he in whom mindfulness directed on the body in regard to body is not present he could well hit a fellow monk and leave without apology
Then that monk rose from his seat arranged his upper robe over one shoulder and with his head on the ground bowed at the feet of the Blessed One saying Lord an offense has overcome me in my foolishness confusion and badness insofar as I have accused the venerable Saariputta falsely wrongly and untruthfully
May Lord the Blessed One accept my offense as such so that in future I may restrain myself
Truly monk an offense has overcome you in your foolishness confusion and badness insofar as you have accused the venerable Saariputta falsely wrongly and untruthfully
But since you have recognized your offense as such and are making amends according to Dhamma we accept it from you
It means progress in the discipline of the noble one if a monk recognizes his offense makes amends and restrains himself in the future
The Blessed One then turned to the venerable Saariputta and said Forgive this foolish man Saariputta before his head splits into seven pieces on this very spot
I shall forgive him Lord if this revered monk asks for my pardon and he too may forgive me
What Samiddhi is the basis of the intentions and thoughts that arise in man  Mindandbody venerable sir
From where derives their variety  From the elements
What is their origin  Contact
What is their convergence  Feeling What is their highpoint  Concentration
What is their master  Mindfulness
What is their highest  Wisdom
What is their essence  Liberation
Where do they merge  In the Deathless
Well spoken Samiddhi well spoken
You have answered well the various questions put to you
But do not pride yourself on that account
Monks I shall teach nine things rooted in craving
Listen and pay heed to what I say
What are the nine things rooted in craving
Because of craving there is pursuit because of pursuit there is acquisition because of acquisition there is decision because of decision there is desire and lust because of desire and lust there is tenacity because of tenacity there is possessiveness because of possessiveness there is avarice because of avarice there is protection and for the sake of protection there is the seizing of cudgels and weapons there is quarrel strife dissension and offensive talk and there are slander and lies such evil and unwholesome things may appear
These are the nine things rooted in craving
Once the Blessed One lived at Saavatthi in the Jeta Grove in Anaathapindika's monastery
At that time the venerable Aananda approached the Blessed One and asked
What Lord is the benefit of good moral habits what is their reward  Nonremorse Aananda is the benefit and reward of good moral habits
And what Lord is the benefit and reward of nonremorse  Gladness Aananda
And what Lord is the benefit and reward of gladness   joy And what Lord is the benefit and reward of joy  Tranquillity And what Lord is the benefit and reward of tranquillity  Happiness And what Lord is the benefit and reward of happiness  Concentration of the mind And what Lord is the benefit and reward of concentration  Realistic knowledge and vision
And what Lord is the benefit and reward of realistic knowledge and vision  Revulsion and dispassion
And what Lord is the benefit and reward of revulsion and dispassion  The knowledge and vision of deliverance
Hence Aananda good moral habits have nonremorse as their benefit and reward nonremorse has gladness as its benefit and reward gladness has joy as its benefit and reward joy has tranquillity as its benefit and reward tranquillity has happiness as its benefit and reward happiness has concentration of the mind as its benefit and reward concentration has realistic knowledge and vision as its benefit and reward realistic knowledge and vision has revulsion and dispassion as its benefit and reward revulsion and dispassion have the knowledge and vision of deliverance as their benefit and reward
In this way Aananda good moral habits lead step by step to the highest
For one who is virtuous and endowed with virtue there is no need for an act of will May nonremorse arise in me it is natural monks that nonremorse will arise in one who is virtuous
For one free of remorse there is no need for an act of will May gladness arise in me it is natural that gladness will arise in one who is free from remorse
For one who is glad there is no need for an act of will May joy arise in me it is natural for one glad that joy arises in him
For one who has a joy there is no need for an act of will May my body be tranquil it is natural for one of joyful mind that his body will be tranquil
For one of tranquil body there is no need for an act of will May I feel happiness it is natural for one who is tranquil that he will feel happiness
For one who is happy there is no need for an act of will May my mind be concentrated it is natural for one who is happy that his mind will be concentrated
For one who is concentrated there is no need for an act of will May I know and see reality as it is it is natural for a concentrated mind to know and see reality as it is
For one who knows and sees reality as it is there is no need for an act of will May I feel revulsion and dispassion it is natural for one who knows and sees reality as it is that he will feel revulsion and dispassion
For one who feels revulsion and dispassion there is no need for an act of will May I realize the knowledge and vision of deliverance it is natural for one who feels revulsion and dispassion that he will realize the knowledge and vision of deliverance
Thus monks revulsion and dispassion have knowledge and vision of deliverance as their benefit and reward thus good moral habits have nonremorse as their benefit and reward
In that way monks these qualities are integrated with the other qualities and in that way these qualities bring other qualities to perfection for going from the here to the beyond
Once the venerable Aananda approached the Blessed One and asked
Can it be Lord that a monk attains to such concentration of mind that in earth he is not conscious of earth nor in water is he conscious of water nor in fire wind the realms of infinite space of infinite consciousness of nothingness of neither perception nor nonperception is he conscious of all these nor is he conscious of this world or a world beyond  but yet he is conscious
Yes Aananda there can be such a concentration of mind

But how Lord can a monk attain to such a concentration of mind
Herein Aananda the monk is thus conscious 'This is the peaceful this is the best namely the stilling of all formations the forsaking of all substrata the elimination of craving detachment cessation Nibbaana' In that way Aananda a monk may attain to such a concentration of mind
Once the venerable Aananda approached the venerable Saariputta and asked
Can it be brother Saariputta that a monk attains to such a concentration of mind that in earth he is not conscious of earth nor is he conscious of this world or a world beyond  but yet he is conscious
Yes brother Aananda there can be such a concentration of mind
But how brother Saariputta can a monk attain to such a concentration
Once brother Aananda I lived here in this Saavatthii in the Dark Forest
There I attained to such a concentration of mind that in earth I was not conscious of earth nor was I conscious of this world or a world beyond  and yet I was conscious
But what was the venerable Saariputta conscious of on that occasion
'Nibbaana is cessation of becoming Nibbaana is cessation of becoming'  one perception of that arose in me and another perception of it ceased
Just as brother Aananda from a fire of faggots one flame arises and another flame ceases even so brother one perception of Nibbaana as being the cessation of becoming arose and another perception of it ceased
On that occasion brother I consciously perceived that 'Nibbaana is the cessation of becoming'
Monks the lion king of beasts comes forth from his lair in the evening
Having come forth from his lair he stretches himself
He then surveys the four directions all around
Having done so he sounds thrice the lion's roar
And why
'May I not cause the death of small creatures that have gone astray'
'The lion'  this monks is a name for the Tathaagata the Holy One the Perfectly Enlightened One
When monks the Tathaagata expounds the Dhamma in an assembly that is his 'lion's roar'
There are monks these ten Tathaagata powers of a Tathaagata endowed with which the Tathaagata claims the foremost rank utters his lion's roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the supreme wheel
What are these ten Tathaagata powers
Herein the Tathaagata understands as it really is cause as cause and noncause as noncause
This is a Tathaagata power of the Tathaagata and because of that power he claims the foremost rank utters his lion's roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the supreme wheel
And again the Tathaagata understands as it really is by way of cause and root condition the result of past future and present actions that are performed
This is a Tathaagata power of the Tathaagata and because of that power
And again the Tathaagata understands as it really is the way leading to all
This is a Tathaagata power of the Tathaagata and because of that power
And again the Tathaagata understands as it really is the world with its many and different elements
This is a Tathaagata power of the Tathaagata
And again the Tathaagata understands as it really is the different dispositions of beings
This is a Tathaagata power of the Tathaagata
And again the Tathaagata understands as it really is the improvement and decline in the faculties of other beings other persons
This is a Tathaagata power of the Tathaagata
And again the Tathaagata understands as it really is with regard to the meditative absorptions the liberations the concentration and attainments their defects and purity and the emergence from them
This is a Tathaagata power of the Tathaagata
And again the Tathaagata recollects his manifold past lives that is to say one birth two births three births four births five births ten births twenty births thirty births forty births fifty births a hundred births a thousand births a hundred thousand births many aeons of world contraction many aeons of world expansion many aeons of world contraction and expansion there he was so named of such a race with such an appearance such kind of food such experience of pleasure and pain such an end of his life span and passing away from there he reappeared elsewhere and there too he was so named of such a race with such an appearance such kind of food such experience of pleasure and pain such an end of his life span and passing away from there he reappeared here thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives
This is a Tathaagata power of the Tathaagata
And again with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human the Tathaagata sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly happy or unhappy in their destiny
He understands beings as faring according to their deeds these worthy beings who were illconducted in body speech and mind revilers of noble ones wrong in their views acquirers of kamma due to wrong view have on the breakup of the body after death reappeared in a state of loss in an unhappy destiny in perdition in hell but these worthy beings who were wellconducted in body speech and mind not revilers of noble ones right in their views acquirers of kamma due to right view have on the breakup of the body after death reappeared in a happy destiny in the heavenly world thus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly happy or unhappy in their destiny he understands beings as faring according to their deeds
This is a Tathaagata power of a Tathaagata
And again the Tathaagata after destroying the cankers has realized for himself here and now with direct knowledge the cankerfree liberation of the heart and liberation by wisdom and he enters upon and dwells in it
This is a Tathaagata power of the Tathaagata and because of that power he claims the foremost rank sounds his lion's roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the supreme wheel
These monks are the ten Tathaagata powers of the Tathaagata endowed with which the Tathaagata claims the foremost rank utters his lion's roar in the assemblies and sets rolling the supreme wheel
Once the venerable Aananda approached the Blessed One and after saluting him sat at one side
The Blessed One addressed the venerable Aananda thus
As to those things Aananda that lead to the realization by direct knowledge of the various doctrinal statements herein I am confident Aananda and I claim to teach Dhamma about these in such a way that a person who acts accordingly will know the real as being real and the unreal as being unreal he will know the inferior as being inferior and the excellent as being excellent he will know that can be surpassed as being surpassable and the unsurpassable as being unsurpassable and there is the possibility that he will know understand and realize it just as it ought to be known understood and realized
But that Aananda is the highest knowledge namely the knowledge of these things as they really are
And I say Aananda there is no knowledge higher and more excellent than this
Monks as far as there are Kaasi and Kosala people as far as the realm of Pasenadi the Kosala king extends the Kosala king Pasenadi ranks as the highest
But even for King Pasenadi change takes place transformation takes place
When seeing this monks a welltaught noble disciple is repelled by it being repelled he becomes disenchanted about the highest not to speak of what is low
Monks as far as sun and moon revolve and illuminate all directions by their radiance so far does the thousandfold world system extend
And in that thousandfold world system there are a thousand moons a thousand suns a thousand Sinerus kings of mountains a thousand RoseApple continents a thousand Western Goyana continents a thousand Northern Kuru continents a thousand Eastern Videha continents a thousand four great oceans a thousand Four Great Divine Kings and their heavens a thousandfold of the heavens of the Thirtythree gods of the Yaama gods of the Tusita gods of the gods of creative joy of the gods controlling others' creations and there are a thousand Brahmaworlds
As far monks as this thousandfold world system extends the Great Brahmaa ranks there as the highest
But even for the Great Brahmaa change takes place transformation takes place
When seeing this monks a welltaught noble disciple is repelled by it being repelled he becomes disenchanted about the highest not to speak of what is low
There will be a time monks when this world comes to an end
And at that time beings are generally reborn in the heaven of the Radiant Deities
There they live made of mind feeding on joy radiating light from themselves traversing the skies living in glory and thus they remain for a very long time
When the world comes to an end monks these Radiant Deities rank as the highest
But even for the Radiant Deities change takes place transformation takes place
When seeing this monks a welltaught noble disciple is repelled by it being repelled he becomes disenchanted about the highest not to speak of what is low
Monks there are the ten kasina devices
What are the ten
Someone perceives the earth kasina above below on all sides undivided unbounded another person perceives the water kasina the fire kasina the wind kasina the blue yellow white red kasina the space kasina the consciousness kasina above below on all sides undivided unbounded
These are the ten kasina devices
Among these ten this is the highest  when one perceives the consciousness kasina above below unbounded
There are indeed monks such persons who perceive in that way
But even for persons who thus perceive change takes place transformation takes place
When seeing this monks a welltaught noble disciple is repelled by it being repelled he becomes disenchanted about the highest not to speak of what is low
Monks there are eight stages of mastery
What are the eight
 Perceiving forms on one's own body one sees forms externally small ones beautiful or ugly and in mastering them one understands 'I know I understand' This is the first stage of mastery Not perceiving forms on one's own body one sees forms externally white forms of white color white appearance white luster and mastering these one understands 'I know I understand' This is the eighth stage of mastery
Among these eight the highest is not perceiving forms on one's own body one sees forms externally white forms There are indeed monks persons who perceive in such a way
But even for persons who thus perceive change takes place transformation takes place
When seeing this monks a welltaught noble disciple is repelled by it being repelled he becomes disenchanted about the highest not to speak of what is low
Monks there are four modes of progress painful progress with slow comprehension painful progress with quick comprehension pleasant progress with slow comprehension pleasant progress with quick comprehension
Among these four the highest is pleasant progress with quick comprehension
There are indeed those who make progress in such a way
But even for persons who make progress in such a way change takes place transformation takes place
When seeing this monks a welltaught noble disciple is repelled by it being repelled he becomes disenchanted about the highest not to speak of what is low
Monks there are four modes of perception one person perceives what is limited and another perceives what is extended one person perceives what is immeasurable and another 'There is nothing' perceives the sphere of nothingness
Among these four modes of perception the highest is when 'There is nothing' one perceives the sphere of nothingness
There are indeed those that perceive in such a way
But even for them change takes place transformation takes place
When seeing this monks a welltaught noble disciple is repelled by it being repelled he becomes disenchanted about the highest not to speak of what is low
Monks among the views of outsiders this is the highest 'Had there not been there would be existence now for me I shall not be and there will not be any obstacle for me'
For one monks who has such a view it can be expected that he will not feel attracted to existence and he will have no aversion against the cessation of existence
There are indeed those who have such a view
But even for them change takes place transformation takes place
When seeing this monks a welltaught noble disciple is repelled by it being repelled he becomes disenchanted about the highest not to speak of what is low
Monks there are some recluses and brahmans who teach an 'ultimate purification' Those who teach an 'ultimate purification' regard it as the highest if after transcending the sphere of nothingness one enters into and dwells in the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception
They teach their doctrine for the direct knowledge and realization of that
There indeed those who thus teach
But even for them change takes place transformation takes place
When seeing this monks a welltaught noble disciple is repelled by it being repelled he becomes disenchanted about the highest not to speak of what is low
Monks there are some recluses and brahmans who teach the highest Nibbaana during lifetime
To those who teach the highest Nibbaana during lifetime the highest is the liberationwithoutclinging after seeing the six bases of contact as they really are namely their arising and ending the enjoyment and misery in them and the escape from them
And though I teach and proclaim thus some recluses and brahmans wrongly and falsely contrary to truth and fact misrepresent me thus 'The recluse Gotama does not teach the full penetration of sensual things nor of the finematerial states nor of the feelings' But monks I do teach the full penetration of sensual things of the finematerial states and of feelings
And being stilled serene and cooled even during lifetime I proclaim the perfect Nibbaana that is free of any clinging
Once the Blessed One lived at Saavatthi in the Jeta Grove in Anaathapindika's monastery
At that time the Kosala king Pasenadi had returned from a sham battle having been victorious and having achieved his purpose
The king then set out in the direction of the monastery
As far as the cart road went he rode by chariot then he alighted from it and entered the monastery on foot
At that time a number of monks were walking up and down in the open
The king approached them and asked Where your reverences is the Blessed One staying now the Holy One fully enlightened
He is staying in the lodging there great king where the door is shut
You may go there quietly and without haste
Then enter the veranda clear your throat and knock with the door bar
The Blessed One will open the door for you
The king did as he was told entered the veranda cleared his throat and knocked with the door bar
The Blessed One opened the door and the king went in
Bending low before the Blessed One with his head on the ground he kissed the Blessed One's feet embracing them with his hands
Then he announced his name I am Pasenadi Lord the Kosala king
I am Pasenadi Lord the Kosala king
But great king what reason do you see for showing to this body such profound humility and offering it such loving devotion
To express my grateful thanks Lord for that reason do I show to the Blessed One such profound humility and offer to him my loving devotion
For the Blessed One Lord lives for the welfare of many folk for the happiness of many folk because a great many people have been established by him in the holy method namely in noble and beneficial principles
It is for this reason Lord that I show to the Blessed One such profound humility and offer him my loving devotion
Again Lord the Blessed One is virtuous of virtue that is mature of virtue that is holy of virtue that is wholesome he is endowed with wholesome virtue
It is for this reason
Again Lord the Blessed One has been a forest dweller for a long time he resorts to remote forest lands to secluded dwellings
It is for this reason
Again Lord the Blessed One is contented with whatever robes alms food dwelling remedies and medicines he receives as requisites
It is for this reason
Again Lord the Blessed One is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of reverential salutation being the incomparable field of merit for the world
It is for this reason
Again Lord the Blessed One obtains at will without difficulty and trouble talk that is helpful to an austere life useful for mental clarity namely talk on frugality contentedness solitude seclusion application of energy virtue concentration wisdom deliverance and on the knowledge of wisdom and deliverance
It is for this reason
Again Lord the Blessed One attains at will without difficulty and trouble the four jhaanas which make for loftiness of mind and for a happy abiding in the present
It is for this reason
Again Lord the Blessed One recollects his manifold past lives that is to say one birth  It is for this reason
Again Lord the Blessed One with the divine eye which is purified  It is for this reason
And again Lord the Blessed One after destroying the cankers has realized for himself here and now with direct knowledge the cankerfree liberation of the heart and liberation by wisdom and he enters upon and dwells in it
It is for this reason Lord that I show to the Blessed One such profound humility and offer him my loving devotion
But now Lord we must go
We have much work and many duties
Do as you think fit great king
And the Kosala king Pasenadi rose from his seat saluted the Blessed One respectfully and keeping him to his right departed
If monks a monk is not skilled in the ways of others' minds he should resolve 'I must become skilled in the ways of my own mind' Thus monks should you train yourselves
And how is a monk skilled in the ways of his own mind
It is just as if a man or a woman young youthful and fond of adornment would look at their face in a clean bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water
If they then see any dust or dirt they will make all effort to remove it
But if no dust or dirt is seen they will be glad about it and their wish satisfied they will think 'How good
I am clean'
Similarly monks it is of great importance for a monk that he examines himself as to qualities in him that are wholesome 'Am I often covetous or often not covetous
Do I often have illwill in my heart or am I often free of it
Am I often immersed in sloth and torpor or am I often free of it
Am I excited or often free of excitement
Am I often in doubt or often free of doubt
Am I often angry or often free of anger
Is my mind often defiled or often free of defilements
Is my body often restless or often free of restlessness
Am I often lazy or often energetic
Am I often unconcentrated or often concentrated'
When a monk in such selfexamination finds that he is often covetous malevolent slothful excited doubtful angry mentally defiled bodily restless lazy and unconcentrated that monk should apply his utmost zeal and energy effort and exertion as well as unremitting mindfulness and clear comprehension to the abandoning of all those bad and unwholesome qualities
Just as a man whose clothes or turban are on fire will apply his utmost zeal and energy effort and exertion as well as mindfulness and clear comprehension so that he may extinguish the fire even so for the abandoning of those bad and unwholesome qualities the monk should apply his utmost zeal and energy
But if that monk on examining himself finds that he is often without covetousness and illwill often free from sloth and torpor from excitement and doubt often free from anger and finds that his mind is often undefiled and his body free of restlessness that he is often energetic and well concentrated  then grounding himself firmly in all these wholesome qualities he should beyond and make an effort for the elimination of the cankers
I do not approve monks of stagnation in things wholesome not to speak of a decline
It is growth in things wholesome that I praise and not stagnation nor decline in them
 It may be monks that wandering ascetics of another persuasion should ask you 'In what are all things rooted
Whereby do they come to actual existence
Where do they arise
Where do they converge
What is the foremost in all things
What is their master
What is the highest of all things
What is the essence in all things
Where do all things merge
Where do they end'
If thus questioned monks you should reply in the following way
'All things are rooted in the will
All things come to actual existence through attention
All things arise from contact
All things converge on feelings
Of all things the foremost is concentration
All things are mastered by mindfulness
Of all things the highest is wisdom
In all things the essence is liberation
All things merge in the Deathless
And Nibbaana is the ending of all things'
Wherefore monks you should train yourselves thus 'In the spirit of our going forth should our mind be strengthened
No evil unwholesome thoughts should entangle our mind and remain in it
In the perception of impermanence should our mind be strengthened
In the perception of egolessness should our mind be strengthened
In the perception of impurity should our mind be strengthened
In the perception of misery should our mind be strengthened
In knowing the straight and crooked ways of the world  in such perception should our mind be strengthened
In knowing gain and loss in the world  in such perception should our mind be strengthened
In knowing the origin and the ending of the world  in such perception should our mind be strengthened
In the perception of giving up should our mind be strengthened
In the perception of dispassion should our mind be strengthened
In the perception of cessation should our mind be strengthened'
In that way monks should you train yourselves
A first beginning of ignorance cannot be conceived 'Before that there was no ignorance and it came to be after that' Though this is so monks yet a specific condition of ignorance can be conceived
Ignorance too has its nutriment I declare and it is not without a nutriment
And what is the nutriment of ignorance
'The five hindrances' should be the answer
A first beginning of the craving of existence cannot be conceived 'Before that there was no craving for existence and it came to be after that' Though this is so monks yet a specific condition for craving for existence can be conceived
Craving for existence too has its nutriment I declare and it is not without a nutriment
And what is the nutriment of craving for existence
'Ignorance' should be the answer
But ignorance too has its nutriment it is not without a nutriment
And what is the nutriment of ignorance
'The five hindrances' should be the answer
But the five hindrances too have their nutriment monks they are not without a nutriment
And what is the nutriment of the five hindrances
'The three ways of wrong conduct' should be the answer
The three ways of wrong conduct too have their nutriment they are not without a nutriment
And what is their nutriment
'Lack of sensecontrol' should be the answer
Lack of sensecontrol too has its nutriment it is not without a nutriment
And what is its nutriment
'Lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension' should be the answer
Lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension too has its nutriment it is not without a nutriment

When listening to wrong teaching prevails it will make prevail lack of faith
When lack of faith prevails it will make prevail unwise attention
When unwise attention prevails it will make prevail lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension
When lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension prevails it will make prevail lack of sensecontrol
When lack of sensecontrol prevails it will make prevail the threefold wrong conduct
When the threefold wrong conduct prevails it will make prevail the five hindrances
When the five hindrances prevail they will make ignorance prevail
Such is the nutriment of that ignorance and so it prevails
Just as if when there is heavy rain high up in the mountains the water flowing downwards will fill up the clefts crevices and fissures in the mountains and when these are full they will fill up the little pools the full little pools will fill up the lakes the full lakes will fill up the small rivers the full small rivers will fill up the big rivers and the full big rivers will fill up the great ocean
Such is the nutriment of the great ocean and so it becomes full
In the same way monks when association with unworthy people prevails listening to wrong teachings will prevail when the five hindrances prevail ignorance will prevail
Such is the nutriment of ignorance and so it prevails
Liberation by supreme knowledge too has its nutriment I declare monks it is not without a nutriment

Once the venerable Saariputta was staying in Magadha in the village of Naalaka
On that occasion Saamandakaani a wandering ascetic approached him and asked
What friend Saariputta is happiness and what is suffering
To be reborn friend is suffering not to be reborn is happiness

Once the Blessed One was staying near Campaa on the bank of the Gaggaraa lotus pond
One day the householder Vajjiyamaahita left Campaa at an early hour in order to see the Blessed One
Then he thought It is not the right time to visit the Blessed One who will now be in seclusion
Nor is it the proper time to visit monks devoted to mind training they too will be in seclusion
Let me now go to the park where the wandering ascetics of another persuasion stay
When Vajjiyamaahita the householder arrived at the park those wanderers of another persuasion were gathered there in company and shouting and speaking loudly they were sitting there engaged in diverse kinds of low talk
But when they saw Vajjiyamaahita the householder approaching from afar they admonished each other to be quiet saying Make less noise your reverences and be quiet
Here the householder Vajjiyamaahita is coming a disciple of the recluse Gotama
He is one of the whiteclad lay disciples of the recluse Gotama who stays now at Campaa
These worthy ones do not like much noise they are used to being noiseless and they praise noiselessness
Perhaps if Vajjiyamaahita sees our group to be quiet he may think of coming here
These wandering ascetics now kept silent
When the householder Vajjiyamaahita had arrived there he exchanged polite greetings and friendly talk with them and sat down at one side
When he was seated the wanderers asked him
Is it true householder what they say  that the recluse Gotama blames all asceticism and that he unreservedly condemns and reproves all ascetics who live a harsh austere life
No venerable sirs the Blessed One does not blame all asceticism nor does he unreservedly condemn and reprove all ascetics living a harsh austere life
What is blameworthy the Blessed One blames what is praiseworthy he praises
By blaming what is blameworthy and praising what is praiseworthy the Blessed One teaches with discrimination he does not teach here in a onesided way
At these words a certain wanderer said this to the householder Vajjiyamaahita Wait a moment householder
That recluse Gotama whom you praise so much is a nihilist and he is one who refrains from making declarations
About that too venerable sir I shall speak to your reverences according to Dhamma
The Blessed One venerable sir declares that some things are wholesome and that some things are unwholesome
The Blessed One having thus declared what is wholesome and what is unwholesome is in fact one who makes declarations
He is not a nihilist nor one who refrains from making declarations
At these words the wanderers kept silent in their embarrassment sitting there with slumping shoulders and heads lowered brooding and unable to utter a word
When Vajjiyamaahita saw them in that condition he rose from his seat and left to see the Blessed One
Having arrived after saluting the Master he told him of his conversation with these wanderers of another persuasion
And the Blessed One said
Well done householder well done
In that way householder should such foolish persons when occasion offers be well refuted by you according to Dhamma
I do not say householder that all asceticism should be practiced nor do I say of all asceticism that it should not be practiced
I do not say that all observances should be performed nor do I say of all observances that they should not be performed
I do not say that every effort should be done or every act of renunciation carried out nor do I say of every effort that it should not be done nor of every act of renunciation that it should not be carried out
I do not say that one should free oneself by every kind of freedom nor do I say of every kind of freedom that one should not free oneself by it
What I declare householder is that such an asceticism should not be practiced which makes unwholesome states grow and wholesome states wane
But an asceticism which makes unwholesome states wane and wholesome states grow such asceticism I declare should be practiced
If in performing observances making spiritual efforts carrying out acts of renunciation freeing oneself by certain kinds of freedom unwholesome states wane and wholesome states grow then all these practices should be undertaken I declare
Then Vajjiyamaahita the householder thus instructed by the Blessed One's Dhamma talk roused by it inspired and gladdened rose from his seat saluted the Blessed One respectfully and keeping him to his right departed
Monks even a monk who has had for a long time clear vision as to this Teaching and Discipline would well refute those wanderers of another persuasion in the very same way the householder Vajjiyamaahita has done
Once a wandering ascetic named Uttiya approached the Blessed One
After an exchange of courteous and polite words he sat down at one side and asked
How is it revered Gotama is the world eternal  is only this true and everything else nonsensical
This Uttiya I have not declared that the world is eternal and that only this is true and everything else is nonsensical
How then revered Gotama is the world noneternal  is only this true and everything else nonsensical
That too Uttiya I have not declared that the world is noneternal and that only this is true and everything else nonsensical
How is it revered Gotama is the world infinite or finite
Are the life principle and the body the same or different
Does the Tathaagata exist after death or does he not exist after death
Does he exist as well as not exist or neither exist nor not exist after death
Is the only one that is true and everything else nonsensical
All that Uttiya I have not declared that the world is finite that the Tathaagata neither exists nor does not exist after death that is the only true one and that everything else is nonsensical
But how is it revered Gotama
To all my questions you have replied that you have not so declared
What after all does the revered Gotama actually declare
Having directly known it Uttiya I have taught the Dhamma to my disciples for the purification of beings for getting beyond sorrow and lamentation for the ending of pain and grief for attaining to the method and for realising Nibbaana
But if the revered Gotama out of his direct knowledge teaches Dhamma to his disciples for the purification of beings for getting beyond sorrow and lamentation for the ending of pain and grief for attaining to the method and for realising Nibbaana will the whole world thereby escape or half of it or a third part of it
At these words the Blessed One kept silent
Then this thought occurred to the venerable Aananda May Uttiya the wanderer not conceive a harmful opinion by thinking 'When the recluse Gotama was asked by me an allimportant question he foundered and did not reply
Probably he could not' But such a view would bring harm and suffering to Uttiya for a long time
Hence the venerable Aananda turned to Uttiya saying
I shall give you a simile friend Uttiya for with the help of a simile intelligent people may come to understand the meaning of what was said
Suppose friend Uttiya there is a king's border town with strong ramparts and turrets on sound foundations and with a single gate
There is also a gatekeeper intelligent experienced and prudent who keeps out people unknown and admits only those who are known
That gatekeeper walks along the path that girdles the town all round and while doing so he does not notice in the ramparts any hole or opening not even one big enough for a cat to slip through
Though he does not have the knowledge of how many creatures enter the town or leave it yet he does know this 'Any larger creatures that enter or leave this town can do so only by this gate'
Similarly friend Uttiya the Tathaagata is not concerned whether the entire world will escape by that or half of it or a third part
But the Tathaagata is aware that whosoever has escaped does now escape and will escape from the world all these will do so by removing the five hindrances that defile the mind and weaken understanding by firmly establishing their minds in the four foundations of mindfulness and by cultivating the seven factors of enlightenment in their true nature
That same question friend Uttiya which you had asked the Blessed One before you have asked him again in another way
Ten things monks do not have purity and clarity outside the Discipline of the Sublime Master
What are the ten
Right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration right knowledge and right liberation
And if these ten things have not arisen they will not arise outside the Discipline of the Sublime Master
Outside the Discipline of the Sublime Master these ten things will not end in the elimination of greed hate and delusion
Outside the Discipline of the Sublime Master these ten things will not conduce to the entire revulsion dispassion cessation peace direct knowledge enlightenment and Nibbaana

The taking of life monks I declare to be threefold as caused by greed caused by hate caused by delusion
So also the taking of what is not given sexual misconduct lying talebearing harsh speech vain talk covetousness illwill
Wrong views too I declare to be threefold as caused by greed caused by hate and caused by delusion
Hence monks greed is a producer of kammic concatenation hate is a producer of kammic concatenation delusion is a producer of kammic concatenation
But by the destruction of greed hate and delusion there is exhaustion of kammic concatenation
I declare monks that actions willed performed and accumulated will not become extinct as long as their results have not been experienced be it in this life in the next life or in future lives
And as long as these results of actions willed performed and accumulated have not been experienced there will be no end to suffering I declare
There are monks tainted failures caused by unwholesome volition which are productive of suffering resulting in suffering
These tainted failures are threefold in bodily acts fourfold in verbal acts and threefold in mental acts
How are these tainted failures caused by unwholesome volition threefold in bodily acts
There is a person who takes the life of living beings he is cruel and his hands are bloodstained he is bent on slaying and murdering having no compassion for any living being
He takes what is not given to him appropriates with thievish intention the property of others in village and forest
He conducts himself wrongly in matters of sex he has intercourse with those under the protection of father mother brother sister relatives or clan or of their religious community or with those promised to a husband publicly betrothed and lastly those betrothed with a garland
In this way tainted failure is threefold in bodily acts
And how is tainted failure fourfold in verbal acts
There is one who is a liar
When he is in the council of his community or in another assembly or among his relatives his guild before the royal family or has been summoned as a witness and is asked to tell what he knows then though he does not know he will say 'I know' though he does know he will say 'I do not know' though not having seen he will say 'I have seen' and though having seen he will say 'I have not seen' In that way he utters deliberate lies be it for his own sake for the sake of others or for some material advantage
He is a talebearer what he hears here he reports elsewhere for causing friction there and what he hears elsewhere he reports here for causing friction here
Thus he creates discord among those united and he incites still more those who are in discord
He is fond of dissension he delights and rejoices in it and he utters words that cause dissension
He speaks harshly using speech that is coarse rough bitter and abusive that makes others angry and causes distraction of mind
It is such speech that he utters
He indulges in vain talk he speaks what is untimely unreasonable and unprofitable having no connection with Dhamma or Discipline
His talk is not worth treasuring it is inopportune inadvisable unrestrained and harmful
In this way tainted failure is fourfold in verbal acts
And how is tainted failure threefold in mental acts
There is a person who is covetous he covets the wealth and property of others thinking 'Oh that what he owns might belong to me'
There is also one who has illwill in his heart
He has depraved thoughts such as these 'Let these beings be slain
Let them be killed and destroyed
May they perish and cease to exist'
He has wrong views and perverted ideas such as these 'There is no gift offering or sacrifice there is no fruit or recompense from deeds good or evil there is neither this world nor another world there are no mother and father there are no spontaneously mindborn beings and there are no recluses and brahmans in this world living and conducting themselves rightly who can explain this world and the world beyond having realized them by their own direct knowledge'
In this way tainted failure which is caused by unwholesome volition and is productive of suffering resulting in suffering is threefold in mental acts
As to that tainted failure which is threefold in bodily acts fourfold in verbal acts and threefold in mental acts and which having been caused by unwholesome volition produces suffering results in suffering it is due to those very failures that beings after death when the body breaks up are reborn in a world of woe in an unhappy destiny a state of misery in the hells
Just as a perfect throw of dice when thrown upwards will come to rest firmly wherever it falls similarly beings will be reborn in states of woe due to those tainted failures caused by unwholesome volition
I declare monks that actions willed performed and accumulated will not become extinct as long as their results have not been experienced be it in this life in the next life or in future lives
And as long as these results of actions willed performed and accumulated have not been experienced there will be no end to suffering I declare
There are monks successes caused by wholesome volition which are productive of happiness resulting in happiness
They are threefold in bodily acts fourfold in verbal acts and threefold in mental acts
How are these successes caused by wholesome volition threefold in bodily acts
There is a person who abstains from taking the life of living beings he has put away cudgels and weapons he has a moral conscience and is compassionate full of sympathy for all living beings he wishes for their welfare
He gives up sexual misconduct and abstains from it
He does not have intercourse with those under the protection of father mother nor lastly with those betrothed with a garland
In this way success is threefold in bodily acts
And how is success fourfold in verbal acts
There is a person who has given up lying and abstains from it
When he is in the council of his community or in another assembly or among his relatives his guild before the royal family or has been summoned as a witness and is asked to tell what he knows then when knowing he will say 'I know' and when not knowing he will say 'I do not know' and when he has seen he will say 'I have seen' and when he has not seen he will say 'I have not seen' He will not utter any deliberate lie be it for his own sake for the sake of others or for some material advantage
He has given up talebearing and abstains from it
What he has heard here he will not report elsewhere for causing friction there and what he has heard elsewhere he will not report here for causing friction here
In that way he unites those who are divided and encourages those who are in harmony
Concord gladdens him he delights and rejoices in concord and he utters words that foster concord
He has given up harsh speech and abstains from it
His words are gentle pleasant to hear endearing heartwarming courteous agreeable to many folk pleasing to many folk
He has given up vain talk and abstains from it
He speaks timely in accordance with facts and profitably
He speaks of Dhamma and Discipline and talks in a way that is worth treasuring
His talk is opportune helpful moderate and meaningful
In this way success is fourfold in verbal acts
And how is success threefold in mental acts
Herein a person is free from covetousness he does not covet the wealth and property of others thinking 'Oh that what he owns might belong to me'
He has no illwill in his heart
He has pure thoughts and intentions such as these 'May these beings be free from enmity free from anxiety
May they be untroubled and live happily'
He has right views and correct ideas such as these 'There is gifts offerings and sacrifice there is fruit and recompense from deeds good or evil there is both this world and another world there are mother and father there exist spontaneously mindborn beings and there exist in this world recluses and brahmans living and conducting themselves rightly who can explain this world and the world beyond having realized them by their own direct knowledge'
In this way success which is caused by wholesome volition is threefold in mental acts
As to that success which is threefold in bodily acts fourfold in verbal acts and threefold in mental acts and having been caused by wholesome volition produces happiness results in happiness it is due to that very success that beings after death on the breakup of the body are reborn to a happy destiny in a heavenly world
Just as a perfect throw of dice when thrown upwards will come to rest firmly wherever it falls similarly beings will be reborn to a happy destiny in a heavenly world due to success caused by wholesome volition
I declare monks that actions willed performed and accumulated will not become extinct as long as their results have not been experienced be it in this life in the next life or in future lives
And as long as these results of actions willed performed and accumulated have not been experienced there will be no end to suffering I declare
I declare monks that actions willed
But a noble disciple free from covetousness free from aversion unconfused clearly comprehending and mindful dwells with his heart steeped in lovingkindness pervading one direction and likewise the second the third and the fourth directions and so above below and around
He dwells pervading the entire world everywhere and equally with his heart steeped in lovingkindness  abundant grown great measureless free from enmity and anxiety
He now knows 'Formerly my mind was narrow and undeveloped but now my mind is boundless and well developed
No kamma of a limited will remain in it will abide in it'
What do you think monks if a young man from his boyhood onwards were to develop lovingkindness the liberation of the heart would he then do an evil deed  He would not venerable sir
And not doing any evil deed will suffering afflict him  It will not venerable sir
How should suffering afflict one who does not do evil deeds
Verily monks that lovingkindness the liberation of the heart should be developed by a man or a woman
A man or a woman cannot take their body with them and depart mortals have consciousness as the connecting link
But he knows 'Whatever evil deeds I did before with this physical body their results will be experienced here and they will not follow me along'
Lovingkindness if developed in such a way will lead to the state of nonreturning in the case of a monk who is established in the wisdom here but has not penetrated to a higher liberation
He dwells with a heart steeped in compassion sympathetic joy equanimity pervading one direction and likewise the second the third and the fourth direction and so above below and around

Verily monks compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity those liberations of the heart should be developed by a man or a woman
A man or a woman cannot take their body with them and depart mortals have consciousness as the connecting link

In the Book of the Elevens Sutta it is said that a monk who is free of the five hindrances does not meditate dependent on earth and yet he does meditate
In explanation the same text says that with regard to the earth his perception of earth is clear Comy The perception arisen in the four or five jhaanas with the object 'earth' is clear and distinct The perception has become clear because by insight it has been seen as being impermanent painful and egoless
On this text and the one following here see Bhikkhu Nanananda Concept and Reality st Ed pp
ff
This knowledge pertains eg to the progress or otherwise on the part of certain types of jhaanaattainers mentioned in Vibhanga those who having attained believe that they have failed those who having failed believe that they have attained etc those who attain quickly or slowly emerge quickly or slowly both attain and emerge quickly or slowly those who possess or lack skill either in concentration or in maintaining the concentration those who possess or lack the skill in both
If the view expressed in the saying under consideration is wrongly conceived it will lead to an annihilationist view as exemplified in SN
This same formula however is also mentioned approvingly by the Buddha
In MN it occurs as one of the reflections of a noble disciple which on the samatha road may lead him to the sphere of nothingness or if he turns to vipassanaa to insightwisdom
In SN the Buddha says that if a monk is firmly resolved he might cut off the lower fetters
In AN the formula is mentioned in connection with the five types of nonreturner
The statement in our text must also be understood in the light of the following sutta passage If one says that in whatever way a person performs a kammic action in that very same way he will experience the result  in that case there will be no religious life and no opportunity would appear for the complete ending of suffering
But if one says that a person who performs a kammic action that is variably experiencable will reap its result accordingly  in that case there will be a religious life and an opportunity for making a complete end of suffering
If monks the liberation of the heart by lovingkindness is cultivated developed frequently practiced made one's vehicle and foundation firmly established consolidated and properly perfected eleven blessings can be expected
What are the eleven
One sleeps peacefully one has no evil dreams one is dear to human beings one is dear to nonhuman beings one will be protected by deities fire poison and weapons cannot hurt one one's mind becomes easily concentrated the features of one's face will be serene one will die unconfused and if one does not penetrate higher one will be reborn in the Brahmaworld
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Let me first thank you for inviting me to deliver the Sir D
B
Jayatilleke commemoration lecture
The invitation was accepted with mixed feelings of diffidence and hope  diffidence because our own thinking sometimes reflects the very conditions that generates the turmoil around us hope because in the message of the Buddha there is a ray of light that will help us to emerge out of this predicament with clarity of thought and purpose
There is a need for clarity not only in the way we think but in the way we feel and incidentally the affective dimension of man provides thematic content of today's lecture
In this context Sir D
B
Jayatilleke is to us basically a nation builder and a nation builder who firmly stood on the soil of our cultural traditions
This lecture is presented as a tribute to this great national leader of Sri Lanka
We shall first raise the question What is the place of emotions in Buddhism then move on to an analysis of specific emotions  fear hatred sorrow and grief  and finally to the four sublime states
Having discussed the negative and positive aspects of emotions within the ethics and the psychology of Buddhism we shall raise some questions regarding the aesthetic aspect of emotions in Buddhism
Emotions are generally regarded in the mind of the Buddhist as aspects of our personality that interfere with the development of a spiritual life as unwholesome states ethically undesirable and roadblocks to be cleared in the battleground between reason and emotion
In keeping with this perspective emotions are described as states of agitation or imbalance
While a large number of emotional states discussed in Buddhist texts fit in to this description are we to accept that all the emotions are of this sort
Within the field of experimental psychology some accept that emotions can be both organizing and disorganizing
In the field of ethics the place of emotions in the moral life is a neglected subject but a few voices in the contemporary world have expressed opinions which bring out the relevance of the psychology of emotions to moral assessment reminding us of the very refreshing discussions in Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics
In these discussions too there is an acceptance of the creative role of emotions in the moral life of man
It may be that there is an emotional aspect of man that distorts his reasoning feeds his prejudices and darkens his vision but should we not look for an emotional facet in man that expands one's horizons of thinking breaks through our egotism sharpens a healthy sense of the tragic and evokes the ennobling emotions of sympathy and compassion for fellow man
There are young people all over the world today torn between the world of the senses with its excitement and boredom and path of renunciation about which they are not clear as it combines a sense of rebellion escape mystery and a search for the exotic East
I am sure the message of the Buddha presents to them a philosophy of life that will combine nonattachment with zest for doing things
This evening let us turn our minds towards an aspect of this modern predicament with the hope of discovering a little light in the ancient wisdom of the Buddha a light that may help us to see clearly the nature of the little world of turmoil that surrounds us
Our discussion today is not a matter of mere academic interest
The recent drama competition organized by the Kandy YMBA an attempt to present a drama based on the Buddhist Jataka stories is the kind of venture that makes us think that the education of the emotions is not alien to the Buddhist tradition
This talk will be concerned with the psychological the ethical and to a limited extent the aesthetic dimension of emotions
An emotion is the meaning we give to our felt states of arousal
Psychologists consider emotions to be complex states involving diverse aspects
On the one hand an emotion is a physiological state of arousal on the other it also involves an object as having a certain significance or value to the individual
Emotions are dynamically fed by our drives and dispositions they are also interlocked with other emotions related to an individual's beliefs a wideranging network of symbols and the cultural ethos of a society
Emotions basically involve dispositions to act by way of approach or withdrawal
Let us take an example to illustrate this
A man who walks a long distance across a forest track feels thirsty he is attracted by the sight of water in a passing stream and he approaches but there is a fierce animal close to the stream and he is impelled to withdraw or fight if he withdraws he might then have a general feeling of anxiety and if he gets back home safely he will be relieved
Thus perception of objects and situations is followed by a kind of appraisal of them as attractive or harmful
These appraisals initiate tendencies to feel in a certain manner and an impulse to act in a desirable way
All states of appraisal do not initiate action for instance in joy we like a passive continuation of the existing state and in grief we generally give up hope
Though there may be certain biologically builtin patterns of expressing emotions learning plays a key role
Learning influences both the type and intensity of arousal as well as the control and expression of emotions
The emotional development of people has been the subject of serious study
There are significant differences in the emotional development of people depending on the relevant cultural and social variables
In fact certain societies are prone to give prominence to certain types of emotions
There are also differences regarding the degree of expressiveness and control of emotions
The important point is that each of us develops a relatively consistent pattern of emotional development colored by the individual's style of life
An emotion occurs generally when an object is considered as something attractive or repulsive
There is a felt tendency impelling people towards suitable objects and impelling them to move away from unsuitable or harmful objects
The individual also perceives and judges the situation in relation to himself as attractive or repulsive
While a person feels attraction for agreeable material shape he feels repugnance for disagreeable material shapes
An individual thus possessed of like and dislike approaches pleasuregiving objects and avoids painful objects
Pleasant feelings and painful feelings are affective reactions to sensations
When we make a judgment in terms of hedonic tone of these affective reactions there are excited in us certain dispositions to possess the object to destroy it to flee from it to get obsessed and worried over it and so on
Our attitudes which have been formed in the past influence our present reactions to oncoming stimuli and these attitudes are often rooted in dynamic personality traits
These attitudes according to Buddha are not always the result of deliberations at a conscious level but emerge on deeprooted proclivities referred to as anusaya
Pleasant feelings induce an attachment to pleasant objects as they rouse latent sensuous greed painful feelings rouse latent anger and hatred
States like pride jealousy elation etc can also be explained in terms of similar proclivities
It is even said that such proclivities as leaning towards pleasurable experience and malevolence are found latent even in an innocent baby boy lying on his back
The motivational side of the emotions can be grasped by a study of the six roots of motivation
They fall into two groups wholesome and unwholesome
The unwholesome roots are greed hatred and delusion while the wholesome roots are nongreed nonhatred and nondelusion
Greed generates the approach desires in the form of the drive for selfpreservation and the drive for sensuous pursuits hatred generates the avoidance desires in the form of the drive for annihilation and aggressive tendencies
In keeping with our initial observations nongreed nonhatred and nondelusion should be considered as the springs of wholesome or ethically desirable emotions
In fact in a study of the impact of the wholesome roots on the forms of wholesome consciousness the following significant observations has been made by the Venerable Nyanaponika Maha Thera
Nongreed and nonhate may according to the particular case have either a mainly negative meaning signifying absence of greed and hate or they may posses a distinctly positive character for example nongreed as renunciation liberality nonhate as amity kindness forbearance
Nondelusion has always a positive meaning for it represents the knowledge which motivates the respective state of consciousness
In their positive aspects nongreed and nonhate are likewise strong motives of good actions
They supply the nonrational volitional or emotional motives while nondelusion represents the rational motive of a good thought or action 
In the light of this analysis it is plausible to accept nongreed and nonhatred as the sources of healthy and positive emotions
It is also interesting to note that nondelusion is the basis of good reasons for ethical behavior
A wrong ethical perspective also may be conditioned by one's desires and emotions
In the light of the Buddha's analysis a materialistic ethics influenced by the annihilationist view may itself be conditioned by desires
On account of desire there is clinging and clinging is said to be of four forms one of which is clinging to metaphysical beliefs
Thus there can be rational motives for good actions as well as rationalizations influenced by emotions
What is of importance in the observation we cited is that the Buddhist psychology of emotions does provide a base for creative emotional response a point which if accepted has significant implications for Buddhist ethics social theory and even art and aesthetics
While we shall come to the role of the creative emotions as we proceed let us now examine in detail the specific emotions discussed by Buddha
First we shall discuss the nature of fear anger guilt and grief and then move on to the four sublime states of lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity
Regarding the range of our analysis our study of emotions is basically limited to the psychodynamics of emotional states
However there is a significant range of factors emerging out of socioeconomic structure of a particular society
Differing economic and social structures stimulate differing types of psychological drives
Sometimes even when the socioeconomic conditions change the character structure of individuals is slow to change
In general whether it be the desire to acquire or desire to share and care for others these desires are in truth dependent on certain social structures for nourishment and existence
The desires to save and hoard to protect and accumulate to spend and consume to share and sacrifice have significant relations to the values embedded in a certain society
The emergence of greed and hatred or compassion and sympathy is related to the value system of a society
If we glance through the discourses of the Buddha as preserved in the Pali canon the available material on the nature of emotions appears to be dispersed and colored by the nature of the diverse contextual situations where emotions are discussed
However in general there appear to be four types of situations where the nature of emotions is discussed emotions obstructing the ideal of good life sought by the layman emotions that interfere with the recluse seeking the path to perfection emotions enhancing the layman's ideal of good life and emotions developed by the recluse seeking the path of perfection
The grouping of emotions in this manner brings an ethical and spiritual dimension to the psychology of emotions in Buddhism
In the context of the psychology of the West the undesirable emotions are those that create adjustive problems and impair our mental health and those desirable are valuable as an adaptive resource
Delineation of mental health merely in terms of adjustment is being questioned in some psychological groups in the West and new horizons have emerged a trend which might help to bridge the gap between the psychology of Buddhism and the currently dominant psychology of the West
Fear generally arises as a response to a danger which is of a specific nature whereas anxiety arises as a reaction to a danger which is not clearly seen
In anxiety both the nature of the object and one's attitude to it are not clearly recognized
However these states fade off into each other in certain contexts
Bhaya in Pali can be rendered as fear fright or dread
Regarding the genesis of the emotion of fear there are at least two clear types of situations which cause fear
Fear is often caused by strong desires Strong desires and attachment to either persons or things cause fear because if we cling to some precious and valuable object we have to defend it against loss or theft thieves can even be a serious threat to one's life
If one is tremendously attached to a person and if the person is struck by a serious sickness a concern for his wellbeing turns into a fear
The possibility of death causes anguish and anxiety
It is the same with the attachment to one's own self a threat to one's life sickness the threat of losing one's job or reputation  all these situations are conditions for the emergence of fear
It is due to the strong selfpreservative drive which in turn is fed by the bhavaraaga anusaya that fear becomes such an agitating condition
Apart from the drive for selfpreservation the desire for power lust jealousy and pride are intimately related to the emergence of fear
As we mentioned earlier some emotions are interlocked with other emotions as is the case for instance with jealousy pride and fear
The second type of fear is the consequence of leading an undesirable life
Here the emotion of fear is related to the emotion of guilt
In this context the emotion of fear has an unhealthy destructive aspect and a positive healthy aspect
If a person is burdened with a heavy sense of pathological remorse it has a bad effect it creates worry and restlessness
On the other hand a lively sense of moral dread and shame prevents man from taking to an evil life and forms the basis of responsibility and a civic sense
The damaging aspect of a heavy conscience in respect to morals has been the subject of discussion since the work of Sigmund Freud
In admonishing both the laymen and the recluse regarding the bad effects of a pathological sense of guilt the Buddha refers to a person who is subject to anxiety fear and dejection a person who has done the wrong thing fears that other people talk about him and if he is in a place where people meet together he fears that others are talking about him
When he sees others being punished by the king he thinks that the same will happen to him and is disturbed by this possibility
Finally when he is resting on a chair or the bed these thoughts come to him and he fears that he will be born in a bad place
Monks as at eventide the shadows of the great mountain peaks rest lie and settle on the earth so monks do these evil deeds lie and settle on him The kind of fear and guilt that disturbs the man here is different from a healthy and productive sense of shame and fear
In the Anguttara Nikaya there is a reference to four types of fears Fear of selfreproach fear of others' reproach fear of punishment and fear of lower worlds
In this context these fears have a good effect on the person he abandons evil and develops the practice of good
Fear is often found mixed with hatred and discontent and this is often so in the emergence of pathological guilt
Kukkucca which can be rendered as uneasiness of conscience remorse or worry is considered a hindrance to spiritual development
It is associated with a hateful and discontented consciousness similar to the Freudian superego consisting of aggressive elements
Among people who are disappointed with the way that they have lived in the past some successfully change into better and productive men others who take a more unrewarding line display a complex admixture of fear hatred and guilt
The religious melancholy the selfpunishing ascetics and similar types have an unproductive sense of fear and dread
Restlessness and worry are described in the Nikayas with an apt analogy if a pot of water were shaken by the wind so that the water trembles eddies and ripples and a man were to look there for his own reflection he would not see it
Thus restlessness and worry blind one's vision of oneself and form an obstruction to the development of tranquility and insight
Hiriottappa however is a positive and healthy sense which must be cultivated and developed
In the words of Mrs
Rhys Davis Taken together they give us the emotional and conative aspects of the modern nation of conscience just as sati represents it on its intellectual side He who lacks these positive emotions lacks a conscience
In a recent study of Morality and Emotions Bernard Williams says that if we grasp the distinction made in Kleinian psychoanalytical work between persecutory guilt and reparative guilt we do not neglect the possibility of a creative aspect for remorse or guilt He who thinks he has done wrong may not just torment himself he may seek to put things together again
In this rather evident possibility we not only have in general a connection between the emotions and the moral life we also have something that illustrates the point about the interpretation of a set of actions in terms of an emotional structure
It is also of interest to note that a student of Buddhism in the West has made an analysis of the Dynamics of Confession in Early Buddhism Teresine Havens too says that in place of the external rites of purification advocated by existing religions the Buddha advocated a radical inner transformation of the affective side of man
According to Havens the Buddha was as realistic as Freud or St
Paul in accepting and recognizing the egocentric lustful hostile and grasping proclivities in unawakened man While advocating a method to uproot these traits the Buddha condemned worry over past offenses as a hindrance to concentration and found a religion which in general seems to have produced far fewer neurotic guilt feelings than has Judaism and Christianity The Buddha has thus presented the principles of the catharsis of emotions which have certainly caught the eyes of many contemporary students of Buddhism in the West
Often we make a distinction between fear and anxiety
Fear is a response to a specific situation or a particular object
It is specific and demonstrable whereas dread is objectless diffuse and vague
In anxiety both the nature of the object and one's attitude to it are not clearly recognized
Anxiety is generally caused by egocentered desires of diverse types
There are some anxieties or vague apprehensions which under clear analysis can be reduced to some specific fear
For instance a person approaching the possibility of marriage may feel some fear due to financial problems or a sense of apprehension whether the marriage would be success but such vague apprehension could again under analysis be explained in a specific form
The Buddha says that there is a more basic type of anxiety due to our deeprooted attachment to the ego
Thus in the words of Conze there is a type of concealed suffering which lies behind much of everyday apprehensions
These emerge from the nature of the basic human condition something which while pleasant is tied up with anxiety as one is afraid to lose it
Here anxiety is inseparable from attachment something while pleasant binds us to conditions which are the grounds on which a great deal of suffering is inevitable like the possession of a body and finally the five aggregates have a kind of builtin anxiety
Inability to face the inner vacuity of the socalled ego results in a flight from anxiety some facets symptomatic of this overt anxiety are the frantic effort of people to join clubs compulsive gregariousness seeking to fill one's leisure by frantic activity such as motoring and such diversions which will help people to avoid being alone
The love of solitude and the way of silence advocated by the Buddha is anathema to large numbers of people who live in the lonely crowd
The Buddha traces this predilection of the anxious man to his inability to grasp the basic truth of egolessness which is the key to understand any form of anxiety
The belief in I and Mine though it gives a superficial feeling of security is the cause of anxiety fear and worry
The discourse on The Snake Simile refers to anxiety about unrealities that are external and those that are internal external unrealities refer to houses or gold that one possesses or children and friends and internal to the nonexisting I
The Bhayabherava Sutta says that purely subjective conditions can cause fear in a recluse who has gone to the forest
If a recluse who has gone to the forest has not mastered his emotions like lust and covetousness is corrupt in heart etc the rustling of fallen leaves by the wind or the breaking of the twig by an animal can cause fear and dread
Thus whether we are dealing with the fears of man attached to his possessions the anxieties of one torn between conflicting desires the fear and dread arising in the recluse gone to the wilderness or the fears consequent on leading a bad life  in all these senses the Buddha is for us a dispeller of fear dread and panic
Now the most important question is Is there no creative existential stirring that awakens man to his real predicament There are references to authentic religious emotions caused by the contemplation of miseries in the world
The emotion of samvega translated as stirring or deeply moving can be an invigorating experience which enhances one's faith and understanding of Dhamma
The samvega that is referred to here as an emotional state of existential stirring should be distinguished from paritassanaa which is a kind of anxiety
The doctrine of the Buddha is compared to a lion's roar
In the forest when the lesser creatures hear the roar of the king of the beast they tremble
In the same way when the devas who are longlived and blissful hear the doctrine of conditioned origination they tremble but they yet understand the Buddha's doctrine of impermanence
This should be compared with the state paritassanaa where a person finds his eternalism challenged but sees the doctrine of the Buddha through the eyes of an annihilationist and laments 'I' will be annihilated When samvega is kindled in a person he sticks to the doctrine with more earnestness
Fear is something which by its very nature entails avoidance but there is a strange phenomenon which may be described as flirting with fear There are people who search for forms of entertainment and sports which excite a mild degree of fear like participating in mountain climbing that can be dangerous motor sports fire walking etc there are others who like to read see and talk about gruesome incidents
A person who goes to see wildlife would like a little excitement rather than plainly see the animals at a distance
This kind of ambivalent nature is found in behavior where a mild degree of fear created by situations helps people to break through monotony and boredom
Also disgust with life and one's own self can make people court situations which are a danger to their life
Freud's study of the death instinct might shed some light on this rather dark facet of human nature
Even in ancient Rome it was said that people wanted both bread and circus
It is possible that situations of disorder turmoil and violence etc are fed by this ambivalent nature
Another facet of this compulsion to flirt with fear is found in the strange delight people find in violating taboos laws and commands
When desires are curbed through fear they are repressed and emerge through other channels
The coexistence of states which are condemned at the conscious level and approved at the unconscious level partly explain this compulsion to violate taboos
There are other types of irrational fears presently unearthed in the field of abnormal psychology which stresses that an undesirable situation has to be avoided on the basis of understanding rather than by an irrational fear or a process of drilling
This brings us to the final aspect of the questions regarding the emotion of fear
The Buddha was not much directly concerned with the question whether the spontaneous expression of an emotion is good or whether it should be inhibited
He held that rather by a process of selfunderstanding diligent selfanalysis and insight one can come to the point where emotions will not overwhelm him
A recent study which attempts to work out a technique of living based on Buddhist principles has something significant to say on this problem
Leonard Bullen says that there are three aspects to the disciplining of emotions first is the development of a habit of selfobservation with regard to one's emotional condition the second involves the control of emotional manifestations as they arise and finally the development of a new set of values so that the situations which earlier elicited the responses of fear will fail to do so
As Bullen himself points out the disciplining of emotions at the level of the individual has social implications
If we begin with ourselves we do not excite the emotions of fear hatred jealousy and pride in others
If others do not excite them in us we are not impelled to see the shadows of our own fears and jealousies in the bosom of their own hearts
Selfanalysis and understanding when practiced with within a community has a reciprocal effect
The emotion of fear when it is generated at the social level creates mutual mistrust suspicion and hatred
The roots of racial prejudices for instance can be understood in the light of this phenomenon of mutual fear
The problem of the young has to be dealt with at the level of the family
It may be said in this connection that ambivalent feelings of love and hatred within the family irrational fears and guilt complexes have a very bad impact on children
At the school level the medium of art literature and drama could do much to honestly encounter the problem emerging out of the affective side of man
If young people do not get a glimpse of their own emotional facets there is the possibility that they create their own forms of rebellion and defiance
There are already in the West today emerging marginal faiths of a highly exotic nature some of which are generated by fears and impulsion of immature minds some of these marginal faiths may be described as forms of siilabbatapaaraamasa
On the other hand there may be an unexpected ray of hope in the rebellion of the young mind trying to break through certain forms of conventional thinking which to them lack the warmth ardor and sincerity of a dynamic faith
It is by a spirited rejuvenation of our own traditions that we respond to this challenge with sympathy and understanding
Let our reflections this evening be a very humble attempt to pursue the problem in this direction
Emotions often create a kind of fog between the subject and the object
In approach desires like greed there is an infatuation due to which the person is blind to the undesirable aspects of the objects which he longs to possess
In the case of avoidance desires generated by fear and more so by hatred the subject projects his hatred in perceiving the object in extreme anger his vision is blinded like the fury of a serpent
Thus there is a positive attitude regarding things we like and a negative aversion for those we dislike
If we desire to avoid a situation or a person we dislike and we cannot do so there is excited in us an urge to destroy harm fight etc
The actual human situation is a little more complicated as sometimes a certain aspect of an object attracts us whereas another aspect repels us and if so under certain conditions what is lovable will turn out to be repulsive
The kind of emotional ambivalence that exists between parents and children is a case in point
Then there are things that we consciously like but unconsciously detest
In the ethicopsychological analysis of emotions that we find in Buddhism there are a number of terms used to connote the existence and expression of anger and hatred dosa vyaapaada patigha kodha etc
Hatred is also related to the states such as issaa macchariya and hiina maana
Dosa is one of the basic roots of immoral action along with greed and delusion
Sometimes in a particular situation all the roots of immoral action may be excited a person is longing to obtain object X but A stands in his way
Thus greed for X is followed by a hatred for A and the desire for X is in turn nourished by the root delusion
The expression of hatred can take various forms by way of thought by way of harsh words and by way of aggressive behavior
Due to certain forms of development that the human being has undergone people often do not speak out their feelings but by a process of repression and concealment accumulate them
Accumulated anger of this sort can explode in very many subtle forms as such anger exists at a subterranean level in the form of the patighaanusaya
A baby who is angry with the mother will direct this on to a doll  this is called displacement If a person takes pleasure in beating a child he will say it will do the child good  this is a form of rationalization
A person who unconsciously hates a person can be oversolicitous about his health  this is a reaction formation
If a person suspects that another person is harboring a grievance against him without grounds he is merely projecting his own hatred onto someone else
We have elsewhere discussed this concept of selfdeception but it is relevant to the emotion of hatred for very good reason
Hatred is an emotion which has been generally condemned by the Buddha so it is difficult to think of any positive forms it may take such as righteous indignation or a just war Thus it expresses itself in many subtle forms
If a person starves himself to death because of a social grievance it may be a way of directing the accumulated hatred on to himself
While suicide has been condemned by the Buddha no form of selftorture can be accepted according to the path of the Buddha
There is a classic case of the child who refused to take medicine and finally through compulsion drank it with a vengeance
It is in the understanding of the deceptive spell of the aggressive urges in man that the Buddha condemned the path of selfmortification
It is a way of life that generates suffering annoyance trouble and fret
The Buddha advocated a middle path that will dry up both the roots of greed and hatred and delusion too
It is in an era close to ours that Sigmund Freud remarked that the voice of aggression is sometimes subtle invisible and difficult to unravel
It is perhaps the subtle appreciation of these psychological mechanisms in Buddhism which made Rhys Davis remark that compared with the ascetic excess of the times the Buddhist standpoint was markedly hygienic Not merely does the Buddha grasp the subtle mechanism through which the aggressive urge manifests but he has presented the finest antidote to the spring of hatred in man preaching the doctrine of the four sublime states
If the genius for both good and evil rests within ourselves the Buddha has given us a sense of optimism to deal with the turmoil around us
Though the Buddha attempted to deal with the emergence of hatred both at the social and individual level the inner transformation of the individual is the basis on which the urge to aggression can be tamed
Thus in working out the different levels of spiritual development there are references to the forms of anger hatred and illwill that obstruct man
Hatred in the form of vyaapaada is referred to as one of the hindrances along with sensuality sloth and torpor restlessness and remorse and doubt
Vyaapaada is one of the fetters that bind beings to the wheel of existence
Vyaapaada kodha and upanaaho issaa and macchariya are considered as defilements in a list of sixteen defilements
These defilements have to be eliminated for the development of insight
These states work in significant combinations for instance in contempt there is a combination of aversion and conceit and denigration is a stronger form of this contempt
Envy is fed by greed and aversion
If we succumb to the last defilement of negligence then these defilements will form into a layer which is hard to break through and has got hardened through habit
It is in this way that we can account for the emergence of certain personality types and the type referred to as the dosa carita will be the very embodiment of hatred
There is a graphic description of the angry man in the Anguttara Nikaya some of which we shall reproduce briefly
On the therapeutic side there are many contexts where the Buddha offers advice to face situations such that one's anger wrath and illwill not be excited and if one is agitated there are techniques to get rid of them
This is not a process of repression by which you push them into a lower level of consciousness but a process by which understanding insight and mindfulness lead one to control and restraint
While the Buddhist analysis of genesis of emotional states helps one to understand their emergence positive techniques are advocated to deal with them and this is done in the case of anger fear greed jealousy or any such unwholesome emotional state
The Vitakkasanthana Sutta recommends five techniques to deal with such states
Grief is a universal phenomenon
It is basically a reaction to bereavement but it is also consequent on other types of losses
If there has been a close identification with the person or the thing lost the person concerned feels as if a part of himself has been lost
The most significant observations on the nature of mourning and melancholy were made by Sigmund Freud
When an object is charged with a strong emotional cathexis or in Buddhist terminology clinging a sudden loss or separation creates a disturbing vacuum
Feelings of guilt depression and selfpity may color the emotion of grief in various situations
The Attahasaalinii warns that sometimes people will not be able to distinguish between sorrow and compassion while the distant enemy of compassion is cruelty the close enemy is a kind of selfpity filled with worldly sorrow
While a deep sense of compassion has a power to transform a person spiritually worldly sorrow binds him more insidiously to the wheel of samsaara
Sorrow grief and lamentation are all facets of dukkha and can be overcome only by grasping the philosophy of the tragic in Buddhism
Mourning and weeping are not effective in dealing with the tragic
We should understand the causes and conditions of suffering and work out a therapy to remove the causes of suffering
The Buddhist attitude demands a sense of reality this is different from either excessive mourning or the use of diversions to drown one's sorrow
Dukkha is a universal feature of samsaric existence along with impermanence and egolessness
The Buddha has said What is impermanent that is suffering
What is suffering that is void of an ego To think that there is an ego where there is only a changing psychophysical complex is to create the conditions that generate sorrow grief and dejection
The Buddhist philosophy of tragedy is contained in the four noble truths the truth of suffering the origin of suffering the extinction of suffering the eightfold path leading to the extinction of suffering
The nature of suffering is thus described by the Buddha birth decay disease death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair are suffering
To be joined with the unpleasant and to be separated from the pleasant is suffering the failure to get what one wants is suffering
In short clinging to the five groups of mental and physical qualities that go to make up the individual constitutes suffering
It is the last part of the formula that gives a sense of depth to the meaning of tragedy in Buddhism
If the nature of the Buddhist analysis of Dukkha is understood within that setting the confrontation with genuine tragic situations in life may have a positive role to play it could break through the natural slumber and complacency and create the sense of urgency in the mind of the Buddhist
Authentic tragic experience should be a spur to the religious life and strengthen one's faith in the doctrine
The way in which the impact of genuine tragic situations may bring about a spiritual alertness without falling into the unwholesome extreme of morbidity is brought out clearly in the Anguttara Nikaya
A certain person hears that in a village or town someone is afflicted or dead and stirred in his way he realizes the truth another beholds with his own eyes and realizes the truth the third person sees a kinsman afflicted and realizes the truth and finally the person himself is stricken with pain and suffering and this situation stirs him to a realization of the truth of suffering
This is by analogy compared to a steed that is stirred when the stick is seen one stirred when the stick touches the skin a third when the flesh is pierced and a fourth when the very bone is pierced by a stick
There is an element of stirring which awakens a person to the tragic sense of life and the emergence of faith in the doctrine
Even if we call this a state of agitation it is different from a person whose fear anger or grief has been aroused
Even the sense of the tragic in life can turn out to be a creative emotional response
Not only does compassion form the basis for a wholesome dimension of emotional warmth and positive concern for others but it is specifically advocated as a corrective to the elimination of hatred fear and allied states
But it has its own alluring disguises and as stated earlier it must be saved from the near enemies of worldly sorrow and pseudolove and superficial attachments
The four sublime states are mettaa karunaa muditaa and upekkhaa
Their potentiality to deal with conflicts jealousies prejudice and hatred are immense and at the social level very significant
In the words of Ven
Nyanaponika They are the great removers of tension the great peacemakers in social conflict the great healers of wounds suffered in the struggle of existence levelers of social barriers builders of harmonious communities awakeners of slumbering magnanimity long forgotten revivers of joy and hope In the early part of the lecture it was mentioned that morality has a significant relation to the psychology of human emotions
In the context of the four sublime states this observation has much relevance
Gunapala Dharmasiri has pointed out that one type of moral justification advocated by the Buddha was the appeal to sympathetic feelings
The simple fact that others are living beings is the reason why I should not harm and this is based on an inference from one's personal experience to that of others As all people dislike punishment and are scared of death one should not kill or harm others In the context of the four sublime states a kind of disinterestedness or neutrality is a safeguard against the emergence of sentimental attachments
These states are considered as boundless as they are not limited narrowed down to a special person or persons
These are not merely principles of conduct but subjects of methodical meditation and these could only get rooted in a strong affinity with this unbounded outlook by the integration of the meditational level and the practical level of conduct
It is by meditative practice that they sink deeply into the heart and thus later become spontaneous attitudes
In the four sublime states we see the finest base for a creative emotional response and moreover a response related to the emotion of natural sympathy and concern for fellow beings
Having dealt with the psychological and ethical aspects of the emotions in Buddhism it would naturally fall in line with our discussion to say a few words on the aesthetic aspects too
These comments are made as an incentive to further reflection rather than in the form of a definitive statement
In the course of our discussion it was observed that Buddhism upholds the cultivation of good emotions and the elimination of unwholesome emotions
Art and aesthetics is basically a medium of human communication
Is there a facet of the aesthetic that can enhance the education of the emotions
There are two sides to the question one from the standpoint of art the other from the standpoint of Buddhism
Let us take the standpoint of art first
There are three views on the relationship between art and morality out of which philosophers like RW
Beardsmore favor the third
The view called Moralism upholds that the aim of art is to teach morality Autonomism is the belief that the art has nothing to do with morality
Both points are mistaken on Beardsmore's view art does not crudely teach morality or deliberately eliminate it rather art can give an understanding which makes moral judgment sensitive and intelligent
In the recent development of what is called Situational Ethics examples from literature are used for the discussion of moral issues
By thus reflecting on the conflicts and dilemmas of the characters we can enrich our own sensibility
Without having undergone the experience ourselves moral and religious problems can be viewed with a sense of detachment Thirdly the uses of pure reason are sometimes limited and the use of literary techniques are extremely effective on occasions the fact is quite obviously seen in the importance of the Jatakas the Thera and Therigathas etc
Finally philosophers like Aristotle discovered a certainly cathartic purpose in art
By the use of the sympathetic imagination one tends to see the common human nature that exists behind the faade of divisive doctrines
Now can a Buddhist absorb the aims of art and aesthetics in this manner
As we have already mentioned for the purpose of efficient communication a wide variety of techniques have been used by the Buddha stories fables poetry paradoxes similes etc
Some of these techniques are well developed  for instance in Zen Buddhism
Drama and song are used today as media for depicting thematically a Buddhist idea
Sculpture and painting have developed over the years with a Buddhist inspiration
But there are problems in this area
Though the five precepts do not directly prohibit artistic activity the call to restrain the senses is important
Also in the more stringent code of morality and for monks seeing dances and such forms of amusements is prohibited
The crucial question is how do we differentiate between the sensuous with its harmful effects and the aesthetic
OH
de A
Wijesekera discussing the relationship between Buddhism and Art says In the Sigala homily we have one of the best abstracts of the Buddha's attitude as to what a lay disciple should do and not do
One will find that the Buddha there admonishes Sigala not to fall into the error of developing a habitual liking for amusements but he certainly does not ask Sigala to cut himself off completely from all aesthetic pursuits only that which is bad and demoralizing Thus if we do not adopt a very limited notion of the sensuous to eliminate the aesthetic education of the emotion through aesthetic media is possible
Jothiya Dhirasekera says the Buddhist recognizes beauty where the senses can perceive it
But in the beauty he also sees its own change and destruction
He remembers what the Buddha said with regard to all components things that they come in to being undergo change and are destroyed It is because of the ability to look at life with equanimity that Buddhism provided a base for the development of a very rich nature poetry the images of peace and tranquility of change and continuity  all these find graphic expression in Buddhist poetry
There is also a devotional aspect of religion which finds fitting expression in aesthetic media and within the concept of saddhaa art and aesthetic can stimulate faith and reverence for the Dhamma
To conclude  In the depiction of human tragedy the lure of power the pitfalls of ambition the roots of passion and the springs of compassion the Jatakas have already provided a veritable gold mine for the education of the emotions
With the tranquility and peace that one sees in the Samadhi statue or the beauty of the ancient cave paintings we enter into a dimension which is predominantly Buddhistic
These observations are offered to reactivate a facet of human nature that comes most naturally to man and harness this potential in the wake of a higher spiritual transformation
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The Sutta Nipata in its oldest and most characteristic parts is a deeply stirring Song of Freedom
The verses of this ancient book are a challenging call to us to leave behind the narrow confines of our imprisoned existence with its evergrowing walls of accumulated habits of life and thought
They beckon us to free ourselves from the enslavement to our passions and to our thousand little whims and wishes
A call to freedom is always timely because in our lives we constantly bind ourselves to this and that or let ourselves be bound in various ways by others and by circumstances
To some extent normal life cannot entirely escape from such a situation
In fact binding oneself to a worthy task and duty or to an ennobling human relationship is an indispensable antidote to the opposite tendency the dissipation of our energies
The physical act of walking consists not only in the freeing action of lifting and stretching the foot but also in the binding function of lowering it and placing it firmly on the ground
Analogously in mental movement there is the same need for support as well as for uplift and forward advancement
But having the comfort of a secure footing in life we too easily forget to walk on
Instead we prefer to strengthen our position to improve and embellish the little cage we build for ourselves out of habits ideas and beliefs
Once we have settled down in our habitual ways of living and thinking we feel less and less inclined to give them up for the sake of risky ventures into a freedom of life and thought full of dangers and uncertainties
True freedom places on us the uncomfortable burden of everfresh responsible decisions which have to be guided by mindfulness wisdom and human sympathy
Few are willing to accept the full weight of such a burden
Instead they prefer to be led and bound by the rules given by others and by habits mainly dominated by selfinterest and social conventions
With the habituation to a life of inner and outer bondage there grows what Erich Fromm calls a fear of freedom Such fear if allowed to persist and take root inevitably leads to a stagnation of our inner growth and creativeness as well as to a stagnant society and culture
In a state of stagnation toxic elements will endanger mankind's healthy progress  physical and mental social and spiritual
Then William Blake's words will prove true Expect poison from stagnant water
Those too who say Yes to life and wish to protect mankind from decline by its selfproduced toxins  biological and psychological  will also have to shed that fear of freedom and enter freedom's arduous way
It is an arduous way because it demands of us that we break the selfforged fetters of our lusts and hates our prejudices and dogmas  fetters we foolishly cherish as ornaments
But once we see them for what they really are obstacles to true freedom the hard task of discarding them will become at the same time a joyous experience
The Sutta Nipata however warns repeatedly of false ideas of freedom
He is not truly free who only follows his selfwilled whims and desires who is carried along by them
Nor can true freedom be found by those who only seek to exchange one bondage for another
Mankind is always in need of both lawgivers and liberators
It is for echoing the voice of that great liberator the Buddha that the following pages have been written as a humble tribute
What follows are free musings on the first poem of the Sutta Nipata the Uraga Sutta interspersed with gleanings from the Buddhist texts which may help to illuminate the verses
The Refrain
The ancient masters of the Theravada Buddhist tradition explain the simile of the serpent's wornout skin occurring in the last line of each of the poem's verses as follows
The shedding of the serpent's old skin is done in four ways
through disgust
with the help of a support and
with effort
Its own species is that of those longbodied animals the snakes
Snakes do not transgress these five characteristics of their species in regard to their birth their death their surrendering to sleep their mating with their own kind only and the shedding of the old worn out skin
Hence in shedding the skin a snake follows the law of its own kind
But in doing so it sheds the old skin out of disgust
When only half of the body has been freed of the old skin and the other half is still attached the snake will feel disgust
In such disgust the snake will support its body on a piece of wood a root or a stone and
making an effort using all its strength it will wind its tail around the supporting object exhale forcefully and expand its hood and shed the old skin fully
Then it will go freely wherever it likes
It is similar with a monk
The law of his own species is virtue
Standing firm in his own law of virtue and seeing the misery involved he becomes disgusted with the old wornout skin of the here and the beyond comprising as his own and others' personalized existence etc which are productive of suffering
Thus he becomes disgusted and seeking the support of a noble friend he summons his utmost strength by way of the path factor right effort
Dividing day and night into six periods during daytime while walking up and down or sitting he purifies his mind from obstructive things doing so also in the first and the last watch of the night he lies down for rest only in the night's middle watch
Thus he strives and struggles
Just as the serpent bends its tail so he bends his legs to a crosslegged posture
As the serpent exhales forcefully so the monk musters all his unremitting strength
As the serpent expands its hood so the monk works for an expansion of his insight
And just as the serpent sheds its old skin so the monk abandons the here and the beyond and being now freed of the burden he goes forth to the Nibbanaelement that is without a residue of the groups of existence
Commentary to the Sutta Nipata
Conforming to the law of its own species the serpent discards what has become only a burden
It is wornout outgrown skin which the snake gladly sheds
And thus it will finally be with him who earnestly walks the path to the freedom from all burdens
Daily practice of alienation from what has been understood to be actually alien will wear thin the bondage to self and the world loosen more and more clinging's tight grip until like the serpent's wornout skin it falls away almost effortlessly
Just as according to similes given by the Buddha the handle of a hatchet is wasted away by constant use just as the strongest shipropes will become brittle by constant exposure to wind sun and rain and finally fall asunder  so will constant acts of giving up of letting go wear thin and fragile the once so stout and unbreakable fetters of craving and ignorance until one day they drop off completely
By such an act of shedding the old skin no violence against nature is done it is a lawful process of growing of outgrowing that which is no longer an object of attachment  just as the old skin is no longer attached to the snake's body
Only in such a way can a person vanquish those passionate urges and deceptive notions of his which are so powerful and so deeply rooted
In the act of ultimate liberation nothing is violently broken which was not already detached from the living tissues of mind and body or only quite loosely joined with them
Only a last effort of the powerful muscles will be needed to shake off the empty sheath  this hollow concept of an imaginary self which had hidden for so long the true nature of body and mind
Here it lies before the meditator's feet  like the serpent's wornout skin  a lifeless heap of thin and wrinkled thought tissue
Once it had seemed to be so full of alluring beauty  this proud and deceptive idea of I and mine Now this illusion is no more and a new conceptual skin has grown which though likewise made of imperfect words has no longer the deceptive colorings of conceit craving and false ideas
Mindandbody are now seen as they truly are
Now one no longer misconceives them for what they are not and no longer expects of them what they cannot give lasting happiness
How big a burden of anxiety fear frustration and insatiate craving will have been discarded
How light and free the heart can become if one sheds attachment to what is not one's own
What actually has to be shed is this attachment rooted in the egoillusion
But until discarded entirely this egoillusion will still cling to mind andbody by the force of three powerful strands which are also its feeders conceit craving and false ideas
Even if false ideas about a self have been given up intellectually the other two feeders conceit and craving are strong enough to cause an identification of mindandbody with the imaginary self
This identification has to be dissolved on all three levels until mindandbody are seen to be as alien as those dry leaves of the Jeta Grove which the Buddha once picked up asking the monks whether these leaves are their self or their self's property
And the monks replied They are surely not our self or anything belonging to our self Then the Master said Therefore monks give up what is not yours
Give up all clinging to body feelings perceptions volitions and consciousness
It is certainly not difficult to give up what is so obviously foreign to us and worthless too like those dry leaves or any other insignificant trifles we encounter in our lives
It is harder to give up a cherished material object or a beloved human being
It is hardest however to detach ourselves from the body and its pleasures from our likes and dislikes from the intellectual enjoyment of our thoughts from deeprooted tendencies and habits in short from all that we instinctively and without question identify with as ourselves All these constituents of our supposed self are visibly changing sometimes rapidly and radically sometimes the changes of our likes and dislikes habits and ideas turn them into their very opposite
Yet we still continue to identify ourselves wholeheartedly with those new states of mind as if they were the old ego
So tenacious is the egoillusion and therefore so hard to break
Yet it is to that hardest task that the Master summons us Give up what is not yours
And what is not yours
The body is not yours give it up
Giving it up will be for your weal and happiness
Feelings perceptions volitions and consciousness are not yours give them up
Giving them up will be for your weal and happiness
We must recall here that it is attachment to these five aggregates that has to be given up and that this is a gradual process
We must not expect our habitual likes and dislikes our intellectual enjoyments and our desires to vanish all at once nor can or should they be broken by force
This seemingly compact and identifiable personality has been gradually built up by the intake of physical and mental nourishment
Again and again thousands of times during a single day we have approached and absorbed the physical and mental objects of our desire
One after the other we have made them our own and believed them to be our own
This continuous process of accumulating attachments and selfidentifications must now be reversed by a gradual process of detachment achieved by dissolving or stopping the false identifications
The Buddha's teaching chiefly consists of aids assisting us in that task of gradual detachment  aids to right living and to right thinking
The simile of the snake's worn out skin is one of these aids and if seen as such it has much to teach
These are some of the ways in which contemplation can be helpful
We look at our skin encasing the body it is now firm and taut healthily alive our warm blood pulsating beneath it
Imagine it now lying before you empty and limp like a snake's discarded slough
In such a manner you may visualize the feature skin among the thirtytwo parts of the body a meditation recommended by the Buddha
When thus brought vividly to life it will help you to alienate and detach yourself from the body
Just as the serpent does not hesitate to fulfill the biological law of its kind in shedding its old skin so right renunciation will not waver or shrink from those acts of giving up which right understanding of reality demands
Just as the serpent does not mourn over the loss of its wornout slough so right renunciation has no regrets when it discards what has been seen as void of value and substance and replaces it by something new and more beautiful the happiness of letting go the exhilaration of the freedom won the serenity of insight and the radiance of a mind purified and calmed
It is the growing strength of this new experience which will gradually clear the road to final emancipation
According to the commentary quoted by us the snake feels disgust towards its old skin when the sloughing is not yet complete and parts of the old skin still adhere to its body
Similarly the disgust felt towards residual attachments and defilements will give to the disciple an additional urgency in his struggle for final liberation
Such disgust is a symptom of his growing detachment
It is strengthened by an increasing awareness of the perils inherent in the uneliminated defilements  perils to oneself and to others
On seeing these perils the whole misery of man's situation the samsaric predicament will gain for him increasing poignancy and the more he progresses in mental training and moral refinement the stronger his distaste will become for what is still unamenable in him to that training and refinement
Therefore the Buddha advised his son Rahula Make disgust strong in you
This disgust is often mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures as an aid as well as a phase on the road to full detachment
Thus among the eight insight knowledges the contemplation of disgust follows upon the awareness of the peril and misery in samsara when formations of existence have become tasteless and insipid to the meditator
And in innumerable sutta passages the Buddha says that when the disciple sees the constituents of body and mind as impermanent suffering and not self he becomes disgusted with them through his disgust he becomes dispassionate and through dispassion he is liberated
The Noble Eightfold Path itself is extolled because it leads to complete disgust with worldliness to dispassion cessation peace direct knowledge enlightenment and Nibbana
When insight is deepened and strengthened what has been called here disgust loses the strong emotional tinge of aversion and revulsion
It manifests itself instead as a withdrawal estrangement and turning away from worldliness and from the residue of one's own defilements
Just as the snake in its effort to throw off its old skin uses as support a stone or the root of a tree similarly the teachers of old say that the striving disciple should make full use of the support of noble friendship in his efforts towards full liberation
A friend's watchful concern his wise counsel and his inspiring example may well be of decisive help in the arduous work of freeing oneself from the burdensome encumbrance of passions frailties and tenacious habits
Often and emphatically the Buddha praised the value of noble friendship
Once the venerable Ananda who was so deeply devoted to the Master spoke of noble friendship as being half of the holy life believing he had duly praised its worth
The Buddha replied Do not say so Ananda do not say so it is the entire holy life to have noble friends noble companions noble associates
If this holds true for the spiritual life of a monk there are additional reasons for cherishing noble friendship within the common life of the world with all its harshness and perils struggles and temptations and its almost unavoidable contact with fools and rogues
Noble friendship so rare and precious is indeed one of the few solaces which this world can offer
But this world of ours would be truly disconsolate if besides the solace of friendship it did not harbor the still greater solace of the Buddha's compassionate message of an open way to final deliverance from suffering
The word monk has to be taken here in the same sense as explained in the old commentary on the Satipatthana Sutta
Now what is it that should be given up finally and without regret
Our text calls it the here and the beyond using Pali words that originally signified the two banks of a river
The here is this world of our present life experience as human beings the beyond is any world beyond the present one to which our willed actions may lead us in our future existences in samsara the round of rebirths
It may be a world of heavenly bliss or one of hell like suffering or a world which our imagination creates and our heart desires for life in any world beyond the present one belongs as much to the totality of existence as life on earth Nibbana alone being the beyond of existence
The phrase the here and the beyond also applies to all those various discriminations dichotomies and pairs of opposites in which our minds habitually move the lower and the higher the inner and the outer the good and the bad acceptance and rejection
In brief it signifies the everrecurring play of opposites and as this play maintains the game of life with its unresolvable dissatisfactions disappointment and suffering the Buddha calls on us to give it up
The overcoming of the opposites the detachment from both sides is one of the recurrent themes of the Sutta Nipata
Among the various pairs of opposites structuring our thoughts attitudes and feelings the most prominent is that of the lower and the higher All the numerous religious ethical social and political doctrines devised by man employ this dichotomy and though their definitions of these two terms may differ enormously they are unanimous in demanding that we give up the low and attach ourselves firmly and exclusively to whatever they praise as high higher or highest
Sutta Nipata v

However in any area of human concern secular or religious clinging to discriminations of high and low is bound to result in suffering
When we are attached to anything high if the object changes we will meet with sorrow if our attitudes change we will find ourselves feeling flustered and discontent
But despite their repeated experience of transiency and despite all their prior disappointments men still foster the vain hope that what they cherish and cling to will remain with them forever
Only those few with little or no dust in their eyes understand that this play of opposites on its own level is interminable and only one the Buddha has shown us how to step out of it
He the Great Liberator showed that the way to genuine freedom lies in relinquishing both sides of the dichotomy even insisting that his own teaching is only a raft built for crossing over and not for holding on to
Majjhima Nikaya 
Do you see my disciples any fetter coarse or fine which I have not asked you to discard
Majjhima Nikaya 
One should however know well and constantly bear in mind that the relinquishing of both sides the transcending of the opposites is the final goal  a goal which comes at the end of a long journey
Because this journey unavoidably leads through the ups and downs of samsara the traveler will repeatedly encounter the play of opposites within which he will have to make his choices and select his values
He must never attempt to soar above the realm of opposites while illequipped with feeble wings or else his fate like that of Icarus will be a crash landing
For a time to the best of his knowledge and strength he must firmly choose the side of the higher against the lower following what is beneficial from the standpoint of the Dhamma and avoiding what is harmful
But he should regard his choices and values as a raft not clinging to them for their own sake always ready to leave them behind to embark on the next phase of the journey
While still on the mundane plane he must never forget or belittle the presence within himself of the lower the dark side of his nature and he must learn to deal with this wisely with caution as well as firmness
To cross the ocean of life and reach the other shore safely skill is needed in navigating its currents and crosscurrents
In adapting oneself to those inner and outer currents however one must always be watchful
The currents can be powerful at times and one must know when it is necessary to resist them
Sometimes right effort has to be applied to avoid or overcome what is evil and to produce and preserve what is good
At other times it is wise to restrain excessive and impatient zeal and revert to a receptive attitude allowing the processes of inner growth to mature at their own rate
By wisely directed adaptation we can learn to give full weight to both sides of every situation  to the duality in our own nature and in the objective circumstances we face
Only by confronting and understanding the two sides within one's own experience can one master and finally transcend them
An increasingly refined response to the play of opposites will teach one how to balance harmonize and strengthen one's spiritual faculties by reducing excess and making up deficiencies
When it concerns two equally positive qualities  such as the faculties of energy and calm  one will naturally prefer to strengthen the weaker side instead of reducing the stronger thus reestablishing the balance of faculties on a higher level
Only by a harmonious balance of highly developed faculties can one move on to the next phase of progress the transcending of both sides the final comprehension and mastery of merely apparent opposites such as firmness and gentleness which appear opposed only when isolated or unbalanced
This harmony which is dynamic and not static gains perfection in the equipoise and equanimity of the arahant the Liberated One an equanimity far wider deeper and stronger than any the ordinary man can even envision
On the emotional level the arahant's equanimity is marked by perfect and unshakable equipoise in the midst of the vicissitudes of life and in the face of all the problems and conflicts which may come within the range of his experience
This equanimity is not indifferent aloofness but a balanced response to any situation  a response motivated and directed by wisdom and compassion
On the volitional and active level the arahant's equanimity appears as freedom from partiality as a thoughtful choice between action and nonaction again motivated by wisdom and compassion and as perfect equipoise when the choice has been made
On the cognitive and intellectual level his equanimity shows up in a balanced judgment of any situation or idea based on a mindful and realistic appraisal it is the equipoise of insight that avoids the pitfalls of extreme conceptual viewpoints
This is the triple aspect of the arahant's equanimity as an embodiment of the middle path rising above the extremes and opposites
In each verse of the poem the giving up of the here and the beyond mentioned in the refrain is connected with the abandonment of certain mental defilements basic distortions of attitude and understanding mentioned in the first lines of the verse
The purport behind this connection is that only if the mental defilements mentioned in the first lines are eliminated entirely  as stated expressly in verses and  can one rise above the opposites involved in those defilements
Only by entire elimination are the defilements eradicated in their lower and higher coarse and subtle forms in their manifest and latent states
If even a minute residue of them is left it will suffice to revive the full play of the opposites and a recurrence of the extremes
No member of a pair of opposites can exclude the influence of its counterpart and remain stationary within the same degree of strength or weakness
There is a constant fluctuation between high and low as to degree of the defilements as to evaluation of mental qualities and as to forms of existence to which the defilements may lead
It is the complete uprooting of the defilements alone which will make an end of rebirth  of the here and the beyond the high and the low which remain in constant fluctuation as long as the defilements persist
When such an uprooting is made the here and the beyond will be transcended left behind as something empty coreless and alien  just as a serpent sheds its wornout skin
This first verse compares wrath which is vehement anger or rage to a snake's poison that rapidly spreads in the body of the person bitten for snakes or at least some of the species have always been regarded as irascible animals of venomous ire
Wrath is an outcome of hate one of the three powerful roots of all evil and suffering
The term hate comprises all degrees of antipathy from the weakest dislike to the strongest fury
In fact the Pali word kodha used in this verse and rendered here by wrath actually extends to the whole scale of antagonistic emotions
We have however singled out its extreme form wrath because of the simile and in view of the fact that its less vehement forms will find their place under the heading of grudge in verse
Of the evil root hate in its entire range the Buddha says It is a great evil but easy to overcome
It was perhaps for both these reasons that wrath is mentioned here first preceding the other defilements which appear in the following verses
Hate is a great evil because of its consequences
Its presence poses a much greater danger of a straight fall into the lowest depths of inhuman conduct and into the lowest forms of existence than for instance greed or lust another of the three evil roots
On the other hand hate is relatively easy to overcome for it produces an unhappy state of mind which goes counter to the common human desire for happiness
But hate will be easy to overcome only for those who also know of the need to purify their own hearts and are willing to make that effort
For those however who identify themselves fully with their aversions or even try to justify their outbursts of temper  for them hate too is very difficult to overcome and may well harden into a character trait of irritability
Just as a snakebite needs prompt treatment to prevent the venom from spreading rapidly and widely through the body so also any uprising of wrath should be curbed at once to prevent it from erupting into violent words and deeds of possibly grave consequence
The true curative antidote for hate in all its forms is lovingkindness assisted by patience forbearance and compassion
But unless the mind is well trained when vehement wrath flares up it will rarely be possible to replace it immediately by thoughts of lovingkindness
Nevertheless a mental brake should be applied at once and the thoughts of anger curbed without delay for if this is not done the situation may be aggravated by continual outbursts of anger to the point where it gets completely out of control
This temporary curbing of wrath accords with the fifth method of removing undesirable thoughts as mentioned in the th Discourse of the Middle Length Sayings namely by vigorously restraining them
By such an act of firm restraint time will be won to compose the mind for dealing with the situation thoughtfully and calmly
But if the anger thus suppressed is left smoldering under the ashes it may well flare up on a future occasion with greater vehemence
Hence in a quiet hour on the very same day one should try to dissolve that anger fully in a way appropriate to the situation
The Dhamma can offer many aids for doing so
Hate can bind beings to each other as strongly as lust does so that they drag each other along through repeated life situations of revenge and counterrevenge
This may first happen in the here that is within one life or in continued human rebirths
But persistent hate harbors the constant danger of dragging the hater down into a subhuman world of misery beyond the human pale or the hater's fate might be a rebirth among the Asuras the demonic titans of militant pride and aggressive powerurge some of whom in turn seem to have taken human birth as great conquerors and rulers
Whipped up by hate and wrath towering waves of violence and fierce tempests of aggression have swept again and again through human history leaving behind a wake of destruction
Though issuing from the one root of evil hate these upheavals have taken a multitude of forms as racial national religious and class hatred as well as other varieties of factional and political fanaticism
Those who crave for leadership among men have always known that it is so much easier to unite people under the banner of a common hate than by a shared love
And all too often these leaders have made unscrupulous use of their knowledge to serve the ends of their burning ambition and power urge even using millions of people as tools or victims of their own unquenchable hate for others or themselves
Untold misery has been wrought thus and is still being wrought today as history books and the daily newspapers amply testify
Now mankind is faced by the mortal danger posed by tools of violence and aggression made utterly destructive through modern technology and by a climate of hate made more infectious through modern mass media and subtle mind manipulation
So there are indeed reasons enough for curbing wrath individually and for helping to reduce it socially
An appeal for the reduction of hate and violence in the world of today can no longer be dismissed as unrealistic moralizing
For the individual and for mankind it has now become a question of survival physically and spiritually
He however who sees danger in the slightest fault and knows that even slight but persistent resentments may grow into passionate hate and violence will earnestly strive for the final eradication of the deepest roots of any aversion
This is achieved on the third stage of the path to liberation called the stage of nonreturn
At that stage no return to the here of existence in the sense sphere can any longer come about while the end of the beyond that is the existence in the finematerial and immaterial spheres will also be assured
Samyutta Nikaya
Lust is here compared to the lotus flower as a symbol of beauty
Because of its loveliness one too easily forgets that the enchanting blossoms of sense enjoyment will soon wilt and lose their beauty and attraction
But the mere awareness of that impermanence is not enough for it may even add to the enchantment and whet the desire to pluck the flowers of lust again and again as long as strength lasts
But desire often lasts longer than the strength to seek or obtain its fulfillment  and this is just one of the ways in which lust brings suffering and frustration
In a single moment the roots of lust can sink deeply into a man's heart its fine hair roots of subtle attachments are as difficult to remove as the great passions or even more so
Thus the Buddha says that greed is hard to overcome but in the same text he also says that greed is a lesser evil
This statement may appear strange in view of the fact that greed is one of the evil roots and also a form of craving the fundamental cause of suffering
Yet greed is less blameworthy than hate in all those cases where the gratification of lust does not violate basic morality and is not harmful to others for instance in the enjoyment of delicious food sexual gratification within the bounds of the third precept and so forth
Nevertheless all forms of lust be they inside or outside the moral norms are still unwholesome as they chain man to kammic bondage and necessarily result in suffering
Therefore for one who aspires to perfect purity and final liberation all forms of lust coarse or refined are obstructions
All lust wants eternity  but cannot obtain it
For though lust itself may well go on eternally without ever being quenched its objects are all inevitably evanescent
When the objects of lust perish as they must or are unattainable as they often are suffering results for the lusting person and when his desire for a loved person fades and changes suffering will result for the beloved
Lust receives its full dimension of depth as an expression of craving an inexhaustible neediness the state of ever being in want
This craving is the subject of the next verse
Lust is entirely cut off at the stage of Arahatship when desire even for the worlds of refined material form or the immaterial has vanished forever
With the elimination of lust its unavoidable concomitants also disappear the frustration torment or despair of nongratification and the listlessness boredom or revulsion of surfeit
He who frees himself of lust is also free of its both sides attraction and repulsion like and dislike
He too has given up the here and the beyond
Craving is the mighty stream of desire that flows through all existence from the lowest microbes up to those sublime spheres free from coarse materiality
Craving is threefold craving for sensuality for continued existence and for annihilation or destruction
Sensuous craving within that mighty river of which our verse speaks is a powerful whirlpool dragging everything into its depth
The infinity of all craving appears here as the bottomless abyss which vainly longs for fullness and fulfillment
But though it ceaselessly sucks into itself the objects of desire it can never find safety and peace
For like the hunger for food this perpetual hunger of the senses daily craves afresh for gratification The senses are greedy eaters The habit of daily sense gratification produces in us a horror vacui
We fear being left empty of sense experience and this fear an expression of the fear of death stands dark and threatening behind each sensual craving as an additional driving force
We see starkly the partnership of fear and desire in the pathological avarice the hectic grasping and clinging of those old people so masterly described by Moliere and Balzac
Driven by the burning sensation of a void within by a feeling of constant lack and neediness we try to suppress that painful sensation by swelling our ego
We strive to absorb into our ego what is non ego or alien we chase hectically and insatiably after sense enjoyment possessions or power we yearn to be loved envied or feared
In short we try to build up our personality  a persona a hollow mask
But such attempts to satisfy sensual craving must fail
If the supposed ego expands its imagined boundaries then by the extension of its periphery its points of contact with a hostile or tempting world also grow inevitably bringing along a growth of both irritation and neediness
One believes that by the mere gratification of lust what has been appropriated from the outside world of objects or persons becomes a part of the ego or its property becomes I and mine But what the ego thus appropriates from outside it can never fully assimilate
There remains an undissolved alien residue which accumulates and slowly but deeply alters the structure of body and mind
This process will finally end in the disruption of the organism  in death
To some extent this is normal an everpresent process as it is also a formula for the intake and assimilation of food
But if sensory craving grows excessive and becomes an uncontested or only weakly contested master it may well happen that the food devours the eater that the craving and search for sensual nourishment becomes so dominant that it weakens other functions of the human mind and just those which are most refined and distinctively human
Unrestrained sensual craving makes a personality featureless and impersonal it reduces human individuation and thus brings us into dangerous proximity to the animal level which is bare or poor of individuation
Specific sensual enjoyment may easily become habitforming and even compulsive again pulling us down to the animal level of instinctive behavior at the cost of conscious control
A life dominated by sensual craving may turn into a monotonous automaton of sensestimulus craving and sense gratification
Uninhibited sensuality reduces our relative freedom of choice and may drag us by way of rebirth into subhuman realms of existence
We say this not to moralize but to emphasize the psychological effects of sensual craving and to show its implications for our progress towards true human freedom that is towards an increase of our mindfully responsible moral choices
In the threatening effacement of individuation in the rapturous submergence of individuality at moments of highest passion  in these features sensual craving approaches its apparent opposite the craving for annihilation
It is ancient knowledge the affinity of Eros and Thanatos of passionate love and death
Craving for annihilation for nonbeing may be likened to the flooding of the river of individualized life
The waters revolt against the banks the restricting boundaries of individuality
Suffering under their frustrating limitations they seek to burst through all dams in quest of the great ocean longing to be one with it to submerge painful separateness in an imagined Oneness
It is the enticing melody of Unbewusst  hoechste Lust the descent to the mother goddess the cult of the night
On a simpler level the craving for annihilation is the outcome of sheer despair the reverse of worldly enchantment
Worn out by the vicissitudes of life one longs for a sleep without awakening to obliterate oneself as a protest against a world that does not grant one's wishes
As an irrational revenge one wants to destroy oneself or others
In some cases fanatical creeds of violence and destruction stem from this very source
Finally in its rationalized form this craving appears as the view or theory of annihilation expressed in various types of materialist philosophies throughout the history of human thought
Craving for continued existence is the unceasing restless flow of the river of life towards goals hoped for but never attained
It is fed by our persistent hope that happiness will come tomorrow or in a heaven or golden age of our belief
Even when all our toil gives little or no present satisfaction and happiness we console ourselves with the thought that we work for our children or our nation or mankind and each generation repeats that deferred hope
As a longing for life eternal desired and imagined in many forms this craving for existence appears in many religions and philosophies
In Buddhist texts it is called the eternalist view
Craving for existence is the driving force that keeps the Wheel of Life in rotation
If viewed by an unclouded eye this wheel is seen as a treadmill kept in motion by those who have condemned themselves to that servitude
It is a contraption where you are perpetually climbing but can never rise an inch
The beings who rotate in it are again and again victimized by their illusion that the steppingboard before their eyes is the cherished goal the desired end of their toil
They do not know that within a turning wheel there is no final goal or destination and that the end of the world with its suffering cannot be reached by walking on a treadmill
It can be attained only by stopping the driving forces within us  craving and ignorance
Yet those beings who have committed themselves to that wheel still believe that within this truly vicious circle they do get on in life and hopefully speak of progress and evolution
This is the sober and sobering view of existence and the craving for its continuation
But if there were not also a tempting aspect beings would not cling to life and crave for it to go on
We need not dwell here on those tempting aspects high or low as there have been and still are many eulogists of life and its beauties
Hence we shall speak here only of some of the more subtle forms of allurement which the craving for existence takes
Among its numerous forms craving for existence may appear as a longing for variety
This longing frequently makes people seek for happiness somewhere else than in the here and now and in some form other than the one they actually possess
The mirage of a happiness elsewhere becomes a bait that moves further away the closer it is approached ever eluding the hand that tries to grasp it
It is like the fate of Tantalus to which man has become so habituated that he even finds it pleasant saying that it adds spice to life
There are others who thirst after everwidening horizons of life seeking new sensory or mental experiences for their own sake some who are enamored with their own prowess in confronting life and some who enjoy their own creativeness
The latter includes many geniuses in diverse fields who may well be reborn as those deities of the Buddhist tradition who delight in their own creations
Characteristic of this mentality is Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's preference for the search for truth over the attainment of it or Napoleon's words that he loved power just as a musician loves his instrument for the sake of the music he produces on it
Those who enjoy life for its own sake proudly aver that they are willing to pay the price for it in life's coinage of suffering and pain defeat and frustration
Often however this is just a heroic pose which hides feelings of frustration and pride
But even when that avowal is honest and stands firm against pain and failure it will finally break down when body and mind lose their strength or when satiety and boredom set in
It is one of the most subtle and effective ruses of the will to live to lure man on and on dangling before him hope novelty or the gratification of pride
The allurement of far horizons the search for the unknown has tempted many imaginative and adventurous minds and those of a heroic mold it has urged to meet the vicissitudes of life as a challenge appealing to their pride to rise above them
Only in the arahant the liberated one will such detachment in face of adversity be genuine and unshakable
Only he can truly say of himself that he has risen above the vicissitudes of existence that his mind is unshaken by the eight worldly events gain and loss repute and disrepute praise and blame joy and woe
Being free from all three cravings he is free of both sides the longing for life and the longing for death the fear of life and the fear of death
He who has conquered craving has conquered all the worlds the here and the beyond For craving is the triune Lord of all the Worlds their creator sustainer and destroyer and he who is craving's conqueror is also the true world conqueror
Human conceit is here compared with a fragile bamboo bridge
In countries of the East such bridges often consist of just two or three bamboo poles sometimes with a railing of the same material
On such bridges one has to be quite sure of one's balance in order to safely cross a roaring mountain brook or a deep gorge
Human pride is just as fragile and shaky
It may easily be upset by a whiff of public opinion hurt by any fool's snide remark hurled down deep by defeat failure or misfortune
Conceit has its roots in egobelief which may be either intellectually articulated or habitually and tacitly assumed
In return conceit gives a very powerful support to egobelief
It does not tolerate any doubt or challenge of what it prides itself on so much the existence and the supreme value of that precious self
Any attempt to question its existence and its worth is regarded with as much violent resentment as a powerful ruler would exhibit if he were to be subjected to a body search at the border of his country
The noun conceit derives from the verb conceiving
It is indeed a conceited conception to conceive oneself superior to others
But also to conceive oneself equal to another or as inferior  these too are rooted in conceit in an egocentric evaluation of oneself in relation to others
All three are modes of conceit the superiority complex the equality claim and the inferiority complex
This urge to compare oneself with others springs from an inner insecurity that deep within knows and fears the shakiness of the delusive ego image
This triple conceit entirely vanishes only when even the most subtle ego reference disappears
This comes only with Arahatship when the last vestige of the fetter of conceit has been eliminated
The arahant no longer needs the shaky bridge of ego conceit as he has given up both sides the discrimination of self and others and has transcended both the here and the beyond of worldly existence
Like ignorant people who want to pick flowers where none can be expected since time immemorial men have sought in vain for an abiding core and substance within themselves and in the world they inhabit
Or they have hoped to find it beyond their own world in celestial realms and in their gods
Man is driven to that unceasing but futile quest for something immortal by his longing for a state of security living as he does in an entirely insecure world which he constantly sees crumbling around him and below his own feet
Not that the vast majority of men would care for the boredom of living forever in the immobility which any stable and secure condition implies
But they long for it as a temporary refuge to which they can resort as children resort to the soothing arms of their mother after becoming sore and tired by their wild and reckless play
Behind that longing for security be it temporary or constant there looms a still stronger driving force the fear of death the desire for selfpreservation
This holds true for the coarsest as well as the subtlest form of that search for permanency be it a wish for the perpetuation of sense enjoyment in a sensuous heaven or the expression of a metaphysical need or the deep yearning for a unio mystica
This quest for permanency and security may also manifest itself as an urge for absolute power or for absolute selfsurrender for absolute knowledge or for absolute faith
Since man's early days as soon as he first started to reflect upon his life situation he turned his glance everywhere in search of something stable in a world of instability
He looked for it in the personified forces of nature in stellar bodies in the four great elements of matter believing one or another to be the ultimate matrix of life
But chiefly he sought it in those changing forms and symbols of the divine which he had created in the image of his own longings within the scope of his own understanding and for the furtherance of his own purposes noble or low
Firm belief in an Absolute whether a god or a state has appeared to man to be so absolutely necessary that he has used all subtleties of his intellect and all autosuggestive devices to persuade himself to accept this or that form of religious or political faith
He has also used every possible means fair and foul either to coax or to coerce others to recognize and worship his religious or political idols
Often not much coercion was needed as there were always those who were only too glad to sacrifice their intellect and surrender their freedom at the altars of those idols to win in return a feeling of security and doubtfree certainty
Men have too easily believed and made others believe that when there is a word there must also be a real thing corresponding to it thence an abiding core an eternal substance within or behind this transient world
It was the Buddha who urged men to desist from their vain search for the nonexistent and see reality as it is
Sutta Nipata v
He the Awake cleared the way to the open leaving behind the towering edifices of ideologies and the debris in which they inevitably end
Showing up in their hollowness the claims of diverse Absolutes he pointed out that only the hard way of critical examination our precarious and limited freedom of choice and the road of morally responsible thought and action can lead us to freedom from suffering
And only a world that is entirely changeable can give us hope for final liberation
Anything permanent found in the world would necessarily bind us to it forever making liberation impossible
But one who is instructed by the Buddha the Knower of the Worlds will not find any core of permanency in any form of existence high or low nor a core of lasting happiness or of an abiding personality
Such a one will not cling to the here nor yearn for a beyond he will remain unattached to either side
Seeing world and self as void of an abiding core he wins the unclouded vision of reality and finally Nibbana's peace
Grudge is felt towards people by whom one has been wronged or offended or towards those who act against one's interests even if in fair competition
Grudge may also have an impersonal character as a resentful bitterness about one's life if one feels that one has been treated unfairly in life by too long a chain of misfortunes
Such grudge and resentment may show up outwardly as angry words and deeds or may rankle deep in the heart as a gnawing bitterness spreading a dark mood over all that one feels thinks and speaks
With some temperaments it can foster vengeful and aggressive behavior with others an ever dissatisfied or melancholic and pessimistic mood
Habitual grudge and resentment can drain much joy from one's life
When growing into enmity a deep personal grudge  just as strong attachment  may persist and grow from rebirth to rebirth from the here to the beyond repeatedly bringing dire misery to those linked in such an unhappy relationship
Also the impersonal grudge one bears against one's unhappy experiences may well reappear in a young child as an innate mood of resentment and discontent
All these are certainly more than sufficiently harmful consequences for spurring us on to banish grudge from our hearts as soon as it arises
Personal grudge arises from an unwise reaction to conflicts in human relationships
It is avoided and abandoned by forgiveness forbearance and understanding of the fact that people are heirs of their kamma
Impersonal grudge is caused by an unwise reaction to the unavoidable vicissitudes of life  the thus and otherwise of our text
It is prevented and abandoned by understanding and accepting the impermanent nature of existence and again by an understanding of kamma
Fertile soil for the arising of a deepseated grudge is political fanaticism and national racial religious and class prejudices
Such grudges can have a personal or impersonal character or both
For the elimination of this type of grudge the aid of both intellectual and ethical faculties is required impartial examination of facts together with tolerance and a feeling for the common human nature shared with others in spite of differences
Grudge  like all other forms and degrees of aversion  is entirely discarded like the snake's wornout skin at the stage of the nonreturner
Then it loses forever its power to germinate in lives beyond  though even at the earlier stages of the streamenterer and the oncereturner it will have been greatly weakened
There is what may be called a higher form of grudge appearing as righteous indignation and a resentful or even hostile attitude towards evil and evildoers
But even this higher form of grudge as well as its very common lower form will be transcended in a mind that has grown mature in compassion and understanding
Our verse speaks only of thoughts without further qualification but there is no doubt that only undesirable unwholesome and evil thoughts are meant
Skillful and noble thoughts particularly those aiming at liberation should not be burned out from the heart
The commentary to our verse speaks of the threefold wrong thoughts of sensuality ill will and cruelty as opposed to the threefold right thought of the Noble Eightfold Path
The commentary further mentions thoughts of gain position and fame concern for personal immortality excessive attachment to home and country to one's family or to other persons
These latter types of thought apply chiefly to monks since according to Buddhist lay ethics concern for home and family and even a moderate concern for gain and position are not discouraged when they contribute toward the fulfillment of a layman's duties
Yet all these attachments are fetters binding us to the here and the beyond and one day they have to be discarded if the heart's freedom is to be won
But the root thoughts of everything harmful and evil are those of greed hatred and delusion which are expressly mentioned in the Discourse on the Quelling of Thoughts
In that discourse the Buddha sets forth five methods of removing such harmful thoughts from one's mind given in a graded sequence from subtler methods of removal to increasingly coarser approaches
The first method is that of immediately replacing undesirable evil thoughts by their desirable and beneficial opposites greedy thoughts should be superseded by thoughts of renunciation and selflessness hate by thoughts of friendliness love and compassion delusion and confusion by wise comprehension and clarity of thought
The discourse gives here the simile of driving out a coarse peg with a fine one as carpenters do
This method will work best when there is a strong natural tendency to turn away quickly from any inner defilement or outer temptation and to replace these thoughts immediately by their antidote
When this spontaneity of moral reaction is weak or absent this method of replacement may still be workable if one has a fair degree of mind control aided by alert mindfulness and firm determination
These latter qualities however can be gradually acquired or strengthened by mental training until they ripen into spontaneous advertence to the good
The second method makes use of the mental impact of strong repugnance against evil by impressing on the mind the ugliness depravity danger and unworthiness of evil thoughts
This may serve as a transition to or preparation for the first method
The simile in the discourse is here that of a carcass thrown over the neck of a handsome young man or woman who will then feel horrified humiliated and disgusted by it and will do the utmost to discard it
Third when these methods fail and undesirable thoughts still perturb the mind one should deny them attention
One should not think about them or dwell on them in any way but divert one's attention to any other thoughts or activity suitable to bind one's interest
This is the method of diverting the mind by nonattention
Here the simile is that of closing one's eyes before a disagreeable sight or turning the glance in another direction
This approach too can prepare the mind for the application of the first method
The fourth method is to go back to the thoughtsource from which those undesirable thoughts started and to remove them from one's mind
This might be easier than to cope directly with the resulting undesirable thought
Such tracing back to the cause will also help to divert the mind and thus reduce the strength of the undesirable thoughts
In view of the latter fact the simile in the discourse speaks of reducing coarser movements of the body by calmer ones a man who is running asks himself Why should I run and he now goes slowly
He then continues the process of calming by successively standing still sitting and lying down
The commentary explains this method as referring to a tracing of the cause or of the starting point of the undesirable thoughts
The simile however seems to admit an interpretation of this method as one of sublimation or gradual refinement
The fifth and last method is vigorous suppression the last resort when undesirable thoughts eg extremely passionate ones threaten to become unmanageable
This method likened to a strong man pressing or forcing down a weaker person shows the realistic and undogmatic approach of the Buddha which does not exclude a method of suppression where the situation demands it lest a serious worsening of that situation or a deterioration of one's character may occur
By applying these methods says the discourse one may become a master of the paths taken by one's thought processes
The thought he then wants to think that he will think and the thought he does not want to think that he will not think
Thus having cut down craving removed the fetter and fully mastered pride he has made an end to suffering
Hence the perfect mastery of defiled thoughts  their entire burning out as our verse calls it  is identical with perfect holiness in which all the here and beyond has been transcended
The first line of this stanza recurs five more times in the following verses 
This sixfold repetition indicates the importance given to these few words by the creator of this poem the Buddha who sees the deep meaning and clads it in beautiful speech
The first two lines of the stanza if viewed closely are variations of the last two lines which speak of the transcending of both sides  taking the meaning of the Pali words oraparam in their wider sense as explained above
The range of meaning of these first few words is as wide as the world entire the world of diffuseness or plurality
In this context it is significant that the Pali word papañca has also the connotation of lagging behind or procrastination Its overactive partner within that pair providing the extreme of excessive movement is craving which tends to go far beyond what the retarding force of objectified samsara or papañca will allow
Craving produces again and again the disillusioning experience of its own futility and yet again and again it seeks evernew enjoyment now here now there
The failure to which craving is necessarily doomed is caused not only by its own inherent illusions but also on the objective side by the unfathomable diffuseness of the world  that intricate samsaric net of interactions in which the frantic flutterings of craving are invariably caught be it here or in a beyond now or later
The very same ideas as those of our verse are conveyed in the first text of the Samyutta Nikaya
There we read
Without tarrying friend and without struggling did I cross the flood
But how could you do so O Lord
When tarrying friend I sank and when struggling I was swept away
So friend it is by not tarrying and not struggling that I have crossed the flood
What in our verse is called going too far is here spoken of as struggling which has the attendant danger of being swept away all over the wide expanse of the samsaric flood
The lagging behind is here expressed by tarrying which leads to sinking or declining  possibly to the lowest depth
There is a similar metaphor in the verses  of the Sutta Nipata
These two extremes  going too far and lagging behind  point also to basic tendencies of life and mind manifesting themselves in various ways as motor impulses and inertia the phases of opening developing evolving and of closing shrinking receding dispersal and contraction dilution and hardening distraction and concentration hypertension and laxity the flights of imagination and the confinement by habit and routine the will to conquer and the desire for self preservation the wish for independence and for security imperturbable will to believe and unappeasable skepticism and so on
The sets of paired terms given in the canonical texts considered here that is
Being swept away  sinking
have been explained by the Buddhist commentators by corresponding dual concepts taken from the terminology of the Dhamma
A selection of these explanations follows
Where it serves greater clarity the separate commentarial statements on the two texts have been combined paraphrased and amplified by additional comments
By clinging to the defiling passions tarrying and seeking a hold in them beings will sink into a low and unhappy existence in the course of future rebirths and in this life their moral and mental standard will sink and deteriorate or at least they will lag behind stagnate in whatever higher aims they have in their life
Struggling for life's varied aims for what is really a mere accumulation of kammic bondage beings are liable to go too far by aiming at unattainable goals be it the gratification of insatiable desires the pursuit of insatiable ambitions or the fulfillment of unrealizable ideals
In that vain effort beings are swept away carried along in all directions of the samsaric ocean
Driven by craving for continued existence longing after the bliss of a theistic heaven or for any other form of a happy rebirth one goes too far by following one's wishful thinking or one's desire for selfperpetuation and when turning to self mortification of body or mind to achieve these aims one likewise goes to excess
When adopting a materialist creed the view of annihilationism one struggles for an earthly paradise fights fanatically against any religious teaching and may even go so far as to deny dogmatically all moral and spiritual values
In performing evil actions one lags behind falls short of the basic human postulates and deteriorating one will finally sink and be submerged by the samsaric floods
In struggling for the performance of worldly good actions with all their inherent limitations and attachments illusions and frustrations one will be carried away endlessly into the everreceding horizon of the unattainable
In yearning after the past one strays too far from the present and even struggles to bring back the past as for instance when one tries to appear young or in a more serious way to impose one's romantic notions of the past upon the present
By doing so one is carried far away from a realistic grasp of the present
In hoping for the future for a heavenly beyond a golden or messianic age to come or even merely for better luck tomorrow one neglects present effort lags behind in meeting the demands of present situations and sinks into a multitude of fears hopes and vain worries
Given to lassitude one will lag behind fall short in one's achievements and be submerged in sloth and torpor
In the excitement and restlessness of struggling one will be inclined to go too far and be carried away to extremes
But he who avoiding all these extremes walks the middle path and harmonizes the five spiritual faculties  he is one who neither goes too far nor lags behind
After these specific illustrations a few general observations may be made on what may be called the structural or functional nature of these pairs of opposites
Going too far is the extreme development of one single aspect of manysided actuality
But the desire for dominance and evercontinued expansion on the part of that one single aspect has also an activating effect on its counterpart
In the neglected or suppressed function it will rouse the will to selfpreservation and assertion
But apart from such opposition any unrestrained onesided expansion will finally weaken that extremist factor itself
When going too far abroad the distance from its original source of strength will grow and there will be a loss of concentrated energy
The initial recklessly selfassertive factor that set out on a journey of conquest in order to impose itself on the world will gradually be thinned out and diluted in the process
Through those thousand things which it absorbs in its conquering career it will imperceptibly become alienated from its original nature and those thousand influences wrongly believed to have been mastered in the struggle will carry their former master still further away into unrecognized and perilous selfalienation
This is a case of the eater being devoured by what he eats All these characteristics of going too far hold good for external activities as well as for the interplay of the inner forces of the mind
In lagging behind there is a preponderance of heaviness or inertia a lack of selfimpelling force of powerful springy tension and even an aversion against it
As far as there is movement in that tarrying tendency it is of a recoiling centripetal nature
It is the cramped or contracted mind spoken of in the Satipatthana Sutta
This centripetal and recoiling tendency is characteristic of an extremely introverted type of mind
Though an introvert type sometimes goes too far in certain psychological and ideological attitudes generally it is shy and timid or resentful and contemptuous
Recoil from too close a social contact places him on the side of lagging behind An extreme introvert type tries to resist even those slight shiftings of its inner center of gravity called for by the human or psychological environment
All manifestations of lagging behind show a lack of reciprocity and of exchange with the outside world
We may even call it weak mental metabolism since mental activity is also a process of nutrition
While the opposite tendency towards excessive expansion may run the risk of being invaded by an excess of foreign bodies there is here a deficiency of them and this will make for poor adaptability and lack of stimulation for new developments
This may finally lead to such a degree of isolation and inbreeding that here too the neglected counterpart will rise in selfdefense
If its countermove succeeds it may produce a harmonious balance of character unless it starts on a onesided development of its own
But if such a corrective is absent or remains unsuccessful that particular lifeprocess by seriously lagging behind will sink that is deteriorate and may reach a point of complete stagnation
Thus the strands of life's texture meet crosswise in their upward and downward path
In that way they weave the intricate net of the world's diffuseness to which the interplay of these paired opposites adds uncountable meshes
It is through balanced view and balanced effort that one can transcend all these extremes
If one has thus found the harmonizing center in one's life and thought  the Noble Eightfold Path the Middle Way  then the outer manifestations of the inner opposites and conflicts will also fall away like the wornout skin of the snake never to be renewed again
Then there will be rebirth no more neither in the lower nor in the higher realms neither here nor beyond both sides have been left behind
For the Liberated One world migration world creation have utterly ceased
greedless he knows This is all unreal lustfree he knows This is all unreal hatefree he knows This is all unreal The world is unreal in the sense of presenting a deceptive appearance being quite different in actuality from the way it appears to a greedy lustful hating and ignorant mind
The Pali word vitatha here rendered by unreal has both in Pali and Sanskrit the meaning of untrue or false These verses however are not meant to convey the idea that the world is mere illusion a play of the imagination
What underlies its deceptive appearance the flux of mental and physical processes is real enough in the sense that it is effectproducing
The unreality lies in what we attribute to the world and not in the world itself
What now is this world and this all which should be seen as unreal in the sense of being deceptive
When the Enlightened One was questioned about these two words he gave the same answer for both
When there is the eye and visible forms visual consciousness and things cognizable by visual consciousness when there is the ear and sounds nose and smells tongue and flavors body and tangibles mind and ideas mindconsciousness and things cognizable by mindconsciousness  then there is a world and the designation 'world'
Samyutta Nikaya
Samyutta Nikaya 
This twelvefold world process is kept going by craving for the six objects and by attachment to the six sense faculties deemed to belong to a self Craving itself is kindled by the discrimination between likes and dislikes that is choice and rejection motivated by greed hatred and delusion
Sutta Nipata v
It is this egocentered discrimination of like and dislike that gives to the world its deceptive coloring  its semblance of reality meaning and value  which is derived from those subjective emotions
But he who is neither carried away by the unreal nor recoils from the real  and thus neither goes too far nor lags behind  he is able to remove that deceptive coloring and to gain dispassion
When the coloring fades away the bare processes of body and mind will appear in their true nature as being void of a core of permanence happiness and selfhood
In the sense of that triple voidness too this world is unreal
Sutta Nipata v
Through freedom from lust and greed there is the final fading away of the fictive reality bestowed by attraction
Through freedom from hatred there is the final fading away of the fictive reality bestowed by aversion and aggression
Through freedom from delusion greed and hatred come to an end and there is the final fading away of all vain hopes and fears concerning the world and of all delusive ideologies about it
A text in the Itivuttaka of the Pali canon speaks of the ideological extremes of eternitybelief and belief in annihilation using figurative expressions similar to those of our Uraga Sutta
And how O monks do some stick fast
Deities and human beings for the most part love existence delight in existence rejoice in existence
When Dhamma is taught to them for the ceasing of existence their minds do not take to it do not accept it and do not become firm and resolute
Thus it is that some stick fast
And how do some run too far
Some feel ashamed humiliated and disgusted by that same existence and they welcome nonexistence in this way Sirs when with the breaking up of the body after death this self is cut off annihilated does not become any more after death  that is peaceful that is sublime that is true
Thus it is that some run too far
And how do those with eyes see
Here a monk sees what has become as become he has entered upon the way to dispassion for it to the fading away of greed for it to its cessation
This is how those with eyes see
Dormant tendencies are mental defilements which have become so strong that from a state of latency they easily become active in reaction to appropriate stimuli
These dormant tendencies are as it were the deepest strata of three levels on which defilements may exist
At the first level the most obvious and the coarsest the defilements become manifest in unwholesome evil deeds and words
This is called the level of moral transgression which can be temporarily controlled by morality
The second level is that of a purely mental involvement namely in defiled thoughts
It can be temporarily suppressed by jhana meditative absorption
The third level is that of the dormant tendencies
These are gradually eliminated by wisdom arising in the four stages of final emancipation
At the first stage of emancipation streamentry the tendencies to false views and skeptical doubt are eliminated
At the second stage oncereturning the gross forms of the tendencies of sensual desire and ill will are eliminated
At the third stage nonreturning the residual tendencies of sensual desire and ill will are eliminated
At the fourth stage Arahatship all remaining unwholesome tendencies have disappeared  those of conceit desire for any new becoming and ignorance
Our clinging to habitual desires and their objects on the one hand and our emotional rejections and aversions on the other  these are the main feeders of the hidden but powerful tendencies in our minds
The tendencies in turn strengthen our habitual reactions of grasping and repelling making them almost automatic
Thence they become potent unwholesome roots of evil by way of greed or hate while the unthinking state of mind in which we so react is the third evil root delusion
It is mindfulness that can check the unrestricted growth of those unwholesome tendencies
At the beginning mindfulness may not be strong enough to prevent the arising of every instance and degree of mental defilement
But when these defilements in their manifestation are confronted by awareness and resistance they will no longer bring an increase in the strength of the dormant tendencies
They are finally silenced however only by an arahant in whom all unwholesome roots have been expunged The arahant has abandoned both sides of the tendencies those of attraction and repulsion
Being freed of all fetters that bind to existence he has given up the here and the beyond the high and the low of samsara
Anxiety and attachment from which similar states of mind are born can be interpreted here as forms of dormant tendencies as basic moods causing appropriate manifestation
Anxiety appears as anguish fear and worry and as feelings of tension oppression and depression caused by those emotions
Also inner conflict may be included here especially as the Pali word daratha has the primary meaning of split
Hence the range of what we have called anxiety may extend to the dark moods resulting in cares and worries which make the heart heavy anxieties proper fears for oneself and for others fear of death and fear of life the tension and agitation caused by inner conflict the feelings of insecurity helplessness and loneliness the primordial anguish rooted in those former three and in the fear of the unknown
All these moods and feelings create a negative emotional background in the character which may color one's human relationships and influence decisions of consequence
It may also throw a deep shadow over one's attitude to life in general and may lead to a shirking of reality to a recoil from it
When anguish and worry continue to grow in the mind without finding relief they may become a cause of the anxiety neurosis which is so widespread in times of emotional and social insecurity
But anguish and anxiety are inherent in human life itself and their presence in the human mind is not limited to times of particular stress and turbulence
How poignantly the weight of anguish was felt even in ancient India has found a moving expression in words that were once addressed to the Buddha
Samyutta Nikaya
Trans
Soma Thera
Attachment via states born of attachment leads to entanglements in the thicket of life
These entanglements through attachment are of many kinds and they throw over man the widespread catchnet of craving
Apart from those that are openly seductive others appear in an innocuous or respectable guise or are rationalized in more or less convincing ways
Attachments can be pursued actively or enjoyed passively
Of the innumerable forms they may take only a very few will be mentioned here
There is the whole scale of fivesense enjoyment with sex as its strongest sex in all its varieties coarse and refined with all its trappings and subservient arts and enticements
There is the enchantment of beauty in nature and art with man's creative or receptive response
There is the insatiable craze to get and to grasp the fierce determination to hold and hoard thirst for power and domination in the smallest circle and on a worldwide scale
On the passive side there is the felt need and the inner satisfaction to obey and submit the gregarious instinct and the wish to creep under the protective shelter of this or that personal or group relationship the comfortable feeling of following habits and custom hero worship and leader cult
And there is also the mystic's loving surrender to his god which of course can have an ennobling effect on the mind and yet is an intoxication of the soul just like the attachment to the bliss of meditation for its own sake
States born of attachment are at the root of the entire life process on all its levels
Hence their variety is inexhaustible
Some may show man at his lowest and others at his most refined level
There are attachments that can inspire man to noble virtues such as loyalty or selfsacrificing love and to sublime creativity in many fields
But even the most lofty heights reached by refined attachment are no safeguard against a plunge into the lowest depths if one unwarily entrusts oneself to the dangerous gradient of attachment
Therefore the wise will strive to detach themselves from the high as well as the low from the here of earthly attachments and from the beyond of their divine and subtle forms
The Master said Do you see my disciples any fetter coarse or fine which I have not asked you to discard Anxiety and attachment produce each other but they also set limits to each other
Craving breeds anxiety craving breeds fear says the Dhammapada
And fear and anxiety on their part give rise to an intensified attachment to what is threatened and to a craving for the means to attain security
On the other hand greed may sometimes be restrained by fear both in individuals and in nations
But greed may also put shackles on fear thus disregarding fear's warnings a person may set out on a perilous course to satisfy his desires
Anxiety and attachment  these two well up from an unfathomable past and again and again become as our text says conditions for renewed existence here and beyond
For anxiety our text specifies a rebirth here in this human existence
Anxiety in all the aspects we have mentioned is so deeply embedded in the human situation that it may sometimes drag to rebirth as strongly as craving does
For that typical human mood of anguish we have quoted earlier a voice from the Buddha's own days
Closer to our days it was that great and radical Christian Soren Kierkegaard who held that the human predicament demanded from those who seriously desired salvation an anxious concern and even despair
The Buddha however as a teacher of the Middle Way advocated neither a mood of despair nor of facile appeasement
In his earnest disciples he instilled a sense of urgency like that of one whose turban is on fire And on the side of attachment he urged his disciples to show keen desire for the task of liberation
The arahant however has transcended both sides even in their beneficial aspects
He is free from anxious concern and free from any clinging
When in the arahant all defiling tendencies have been silenced and become nonexistent they can no longer provide a soil for the growth of the five hindrances which in jhana and in the worldling's insight are only temporarily suppressed
The pair of opposites in the moral sphere sensedesire and ill will can no longer impede and these painful inner barbs can no longer irritate
The extremes in temperament sloth and agitation cannot arise and disturb the serenity of one who has reached the perfect equipoise of the faculties of energy and calm nor can there be any doubtful wavering in one of perfect wisdom
It is for these reasons that in this last verse of our text the arahant is portrayed as being doubtfree and serene and free of inner barbs
The five hindrances illustrate once more some of the strands that keep the skin  be it fresh or partly wornout  attached to the body
Unhindered by them and free from all that has been worn out the Liberated One serenely goes his way into the Trackless  Nibbana
The concluding two lines too point to a wider significance
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The awakened one the Buddha said
Here O Monks a disciple lets his mind pervade one quarter of the world with thoughts of unselfish joy and so the second and so the third and so the fourth
And thus the whole wide world above below around everywhere and equally he continues to pervade with a heart of unselfish joy abundant grown great measureless without hostility or illwill
The virtue of mudita ie finding joy in the happiness and success of others has not received sufficient attention either in expositions of Buddhist ethics or in the meditative development of the four sublime states of which mudita is one
It was therefore thought desirable to compile this little book of essays and texts and to mention in this introduction a few supplementary features of this rather neglected subject
It has been rightly stated that it is relatively easier for man to feel compassion or friendliness in situations which demand them than to cherish a spontaneous feeling of shared joy outside a narrow circle of one's family and friends
It mostly requires a deliberate effort to identify oneself with the joys and successes of others
Yet the capacity of doing so has psychological roots in man's nature which may be even deeper that his compassionate responses
There is firstly the fact that people do like to feel happy and would prefer it to the shared sadness of compassion
Man's gregarious nature already gives him some familiarity with shared emotions and shared pleasure though mostly on a much lower level than that of our present concern
There is also in man not only an aggressive impulse but also a natural bent towards mutual aid and cooperative action
Furthermore there is the fact that happiness is infectious and an unselfish joy can easily grow out of it
Children readily respond by their own smiles and happy mood to smiling faces and happiness around them
Though children can be quite jealous and envious at times they also can visibly enjoy it when they have made a playmate happy by a little gift and they are then quite pleased with themselves
Let parents and educators wisely encourage this potential in the child
Then this seed will quite naturally grow into a strong plant in the adolescent and the adult maturing from impulsive and simple manifestations into the sublime state of unselfish joy
Thus here too the child may become the father of a man Such education towards joy with others should of course not be given in a dry didactic manner but chiefly in a practical way by gently making the child observe appreciate and enjoy the happiness and success of others and by trying himself to create a little joy in others
This can be aided by acquainting the child with examples of selfless lives and actions for his joyful admiration of them
This feature should not be absent in Buddhist youth literature and schoolbooks throughout all age groups
And this theme should be continued in Buddhist magazines and literature for adults
Admittedly the negative impulses in man like aggression envy jealousy etc are much more in evidence than his positive tendencies towards communal service mutual aid unselfish joy generous appreciation of the good qualities of his fellowmen etc
Yet as all these positive features are definitely found in man it is quite realistic to appeal to them and activate and develop that potential by whatever means we can in our personal relationships in education etc
If it were impossible to cultivate the Good I would not tell you to do so said the Buddha
This is indeed a positive optimistic assurance
If this potential for unselfish joy is widely and methodically encouraged and developed starting with the Buddhist child and continued with adults the seed of mudita can grow into a strong plant which will blossom forth and find fruition in many other virtues as a kind of beneficial chain reaction magnanimity tolerance generosity friendliness and compassion
When unselfish joy grows many noxious weeds in the human heart will die a natural death jealousy and envy ill will in various degrees and manifestations coldheartedness miserliness and so forth
Unselfish joy can indeed act as a powerful agent in releasing dormant forces of the Good in the human heart
We know very well how envy and jealousy can poison a man's character as well as the social relationships on many levels of his life
They can paralyze the productivity of society on governmental professional industrial and commercial levels
Should not therefore all effort be made to cultivate their antidote that is mudita
Mudita will also vitalize and ennoble charitable and social work
While compassion is or should be the inspiration for it unselfish joy should be its boon companion
Mudita will prevent compassionate action from being marred by a condescending and patronizing attitude which often repels or hurts the recipient
Also when active compassion and unselfish joy go together it will be less likely that works of service turn into dead routine performed indifferently
Indifference listlessness boredom are said to be the 'distant enemies' of mudita
They can be vanquished by an alliance of compassion and unselfish joy
In him who gives and helps the joy he finds in such action will enhance the blessings imparted by these wholesome deeds unselfishness will become more and more natural to him and such ethical unselfishness will help him towards a better appreciation and the final realization of the Buddha's central doctrine of Noself
He will also find it confirmed that he who is joyful in his heart will gain easier the serenity of a concentrated mind
These are indeed great blessings which the cultivation of joy with others' happiness can bestow
Nowadays moral exhortations fall increasingly on deaf ears whether they are motivated theologically or otherwise
Preaching morals with an admonishing finger is now widely resented and rejected
This fact worries greatly the churches and educators in the West
But there are ample indications that this may more or less happen also in the Buddhist countries of the East where ethics is still taught and preached in the old hortatory style and mostly in a rather stereotype and unimaginative way with little reference to presentday moral and social problems
Hence modern youth will increasingly feel that such moralizings are not their concern
In fact within the frame of the Buddhist teachings which do not rely on the authoritarian commandments of God and church but on man's innate capacity for selfpurification such conventionalized presentation of ethics which chiefly relies on overworked scriptural references must appear quite incongruous and will prove increasingly ineffective for young and old alike
The need for reform in this field is urgent and of vital importance
It was also with this situation in view that the preceding observations have stressed the fact that a virtue like unselfish and altruistic joy has its natural roots in the human heart and can be of immediate benefit to the individual and society
In other words the approach to a modern presentation of Buddhist ethics should be pragmatic and contemporary enlivened by a genuine and warmhearted human concern
In this troubled world of ours there are plenty of opportunities for thoughts and deeds of compassion but there seem to be all too few for sharing in others' joy
Hence it is necessary for us to create new opportunities for unselfish joy by the active practice of lovingkindness and compassion in deeds words and meditative thought
Yet in a world that can never be without disappointments and failures we must also arm ourselves with the equanimity to protect us from discouragement and feelings of frustration should we encounter difficulties in our efforts to expand the realm of unselfish joy
Mudita  unselfish or sympathetic joy  is one of the most neglected topics within the whole range of the Buddha Dhamma probably because of its subtlety and of the wealth of nuances latent within it
Besides getting honorable mention within the context of The Four Divine Abidings few commentators have had much more to say about it apart from explaining that it means sympathetic joy at the good fortune or success of others Only one notable writer Conze has had the insight to suggest that mudita ie
sympathy is a prerequisite of metta and of karuna
He thus names appreciation as one of the components of mudita
How right he is
For one cannot appreciate another person without seeing some good in him
If one does not appreciate the other person in the slightest degree one would be hard put to experience joy at any stroke of good fortune or success that may befall him
To stimulate feelings of pleasure when in fact one feels none would be the grossest of hypocrisy
Thus mudita tacitly implies looking for the good in others and learning to recognize and admire what good there is
Likewise if one has a misanthropic view of mankind regarding people as essentially evil and not worth being concerned about one cannot on the face of it make much headway with any of The Four Divine Abidings
To have a sympathetic attitude towards human beings does not betoken an idealization of man but rather a realistic appraisal that though often in error and grievously at fault man has nevertheless the potential to rise above his darkness and ignorance into the light of knowledge and even to undreamed of heights of Nirvana
Unless one has that measure of faith and confidence in mankind which the Buddha himself had the practice of metta and karuna is impossible
Thus the broadest and most simple aspect of mudita as sympathy towards mankind is also the most basic and important
To regard mudita as being relevant only on certain relatively rare occasions when our friends and acquaintances come into a bonanza of some kind is to fragment it and render it trivial thereby missing the essential matrix
It should not be regarded as a matter of turning on a tap from which mudita will gush forth
There should be in a certain sense a quiet stream of sympathy and understanding flowing within the individual all the time
Though to be sure it does also mean developing the capacity to participate in another person's finest hour and doing so spontaneously and sincerely
It is indeed a depressing fact that people are much more ready to sympathize with the misfortunes of others than to rejoice with them a psychological quirk in people which wrung from Montaigne the ironic statement
There is something altogether not too displeasing in the misfortunes of our friends
Turning back to the essential matrix of mudita as sympathy towards mankind faith in its potential for good and acceptance of its worthwhileness this is precisely what is lacking in the world today
There is abroad a kind of cosmic gloom and among some large sections of people a feeling of defeatism
Probably the scene is largely colored by the shadow of the hydrogen bomb and the various other horrible weapons of destruction which we know the nations are so busy in manufacturing
All in all too much has happened in too short a time
More scientific and technological discoveries have been telescoped into the last fifty years than in the previous five hundred and the total result is at the moment of dubious benefit to humanity as a whole though of inestimable worth to the new millionaires who have managed to muscle in on the expanding economy
Electric and nuclear power the spectacular forging ahead of communication transport and industry have brought in their wake such negative byproducts as overpopulation more and more urbanization into colossal concentrated centers such as Tokyo New York and London which in turn has given rise to other unfortunate results both physical and psychological pollution from industrial waste destruction of natural resources individual desocialization alienation stress as evidenced by the delinquency figures the drift to drugs character disorders feelings of the meaninglessness of life rise in crime wanton destructiveness despair suicide
We know that such ills have always existed in society and that probably they always will to some degree but the frightening thing about the present situation is that they are insidiously increasing in spite of the fact that many people and especially the youth have never had it so good
As it is man feels more insecure than ever more uncertain and lost
Viewing these symptoms many people throughout the world have drawn the conclusion that man has arrived at the period of moral decline and disintegration and that humanity has become so depraved as to be hopelessly beyond redemption or recall
Such a view has always been characteristic of old age
We can with a certain degree of amusement read the lines
The above admonition was composed in ancient Egypt during the Middle Kingdom thousands of years ago but the words are those which every generation hears
There is a proneness in periods of crisis and transition to conjure up in the mind a fantasy of a previous golden age when people were of sterling worth and life was lived in accordance with the noble virtues
But we may well ask when was there such an age and where
If people who harbor such quaint notions were to read history they would realize that such a belief is just about as valid as that there ever was a time when flowers bloomed for ever and sweethearts were always true in the words of the old song
Ancient history and the Middle Ages are definitely OUT as far as morality is concerned
Without going so far back merely a couple of hundred years Smollett wrote this of eighteenth century England
Commerce and manufacture flourished to such a degree of increase as has never been known in this island but this advantage was attended with an irresistible tide of luxury and excess which flowed through all degrees of people breaking down all the bounds of civil policy and opening a way for licentiousness and immorality
The highways were infested with rapine and assassination the cities teemed with the brutal votaries of lewdness intemperance and profligacy
In the nineteenth century Wordsworth wrote
And James Hemming a modern writer in his book Individual Morality
Nineteenthcentury London was frequently shaken by the destructive antics of informally organized hooligan gangs of young aristocrats
Those young roughs having idled away their days spent their nights beating people up smashing up coffee stalls alarming women and such like  the Bucks the Corinthians and all their imitators and hangerson
Such bands were following somewhat less cruelly in the tradition of the nefarious Mohocks who terrorized eighteenthcentury London
Sexual propriety
Quoting again from Hemming
Brothels in the nineteenth century were big business and laws to forbid living on the immoral earnings of women after several rebuffs in Parliament did not reach the statute books till
But this was in England the most progressive country in Europe
There is no evidence for believing that conditions were better on the Continent
Understandably twentyfive years after World War II we are still appalled by the memory of the Nazi gaschambers and the genocide which was their aim
This is by no means an isolated instance of genocide
History bears witness to similar incidents of destructive hate culminating in mass murder
The Albigenses were wiped out to a man and in at the Massacre of St
Bartholomew's Eve thousands of Huguenots were slaughtered Pope Gregory XIII commanding bonfires to be lit and a medal to be struck in celebration
The idea that the mass destruction of one's ideological enemies is justified was already old in the days of the Old Testament
Saul was commanded
Now go and smite Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and ass
All of the foregoing is not intended as apologetics justifying violence bloodbaths or individual or collective acts of immorality but merely to dispel the myth that there was ever a previous idyllic phase when man could have said with some semblance of truth
So let us lay to rest forever the belief that in the past men were truer kinder more upright and generally more worthy than they are today
Let us give that piece of romantic fiction the respectable funeral that it deserves
Our ancestors and predecessors were no better than we are and we are certainly not worse than they were
In many respects we have improved considerably on the ways of our forbears
Actually there has been a great deal of progress considering that slavery hung on in England until in America till and serfdom in Russia till
And in spite of the injustices and lack of moral scruples that still exist there is more awareness kindliness and sensitivity in many human societies than there has ever been before
Today when a national disaster of great magnitude occurs in a country quite often the rest of the world rallies around and helps  perhaps not to the extent that it should but nonetheless to some extent
Such a broadening expansion of the human conscience would have been deemed a Utopian ideal in former times and impossible
When acts of genocide were perpetrated in the past people just accepted it that was that and there was nothing to be done about it
In our time the whole world was revolted by the Nazi gaschambers eventually rose against the loathsome disease of Fascism and smashed it even thought it took the combined might of the allied force five years of bitter conflict to do so
However in the past without exception whatever was inflicted upon a people they mostly took
Today they don't  they protest they demonstrate they kick up a fuss
They have become articulate because they have realized that the greatest evil of all is not poverty racialism or war but powerlessness
Naturally such an unexpected show of interest in public affairs is embarrassing to governments accustomed to an inert and docile population and there is some wistful talk by diehards of the silent majority but the present indications are that the silent majority is likely to become a silent minority in the face of such urgent problems as overpopulation and destruction of natural resources which if left unchecked will make the earth uninhabitable within a foreseeable future
However against this general tendency is the lamentable fact that nothing was done about the rape of Tibet and even now there are no largescale or forceful protests being made about the genocide that is being practiced in that country by the Chinese
So far from feeling dejected and dispirited about mankind we should be hopeful and buoyant
There would be infinitely more cause for alarm and despair if people were as easy to manipulate as sheep or merely apathetic
The arguing and the restlessness throughout the world is about the principles on which we should run our lives a struggle for values other than the profit motive for ways and means to make possible greater cooperation between individuals and nations and for moral maturity in coping with man's new powers and responsibilities
People discuss argue petition protest demonstrate because of their sympathy compassion and love for mankind
It is very difficult to differentiate between the three or to recognize precisely the line of demarcation where one ends and the other begins because they are illimitable
There are of course others who see in these conflicts only hatred but this view is hardly tenable because it is much easier and much more comfortable to remain uninvolved drifting with the current nor swimming against it
The Ven
Nyanaponika has summed up the interdependence of the Four Divine Abidings in the following quotation
Love imparts to equanimity its selflessness its boundless nature and even its fervor
Compassion guards equanimity from falling into cold indifference and keeps it from indolent or selfish isolation
Until equanimity has reached perfection compassion urges it to enter again and again into the battlefields of the world
Sympathetic joy gives to equanimity the mild serenity that softens its stern appearance
It is the divine smile on the face of the Enlightened One
From The Four Sublime States in The Wheel No
A feature of the BuddhaDhamma is cognizance of the pairs of opposites in the training to get beyond them
The Buddha's method of mental training and development was to teach by first defining unwholesome or unskillful thoughts words and deeds or practices which characterize many of man's proclivities and then to propound their opposites of a wholesome or skillful nature as an achievement to be sought after for the abolition of them both eventually when even the good must be left behind as well as the evil when even the Raft of Dhamma is to be abandoned  after crossing the flood of samsara
The trouble with so many of the unwise is their desire to abandon the Raft of Dhamma before reaching the further shore
The Buddha's method of expounding the negative and the positive the passive and the dynamic aspects of behavior in both abstract and concrete terms is obviously to create awareness of what is to be sought after and nurtured
The basic ignorance featured in Buddhism is not so much a rejection of the truth as it is a failure to perceive it
It is as it were a blind spot in our perception akin to the physical damage of a section of the brain or the nervous system which results in impaired vision or locomotion
In other words the depth of our ignorance may be measured by our lack of consciousness of it
This is why it is so necessary that we should see and recognize our failings and shortcomings if we are to eradicate them
It is also important that we should be mindful of the good that has arisen and to foster and develop it to the point of perfection
To realize our imperfections is the beginning of wisdom  the first light to shine on the darkness of our ignorance
While we are blissfully unaware of unwholesome states of mind within ourselves such states will continue to flourish and their roots will dig deeper into our very being
Just so too in our relationships with our fellow men the unperceived evils will be repeated unconsciously and unrecognized building up a cumulative unhappy future for us under the retributive causal law of karma
In dealing with mudita or altruistic joy we are once more to some extent frustrated with the inadequacy of translations for brahmavihara or appamañña  the former as sublime or divine abode and the latter as boundless state To reduce either of these terms to modern idiom is difficult
The four characteristics grouped under these terms are lovingkindness compassion altruistic joy and equanimity extended to universal application
In their perfection they are sublime and boundless and to be dwelt in as one speaks of dwelling in Peace so we will leave it at that
As with all perfections these four desirable characteristics are the antidotes to the poisons of their opposite imperfections and here is where the recognition of their opposites is apposite
Less has been said or written of mudita than of the other three of these four characteristics perhaps again because of its somewhat clumsy translation
While lovingkindness and compassion are objective reaching out to all sentient beings mudita and equanimity are subjective or personal in their application
It may seem strange at first until we critically examine the source to speak of either selfish or unselfish joy
Joy is an emotional ecstasy arising from pleasure
It is something intensely personal
While we can and do share our pleasures to some extent with others the resultant impact of them on various personalities will vary as widely as the personalities
At times what may give rise to rapturous joy in us when shared may give rise to positive aversion in another
A pertinent example of this would be the reactionary effect of certain music on people of differing tastes
While it is not uncommon for some of the modern generation to literally swoon in ecstasy under the influence of the combination of discordant and dissonant notes and chords others find them anything but entertaining or pleasurable
Here we have what might be termed selfish joy on the part of the participants by those who have to suffer most unwilling participation
For all that within the group enjoying it there is a reciprocity of delight happiness and rapture between the entertainers and the entertained
Superficially then we could say it is not the phenomenon of joy itself that is either selfish or altruistic by nature but that time place and circumstance must all be considered in relation one to the others
However to bring mudita within the ambit of the BuddhaDhamma we need to go deeper into the necessity for cultivating this perfection
What are the opposites to be eliminated by its cultivation
We never tire of asserting the interdependence of every aspect of the BuddhaDhamma no matter which particular facet is being discussed
We have already stated that ignorance is failure of perception and it is true that greed and hatred do arise through the nonperception of their source and subsequent results that basically craving born of ignorance is the culprit and that the purpose of the BuddhaDhamma is to eliminate craving
It is craving that gives rise to jealousy envy covetousness avarice and greed in all of its manifestations
Here it is that mudita when practiced and developed becomes a sublime and boundless state of mind to be dwelt in as a corrective characteristic for their removal
One of the most frequently used similes by the Buddha was that of fire
At times it was the destructive quality of fire that was likened to the destructive nature of the passions
At other times it was the ardent nature of fire that was to be emulated in the pursuance of the path to holiness
In its uncontrolled existence fire is a destructive danger
Under control it is one of man's greatest boons and blessings
In either case it was a motivating force to be reckoned with at all times active potent and energetic
The three roots of evil  greed hatred and delusion  are also known as the three fires On one occasion the Buddha and his band of monks were for the time staying on Gaya Head a mountain near the city of Gaya
From their elevated position they watched one of the great fires that from time to time ravaged the countryside
This inspired what is known as The Fire Sermon which is the third recorded discourse delivered by the Buddha subsequent to his Enlightenment and at the beginning of his long ministry
To the Buddha the world of Samsara was like the flaming plains below Everything is burning said the Buddha burning with the fire of passion with the fired of hatred with the fire of stupidity 
It is these three fires that give rise to jealousy envy covetousness avarice and greed
The craving for possessions the craving for sensual pleasures the begrudged success of others the hatred that is begotten by the gains of others the odious comparison of greater status compared with our humble circumstances these are the fires that burn within us to our undoing
It is now evident why mudita is such an important characteristic to be cultivated
When we can view the success of others with the same equanimity and to the same extent as we would extend metta and karuna  lovingkindness and compassion  to those who suffer grief and distress sadness and tribulation sorrow and mourning then we are beginning to exercise mudita and are in the process of eradicating greed and craving
Developed still further we can reach the stage of sharing with others their joy of possession their financial or social successes their elevation to positions of civic or national importance or their receipt of titles and honorifics
In such a manner mudita is counteractive to conceits of all kinds and its growth and development checks craving's grip
Until we have developed this subjective characteristic within ourselves how can we develop the objective characteristics of metta and karuna
The accumulated possessions results of our greed may give us the pleasure and the happiness of the miser gloating over his hoard of gold
The happiness born of shared pleasures shared love shared possessions shared delights in another's success will surpass the meager selfish happiness of the miser
Unselfish joy multiplies in ratio to the extension of its application quite apart from its purifying effect on our own lives
In anamoli's translation of Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga he uses gladness for mudita with the footnote Mudita  gladness  as one of the divine abidings is always used in the sense of gladness at others' success Buddhaghosa illustrates this by saying On seeing or hearing about a dear person being happy cheerful and glad gladness can be aroused thus 'This being is indeed glad
How good
How excellent' Just as he would be glad on seeing a dear and beloved person so he pervades all being with gladness
In The Analysis of the Sixfold SenseField the Buddha speaks of the six joys connected with renunciation
While such joys are subjective by nature they are devoid of any taint of egoistic craving that could give rise to the cankers of jealousy envy covetousness or greed
These joys arise on the realization of the impermanence of material shapes sounds smells flavors touches and mental states and the renunciation of attachment to them
Altruistic joy is one of the four sublime states of mind  friendliness compassion altruistic joy and equanimity  which together form one related group among the various spiritual or physical exercises generally described as meditation or contemplation
These all have as their common aim the attainment of mental calm or equanimity which is intended in turn to foster the development of liberating insight
A still mind like still water yields a clear reflection of what is before it This is why this particular series ends with equanimity but the route by which it is attained in this case is different from that traversed for the most of the other themes used as a focus for concentration
The others such as meditation on the breath on death on visual objects or on the Buddha the Doctrine and the Order of the Enlightened One are entirely concerned with the selfcultivation of the meditator
Most of these themes are abstract or inanimate while the Buddha and the Order have transcended any power of ours to help or hinder them
So the only person concerned or affected in these forms of training is the meditator
It was doubtless to encourage those wrestling by these means with their own inner weakness or conflicts that the following verse of the Dhammapada was uttered
Let no one neglect his own task for the sake of another's however great let him after he has discerned his own task devote himself to his task
But if this were the whole story it would be difficult for such selfcultivation to serve in turn as a basis for the freedom from bondage to the selfconcept which is the main characteristic of the development of insight
Indeed it was the recognition of the dangers of selfpreoccupation or selfrighteousness liable to arise in these often acute struggles for selfdiscipline that impelled the more extreme exponents of the Pure Land school of Buddhism to abandon selfcultivation in favor of the less exacting path of reliance on the Buddha's transforming grace
But the cultivation of the sublime states represents a less radical form of compensation which while compatible with other practices can help to broaden the meditator's perspective in order to achieve a mode of equanimity which does not imply withdrawal into oneself or indifference to others
The starting point here of course is on the ethical plane in the practice of generosity in practical ways which in order to become interiorized and thereby go beyond mere outward form must be grounded in an attitude of friendliness for all beings without distinction
Since this outlook implies the recognition that all beings are subject to joys and sorrows just as we are it finds a natural development in sympathy  that is to say compassion  for their sorrows and joy in their blessings
The former of these seems much the easier to achieve since it is possible to feel compassion for suffering even in the absence of any positive friendliness for the sufferer whereas it is only possible to share genuinely in another's joy if there is some element of true affection or friendliness present
This is perhaps why on a much lower level of sensitivity the reporting of news seems so heavily concentrated on the side of crimes and disasters which are perhaps felt more likely to arouse interest than happier events and deeds
If the latter arouse any interest at all it is likely to be spiced with envy or cynicism
Not only does genuine joy in the prosperity of others require some element of affection it requires this to be of a quite high order
A great deal of what passes for love is really aimed at mere emotional gratification on the part of the lover for whom the beloved is little more than a prop for acting out some drama satisfying a purely subjective need  the beloved's own needs being treated less seriously
Indeed even apart from outright commercialization a certain habit of bargaining with affections seems remarkably widespread when one begins to take notice of it
In the light of this the ability to feel a genuine joy in another's happiness equal to one's satisfaction with one's own represents a truly sublime state So it is not surprising that in the history of Buddhism which cultivated this attitude systematically there arose an aspiration to share with others not only one's material resources but the spiritual resources described as merit
This aspiration follows naturally enough from the basic theory as to what merit is
Merit is the accumulation of tendencies resulting from enlightened deeds which according to the law of moral causation conduce to the future happiness of the doer
Here he is joyful hereafter he is joyful in both worlds the welldoer is joyful
I have done good is the thought that make him happy
Still greater is his joy when he goes to states of bliss
If the doer is still in a state where only purely personal forms of satisfaction are possible the fruits of merit can only take this form
But suppose he loves even one being so much that if that being is in some state of deprivation he can only be made happy by the improvement of that being's lot then the merit which is due to him can only take effect by benefiting him through that other's welfare
The wider his altruism expands so that purely personal gratifications no longer adequately satisfy him the wider must be the range of the benefit which his own merit would need to bring to others if it is to fulfill its defined function of bringing happiness to him
At the same time his altruistic tendencies will ensure that he will have vastly more merit due to him so his resources will tend to become commensurate with the aspirations for example of Santideva when he says
May I be an alleviator of the sorrows of all beings and a divine medicine to those afflicted by disease
May I be the benefactor and bringer of peace to them until all their bodily ailments and mental tribulations are at the end
The principle of the sharing or transference of merit so much stressed in Mahayana Buddhism is sometimes objected to by Western Buddhists because of a superficial resemblance to the Christian doctrine of atonement which they have rejected
But the principles entailed are not really identical since the Christian doctrine is based on an essential distinction between the roles of the Creator and the created while the Buddhist sharing of merit arises from a combination of the definition of merit and of the nature of altruistic joy
It has a further importance too in that it anticipates the emancipation to be derived from insight into the emptiness of the selfconcept that is to say awakening to the emptiness of the concepts I and mine in terms of ultimate truth
On this level the description mine as applied to merit will finally be seen to be as inapplicable as in the case of any other assumed possession
This was already explicitly set out in one of the Buddha's earliest discourses The Marks of the Notself in which he taught his first five disciples to contemplate each of the five components of personality in the terms This is not mine this I am not this is not my self The fourth of these components is the aggregate of mental tendencies or activities which include merit and demerit
Even on a lower plane than that of perfect insight it can be seen that our deeds are not exclusively ours because no one acts in absolute isolation so that every act involves some stimulus or opportunity arising from activity of others
On the other hand a too persistent insistence on the individual nature of merit can only impede the ultimate awakening to the Notself
This has some bearing too on the reason why friendliness compassion and altruistic joy are regarded as leading to an equanimity which does not imply an indifference to the joys and sorrows of others
In the absence of such a conclusion the alternate sharing of joys and sorrows like these emotions arising on one's own account would be as endless as the worldcycles which it is the Buddhist aspiration to transcend
The goal of the divine states is that the aspirant who in process achieves the role of a Bodhisattva in a twoway empathy with others by his perfect sharing of their joys and sorrows is in a position to radiate to them stability which in turn will help them to be less subject to their own emotional vicissitudes
In this way he and they are liberated together each sustaining the other
Excerpted from The Path of Purification
One who begins the development of unselfish joy should not start with dearly beloved person a neutral person or hostile person
For it is not the mere fact that a person is dearly beloved which makes him an immediate cause of developing unselfish joy and still less so neutral or hostile person
Persons of the opposite sex and those who are dead are not suitable subjects for this meditation
A very close friend however can be a suitable subject
One who is called in the commentaries an affectionate companion for he is always in a joyous mood he laughs first and speaks afterwards
He should be the first to be pervaded with unselfish joy
Or on seeing or hearing about a dear person being happy cheerful and joyous unselfish joy can be aroused thus This being verily is happy
How good how excellent For this is what is referred to in the Vibhanga And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart imbued with unselfish joy
Just as he would be joyful on seeing a dear and beloved person so he pervades all being with unselfish joy
But if his affectionate friend or the dear person was happy in the past but is now unlucky and unfortunate then unselfish joy can still be aroused by remembering his past happiness or by anticipating that he will be happy and successful again in the future
Having thus aroused unselfish joy with respect to a dear person the meditator can then direct it towards a neutral one and after that towards a hostile one
But if resentment towards the hostile one arises in him he should make it subside in the same way as described under the exposition of lovingkindness
He should then break down the barriers by means of impartiality towards the four that is towards these three and himself
And by cultivating the sign developing and repeatedly practicing it he should increase the absorption to triple or quadruple jhana
Next the versatility should be understood in the same way as stated under lovingkindness
It consists in
This versatility is successful only in one whose mind has reached absorption
When this meditator develops the minddeliverance of unselfish joy through any of these kinds of absorption he obtains these eleven advantages he sleeps in comfort wakes in comfort and dreams no evil dreams he is dear to human beings dear to nonhuman beings deities guard him fire and poison and weapons do not affect him his mind is easily concentrated the expression of his face is serene he dies unconfused if he penetrates no higher he will be reborn in the Brahma World
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Mangala Popularly it means lucky sign omen good or evil auspicious or inauspicious or a blessing
In all countries and times there have been superstitions about these things and this is as true of western technological societies as it was of India in the Buddha's days
Though people now may not divine auspices from the shapes of cloth nibbled by rats they have plenty of other signs of fortune and misfortune
For some reason or other signs of fortune are few now in English tradition and offhand the writer could think of only one it is lucky to pick up pins
But unlucky signs and actions to ward off misfortune are many
For instance a few years ago a sister in an English hospital insisted that flowers of other colors be mixed in with my mother's red and white carnations  or we shall have a death in the ward In Australia in the showbiz world to whistle in the dressing room before putting on an act will bring misfortune which can only be averted by leaving the room turning round three times and swearing
Another generally unlucky sign is for a black cat to cross one's path
In Nepal though they consider an overturned shoe to be very inauspicious when one is setting out on a journey
And sailors the world over are well known for their attachment to good signs and dread of ill omens
Less specialized examples can be found in crossing one's fingers and in touching wood against disaster and in the practice of throwing salt over the left shoulder whenever salt is spilt

Certainly a well known Swedish match company did promote the idea of illluck following three smokers who light up on one match
A bit nearer to commonsense is the superstition about not walking under ladders but most of these beliefs are quite irrational like the children's idea that a bad day will follow after stepping on cracks in the pavement when going to school
Even nearer to the Buddhist idea of good omens are dreaming of bhikkhus or temples or seeing a bhikkhu when one comes out of the house first thing in the morning
How such things can be interpreted differently is well illustrated by some Chinese business people for whom the sight of a bhikkhu  one who teaches the doctrine of voidness  at that time is a very bad omen
In Theravaada countries generally the word sumangala is a popular name both among bhikkhus and laymen
But one could keep on and find innumerable examples of the popular idea of mangala
It was the Buddha's genius to show that it is the practice of Dhamma that is truly auspicious
In Buddhist countries there are many works explaining the contents of the Mangala Sutta
Some are in Paali but many are in the languages of the present Buddhist countries of SE
Asia
They are popular books widely read by Buddhists there
Apart from this lectures over the radio and sermons in temples and homes often take the form of a commentary upon this discourse or part of it
English language lacks such a work apart from the translation of the Paali commentary to the Sutta by Ven
anamoli Thera in Minor Readings and Illustrator
The author's book written before this was available helps to fill an omission in English Buddhist literature
As the reviser of this book I have often referred to Ven
anamoli's translation and sometimes inserted some material from that book into this one
Where it was felt necessary some passages by the author have been omitted or rewritten
It is my hope that he will be satisfied with these changes which do not affect the plan of his work
John Dimmick my good Buddhist friend for many years has patiently disentangled and typed the revised copy
The Mangala Sutta is so popular because of the wide range of its teaching within a few easily remembered verses
Also because of its clarity and straightforwardness which is characteristic of the Dhamma as a whole
Here are good omens for everyone real blessings for everybody
You have only to practice

On receiving a gift copy of Dr
R
Soni's book on the Mahaa Mangala Sutta which is an allround summary of the Buddhist teachings for the attainment of peace happiness and spiritual wisdom I realized that it should be republished
I requested Dr
Soni to post a copy of his book to the Ven

In the meantime I appealed to the Venerable Editor to consider its republication
I was delighted that he quickly agreed to my request to publish it in THE WHEEL series
The sutta has been treated in a scholarly manner and presented so lucidly that it can be appreciated by a wide reading public
It contains wisdom which if applied to our daily lives is bound to bring about a moral and spiritual upliftment of all concerned
Through the merit of this publication may the author's and writer's parents attain Nibbaana's peace

Some two years back I shifted my library and manuscripts to Mandalay from my prewar station where the things had remained for over ten years separated from me first because of the war and then because of the insecurity and insurgency in the country
Though several books were found infested with bookworms yet it was a delightful experience to get back the main part of the library intact
The joy however was damped by a profound shock as the contents of a large and precious box were found damaged beyond recognition by white ants precious because apart from some valuable and rare books the box contained several major manuscripts on which I had worked devotedly for over nine years
The files were a heap of wet mud with thousands of white ants wriggling in it
It seemed these destructive creatures had found access to the box during the long journey in the goodstrain
My shock can be better imagined than described
What had been safe from invaders bombs bullets weather and storms was lost through the white ants on the final journey
Truly it was an object lesson in anicca the impermanence of all compounded things
Disheartened but not quite despondent I began immediately to extricate and save everything possible
Hundreds of mutilated and withering sheets were thus reclaimed
Among these were some which had my researches on the phenomenon of rebirth and the psychology of consciousness and also my writing and verses on the Mahaa Mangala Sutta
With happy memories of the sutta thus revived I shortly set to work to rewrite this book
Two pleasant results followed firstly the shock was soothed away by new inspiration and secondly this book was the result
It is hoped that this work will serve a useful purpose but it will remain a moot point as to who should earn the gratitude for producing it the author or the white ants
The Mahaa Mangala Sutta is a rewarding text for the wholesome shaping of complex human civilization
In this work an attempt is made to offer some studies of this important discourse of the Buddha which provides a plan true at all times for the material and spiritual wellbeing of individuals in a democratic society
The discourse provides lessons of direct practical application capable of immediate and fruitful use by people in all walks of life irrespective of differences of sex or status race or religion
These precepts should have wide publicity so that they may be widely used particularly at this juncture in human history when people are coming closer together so that nations need a silken cord to unite them harmoniously into a family of cooperating and trusting members
Only such a transformation can save them from impending and utter disaster which must be expected because of their terrible hatreds greeds and misunderstandings
Conditioning of the individual towards wholesome conduct is really necessary
Such a change of attitudes leads to definite improvement in not only domestic and social affairs but also in national and international ones
For the introduction and promotion of such friendliness the auspicious words of the Buddha reaching us from across the ages provide an excellent guide
The present work introduces this worthy guide and this book is sent out in the faith and hope that it will help lead some people in the world towards better human relationships
It is a happy coincidence that it is starting its auspicious journey from the city that was once the capital of the good King Mindon and which even today is the center of Buddhist learning in Burma

Superstitions and selfish desires weave a pattern of mind which interprets objective and subjective happenings in life as forebodings of personal weal and woe
Thus if on waking up in the morning or on the start of a trip or in the course of a long journey or the beginning of an enterprise or during a sacred ceremony one meets with what is taken to be a sign of good fortune such as a flower in bloom a smiling face good news or even something at first sight offensive but potentially considered good some people feel assured of success in the subsequent course of events
An autosuggestion like this might be of some use but to place complete reliance on it neglecting the action necessary for the fulfillment of success would be too much of wishful thinking bound to result in frustration or failure
So much importance is attached by some people to such omens of what is supposed to be auspicious that a sort of pseudoscience has grown up playing an undesirable role in the lives of those people by choking their initiative by sustaining their fears by suppressing selfconfidence and by the promotion of irrational attitudes in them
In the time of the Buddha such a belief was as much in evidence as today and as he was opposed to anything that fettered the healthy growth of the human mind he raised his voice against such superstitions
He denounced luck or fortune or auspiciousness and proclaimed instead human behavior associations and activities as the real origins of fortune or misfortune Thus the emphasis was shifted from unhealthy fears and fettering superstitions to individual responsibility rational thinking social obligations and selfconfidence
This had farreaching effects in improving both human relationships and the efficiency of the human mind
In Indian society in the Buddha's time people were addicted to superstitions about omens of good and bad luck besides being divided on their nature and implications so it was natural that someone should inquire the views of the Great Teacher the Buddha on the subject
His words of wisdom had already been an immense success not only with ordinary people but also with those in positions of power and those with great learning
A special messenger was therefore sent to meet the Buddha while he was staying at the Jetavana monastery in the garden of Anaathapindika at Saavatthi to inquire his views on omens
The views expressed by the Lord in the Mahaa Mangala Sutta are a masterpiece of practical wisdom
This sutta was recited in the First Buddhist Council by Venerable AAnanda the attendant of the Buddha who had memorized so many of the Buddha's discourses
The Discourse is a charter in outline of family responsibility social obligations moral purification and spiritual cultivation
Within the compass of a dozen stanzas are included profound counsels and golden rules which admirably point out the way life's journey should go if it is to reach the haven of perfect harmony love peace and security
Beginning with emphasis on the need for a suitable environment the Discourse lays appropriate stress on personal discipline righteous conduct and adequate discharge of duties to one's near and dear ones
Then the higher virtues of humility gratitude patience and chastity are introduced
And step by step are reached serenity perception of truth and Enlightenment
A welldrawn chart like this correctly indicates the true course of progress on the stormy sea of life
Not only is the course correctly shown but also the rocks and other perils always to be found on such a journey are clearly pointed out
The wisdom of the Mangala Sutta is emphasized by its spiritual appeal which is firmly planted on this earth while providing wings to soar high into the ethereal regions and beyond
The Buddha as usual in his teachings does not forget the needs and difficulties of the everyday world
Here lies its greatest appeal to the ordinary man who however much he may be fascinated by the ideal of renunciation and fulltime spiritual practice is still attached to the world through contact with family friends and relations and the inevitable duties and obligations that this entails
It is true to say that the appeal of the sutta is universal
A child in school may benefit from it as may a scholar in the university
It is as much applicable to the humblest citizen as to those in power
Though proclaimed by the Buddha it is just as valuable to nonBuddhists valuable in fact for all peoples at all times
Above all the sutta is a wonderful stimulus for reform
It indicates the simple and direct way the Buddha adopted to wean people from superstitions and irrational attitudes so that they could grow and mature towards an enlightened outlook
This gradual method is unique to the Buddha
He made people see luck omens and auspiciousness in quite a new light rejecting superstition and encouraging reliance upon one's own good actions
In consequence signs and omens gave way to his emphasis upon social obligations and duties founded on individual good conduct and leading to a society lighted by understanding and individual hearts enlightened by penetration of the truth
The Mahaa Mangala Sutta is included in that ancient anthology of the Paali Canon called A Collection of Discourses
This work contains a great variety of discourses some upon basic subjects suitable for lay people while others which have great depth are addressed to those who practice Dhamma all the time
The SuttaNipaata is the fifth item of the Minor Collection and is divided into five sections
The Mahaa Mangala Sutta is the fourth sutta of the second of these called the Lesser Section
The contents of this sutta also appear in the first item of the Minor Collection known as the Minor Readings called there simply Mangala Sutta
It is interesting to note that the tenth item of the same collection the Jaataka which has chapters each relating a previous life of the Buddha has as the titles of the th and rd Jaatakas the Mangala Jaataka and the Mahaa Mangala Jaataka respectively
These stories though their contents are different are interesting supplements to the sutta because the same spirit runs through all these texts
The following table clearly indicates the exact location in the scriptures of the Mangala Sutta the Mahaa Mangala Sutta the Mangala Jaataka and the Mahaa Mangala Jaataka
The story of the Mangala Jaataka concerns a brahman said to be an expert in predictions drawn from cloth
Obsessed with the superstition that any cloth however new or costly once bitten by a rat was highly inauspicious he had a valuable garment of his thrown away into a cemetery on discovering a ratbite on it
Hearing that the Buddha had picked up the discarded cloth consternation seized the brahman as he expected illluck to strike down the Blessed One and those with him
He hastened to the Buddha to avert the danger before it was too late
But once in the Buddha's presence he was weaned of his superstition and attained insight into the Dhamma
The Buddha told him of his addiction to the same superstition in an earlier life
The Buddha taught Mahaa Mangala Jaataka about one of his previous births when he was leading the life of a hermit near Benares
He then expounded eight groups of blessings viz unqualified benevolence humility social service liberality domestic felicity uprightness compelling universal respect proper understanding of kammafunctioning and mental peace
The above stories throw considerable light not only on the attitude of the Buddha towards superstitions but also on the emphasis he laid on growing into an enlightened outlook and virtuous life
In the Mangala and the Mahaa Mangala Suttas the latter aspect is further amplified
We have chosen the Mahaa Mangala Sutta as the text of the present work
It has an introduction in prose but its main body is the twelve stanzas
Each stanza has the same number of lines and all the stanzas are in the same meter and have the same refrain
The teachings contained in these verses since they are in agreement with other parts of the suttas are obviously words from the Buddha's lips
The recitation of this composition in the First Council was the work of the Venerable AAnanda hence the words with which it opens Thus have I heard
The title Mahaa Mangala Sutta has three parts namely Mahaa Mangala and Sutta Mahaa means great used as a prefix it enlarges and emphasizes the meaning of the word or expression to which it is attached
Thus Mahaadhana Mahaakarunaa Mahaapatha Mahaapurisa Mahaaraaja
Other examples are Mahaabodhi and Mahaavihaara etc
The prefix Mahaa added to the title of a book or chapter adds weight and importance to the contents
The use of the prefix in this sutta is an indication of its precious worth besides suggesting the recognition of this worth by the arahants who compiled the suttas in the First Council
The component Mangala means an omen good luck an auspice etc
The word also signifies auspicious ceremony eg vivahamangalam naama karanamangala
Such uses of the word are still common in India and reflect the popular and more or less superstitious ideas that the Buddha tried to supplant
The Paali commentators have derived the term Mangala from mam and gala therefore it means that which is obstructive to woe In practice it has the positive significance conducive to weal
Mangala though at times used in a spiritual sense usually has worldly associations
It generally stands for conditions making for satisfaction happiness and prosperity
Thus it is the most yearnedfor thing in worldly happiness and domestic welfare
No wonder any sign or omen any mangala believed to point the way to such happiness is eagerly seized upon
When it is so much of a blessing people will eagerly seek and look for it in physical omens and material signs which they think lead to it
Because of the differences in outlook among various people conflicting interpretation of the omens considered auspicious are naturally found
It was to settle such differences that the Buddha was approached
But rather than condemning some viewpoints or commending certain other interpretations he looked at the subject from a different angle and from a higher horizon with the result that the term mangala assumed a nobler significance
Coming to the last component of the title originally by the term sutta was meant a string or a thread
In fact the word is still used in this sense
Just as beads can be strung together by a thread into a rosary or flowers into a garland successive arguments can be strung together into a logically brilliant whole and sections of a story or a sermon can be threaded together to present a good way to practice
The symbolic use of the word sutta to mean a discourse is this threading together
In English too the word thread has been the symbol of continuity as suggested by the phrase a thread of thought As progressive continuity is obvious in a series of logically connected ideas and events in a narrative it is symbolized by a thread or a sutta
Evidently a knot in the thread represents a concentrated deep idea inviting focused attention for its unraveling
Such reflections result in flashes of wisdom and inspiration
It was in this sense that the thinkers and sages in ancient India used the term sutta also it was in this form that they expressed their thoughts
The Discourse on the Highest Blessings is truly a sutta a threaded collection of gems of the highest blessings in life blessings varied in nature and scope according to the needs of the individual in different stages on life's journey
The sutta really is a sublime garland of blessings full of fragrance radiant with benevolence shining with truth and aglow with practical utility
The Mahaa Mangala Sutta by itself or as part of the SuttaNipaata or of the Khuddakapaatha or as a part of some compilations is available in several editions in the Sinhalese Thai and Burmese scripts with or without translations and commentaries in those languages
The sutta has a special significance in the national life of Burma
It is certainly Burma's most valuable heritage of proven truth
The sutta is one of the first lessons a child in Burma learns by heart
Memorizing it eagerly he recites and untiringly repeats its stanzas naturally with gusto till their constituents seem to vibrate his entire being
And what is more marvelous the effect is lifelong
Even in rash youth and old age the chanting of the sutta coming from the precincts of a monastery or classroom recalls memories of childhood and the need for selfcultivation to direct one's steps towards those actions which lead to peace in one's own heart and happiness for others
Today throughout the length and breadth of the country children and adults are schooled in the Mangala Sutta
There are dozens of admirable books and booklets on the Mangala Sutta available in Burmese
Most of these are recent works and very well written in a way to convey the practical message straight to the heart
Of the older works Mangalatthadiipani a voluminous book of over pages written by Mangalabongyaw Sayadaw at the court of Amarapura in CE
This is not only an impressive piece of classical literature but also an abundant storehouse of welltold stories illustrating moral practical and spiritual values in the sutta
The method is commendable because of its proven value making the listeners and readers understand vividly the practical import of the sutta's teachings
It is good to see that even the latest works freely draw upon this old method
Thus modern Burmese authors while imparting a fresh touch to their writings are wise in not losing hold of the treasurestore of the past
In the present work unfortunately the illustrative stories cannot find a place because they would greatly increase its length
There have been many translations of this sutta some with the Paali some without and it is not possible or necessary to list them here
That there are so many is an eloquent testimony to the popularity of the sutta
In spite of this great appreciation the author does not know any works in English exclusively devoted to the sutta apart from one publication and some leaflets
Considering the value importance and popularity of this precious sutta the need for more and detailed works is obvious
Therefore it seems there is no need for an apology in offering this book to the reader
The plan of the present work is simple the Mahaa Mangala Sutta is presented first in original Paali together with a wordbyword English rendering of it and a more literal translation
Then follow notes and comments explaining the contents
However all the issues do not require exhaustive treatment
While it has been found necessary to deal thoroughly with certain subjects of special Buddhist interest or of a complicated nature others easily intelligible and needing no comments are barely mentioned
In the last chapter the Blessings are classified
It was the author's desire to give a living Burmese touch to this work by assigning a chapter to a captivating contemporary popular song in Burmese on the sutta but the difficulties encountered in rendering this into English proved insurmountable so the attempt had to be given up
In the preparation of this book the valuable assistance received form Ven
Nyanatiloka's Buddhist Dictionary is gratefully acknowledged
The author is also thankful to U Ba Thin and other friends who read the Burmese text to him

Thus have I heard
Once while the Blessed One was staying in the vicinity of Saavatthi in the Jeta Grove in Anaathapindika's monastery a certain deity whose surpassing brilliance and beauty illumined the entire Jeta Grove late one night came to the presence of the Blessed One having come to him and offered profound salutations he stood on one side and spoke to him reverently in the following verse
Here ends the Discourse on Blessings
Discourse on the Highest Blessings the real omens or the most auspicious and lucky actions
The suttas of the Buddhist scriptures begin with these words
The history behind this short sentence is as follows
Some three months after the final Nibbaana of the Buddha when King Ajaatasattu had been on the throne already for about eight years the First Great Council was held under royal patronage at the Sattapanni Cave in Raajagaha the capital where arahants assembled to recite classify and group together the Teachings of the Master
Venerable Mahaa Kassapa presided while the Venerables Upaali and AAnanda rehearsed the Vinaya and the suttas or discourses respectively
The Council finished its work after seven months during which time they arranged the entire Teachings of the Master that is the collections of the Vinaya rules and the suttas
To the Venerable AAnanda as he was most learned in the Master's discourses fell the arduous task of rehearsing the suttas in the Great Council
He prefixed each discourse with the expression Evam me suttam thus personally testifying to the authenticity of the suttas
At that time religious teachings generally were committed to memory so the Buddha's Teachings too were presented at first in this way
Venerable AAnanda's words Thus have I heard were prefixed to the memorized version which thereafter was passed down from teacher to pupil by oral tradition until it was committed to writing for the first time at Aluvihaare in the central province of Sri Lanka about Bin the reign and under the patronage of King Vattagaamani Abhaya
The Council was held at the capital of Anuraadhapura with its conclusion the writing down of the Suttas Vinaya and Abhidhamma at Aluvihaare
The Council was necessary for safeguarding the texts from loss through invasions famines and the whims of kings also from serious alterations and interpolations by unscrupulous people
There is a legend that the Tipitaka was inscribed on gold sheets which were said to have been deposited in the rocks at Aluvihaare
Considering the amount of gold which would be needed this seems very unlikely though some condensed passages may have been inscribed in this way and enshrined
As the Venerable AAnanda was a streamwinner who had seen Dhamma himself as well as being a devoted attendant of the Buddha his words Thus have I heard prefixed to the Mahaa Mangala Sutta as to most other suttas invest these texts with the seal of authenticity
As one of the epithets of the Buddha it occurs frequently in the scriptures meaning having good luck ie auspicious fortunate
It is generally translated as the Blessed One or the Exalted One though the full meaning of One who apportions with the knowledge of what is exactly suitable to them cannot be conveyed in English
The usual formula of homage also has this epithet at the beginning Namo tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammaasambuddhassa meaning Homage to the Blessed One the Liberated One the Fully Enlightened One There are many other titles by which the Buddha is known such as Tilokanaatha Dhammaraajaa Tathaagata Sugata Sakyamuni and Sakyasiiha and so on
The term Buddha itself is not a name but means the Enlightened One the Awakened One which signifies the zenith of perfection supreme and final release from all types of existence or being and the actual attainment of Nibbaana during life
Saavatthi was an ancient city which is identified with the village of Sahetmahet in the presentday Indian state of Uttar Pradesh
It was the capital of the powerful kingdom of Kosala in the th century BThe great merchant and benefactor Anaathapindika whose real name was Sudatta bought Prince Jeta's pleasure grove in this city for a fabulous price and built a monastery which he presented to the Buddha
The monastery was called Anaathapindika AAraama and the grove was known as Jetavana Prince Jeta's Grove
Here the Buddha stayed for twentyfour rainy seasons and gave many important discourses
The Mahaa Mangala Sutta is one of them
In Buddhist teachings there are six realms of celestial beings superior to the human world which together comprise the happy states in the world of sensual desire or kaamaloka
These beings are of greater or lesser splendor and brilliance and they live very long lives enjoying the happy fruits of their past good kamma
On the expiry of this however they gravitate to a rebirth in accordance with their residual merit for the devas make little new good kamma and can be compared to rich people living on their capital which will run out sooner or later
And their new rebirth is not necessarily a better one it may well be worse and even below the human state
Though shortlived and having a coarse body man is in a way superior to these celestials as he can increase his merits by further wholesome actions and can even attain to the highest goal Nibbaana
That is why even celestial beings look to the Buddha for guidance and to Noble Ones for assistance
At the time when the Buddha was teaching in India it is said that not only human beings were divided about what was an omen what was lucky or auspicious and what were really blessings but also celestials were confused on the subject
As no one could decide this matter an assembly of celestials deputed one of their number to visit the Buddha to get his views to clarify their doubts
There are many stories of heavenly messengers visiting the Buddha
They usually visited him late at night as the accounts say when the night was far spent or just before dawn
Sometimes they visited him in human form and at other times they went in celestial form
Sometimes the designation devataa is even used for forestdwelling spirits who also visited the Buddha
In this particular case it was a radiant being from a celestial abode whose presence filled the entire grove with splendor turning the darkest hour of night into more than the brilliance of day
Materialists may consider such a being to be imagination but there are people with personal experience of such forms of existence
These heavens have other states superior to them two more spheres namely the world of subtle form and the formless world
The former have sixteen realms while in the latter the inhabitants are supercelestial and even longer lived their life span running into thousands of aeons
Still they are also subject to change
These celestial and supercelestial regions together with the human realms and the four subhuman planes or the evil states in all totaling planes of existence comprise the range of phenomenal existence termed samsaara literally the wandering on The inhabitants of these planes whether human or subhuman celestial or supercelestial are all alike in this their existences depend on the different types of good and bad kamma made by them
They are alike too in that all are subject to the same law of impermanence suffering and notself the difference being in the quality of their lives with more or less of happiness and suffering opportunities for development or lack of them
These are the fruits of kamma made in past and present lives
All these beings high and low are bound to the incessantly moving wheel of samsaara
If there were no way out each individual would go on forever because of intoxication with greed hatred and delusion and so suffering here suffering there and suffering everywhere  it would have no end
The way beyond what is marked by impermanence suffering and nonself was pointed out by the Buddha who after his supreme awakening to truth showed the path which leads to the final release of Nibbaana
Birth as a human being is best according to the Buddha's teachings for in spite of his frailties man has adequate personal and environmental conditions for scaling spiritual heights while he may have seen enough suffering to goad him on
Thus each human being has the potential to become an arahant or a Buddha though not everyone of course has golden chances and magnificent opportunities still all are capable of raising themselves to some extent and some to heights far above the range of even the highest gods
It depends on how each person avails himself of the opportunities
One should always make the greatest effort to turn one's footsteps towards a good heavenly birth or towards Nibbaana the highest goal otherwise evil kamma may rivet chains which drag one down to sufferings or even into fires of the hells
The Buddha shows the way the pilgrim has to walk that way himself
The Buddha is called the Light of the Three Worlds and any of their inhabitants even the gods may approach him for everyday guidance or spiritual instruction
Usually people go to the gods for guidance but it is the various gods who came to the Buddha with their problems
In this way we can understand the significance of the god's visit mentioned in the Mahaa Mangala Sutta
Here a question is asked to which the subsequent eleven stanzas provide the answer
The question is put by a deva the accredited spokesman of the devaworld
The deva presents to the Buddha not only the contentions about blessings prevalent in the heavens but also those in the human world thus covering the seven happy planes of the sensual world and perhaps more
The points mentioned or implied are
From the above two distinct issues emerge
In the world of sensual desire happiness is conditioned by subjective desire efficiency of the senses and the existence of suitable objects
As all these are subject to incessant change the consequent happiness of the senses is transient and therefore lacks lasting satisfaction
Sensual gratification is in fact a deception though if it is understood this may lead to the path of deliverance
This is the escape from sensedesires
But when gratification is not understood it may intensify desire for sense pleasures with dissatisfaction regret or sorrow which are the danger in them following sooner or later
The Buddha has many times spoken about sensedesire gratification danger and escape
With these clear facts one must draw the following conclusions
So happiness in the world of sensual desire is at best only relative and therefore subject to constant change
The Buddha immediately realized both the relative and the supramundane importance of this question concerning the acts of blessedness or true omens
He gave a reply in which both these aspects were thoroughly considered
By reinterpretation the Buddha boldly bypassed the superstitious meaning of the word mangala looking at auspiciousness from the practical viewpoint
Beginning his answer in a very downtoearth way he gradually described in a steadily rising scale blessings or omens leading higher and higher finally to the supramundane state of Nibbaana
Sevanaa and asevanaa literally mean service and the absence of service Applied to the nouns wise man and fools the meaning is association or nonassociation thus we get not associating with fools and associating with the wise The underlying idea is that one must not follow after fools or take them as a standard for conduct or personal guidance but follow the wise
One waxes or wanes in good qualities according to whom one associates with
Pandita means the wise learned experienced and those capable of giving advice which is practical and wholesome
Baala originally meant children and hence weak persons and then foolish and stupid people the opposite of the wise people with minds undeveloped those whose behavior is coarse and rough troublemakers who tend to give advice which is unwholesome and evil
They lack discrimination and a sense of judgment and are heedless of Dhamma reckless in action and regardless of the consequences
These people are undesirable company
This interpretation of baala does not include children who are on the whole good and graceful
The emphasis is on keeping away from and not getting entangled with people who though grown up in years have none of the graces of children but all their failings and shortcomings these are the people possessing the characteristics of fools Their company can only harm
They certainly are very unfortunate but association with them is not auspicious and their mental and emotional constitution is such that they do not profit from beneficial guidance
Far from gaining anything themselves they will rather drag even a good man into trouble and danger
The example usually given from the suttas is that of the Buddha's cousin Devadatta dragging King Ajaatasattu to hell by instigating him to kill his father who was a virtuous king
The suttas warn one against companionship with bad people in this way because of bad company one gives ear to evil advice because of such advice evil reflections occupy the mind because of such reflections mental confusion prevails and the senses are uncontrolled as a result of this actions of body and speech are faulty and the five hindrances gain strength holding one to sensual cravings and resulting in sufferings
On the other hand through companionship with the wise the sequence is listening to good advice rational faith noble thoughts clear thinking selfcontrol good conduct conquest of the hindrances gaining of wisdom and the consequent liberation
It should be said here that while it is essential for an ordinary person to keep away from bad company one who is advanced in selfcontrol full of lovingkindness and compassion and thus immune to the evils of such association may live in the midst of such persons for the noble purpose of leading them to a better understanding while all the time on guard against evil influences
Though his body moves with them his mind should be beyond their influence
If he is not certain of his own selfcontrol he should avoid the company of such people
He may associate with them only when he is sure that his good influence is flowing to them and not their evil influence to him
The advice of the Buddha is that there should not be any entanglement with fools from which one can neither extricate oneself nor them
Puujaa and puujaniiyaanam mean homage and those worthy of homage The examples are the Buddha monks holy persons parents teachers  all of whom are of great assistance to us in life
Some people do not like to show respect or to express reverence even when it is quite proper to do so in the presence of those who have greater and purer conduct in mind speech and body than they have
Such people suffer from pride they estimate themselves too highly and do not want to admit that others could have achieved more than themselves
They are so to speak standing in their own light and they will not be able to see the right way to go
Their pride will only lead them to the strengthening of other defilements of mind and so they go from bad to worse
They have shut the door in their own faces and can go no further
And how they quarrel with others
Respectful persons are not like this
They are a pleasure to live and associate with unlike people with much pride
They not only fit well into whatever society they are in they also have the ability to learn more since they recognize that others know more than they do
So they have one of the factors necessary for any progress whether in worldly prosperity or on the Path of Dhamma
We shall see later that humility is another Blessing This practice of honoring the honorable is the foundation for humility
Patiruupadesavaaso means residence in a suitable and pleasant locality For life to be pleasant the dwelling place must be comfortable secure in construction tidy and clean in appearance properly maintained and besides it is helpful if it is in a good neighborhood and inhabited by agreeable people
The commentators amplify the meaning by explaining that a suitable locality should have in it people who practice the Noble Dhamma the evidence of this being the existence of shrines monks and monasteries and many good people engaged in meritorious deeds
Residence in a place inhabited by quarrelsome and troublemaking citizens where one is bossed about by a dictatorial and corrupt government where the climate is inimical with frequent ravages by floods famines earthquakes and epidemics where the air is charged with hatred and mutual suspicion and where freedom of thought and action are reduced to a minimum in brief residence in a place having many factors and conditions obstructive to the practice of Dhamma and not conducive to physical moral and spiritual wellbeing is just the opposite of what is meant by a suitable environment
When selection of a place for residence is considered a Buddhist bears in mind the advantage of being near a source of Dhamma besides of course more mundane advantages such as nearness to his work place
Pubbe ca katapunnataa merit made in the past Obviously it is a blessing to have done meritorious deeds in the past
A Buddhist unlike others who take existence as beginning with birth in this life understands the range covered by the term pubbe to comprise a vast chain of existences each life preceded by an earlier one in an unbroken and unlimited succession
The Buddha has said that the beginning of the round of birth and death is inconceivable for beings are blinded by ignorance and impelled by their cravings to make more and more kamma which means the experience of more and more lives
Action is performed by one's body or by speech or by mind
These actions are called kamma when will intention or volition is involved in the performance of action If there were no will involved there would be no results or fruits of kamma
Throughout life one goes on making kamma and experiencing the results some kamma bears immediate results some is delayed in result whereas another fails to fruit because suitable conditions for this to occur are not found
At death the continuity of the potential results of kamma in the stream of mind  which includes feeling perception mental formations and consciousness  are the only real traces of the individual his body having suffered disintegration
These potential results of kamma must fruit and the only way that this can happen is through rebirth
This means the attraction of the mental continuity to a suitable couple who are having sexual intercourse and where conception is possible
This applies among human beings and animals where reproduction involves sexual union
With other kinds of kamma governing the place of birth existence begins spontaneously without parents as among all the gods and among all types of subhuman birth with the exception of animals
Where one is born depends generally upon the quality of the past kamma which is ready to fruit more specifically it depends upon the last thought in the mind of the dying person
In the new existence that individual will experience the fruits of some of the past kamma while if born as a human being he will make more new kamma to add to the store of potential results
At the end of that new term of life what remains of the individual is again his mental continuity containing his potential results of kamma and it is this which again determines and conditions his next existence
Thus the cycle goes on death followed by birth birth by death and so on
The final release from this ocean of deathbirthdeath comes only for a Buddha or arahant whose body is worn out who has broken the pattern of kamma making and has no potential result to experience
Such a person is freed from the rounds of suffering incessant change and selfhood to know and see for himself or herself the highest goal Nibbaana
As kamma is varied in nature so are its results
Kamma may be unwholesome or wholesome the former being rooted in greed hatred or delusion while the latter has its roots in generosity lovingkindness or wisdom
Wholesome kamma made with these last three roots is also known as merit  those actions which cleanse and purify the mind of the doer
Each person makes wholesome and unwholesome kamma as well as having a store of resultants from past kamma some actual and fruiting while others are potential so the ingredients vary with each person
Whatever kamma a person performs good or evil he will be the heir to it says the Buddha
Thus the influence of past lives of an individual on his present experience can be more or less strong
If he tormented other beings he may suffer with a disease if he was habitually angry he inherits ugliness while stinginess gives him the heritage of poverty indolence of illiteracy envy in the past a low position in this one and so on
On the other hand from wholesome actions one inherits health beauty wealth wisdom noble birth and so on
Truly it is a blessing to have done good deeds in the past
There is no inheritance better than that resulting from good kamma to be an heir to such an inheritance means that one starts life with an excellent advantage
It is for this reason that the Buddha praised the merit garnered in the past and declared it a blessing in this life
Attasammaapanidhi one's self rightly directed This means one must decide on a proper objective in life and set oneself on the right path leading to it
The emphasis is on one's own self one should try to direct oneself to the desired goal by the efforts one makes
This encourages selfconfidence and discourages dependence upon the grace of gods or men
Many people pass their lives in the wrong course engaged in evil practices of the body speech and mind
Such people perhaps we are among them should cherish right desires and open a new and wholesome direction for their lives
Others who already consider themselves to have a wholesome way of living should review their situation from time to time not only to avoid lapses but also to progress further in the right direction
We can understand clearly what is meant by rightly directing oneself in this comment The unvirtuous person establishes himself in virtue the faithless person establishes himself in excellent faith the avaricious person establishes himself in generosity
Along these lines everyone has something to do
Bahusaccan ca sippan ca ample learning and proficiency in crafts
Bahusaccam is read by some as bahussutam which means great learning through hearing In the time of the Buddha education was mostly through oral tradition written knowledge not being very common
Consequently one was considered learned according to what one had memorized after having heard learned people talk
This standard of erudition applied particularly to religious learning
Obviously a pupil needed certain abilities such as a good memory keen desire to learn and to associate with the learned also a capacity to understand their teachings
Thus bahusaccam means much learning through direct contact with the learned This is a blessing whether the knowledge gained is used for Dhammapractice or restrained by moral conduct for one's livelihood
Bahusippam means proficiency in some art or handicraft which implies practical knowledge of some art science or handicraft We understand that the Buddha saw skill in some art or craft as a blessing too
Not only knowledge is praised by him but also manual work wherever this is not tainted by unwholesome actions
One's craft should therefore be in accordance with the precepts when it may be used either for hobby or livelihood
Among bhikkhus too there are crafts which it is good to be skilled in  such as making robes  and such skills are a blessing for one's fellow monks
Vinayo ca susikkhito welllearned discipline
For one who leads the householder's life this means abstaining from the ten courses of unwholesome action
The ten that should be abstained from so that one makes no evil kamma are
A layman who disciplines himself in these ten is rightly called an excellent person
People like this are sure to make further gains on the path whenever they make efforts

The moral discipline in the case of a monk is stricter than for a householder he must train himself not to fall into the various classes of offenses laid down by the Buddha
Subhaasitaa ca yaa vaacaa wellspoken words of civility
By this one would usually understand speech which is devoid of the four defects as given in the list under welllearned discipline And certainly what one speaks and how one speaks it are very important considering all the words which pour out of our mouths every day
However the commentary says that wellspoken words consist of words used while teaching Dhamma to other people
This must be true for Dhamma is always for one's benefit though of course much depends on how it is taught
Dhamma words can never be illspoken words since they
In this way they are a blessing both to the speaker and the listener
Maataapitu upatthaanam means adequately supporting looking after properly waiting on patiently and rendering proper service to mother and father
People these days do not always look after their parents
In western lands they often prefer to get some institution to take care of them as they age
But they do not consider perhaps that because they have not given good support or even neglected their old parents it is likely that they too as they grow old will have to suffer the same misfortune
Contrast this with the Buddha's teaching that children's debt to parents is so great that it can never be repaid by only material support
One should certainly give this but the support of Dhamma should also be given them
Are they stingy
Teach them generosity and its benefits
Perhaps their moral conduct is not good in some way
Then lead them to see the dangers of unwholesome conduct
Or maybe they lack understanding
Open the gates of Dhamma so that they understand good and evil the causal arising of events and so on
Only in this way can parents be repaid by their children
One's parents should be honored  the Buddha has called them God and it is surely better to pay homage to them with devoted service and lovingkindness which will bring them joy in their declining years than to worship any kind of god unknown to oneself personally
A good Buddhist thinks and acts in this way towards his parents I who was sustained by them shall sustain them I shall do their work for them I shall keep up their family traditions I shall make myself worthy of my inheritance I shall make continual offerings for them when they have died These are the Buddha's words to young Sigaala
Regarding the last this means the wellknown Buddhist practice of giving alms on death anniversaries and dedicating the merits to those who have died
In this way parents are supported even beyond this life
This is a blessing for those who are so kind and grateful as they have the chance to make much good kamma
Puttadaarassa sangaho cherishing one's wife and children
Surely everyone knows that this should be done
But one hears also of many cases when they are neglected or abandoned by a husband gone elsewhere
When a man has such commitments he has the duty to support the wife and help the children
The Buddha taught young Sigaala that a husband can help his wife in five ways by cherishing her by not looking down on her by not being unfaithful to her by giving her authority in her sphere of work and by making presents to her of such things as ornaments
Any way of helpfulness which is in accord with the Dhamma is a true blessing because all such actions are good kamma  wholesome and with happy results
If done in the right spirit cherishing wife and children must bring harmony into the home and just in this life to live at peace with others is a blessing what to speak of the good results in lives to come
Anaakulaa kammantaa means activities and livelihood which bring no conflicts and can be attended to peacefully without mental confusion
Not only should one's work bring no conflicts but one should avoid disturbing others
The significance of the expression will be much better appreciated by understanding that kamma should be a means to an end
The adjective anaakula  unconflicting  shows how the work should be done to reach the end
Life is a state of conflict brought about by the roots of the unwholesome greed hatred and delusion which are the sources of so many actions
The fruits arising from this action are various kinds of sufferings and limitations further causes for conflict
The objective in life is not to further complicate conflicts but to act work and attend to business in a way that leads to the lessening and eventual riddance of conflicts
The emphasis is on making wholesome kamma as a means of achieving noble and desirable objectives
It is not the quality of the objective alone that decides the worth of an activity it is the objective taken together with the means to it and related activities that decides final worth
Thus the means have as much importance as the ends To sum up this blessing what is important here is right livelihood  that one's work leads to no harm for oneself or other beings
This kind of work everyone will agree is a blessing
Daana charity liberality offering of gifts etc
The important thing here is not the act as it appears but the intention behind it
Thus daana may be graded as low medium and superior according to whether the motive is selfish unselfish or a mixture of these
The results vary accordingly both in quality and quantity
The mental purity of the recipient and the amount of what is given though undoubtedly important factors are subsidiary to the intention motivating the offering
Apart from the material daana visibly given through the body daana may also be practiced by speech and mind a friendly smile words of goodwill a generous nature and a mind full of lovingkindness
Giving also works in harmony with other good qualities and strengthens them
For instance a generous person develops both renunciation in being able to give freely and compassion concern to aid the plight of others
Giving is also related to moral conduct that one gives gifts which do not conflict with the precepts
And this brings in another relationship with wisdom for one should give wisely not unwisely
Finally another division of types of giving often seen is into material offerings and the gift of Dhamma
This Dhammadaana excels all other kinds of gift since unlike material gifts it never wears out instead becoming stronger with use as well as being of benefit in future lives besides the present one
A great blessing
Dhammacariyaa practice of Dhamma
Living by the Dhamma means making efforts to maintain and increase one's practice of the ten wholesome paths of kamma
Restraint from their evil counterparts has already been mentioned under welllearned discipline So here they are explained in a positive way
In the context of the stanza the term Dhamma has the connotation of righteousness This is supported by a commentary which gives as a synonym samacariyaa
Anavajjaani kammaani blameless actions
The expressions unconflicting types of work and blameless actions are accepted as synonymous by some authors
They might be so at first glance but they differ in their emphasis
Thus while the unconflicting types of work lay emphasis on the nature of the activities with which one is occupied the expression blameless actions stresses the making of kamma which will not lead to obstacles and hindrances in the future
One could say that here the intention in the mind is stressed
The Paali commentary bears this out when under this blessing it suggests a number of actions which are blameless such as keeping the eight precepts on the Uposatha days social services planting gardens and groves making bridges
Then there are the hospitable actions for which Buddhists are famous the full jar of cool water to refresh thirsty travelers and the rest house giving shade which anyone may use
All such actions are praiseworthy irrespective of one's belief  for where is kindliness not praised
It is a great blessing wherever many kindly people are found
AArati viratii paapaa avoiding and abstaining from evil
The words aarati and virati occur together in several places in the scriptures
Taken together they mean abstinence keeping away from avoiding etc
Though the two terms have similarity of meaning they are not the same as we shall see
Both signify effort at detachment from something unwholesome in the range of sensual pleasure that is the evil mentioned in the stanza
It is the difference in scope between the two terms that makes them into two distinct blessings in the sutta
Thus the expression avoiding and abstaining from evil means avoiding evil and abstaining from evil
The commentary explains avoiding evil to mean mental nondelight in it a shrinking away from evil thoughts that have arisen so that they cease having run out of fuel to burn
Only when this avoidance is not present in the mind can the fires of greed aversion and delusion be fueled up with the persistent flames of evil thoughts
But abstaining from evil means abstinence by way of bodily and verbal actions Where mental avoidance of evil is present there will be also abstinence from it through body and speech but the presence of the latter does not guarantee the former
Why this is so is explained by the commentary when it says that abstinence may be the result of following custom or tradition
For if people do not steal let us say thinking It would disgrace the family then they have present only abstinence as custom A better reason for abstinence is found in the person who remembers the precepts thinking Oh I shall break that training rule This is called abstinence as undertaking Best of all is abstinence as severance found in the Noble disciple who can abstain quite naturally and without struggle because the power of evil has been weakened in his heart
The scriptures also teach three kinds of avoiding and abstaining namely from wrong speech wrong action and wrong livelihood
This means that both of these blessings are concerned with siila or morality
Concerning this word evil what does it mean
Why do we say that this or that action is wrong speech wrong action or wrong livelihood
All the actions listed under these headings bring trouble and suffering to oneself and to others
They lead to blame from other people and for the doer of them they cause many obstacles and difficulties in the future
Here they are
Majjapaanaa ca sannamo refraining from intoxicating drinks Majja this is related to our English word mad and there is a play on intoxication and maddening which English cannot reproduce
However everyone the world over knows the effects of alcohol and other intoxicants
Though drinks are mentioned here anything which leads to more delusion of the mind whether swallowed injected or smoked should be included
A Buddhist wants a clear mind that can understand easily what is going on in his own mind and body as well as other actions
But these besotting substances just lead to more and more foolishness
Thoroughly drunk a person knows nothing but must suffer when he wakes
Partly drunk a person becomes capable of actions which he would be ashamed to do while sober
And carelessness from intoxication leads to the death or maiming of how many people these days
So those who are intoxicated are rightly blamed by wise men
The commentary remarks that these people are censured in this life get themselves an unhappy future life and when finally they return to the human state after long subhuman existences they are born mad
This seems just enough for they madden themselves with intoxicants now so the fruits of such kamma brings madness a whole life without understanding
Taking all this into account an earnest follower of the Buddha should abstain completely from all intoxicants
Appamaado ca dhammesu diligence in Dhamma doing Pamaada like majja in the last blessing is also related linguistically to madness
This is the opposite of what the Buddha taught
He constantly urged people to cultivate appamaada or diligence
The word in Paali has the flavor of three good qualities effort mindfulness and wisdom
These three go along together in anyone who tries to develop the Dhamma in himself and such a person is appamatta diligent or heedful
Now here the Buddha is admonishing us to be diligent in cultivating Dhamma  all aspects of it in ourselves
This means we should try to protect whatever good practices we have already and make the effort also to develop further in dhammaqualities or practices
If we find any of the following in our hearts then we are slipping
concerning the development of wholesome dhammas
Surely diligence is a blessing
Gaaravo reverence
This includes the proper veneration of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and respect for parents and teachers wise people good persons and elders  in fact a general high regard for everyone
Even the Buddha after his Enlightenment surveyed the world to try to find a teacher to revere
When he realized that no teacher surpassed his own attainments then he proclaimed in verse that he would live revering the Dhamma through which Enlightenment had been discovered
And the arahantdisciples too had reverence for the Buddha as their guide for the Dhamma for other senior bhikkhus and for the way of training
The further one has gone along the path of Dhamma the more reverence one has for it  and for others who also practice correctly
It is not that reverence grows less as one practices
This is a way of estimating one's own position for if a lot of pride and conceit can be seen then one has not got very far
How does one show respect or reverence
The Buddha says that one gives such a person a good seat stands up to receive them makes way for them and for religious teachers one places one's hands together and bows at their feet
This is a blessing resulting in good future births and harmony in the present life
Nivaato humility
Yet another factor which stresses the importance of having no pride
The fact that we encounter a number of blessings which deal with nonpride should make us realize how important humility is for successful practice of Dhamma
The person who knows it all who always replies I know who has his own theories about Dhamma or anyone else's theories for that matter does not have humility
Because of this he can never train under a good teacher
The Commentary gives the right attitude to have to be lowly like a footwiping cloth like a bull with horns cut off or like a snake with fangs extracted People like this get on with Dhamma
Of course this does not mean that one is obsequiously humble  just another disguise for pride and a revolting one at that
But the wise person tries to make displays of self less and less evident
He does not advertise himself he is not exuberant in body or speech but instead is restrained
It is interesting to note that this humility in Paali is literally notwind which ties up well with such English expressions of conceit and pride as puffery vaporing or more colloquially hot air and gas
Santutthii contentment
This implies acceptance of conditions and situations as they arise with equanimity and without grumbling
This is a quality which bhikkhus must have as the commentary emphasizes when it does not mention lay people at all here
This is a much needed quality in those parts of the world and among those families where there is affluence
Contentment spells peace of mind for the person who has it craving more and more spells out the opposite
What should one be content with
With enough clothes enough food enough living room and enough medicines
But then what is enough and what is excess
Enough gives one little trouble to keep and maintain but more than that brings anxiety and worry
This blessing should also not be misunderstood as counsel not to make an effort in life
Bhikkhus do not have to possess many things for happiness in their life but lay people need much more
Lay people must make effort to obtain what is necessary for a happy life without poverty and starvation
Everyone has to decide for themselves whether possessions will bring more happiness or more trouble
Being able to know this clearly is an aspect of wisdom
Katannutaa gratitude
Literally this is knowing what has been done that is remembering what others have done for oneself
The Buddha has said Two sorts of people are hard to find in the world one who first does and one who is grateful and recognizes Without this quality a person forgets parents relatives friends teachers and those who teach him Dhamma he turns his back on them just when they could be helped by him or when they are in need of aid
A selfish person seems to try to isolate himself from the world's web
I alone am important he says and forgets all the benefit derived from others
On the other hand the grateful person makes for harmony and peace
How many good things have we obtained through others in this life and how many are we grateful for and then express our gratitude in speech and action
Kaalena dhammasavanam timely hearing of Dhamma means that the occasion for hearing the teachings of the Buddha should be welltimed
Hearing of Dhamma should be opportune
Obviously the hearing of Dhamma will be more profitable if regularly attended to at times when one has healthy body and mind when one is exhausted except perhaps during disease or suffering this may lead to sleepiness and so it is not suitable
Some of the excellent general occasions for the hearing of the teachings are
Regarding the time of the day suitable no definite rules can be laid down for what suits one may not suit another
It is proper to take into consideration the following general points
Timely hearing of the Dhamma is a great blessing since because of it the five hindrances can be abandoned even while one sits there and the ten fetters too so that even the three kinds of taints may be exhausted and arahantship won through listening attentively
Even if such attainments do not occur then one comes to know Dhamma which one had not heard before while what one had heard is learned in detail
With such a store of Dhamma one can apply it to one's life for one's own benefit and the happiness of others
A great blessing
Khantii this important virtue in fact one of the highest can be translated as patience but it includes the virtues of forbearance forgiveness and tolerance
It finds expression as a serene attitude towards stresses in oneself and outside which enables a person to accept with equanimity the flow of events
Because of this the impressions entering the mind from the sense doors cannot upset the peace reigning there so one goes on serenely with the work in hand
Though all sorts of upsetting situations occur and send their disturbing messages to the mind it does not become heated
In fact with even a little of this virtue the mind becomes cool clean and calm like a refreshing pool of crystal clear water quite unlike the minds of most people which can rightly be compared to a pot of boiling soup or a cup of water with swirls of color in it
A person who practices patience has a cool heart the mark of a person who has applied the Dhamma to his life
Coolheartedness not worried flustered or impatient marks the good Buddhist while hotheartedness shows how little of Dhamma a person has in his heart
Khantii is one of the paaramitaas which one who aspires to Enlightenment must perfect to a far greater degree than just not being impatient or impetuous
This we know from that famous story of the Bodhisatta's life when he was the Preacher of Patience a monk living harmlessly in the forest who was slaughtered by a maddened king about which it is said in that story
Even if our patience is not tried by such extreme events still we have to encounter heat and cold hunger and thirst various insects and so on which attack this body and the sharp words of others which seem to attack the ego then there are occasions for being patient about time and how many times for being patient with the frailties of other people
But the basis of all patience is to be patient with oneself
Patience is thus the foundation of mettaa
It is reckoned as a great power and the strength of those who have patience is often praised in Buddhist writings
Sovacassataa the meaning given in the commentaries is one who can easily be addressed spoken to or advised and it further means a person who can be corrected Also implied are the qualities of tolerance of criticism directed at oneself and courtesy and gratitude in accepting advice
The commentary says that a person who is meek when corrected has the chance to learn Dhamma which is the opposite of the person who is difficult to speak to The latter indulge in prevarication silence or think up virtues and vices Prevarication is only a fancy word for lying the method used by some people when they are admonished
Another way is sullen silence while the third is blaming the adviser by charging him with faults or else praising one's own virtue
People like this are difficult to train others find them hard to get on with
One should examine oneself to find out whether or not one has the blessing of being meek when corrected
Obviously a gentle person will only need to be told to do a thing gently he is like a wellbred horse needing just a soft touch unlike an obstinate beast which only responds to harsh treatment
He is a thoroughbred with the attributes of broadmindedness of outlook instant acceptance of good advice and habitual courtesy in manners and speech
Samanaanan ca dassanam seeing monks or holy men In the ordinary sense dassanam means seeing with the physical eye
But generally the expression signifies more than mere seeing even when used in the restricted sense of seeing in the ordinary way
The underlying sense is conveyed when the act of visual seeing has as its objectives holy persons of purity and real worth
Seeing is generally performed with the desire to pay respects to them
This is also the sense of the modern Hindi word darshan
For a Buddhist however it is not enough just to gaze with devotion and perform acts of worship
So the expression means much more than mere meeting or seeing It involves mind speech and body in a harmonious synthesis
There is no better company than holy persons whose very presence spreads a purifying aura and inspires a constructive approach to one's problems
Such company is an antidote to evil ways of life besides leading one to discover for oneself spiritual treasures in due course
In the deeper sense dassanam means seeing with the mental eye eg naanadassam and dhammadassana
So in the deepest sense dassanam means perception of the Noble Truths
All those deeper meanings can come about through simply seeing the monks
Kaalena dhammasaakacchaa timely discussion on the Dhamma
As Dhamma is a profound subject it needs sincere effort to understand it properly and grasp it for practical use in life
This can be made easier through discussions with others who have a thorough knowledge of the theory and practice of Dhamma
Discussions should be welltimed
The right times for discussions with intelligent wise and experienced people should not be missed even though it means personal inconvenience
Still one should remember that discussions would not be opportune if the convenience of the other person is neglected
It is particularly timely to discuss the Dhamma when one's mind is trouble either by defilements of the mind such as uncertainty or by exterior troubles in the family at work or in any kind of relationship
Tapo literally means heat Its brahmanical meaning was ascetic practices which the Buddha showed were useless for the attainment of deliverance
Though he denounced the torment of one's own body the Buddha used this word to mean selfcontrol as with the restraint of one's sense faculties
When these are restrained then such unwholesome mental states as covetousness and grief have no chance to appear
But tapo was used in another sense by the Buddha to mean vigorous efforts the sort which a bhikkhu has to make if he is to win Enlightenment
It is the kind of effort which burns up the defilements
Brahmacariyam holy life
The general Buddhist meaning is the best life but in some places it means the Buddha's Dispensation while elsewhere it is the monk's ideal life
Here it can include these two besides the more common meaning of leading a holy life which implies abstaining from sex
With brahmacariya may also be included the practice of the Four Sublime States viz mettaa karunaa muditaa and upekkhaa
The word brahmacariyaa while including all aspects of Dhammapractice in its scope emphasizes moral purity
Through the study and practice of Dhamma one attains selfcontrol and an important part of this is sex control which energy empowers the clear meditative mind as well as providing the drive for beneficial social activities
Sensual desire generally is a cause of many lives and much suffering
As sexual desire is a concentrated form of sensuality and so the cause of much trouble the Buddha has shown how it can be checked first by precepts and then through meditation
For the lay followers sex is limited to that allowed in the third of the five precepts while for bhikkhus complete sexual abstinence is necessary
Bhikkhus are bound to practice it strictly and even lay followers may undertake the precept of sexual abstinence if they wish
Worldly life though not much help for this practice does not make it impossible
Buddhists observe this vow on the Uposatha days and some who are endowed with strong selfcontrol and a firm determination to advance in meditation practice it all the time while engaged in the general round of worldly duties
Ariyasaccaana dassanam seeing the Noble Truths ie the Four Noble Truths which constitute the central pillar of the Buddha's Dhamma and of which all other Buddhist doctrines are a preparation or elaboration
The Four Noble Truths are the briefest factual description of experience during life
They constitute the unique and vital discovery made by the Buddha which was announced by him in his very first discourse
The truths are
The eight steps of the Noble Eightfold Path are
These eight steps are usually grouped into the following three divisions
Knowledge of these truths may be intellectual or by way of realization
The former variety of knowledge as it is intellectual or hearsay evidence only helps understanding the formulation of these truths which still remain to be realized
The knowledge gained in this way remains limited as relative truth
The knowledge based on direct perception is that of realization it is the knowledge penetrated by truth
The former type of knowledge is termed mundane and the latter supramundane
As mundane knowledge the Four Noble Truths are generally perceived as separate events nevertheless their understanding helps to dispel certain prejudices and wrong beliefs
In the supramundane stage all the four truths are simultaneously realized whoever realized suffering also realizes its origin its cessation and the path to its cessation
Though at first one has an intellectual appreciation of them  for certainly this is also a blessing  here direct perception is meant the former usually leading to the latter
The expression means the perception of the Four Noble Truths at work in life
This insight results in the realization of the facts of suffering its roots in the cravings of lobha dosa and moha its extinction through the exhaustion of the cravings and the technique of the conquest
Once direct insight arises one arrives at the doorway to the Final Goal
Nibbaanasacchikiriyaa the realization of Nibbaana Nibbaana the Final Goal is a blessed state of freedom from desire of freedom from greed hatred and delusion of perfect safety from the vicissitudes of existence of bliss that is resplendent of knowledge that is supreme in brief a state that is perfection itself
In life one is plagued by desires in Nibbaana all desires are extinguished and all clingings are nullified
In life one lives in a forest of conflicting views and theories in Nibbaana all these vanish under the direct perception of truth just as the dew vanishes with the direct touch of the sun's rays
The state of Nibbaana which is supramundane is beyond the power of language to describe for words can only convey relatively true concepts
Therefore it is beyond the power of anyone even the Supreme Buddha to describe or define Nibbaana except by using negation and occasionally more positive imagery
Hence the Buddha has not described Nibbaana at any length although he uses similes sometimes for effect
The attainment of Nibbaana is the most excellent achievement needing a strong determination backed by strenuous endeavors in the right way
These endeavors must be patiently and perseveringly directed towards the eradication of the roots of evil bound up with life namely lobha dosa and moha
These evils rooted in ignorance generate strong fetters which tie beings to the painful circle of suffering the wheel of existence the round of birth death and rebirth
The fetters are ten in number
Those possessed of all the ten fetters are termed ordinary people
We are those ordinary people who are in the stormy ocean of existence feverishly twitching to the tune of sensual cravings while tightly bound to the wheel of suffering
We are prisoners in chains chains riveted by our cravings
The dissolution of these fetters is the highest aim of the Buddha's teaching
Though the effort needed for this is very great the resulting fruit is sweet beyond compare
Once the right course is found further progress is assured
The right method is mental culture through reflection meditation and concentration
The resulting insight is the solvent of all fetters dissolving them away
The dissolution of the first three fetters makes one a sotaapanna
This means success in shifting from the stormy ocean of life to the cool and steady stream that unmistakably leads to Nibbaana the release
This is the first stage of Nobility
With the attainment of it one is known as an Ariya a Noble One
In the next stage the next two fetters are weakened and the Noble One becomes a sakadaagaamii to this world
The destruction of these two fetters makes the Noble One an anaagami
Freedom from all the ten fetters makes one an arahant a Perfect One a Fully Liberated One
He has attained to the Highest that is to Nibbaana after death there is no more rebirth for him
The Buddha is an arahant as he has destroyed all the fetters
He is more than that too for he reached the goal by a longer and more strenuous path with the object of amply profiting the world through his supreme wisdom and compassion
The Buddha and the arahants unlike ordinary people make no more mentalformations or kamma
They stand with rocklike firmness unshaken by the winds and storms all around
They are beyond the clutches of any temptations they are delivered of all evils are perfectly pure and holy and full of supreme understanding
They have achieved the Goal Nibbaana
They live only for the period necessary to expend their kammic momentum left from the past
At the end of that as no more kamma fruits remain they attain Parinibbaana no more to return to rebirth anywhere
There are obviously two aspects of Nibbaana
One often hears a strange question Who or what attains Nibbaana after the final death
The question is meaningless as there are neither any kammaresultants nor any of the five groups of the psychophysical being left so the question does not arise as to who or what enters Nibbaana
To explain this more fully one should know about one's self and what this means
The Buddha's analysis of personality reveals five groups as making up a human being ruupakkhandha vedanaakkhandha sannaakkhandha sankhaarakkhandha and vinnanakkhandha
A common classification is the grouping of these five into two sections naama comprising the last four and ruupa the first group
All these are characterized with the three qualities common to all living beings
And as there is nothing in the human person outside these five a human being is in reality without a permanent egoentity self or soul
He is like a bubble of water or a cart on the road things which give the impression of being entities because of the combination of certain factors but which have no permanent substance to endure for ever
There are two aspects of truth namely
The Buddha in his discourses while addressing ordinary people or while expounding the commonsense viewpoint generally spoke of conventional truth
Thus in this sutta the term atta self is used only as conventional mode of speech meaning the human being as he appears In the ultimate sense the personality is a flux everchanging and never the same even for two consecutive fractions of a moment
This is the doctrine of anattaa
It is a unique Buddhist discovery  in fact the most revolutionary discovery ever made in the field of human personality
Without a proper grasp of its import Buddhism will be understood only superficially
The conventional recognition of a self as a convenient mode of speech however should not lead people astray into belief in the existence of a higher self There is no higher self or soul in the ultimate sense for no self of any kind higher or lower here or hereafter can be found
That is why the Buddha laid emphasis on selflessness and classed it as one of the three fundamental characteristics of all living beings including human personality
The proper study for a man is himself for once the emptiness of self is understood all the rest becomes easy to grasp
As tersely explained in the Visuddhimagga according to ultimate truth
Yet with this direct view of truth in which personality finds no foothold at all the Buddha did not ignore the truth of the conventional self
He gave it the recognition it merited and used it as a base for directing the individual ultimately to the realization of the truth of non personality
This is where the expression attasammaapanidhi one's self rightly directed eventually leads
Thus evil tendencies and practices give way to the wholesome tendencies and practices once the delusion of self is penetrated
From the very start one should know that the self is accepted merely as a convenient or conventional designation and that its apparent reality can certainly be understood as a delusion once its nonexistence in the ultimate sense is realized
The very fact of starting the life journey in this way becomes the act of directing or setting oneself in the right course by oneself Though there may be external help available the emphasis is on the right direction and selfreliance
All available wholesome assistance should be used but not too much dependence should be shown to any aid apart from that springing from within one's self
So Nibbaana is not attained by any person in the highest sense
Realization of Nibbaana means at least an actual glimpse of it which can be had by no less a person than a sotaapanna
It may here be pointed out that the expression the realization of Nibbaana implies that by one's own efforts one reaches the goal
Through determination and perseverance in the right direction the goal is reached and not through grace it is not a Gift from the Heavens but the fruit of one's supreme endeavors
In brief the goal is one's own earnings verily Nibbaana is well earned
Blessed is the person who earns it
Phutthassa lokadhammehi cittam yassa na kampati a mind which does not waver when touched by worldly conditions Worldly conditions inseparable from life are eight in number gain and loss fame and disgrace praise and blame and pleasure and pain
While ordinary people grasp the pleasant halves of these pairs and reject the unpleasant Noble Ones especially arahants are not shaken by either of the halves
We as ordinary people should try to develop more equanimity towards gain and loss and so on
Asokam viraajam and khemam are the attribute of an arahant
These describe the mental state of a Fully Liberated One
The mind of such a person is unique free from disturbances purified of passion and finished with sensuality it is calm and serene without the storms of desires and the waves of worries
The worldly conditions do not sway him he stands firmly witnessing but untouched by the changeful and sorrowful drama of life going on all around
This stanza concludes the sutta
The fulfillment of these blessings is shown by
This is the sublimest of all attainments the Everest of human achievements Nibbaana in this life

The thirtyeight blessings detailed in the Mahaamangala Sutta are not arranged in random order
Their arrangement is strictly logical and their sequence is natural and progressive
Up to this point we have dealt with the various issues individually because an analytic study was necessary for the proper understanding of he subject
Now with the perspective of the entire sutta we are in a position to consider the subject as a whole
This enlarged view while giving as a chance to appreciate the cultural integrity of the sutta also gives an understanding of the synthesis of its thirtyeight constituents
These constituents are so arranged that they not only follow one another in proper sequence but they also group themselves into categories which are themselves in the progressive order of development in Dhamma
Before we pass on to a systematic classification of these blessings it will be refreshing to read the following comments on the sutta adapted from Shway Yoe who is quoting the Christian Bishop Bigandet
Within a narrow compass the Buddha has condensed an abridgment of almost all moral virtues
The first portion of these precepts contains injunctions to shun all that may prove an impediment to the practice of good works
The second part inculcates the necessity of regulating one's mind and intention for a regular discharge of the duties incumbent on each man in his separate station
Then follows a recommendation to bestow assistance on parents relatives and all men in general
Next to that we find recommended the virtues of humility resignation gratitude and patience
After this the Teacher insists on the necessity of studying the Law visiting the religious conversing on religious subjects
When this is done one is recommended to study with great attention the four great Truths and keep the mind's eye ever fixed on the happy state of Nibbaana which though as yet distant ought never to be lost sight of
Thus prepared one must be bent upon acquiring the qualifications befitting the true sage who would remain firm fearless and unmoved even in the midst of the ruins of the crumbling universe the Buddhist sage ever remains calm composed and unshaken among all the vicissitudes of life
There is again clearly pointed out the final end to be arrived at viz that of perfect mental stability
This state is the foreshadowing of Nibbaana
The ingredients of the Mahaa Mangala Sutta because of their moral excellence and practical appeal are capable of many classifications
Thus the thirtyeight blessings can be presented in a variety of combinations
The author after thinking deeply over the possible groupings has arrived at a pattern worked out by himself
This classification is based on practical considerations and is expected to be generally useful
Before we present our own classification it is proposed to offer another the essential feature of which is the division of the sutta into the three classical sections namely siila samaadhi and pannaa
The credit for developing this admirable classification goes to Mangala U Ba Than the very honorific prefix to whose name is significant of the excellent work done by him in Burma in popularizing the teaching and the practice of the Mangala Sutta
He groups the first twentyone mangalas under siila and divides them into five groups these ensure the basic training of the individual as well as assisting with the discharge of his obligations in the social sphere
The next nine mangalas are classed under samaadhi as aspects of mental culture
The last eight mangalas come under pannaa and are either the practice towards or the fruit of wisdom and insight
Steady and regular practice of the twentyone mangalas grouped under siila brings the utmost happiness prosperity and satisfaction possible in the human state
These admirable achievements are not only adequately stabilized and ensured against possible setbacks but are also further enhanced by the practice of the fine mangalas grouped under samaadhi
The last eight mangalas grouped under pannaa assist the progressive realization of the highest wisdom
The above classification is schematically represented below
The Mahaa Mangala Sutta a well and charted course of personal culture and progress is an excellent guide for reaching even the highest goal
It is a foursectioned ladder which helps one to climb step by step to the zenith of noble achievements
The ideal of life is deliverance from fears and insecurities
This is achieved through steady strenuous effort and righteous wayfaring in the world
Such a great venture as this obviously needs adequate preparation and thorough training The Mahaa Mangala Sutta indicates not only the course of the preparatory training but also safely guides the individual through the journey of life and ultimately leads him to the secure haven of Nibbaana
The first five mangalas provide material for the foundation of life's building
The sixth gives the necessary plan for the construction work while the next four complete the structure
In this way the building is made ready to house the other mangalas
This constitutes the phase of preparation
The next phase is concerned with how the building already prepared is occupied
The first seven mangalas of this deal with the proper discharge of domestic duties and social obligations
The next three are a matter of personal conduct and the one following these aims at conserving the progress hitherto achieved through the practice of all the twenty mangalas mentioned so far
The next five mangalas are the cultivation of the higher virtues which are absolutely essential for venturing into the cultivation of the Dhamma's highest aspects
Thus through the operation of the last sixteen mangalas the residence of life prepared by the first ten becomes a workshop producing the goods of worldly obligations and the cultivation of benevolent feelings
This is the phase of wayfaring in the world which transforms the building into a temple of life
The next stage is spiritual growth
This invites the occupation of the temple by the most refined and exalted mangalas
The cultivation of two mangalas leads to ability in the practice of the spiritual life and the next two make contact with those leading a religious life
Then four more mangalas open the gates of realization of the Dhamma
And the last four mangalas constitute the Great Awakening which transforms the temple into a lighthouse for humanity
This is the ultimate benefit of Dhammapractice the signs of which are the invincibility of such a person and Supreme Bliss
Schematically listed the above phases are
A comparison of the above classification with that of Mangala U Ba Than shows several points of contact
The major agreement is in the phase of preparation which in both cases is taken up by the first ten mangalas
Also the terminal sections in both cases are identical
An examination of our classification makes it evident that section one of the sutta is concerned with preparation for the second section which in turn is a preparation for section number three
The fourth section is the final result
Each of these sections has several stages
The last stage of the first section qualifies the person to enter the second section of the worldly journey and the last stage of the second section brings the pilgrim right to the threshold of the third section
The final stage of the third section spells the supreme realization of the highest aim that people can aspire to
The fourth phase is the goal itself
The traveler through the above sections is really a pilgrim who takes up the journey of life with a definite plan covering bodily verbal and mental activities his object is to make of life a happy and moral means to a glorious end
The Mahaa Mangala Sutta provides the map which takes the pilgrim safely through life's journey to the final destination so that he gains deliverance from dukkha and the delusions of existence
The eleven stanzas comprising the reply to the issue raised in the first stanza are apportioned to the four sections as follows
The position of Wayfaring in the World between the stages of Preparation and that of the Religious Life while it does not mean that marriage is essential for all people at some period in life does lay emphasis on the cultivation of moral principles and in the discharge of social and familial obligations
According to the Buddha and in contrast with the four stages of Hindu life marriage is not a compulsory institution though it provides sometimes a fruitful field for the cultivation of certain virtues and so appears here as an intermediate phase which can be utilized as a training ground for entrance upon the third phase of spiritual values
Thus marriage is an optional part of the second section of life
As a means to a desirable end it is commendable but if accepted as an end in itself it clogs the wheels of progress and becomes a sort of a labyrinth beset with passions and crowded with peculiar obstacles which do not easily allow the pilgrim a chance to find the path leading to awakening
Therefore those who can practice the necessary mangalas of this stage without entering into matrimonial bondage as monks and nuns for instance are free to do so the emphasis being on the cultivation of the associated virtues and the adequate discharge of certain obligations expected of the pilgrim
However in case marriage is excluded from the program the question of obligations due to wife and children obviously does not arise as the pilgrim is quite free from this burden
Usually human beings are heavily burdened fettered with the weighty chains riveted by themselves the chains of fears and superstitions dogmas and rituals
Egoistic tendencies worked by the forces of greed hatred and delusion bring about this bondage
Bound by these selfcreated chains human beings suffer repeated difficulties hardships and miseries which rob people of selfconfidence and courage
The result is belief in prayers and priests rites and rituals sacrifices and sacraments speculations and the supernatural all prompting slavish dependence on extraneous agencies and forces imaginary or real
Thus the mind of man is entombed by the prison walls of his own making
The Buddha was moved by great compassion at the sight of the pitiable condition of humanity drowning in its own blind beliefs
He sounded the clarion call of freedom and showed the right way of breaking through the selfmade crust of superstitions smothering individual initiative confidence and courage
His Mahaa Mangala Sutta is a masterly antidote to all blind beliefs and superstitions
When approached to declare the mangalaani or auspicious signs he enumerated instead the acts of blessedness thus bringing about a psychological revolution in the beliefs of many people
Every section of the sutta is a storehouse full of practical wisdom
Precious ideas and valuable counsel are packed in every line in condensed form so that their expansion is really necessary
Just as letters were microphotographed during the war to reduce freight in air shipment and then blown up before delivery so the thoughts and ideas behind the factors of the Mahaa Mangala Sutta have to be expanded for easy study and understanding
It should however be pointed out that though the essentials of the enlarged picture will not change at different times and places yet certain factors such as the color of the picture and the texture of the materials used may differ
That is why the practical exposition of the sutta is sure to vary under different circumstances without altering the central values
In the eleven stanzas of the sutta is given counsel which can make anyone an ideal citizen
There are instructions which excellently prepare people for a fruitful journey through life
Further counsel progressively matures the individual till he successfully passes from the worldly state to the sphere of higher virtues and certain spiritual experiences
These in due course lead to perfect liberation
Thus the phases of preparation worldly life religious life and spiritual consummation follow one another in logical sequence
In this way all the due obligations are adequately discharged
The ultimate fruits are flawless happiness and perfect security
It is undoubtedly true that the sutta is an excellent moral foundation for children
But that is just a beginning
The sutta also is a cultural moral and spiritual compass for guiding the ship of life through the stormy ocean of existence to the safe final haven of the Further Shore
At every step in life at every stage and under all circumstances the sutta has practical advice to offer advice which if followed may be expected to lead to the effective solution of many complicated problems
The sutta provides unfailing guidance not only to a child at school or to youngsters in their teens but also to grownups no matter what age and what their status or work race or nation creed or education
Homes schools universities law courts hospitals factories monasteries government and business offices laboratories and all the other places of human activity can derive substantial benefit from the teachings of the Mahaa Mangala Sutta
A poor and humble person may gain from the practice of these golden precepts even more than wealthy man a prime minister may benefit as much as any humble citizen a new saamanera as much as a senior bhikkhu a laborer in the field as much as a king on his throne a school teacher a compounder or a petitionwriter as much as a professor or a doctor or a pleader
The sutta is a general prescription most excellent for the difficulties of everyone for alleviating moral decay and for mending the spiritual fractures of all men and women of all times and places of all races and religions
Such is its grandeur
Such is the glory of this short discourse which may rightly be designated a universal panacea
In the practical application of the teachings of the sutta is the effective solution of all problems whether personal or domestic private or public national or international
The benefit however is in accordance with the degree of practice which if habitual leads to a mental state in which it is natural to distinguish between the mangala and the amangala practices and to flow only with the former according with one's practice
Though the sutta is a part of the Buddhist canon its contents breathe such a harmonious air that they are the property of the whole human race
In its sublime teaching the distinctions of creed race and nationality vanish and the rigid frontiers of religion melt away making the peoples of the human race seem as members of one undivided family
Bound together by common problems and by the urge to find their solutions mankind is certain to benefit from the wisdom enshrined in the sutta
The teachings of the sutta are an excellent instrument for conditioning humanity in the direction of intellectual clarity and emotional purity towards efficiency in work and amity in human relationship
The world today sorely needs such advice
Shaken by the two worst wars in history and tormented by the possibility of a third one worse than any before most of the world's peoples today are naturally thirsting for peace
To quench this thirst apart from suitable economic readjustments intellectual honesty and emotional strength are essential
They are of paramount importance in fact much more important than the deluded trust in the strength of armies and the hollow hope in the potency of atomic and hydrogen bombs and other devilish weapons
It is our experience that wars far from solving the problems causing them create more unsolvable problems in their wake
To go to war heedlessly is madness and a suicidal policy
Besides the fact of coming to blows is evidently an admission of the moral and intellectual bankruptcy among those nations which fight
The trouble with the world today is more a matter of its individual human inhabitants than the objective world's state
The causes of these troubles are greed hatred and delusion
These fires within manifest as conflicts without unleashing manifold sufferings
There can be no peace without moral and intellectual concord among mankind
There can be no real love in human relationships so long as the fires of hate dishonesty anger and greed fiercely burn in the human heart
Like war peace has to be won
The Mahaa Mangala Sutta of the Buddha shows the way to do it
It shows the way of genuine victory through nonviolence and real love
Rather than conquering thousands and millions in battle the Buddha teaches the conquest of self through selfculture and selfcontrol
This is a victory well worth winning
It leads to peace its substance is unshakable happiness and its fruit perfect security
Effective victory over self illumines every sphere of life personal family social national and international also physical mental moral and spiritual
Thus the Mahaa Mangala Sutta deals with the harmonious development of the whole man in his total environment
There are thirtyeight mangalaani or acts of blessedness each of which is designated the best or the highest In view of the fact that these acts include such different spheres as worldly pursuits family life religious practices and spiritual ideals it may reasonably be asked as to why all of these are each called the best as mangalamuttamam
The sutta deals with personal life as a whole
But as life has different stages different precepts condition each stage towards a wholesome state
Step by step the evolution of the individual proceeds each step having some acts or blessings as unique to itself
As the individual progresses his attention increases and his outlook is focused on different ends
On looking back he may well feel like a mature person looking at the toys of his childhood
Certainly what was highest or best then is not so for him now
And it is true too that what he regards as the highest or the best will be rejected by a child
At the different stages of life different counsels are needed the best for each phase of the journey
Just as man going off to market with a bag of charcoal on his back on finding wool discards the charcoal on finding silver discards wool on finding gold discards silver on finding diamonds discards gold and on finding the secret of enduring happiness discards everything else so too we successively shift the level of our outlook focusing our consciousness to ideals higher and higher till the highest is reached
The Mahaa Mangala Sutta gives the best counsel for each stage of life it is thus that worldly felicity and spiritual bliss cease to be conflicting ideals
Every ideal that is good is best in its own place
That is why each of the thirtyeight Blessings is the highest and the best
So great is the importance of the Mahaa Mangala Sutta that if one had to face a situation where it was necessary to surrender all the teachings of the Buddha except a single discourse one would do well to hold on to the Mahaa Mangala Sutta
Having this as a possession it would be possible even quite easy to reconstruct the entire teachings of the Buddha
This opinion is ventured to emphasize vividly the practical value of the sublime sutta which provides an allround and unfailing guidance for worldly promotion and spiritual salvation
The understanding and proper practice of the sutta would help the world more towards prosperity moral excellence harmony peace happiness and spiritual glory than a hundred international conferences
Because man has become more clever than wise he has to face endless trouble today
Unless his cleverness is properly balanced by wisdom there is every danger of his being wiped out of existence not unlike the fate suffered by a monkey recklessly playing with a flaming cigarette lighter surrounded by open drums of gasoline
Certainly there is enough of the monkey still in man
The Mahaa Mangala Sutta holds out the promise of evolving man towards true humanity
it makes of him a complete personality physically healthy vocationally efficient intellectually brilliant socially benevolent culturally talented morally wholesome materially resplendent and spiritually unexcelled
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
In the following pages I have tried to write about those things that a lay Buddhist can do even though his home is far away from Buddhist lands or even from Buddhist temples and societies
I have had to consider the various daily and periodic events of the Buddhist calendar and retain here only those items which can be practiced by lay Buddhists without access to bhikkhus monasteries temples stupas and so on
Out of the rich traditions found in Buddhist countries only three subjects have been dealt with the daily service chanted in homage of the Three Treasures with some recollections and meditation the Uposatha days with the Eight Precepts and the Rainsresidence of three months
Most has been here about the first of these as it is very important to have some regular daily Dhammapractice
Even where isolated Buddhists are fortunate enough to be near some Buddhist center they will still benefit from these Buddhist practices all of which are based on similar methods used in the East
These days there are many books on Buddhism some reliable and more speculative so that a Buddhist living in a country where his religion is quite newly introduced is likely to have some difficulty in discerning what is really the teaching of the Buddha
However this difficulty can be overcome by the study of the original sources the Pali canon and need not be a great hindrance
Of course if the student can gain the help of some well learned and practiced Buddhist he will understand Dhamma more quickly and thoroughly
He will also be able to practice more easily
For it is a great difficulty even if one has a good acquaintance with the Suttas to know how to practice their teaching
This is more a problem for Buddhists who have to acquire all their knowledge about the Dhamma from books
One hears people like this say I am a Buddhist but what should I practice It is not enough to answer this question with more or less abstract categories saying for instance Well practice the Eightfold Path After all it is not so easy to practice the Dhamma in an alien environment where bhikkhus viharas and stupas are not found
In Buddhist lands where these and other signs of the Dhamma are to be seen the lay person has many aids to practice and is not without help when difficulties arise
But elsewhere the layman must rely upon books
Leaving aside those which are misleading and if even the most authentic sources alone are studied still the mind tends to be selective of the materials available so that it is possible to get onesided views
Now it can be a good corrective to stay in a Buddhist country for some time and get to know how things are done but not everyone has the opportunity to do this
Here then I should like to touch upon a few common ways of Buddhist practice
I shall try to be as general as possible in these matters so that my descriptions are not peculiar to the Buddhist country that I know best Siam but may be common to many Buddhist traditions
It is best to start with practices which are common to all Buddhist traditions for everyday observance
It is usual among the more wealthy lay Buddhists to have a small room set aside for their daily devotions or at least a curtainedoff recess
A few might even have a small separate building
Even poor people with little space in their houses have a special shelf high on the wall on which a Buddhaimage or picture is placed together with the usual offerings
Nowhere in the Buddhist world are Buddhaimages treated as ornaments for a living room
And a Buddha image is always given the highest seat in the room that is the Buddhaimage is displayed in the place of honor
In the shrineroom this will be on the highest part of a shrine
If on a special shelf then that shelf is usually high on the wall and has nothing above it
The fact that one places the symbol of one's Teacher in the highest place shows one's high regard for him
For this reason alone it is obvious that Buddhaimages should not be placed on mantelpieces and miscellaneous furniture
Also if the shrine occupies part of the room used for sleeping it should be near the head of the bed not at its foot
This is because that part of the body which houses most of the organs of sense and is the physical base of much mental activity  that is the head  the topmost part of a person should be directed to what one esteems as the highest in this case the symbol of the Buddha
But feet however useful are easily dirtied and become illsmelling quickly and should never be pointed at any person who is respected and certainly not at a shrine whether Buddhaimage or stupa
Perhaps some may object to such matters
One may be able to hear some people growling Buddhism has nothing to do with such things But this attitude ignores the fact that the Dhamma is relevant to all circumstances also that fine conduct was praised by the Buddha not ignored by him
So such things do matter if one is going to have objects of reverence such as Buddhaimages
Whenever we think that such matters are not worth troubling over then we are just careless and unmindful
A Buddhaimage should be treated respectfully and it is a good way of training oneself to treat the Buddhaimage as one would Gotama the Buddha himself
Reverence is a part of the Dhamma which should not be neglected for it helps in the overcoming of conceit
Buddhists of all traditions have shrines with images paintings stupas and so on just because reverence is an essential part of Buddhist training
From practices based on reverence are born humility in oneself and harmonious relationships with others and the Buddha tells us that four qualities increase for those who are respectful and honor those who are senior to them Long life and beauty happiness and strength
Who does not want them
To digress a little here on the objection raised above
This might be made by a person of rational temperament who had been able to read some translations from the Pali canon but who had never met with Buddhist teachers or been to Buddhist countries
From his reading such a person might get the impression that Theravada is coolly logical in fact a sort of eastern humanism
But this shows the selectiveness of the mind since all through the Suttas there are examples of reverence and devotion
It is true that the Buddha did not encourage his followers to give full reign to their emotions with unrestrained outbursts is all
However He did lay down three forms of reverence for bhikkhus wearing the robe with the right shoulder bared kneeling down and holding the palms of the hands together in the gesture of reverence
Prostration at the feet of the Buddha is also mentioned many times in the Suttas
Lay people are free to show their reverence in any suitable way and people of those times were recorded in the Suttas as expressing their reverence variously
So the Kalamas of Kesaputta approached the Lord
Having approached him some prostrated towards the Lord and sat down at one side some greeted the Lord politely and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way sat down to one side some raising their hands in añjali to the Lord sat down to one side some called out their names and those of their clans and sat down to one side while others saying nothing sat down to one side
 Kalama Sutta Anguttaranikaya iii
See A Criterion of True Religion Mahamakut Press Bangkok and The Kalama Sutta Wheel No BPS Kandy Sri Lanka
No doubt these expressions depended upon their confidence and serenity
Down to the present time Theravada tradition in any Buddhist country is rich in the various forms of reverence accorded to Buddhaimages stupas and to the Sangha
So a negative view as the one mentioned is neither an advantage for practice nor in agreement with tradition
But other people too might have such ideas for instance some who have read about the iconoclastic attitude of some Zen masters or of the siddhas who were the last partly Buddhist teachers in India before the extinction of Buddhism there
There are remarks and actions recorded of some of the former teachers which might lead one to expect that whatever else Zen is surely reverence plays no part in it
Such people are bound to be a little startled by the emphasis on reverence and the large devotional element present in the daily training of anyone monastic or lay who stays in a Zen training temple
The siddhas too spoke against rituals but that was because they were faced with a great overgrowth of Buddhist ritualistic devotion gradually accumulated through centuries of Mahayana and Vajrayana
In matters of devotion as in other things one should remember that the Buddha himself taught Dhamma in the middle with the rejection of extremes Confidence should be balanced with wisdom but onesided practice will not lead to great fruits
Another sort of objection which has been raised is that the forms of respect in Buddhist tradition are specially Asiatic and not suitable for Buddhists in other countries
One hears of calls for a peculiarly British or American Buddhism divested of Asiatic trimmings Perhaps the various nonIndian peoples to whom Buddhism has spread also raised such objections when Buddhist tradition contrasted with their own established cultures
However that may have been the Dhamma requires some time before it puts its roots down in any culture and before one can even begin to imagine western forms of Buddhism westerners who have long trained in the Sangha become learned and serene in their hearts are necessary
The priority in Buddhism is on properly trained people not on arguments as to exterior forms
Now to return to the shrine room
Lay people will find it most useful in the morning and evening and perhaps on some days when more time can be given to the cultivation of calm and insight
The usual course of practice taught for lay people in Buddhist countries is that they should practice giving according to their faith and as far as their circumstances allow make an effort to keep the precepts pure and as far as they are able so develop the mind in meditation
That is to say those who are less interested in Dhamma practice should at least make an effort to be generous
If they give nothing or very little when more could be given they are making little or no effort to go against the worldly stream of craving
Some who cultivate generosity may not be very good at keeping some of the Precepts but they are practicing a valuable part of Dhamma
And it is reckoned much more practical to be openhanded and devoted to the Buddha than it is merely to have a lot of unpracticed booklearning
Next will come people who not only make an effort to give generously but also try to keep the precepts
They try to conform their actions to what agrees with the Five Precepts and perhaps on special occasions undertake Eight Precepts as well a subject to be discussed below
Finally there are those who are able to practice more than dana and sila and try to cultivate their minds every day through meditation
Now the shrineroom is the place where at least the last two of these Dhammapractices may be undertaken
It should be a quiet place and one which is screened or curtained off from the sight of people not interested in Dhamma
It is desirable to have some such place apart from ordinary living rooms devoted only to Dhammapractice and where the furnishings will remind one only of Dhamma
Though these may be quite elaborate in Buddhist countries really nothing is needed which is difficult to obtain
Probably the most difficult and perhaps expensive is the Buddhaimage
Failing to obtain that an inspiring picture of the Buddha may be used
Or if one cannot be found then a good reproduction of some famous stupa could be one's focus
Whatever it is with its beauty it should evoke harmony and peace
If there is an image then one requires a low table to place it onso that the Buddhaimage is just a little higher than one's head when kneeling down
So it will be an advantage if one can kneel down on a soft mat on the floor and dispense with chairs
Once kneeling it is easy to seat oneself after offerings and recollections in meditation posture
The table upon which the Buddhaimage is placed could be covered with a new cloth perhaps something beautiful in color and texture for beauty used with restraint is an aid to devotion
In front of the Buddhatable another and lower one might be used for the offerings something like the sketch on the facing page
Apart from the Buddhaimage in the place of honor one may have other Buddhist objects round or on the shrine such as scrollpaintings Buddhist symbols such as the lotusbud wheel of Dhamma or the Bodhileaf or miniature stupas and so on
But three things are certainly needed on the shrine for making the usual offerings candlesticks an incense burner and vases or trays for flowers
In Asian countries one may see many other things offered food water drinks fruit etc
The idea behind this kind of offering is gratitude to the Teacher and the consideration that one should not partake of good things without first having offered something symbolically to Lord Buddha
The word offering rather suggests that one expects those things to be accepted but of course the Buddha having attained Nibbana is beyond acceptance and rejection
The Pali word for these things makes this matter clearer sakkara is that which should be done properly and means firstly honor and hospitality given to guests and so by extension to a symbol of one's Teacher
Regarding the incenseburner though various patterns are used in the East the cleanest method is to part fill an openmouthed bowl with clean sand and to place this on a saucer or other flat vessel
This should collect most of the ash
Some Buddhist traditions do not use vases but as in Sri Lanka arrange the flowers in patterns on trays or platters
This method of course requires time while the flowers quickly demonstrated their impermanence
People quite often ask why these three things in particular are offered
The offering of flowers is a bridge to the contemplation of the body's impermanence
An ancient Sinhalese Pali composition may be translated like this
Candles or lights are lit to symbolize the light of Dhamma which one should find in one's own heart driving out the darkness of the defilements there
In the Dhammapada there is a suitable verse for recitation while making this offering
Incense having a good smell is lighted to remind one that the Dhammalight can only be found with the aid of good moral conduct which has been so many times praised by the Buddha as in these Dhammapada verses
If these offerings are made with mindfulness of their meaning then they are not without good results
Also they act as objects for focusing the mind which in the morning may still be sleepy or in the evening may be distracted by the events of the day
These offerings lead one to concentrate the mind when reciting the Refuges and Precepts the recollections and during meditation
So we can see that these actions agree with that quality of the Dhamma called leading inward
However before we come to these aspects of practice a few words should be said on the traditional gestures of respect
Dhamma is the way for training mind speech and body
But the Buddha dhamma is sometimes regarded in a way which is too intellectual and theoretical so that there is a danger that it is not practiced as a way of training
To help with the training of the body there are various gestures which are expressions of one's confidence in and reverence for the three Treasures
These actions when performed with due mindfulness are wholesome kamma made by way of the body
Repeated frequently they become habitual bodily kamma and it is good to have the habit of reverence as part of one's character
The Buddha soon after his Enlightenment thought that to live without reverence was not suitable so he looked around with the divine eye to find some teacher under whom he could live revering him and his teachings
But he found no teacher superior to himself nor any teaching superior to the Dhamma which he had discovered
But out of reverence for that Dhamma he decided to make the Dhamma his Teacher and to live revering Dhamma
We who are his followers should follow in his footsteps and live with reverence for those three aspects of Enlightenment Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
The gestures used for this are mainly two respectful salutation with the hands and the fivelimb prostration
The first of these which may be remembered as añjali as there is no satisfactory English equivalent is made by bringing the palms of the hands together and raising them to the region of the heart or higher according to circumstances
For instance in the shrine room after kneeling down in front of the Buddha image one makes añjali before offering flowers lights and incense
And as the Teacher was the highest in the world and one to go beyond the world so one respects him by placing one's hand in añjali to the forehead
But while chanting the hands are held in añjali at heart level
This action and others described here should be done with mindfulness and therefore gracefully
And one should be careful to see that exaggerated and impetuous movements are avoided
As we remarked before the Dhamma does not encourage unrestrained expressions of emotion rather with its aid one endeavors to calm one's heart
After all these preliminary remarks we have just got into our shrine room knelt down made añjali and offered the three offerings
Now there are flowers placed in their vases or upon some offering tray candles or lamps burning brightly and a blue column of incense smoke rising to the ceiling
It is time to pay one's respects with the whole body to the Teacher
When afterwards one says Namo tassa that word namo comes from the root nam meaning to bend So now one bends oneself one's mind and body down and acknowledges that the Buddha was indeed the Perfectly Enlightened One that one's own understanding of Dhamma is insignificant
In the kneeling position one's hand in añjali are raised to the forehead and then lowered to the floor so that the whole forearm to the elbow is on the ground the elbow touching the knee
The hands palm down are four to six inches apart with just enough room for the forehead to be brought to the ground between them
Feet are still as for the kneeling position and the knees are about a foot apart
This is called the prostration with the five limbs that is the forehead the forearms and the knees
This prostration is made three times the first time to the Buddha the second to the Dhamma and the third to the Noble Sangha
An ancient tradition from Thailand makes this more explicit as it adds a Pali formula to be chanted before each of the prostrations
Before the first one may chant
Some people feel that this prostration is foreign and not at all important
They say that it may discourage people from the practice of Dhamma if their first sight of it is so alien a custom
As there are a few points to discuss here another digression must be made
Prostration in this way or similar ways which may be more complicated do not seem foreign at all when seen in a Buddhist country
There they are just the traditional ways of paying respect and western people even some nonBuddhists seldom have any difficulties
In these days when there are so many Asian religious and cultural movements in western countries a practice of this sort loses its strangeness
Certainly it is a practice which any ablebodied Buddhist may do in the seclusion of his shrine room and not feel embarrassed but at public meetings where nonBuddhists may be present it is better perhaps to restrict one's courtesies to the añjali and a simple bow
It is well to consider whatever one's beliefs about this practice that it is a long established way of showing respect in every Buddhist tradition both in the Sangha and among lay people
It is part of the common inheritance of all Buddhists in Asia while practices of this sort may be expected to spread in time to new Buddhists in other parts of the world with the increase in the number of Buddhist temples images stupas and above all with the gradual establishment of the Sangha in those countries
Though most of one's devotions are made in English it may be good to retain this short sentence in Pali
It is very ancient and found several times in the Suttas
Here is one example of its use
Thus have I heard At one time the Lord was staying near Savatthi in the Jeta Grove at Anathapindika's monastery
Now at that time the brahman Janussoni was leaving Savatthi early in the day in an allwhite carriage mares
The brahman Janussoni saw the wanderer Pilotika coming in the distance and seeing him he spoke thus to the wanderer Pilotika Now where is the revered Vacchayana coming from so early in the day
Sir I am coming from the presence of the Samana Gotama
What do you think about this Vacchayana
Has the Samana Gotama lucidity of wisdom
Do you think him wise
But who am I sir that I should know whether the Samana Gotama has lucidity of wisdom
Surely only one like Him could know whether the Samana Gotama has lucidity of wisdom
Undoubtedly it is with lofty praise that the revered Vacchayana praises the Samana Gotama
But who am I sir that I should praise the Samana Gotama
Praised by the praised is the revered Gotama chief among devas and men When this had been said Janussoni the brahman got down from his allwhite carriage mares and having arranged his upper cloth over one shoulder having bowed down to the Lord three times with his hands in añjali he uttered these inspired words Namo tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammasambuddhassa
Namo tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammasambuddhassa
Namo tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammasambuddhassa
 translated by Dr
IB
Horner in Middle Length Sayings Vol I p
Evidently this sentence expressive of praise and devotion was quite widely known as several lay people some Buddhists and others not some brahmans and at least one king uttered these inspired words
So when today we chant these words it is a sound that rings back through the ages to the Buddhatime
We may chant as the brahman did
three times in Pali while recollecting its meaning silently or use may be made of a method of chanting which translates this formula interspersing the Pali with English like this
I wish to revere with body speech and mind that Lord apportioning Dhamma
These three epithets of Gotama the Buddha express the three great qualities of Enlightenment
BHAGAVATO shows the Great Compassion of the Buddha and this we should recollect first as lovingkindness and compassion is the necessary base for our own practice of Dhamma
ARAHATO represents the Purity of the Buddha a purity unforced and everspresent to be approached by us through the practice of the Precepts
SAMMASAMBUDDHASSA stands for the quality of Wisdom the Unsurpassed Perfect Enlightenment which distinguishes a Buddha from all other men
Here Samma means perfect sam stands for by himself and Buddhassa is to the Enlightened or to the Awakened
When people ask Who is really a Buddhist the answer will be One who has accepted the Three Refuges  Buddha Dhamma and Sangha as his shelter and guiding ideal
So now that we have paid our respects to the Teacher it is usual for Buddhists to continue by affirming their Refuge in Enlightenment in three aspects the Buddha the rediscoverer of Enlightenment the Dhamma the way to that Enlightenment and the Sangha those who are practicing that way have discovered Enlightenment for themselves
That which has the nature of the Unsurpassed Perfect Enlightenment unconfused and brilliant with the qualities of Great Compassion Purity and Wisdom that is a secure refuge
So we recite this sure refuge as a reminder every day
There is a reason for repeating each refuge three times
The mind is often distracted and if words are spoken or chanted at that time then it is as though they have not been spoken at all
There is no strong intention behind them and one's Going for Refuge will be like that of a parrot
Repeating words three times is common in many Buddhist ceremonies and ensures that the mind is concentrated during at least one repetition
When one has gone for refuge and so affirmed that one is following the way taught by the Buddha then it is time to remind oneself of the basic moral precepts for daily conduct
These are the words of the Buddha from the Dhammapada
So these actions are to be avoided if one wishes to be not only human in body but also to have a human mind
And birth as a human being depends to a great extent upon the practice of the Five Precepts which are also called the Dhamma for human beings
The practice of these precepts makes this human world bearable but when such practice declines then it becomes a place of suffering and distress
Therefore it is a practice among Buddhists to bring to mind every day the Five Precepts while sitting with hands in añjali in front of the shrine
At that time one should resolve as strongly as possible to practice them and not to depart from them
They may be recited in translation as follows 
These precepts are the basic and minimal observance of moral conduct by a Buddhist
They are designed to restrain him from making bad kamma in speech and body and to serve as the basis for further growth in the Dhamma
If a Buddhist wishes to meditate for instance he must be trying to practice the Five Precepts
Meditation trains the mind away from unwholesome states but how could this be done if body and speech were uncontrolled
In connection with precepts and meditation it may be said again that all kinds of drugs should be given up before trying meditation
They confuse the mind or merely alter it temporarily  and so fall under the fifth precept  while meditation is the step by step purification of it
Now that the GoingforRefuge and the Five precepts have been recited it is time to recollect the virtues of the three things most precious to a Buddhist in the world
The Treasures of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha are not excelled by any other sort of treasure for these treasures have the nature of Enlightenment and are beyond the realm of arising and passing away
So that we appreciate well the value of these Three Treasures this translation of the passages recollecting their virtues should be recited every day
The advantage in making these recollections even in a brief form chanted once or twice a day is a gradually increasing appreciation of the Three Treasures
It is like a precious balm contained in an unglazed vessel  gradually the whole of the vessel is pervaded by the sweetness of its contents
Before going on to chant other recollections these three traditional verses from Sri Lanka can be chanted to make one's mind firm in the Refuges
It is easy for the distracted and weak mind to take refuge in the impermanent and unstable things of this world while neglecting the true Refuge which is like an incomparably brilliant diamond of adamantine quality in one's own practice of Dhamma
To put aside other refuges dogmatic and materialistic one recites
The mind which is established in the three Refuges does not suffer from doubt and wavering there are no thoughts as Was the Buddha really enlightened and so on
When the mind has firm confidence in the Three Treasures then it is not disturbed by skepticism a hindrance to the experience of deep meditation
There are other recollections which one can make and which help one to appreciate the state of a human being
People tend to hide away from decay disease and death while greatly attached to sentient beings and insentient objects
Some people try also to ignore moral responsibility for their actions
The recollections below bring all these subjects out into the light and make us face them squarely
Therefore the Buddha has said that they should be recollected by everyone daily
This recollection is specially good for arousing mentally vigorous states and for getting rid of laziness and drowsiness
Repeated every day these recollections make one value this life so that one makes the best use of it
Another practice which is beneficial as it counteracts states of mind rooted in aversion is mettabhavana widely practiced by people in Buddhist countries
The advantages are many ranging from an increase in personal happiness through such social benefits as having many good friends to ease of meditation practice dying unconfused and at least gaining a good rebirth
So as part of one's daily practice one should recite this traditional passage used in all the Buddhist countries of Southeast Asia
While chanting both these recollections one should not be too hurried
Take time over them and pause for reflection after each phrase has been chanted
In this way one prepares the mind for the next part of one's practice
When the last reflection has been finished one should change from kneeling seated on the heels to a crosslegged posture whichever one is most suitable
Those who find it difficult to get their knees anywhere near the floor may find it useful to sit in the way illustrated with a small hard cushion  inches thick under the buttocks
One should also sit on a reasonably soft surface and a square of folded rug soft carpet etc underneath one will make for the greater comfort of the knees
When seated ready to meditate one's body should be upright and yet relaxed
Carefully notice any physical strain and try to correct it
Also one must ensure that the body is balanced and comfortable before meditating  this can be done by moving the body around while seated  for once started the body should not be moved
Clothes should be not moved
Clothes should be loose and not constricting in any way
Of all the sitting positions the lotus posture is the best and firmest
But not so many people are able to get their legs into this position without a good deal of practice so the halflotus posture may be tried as it also makes the body firm
Other people find the lion posture better or where none of these can be done just sit in the ordinary crosslegged way  but the back must be straight
If it is found difficult to keep the back straight then put a cushion in the smallof the back and sit against a wall
This will help to straighten the back while it gives support to anyone who has a weak back
When all of these ways of sitting are impossible a chair may be used although it is difficult to feel really firm on a chair
When the legs are stiff it will be useful to try loosening the three joints of ankle knee and thigh with these exercises While standing raise one leg keeping it straight a foot off the floor
Support the body by grasping hold of something firm with the hand on the other side of the body
Revolve the foot from the ankle in the widest possible circle while keeping the rest of the leg still
Turn the foot a number of times both clockwise and anticlockwise
Then raise the top part of the leg until it is parallel with the ground and swing the lower leg in as wide a circle as possible from the knee
Do not move the upper leg
Reverse direction of swing and repeat several times
Then straighten the leg and swing it keeping it straight from the thigh in the largest possible circle in both directions
Repeat these three exercises from the other leg
The whole procedure may be done two or three times a day but do not overdo it to begin with  the result will be a lot of aching joints
After a month or two the joints will have become more flexible and the leg muscles more relaxed
It should then be quite easy to adopt one of these crosslegged postures for a long period of time
So much for the body
Having quietened the body and resolved not to move it while meditating what about the mind
Most people find that it moves much too fast for their mindfulness to catch
Usually what is called mind means the present time consisting of
So a mind may be concerned with any one of the five sense consciousness or it may be mindconsciousnesselement having as object something from the past present or the future or again it can be the dhammaelement consisting of the three species of mental states
It will not be mindelement which is the passive state of mind operating in deep sleep
Now a mind or rather a mind operating in deep sleep
Now a mind or rather a succession of minds which is concerned with such highly differentiated data cannot become very concentrated
Even when minds are not concerned with outer sensual stimulation and only with inward reflection they will still be discursive with words concepts pictures and feelings etc
In the state of meditation we try to cut out even these inward disturbances by fixing the mind upon one subject which is not discursive
This will conduce to our minds being only wholesome states which tend towards concentration and peacefulness
The mental stream of minds concerned with many unwholesome states defiled by being rooted in greed aversion and delusion are unconcentrated
Defilements lead to mental troubles among them distraction dullness boredom drowsiness lust attachment and aversion
But the absence of defilements means the growth of strong wholesome states and hence of increases in clarity and concentration
So when one has sat down already and made one's body comfortable then reflect a little This is not the time to think about the past or the future
Even thoughts about the present must be put down now
This is the time to quieten and concentrate the mind
To follow the Way of Lord Buddha to make the mind firm and unshakable
Now I shall only observe my meditation subject Breathe in out in
Two subjects in particular are suitable for a Buddhist who has no direct contact with a meditation teacher
One is mindfulness of breathing the other the development of lovingkindness
There are many other subjects but these two are the most widely used and can usually be employed without a meditation teacher's guidance
Here each one will be treated briefly as there are other books in which they are dealt with in greater detail
Mindfulness of breathing was by tradition the subject used by Gotama in his efforts to attain Enlightenment
It is most suitable for promoting calm and concentrated states and so for quelling the distracted mind
It is taught in a number of different ways but in all of them the meditator must first find one point in the breathing process where the breath can be watched
Concentration upon the breath entering and leaving the nostrils or upon the upper lip is good for encouraging clear and concentrated mental states except for people who experience some tension in the head or for those who find this subject too subtle
For both types of persons or for people when affected in these ways to concentrate upon the rising and falling of the diaphragm is beneficial
When one has sat down and begun meditation it is advisable not to change one's subject but from time to time as the quality of meditation practice changes for better or worse according to circumstances the point of concentration or even the subject may be changed as it becomes necessary
One should view the meditation subject as a medicine to cure the diseases of the mind and as the symptoms of those diseases change so the subject of one's meditation can be changed
For instance a person practicing with mindfulness of breathing may find that he is being disturbed by angry thoughts it may become necessary then for the control of such thoughts to switch to the meditation on lovingkindness
However before changing the subject of meditation it is very helpful to get the advice of someone who is wellestablished in meditation practice
Having fixed upon one point for watching the breath keep the mind there
You can judge for yourself how successful you are by what happens after this
If the mind is continuously just fixed on breathinginout with no other senseobjects not even of other parts of the body and no discursive thought then one is doing well for meditation is fine and calm
If you do perceive other senseobjects for instance loud or soft noises from outside but your mind is not shaken from the concentration on breathinginout merely having awareness of them which returns immediately to the breathing when they cease without discursive thought concentration is good
If the mind is mostly fixed on breathinginout but also strays to body consciousness elsewhere round the body but still without discursive thoughts then it is not so bad
But if one's breathinginoutmind is frequently disturbed by other mental states consisting of ideas pictures etc then there is still a lot of work to do
Even if one's meditation is up to the first standard there is no need for complacency as there is plenty more to do
The more advanced aspects of meditation do require guidance and one should make every effort to get in contact with a reliable source of teaching
The time that one gives to meditation must depend upon the individual although less than  minutes is of little benefit unless the mind is very well concentrated
Also it is a good discipline to resolve to practice every day and at the same time
One should not practice on some days but not on others
This shows a wavering mind and cannot accomplish much
And when one has determined to meditate every day one should also resolve to practice for the same length of time each day not one day twenty and next only five minutes
If one's practice is not regular then this shows weakness of the mind and such a mind is good at suggesting Today it is too hot Today I am too tired and a thousand and one other excuses
The best time for meditation is early morning when everything is quiet and while the mind and body are rested
If one meditates once a day then this is the best time to do it
Some people like to meditate twice and do some practice also in the evening
However personal experience will soon make it clear that while hunger is not conducive to meditation neither is a full stomach
Tiredness may also be a limiting factor in the evening
The Development of Lovingkindness is another very valuable practice
It aims at the dissolution of angry averse states of mind and the increase of that kind of love which is cool capable of extension to all and nonpossessive
A word here about love
In English we have only this one word which has to describe a great range of emotions whereas in Pali there are several words describing three levels
The lowest is the one we share with the animals lust which is based on powerful desires for pleasant feelings and is completely selfish
This kind of love does not consider others at all and cares only for selfgratification
In Pali its name is kama
When there is no kama deliberate sexual intercourse is impossible
Kama causes sex to appear attractive and is strengthened when the senses are not guarded
Hence the Buddha's injunction for bhikkhus to restrain their senses to some extent and this will help to limit the arising kama making for greater peace of heart
Second is sneha the viscous attachment which holds families together
This love is not totally selfish but rather regards the attachment as a bargain out of which oneself and others get something
For instance the husband gets home cooking while the wife obtains security to rear a family
The terms of this bargain of course may differ quite widely
But sneha is only capable of being extended to a few people who are involved in this bargain
By contrast metta or lovingkindness is a love not hot with lust nor sticky with attachment it is cool and does not consider personal benefits
The person who has metta is concerned with the happiness of others before he thinks about himself
No human relationship can last long and be of great benefit if it is not founded on metta for only such love can be extended to other beings generally and without limitation to some group
Usually our relations with other people are made up of kama sometimes sneha frequently with a sprinkling of metta now and again
From the point of view of meditation practice kama hinders it while metta helps it
Metta must be practiced first towards oneself
That is to say one cannot love others unless first one has established love in one's own heart
To try spreading metta to others before strengthening it in oneself is like a poor man who proposes to give out money for others' benefit
To have metta for oneself means a relative absence of conflicts in oneself to be at peace with oneself
So the first thing to do in sitting meditation is to repeat over and over again May I be at peace When the mind becomes calm and one can feel about one's heart the brightness of metta then it is possible to start practicing it towards other people
Having cultured lovingkindness in one's heart one may next picture any person whom one respects deeply and constantly wish for that person May he be happy Having developed towards that person the same or greater intensity of metta then go on to see in the mind a person with whom one is just friendly and after that a neutral person
Only then may one consider a person who is disliked or even one who is hated
In each case the emotional tone accompanying the mental picture should be the same and only when it has reached the same intensity should one move on to the next person to be considered
It is useless to begin with those one dislikes as such practice is merely the extension of what is already there  aversion  rather than the development of something new  metta
To begin with the disliked just wearies oneself and gets one nowhere
In this meditation thoughts of lovingkindness must be backed up by the emotional feeling associated with lovingkindness if they are to be really effective in ridding oneself of aversion
This power of metta is used to break down the walls which we erect around ourselves the walls of aversion and dislike so that metta properly practiced becomes by deep meditation not only widespread but infinite in extent
One to whom each person and each living being are equally dear who wishes happiness for all sentient beings visible and invisible in every direction and state of existence whose heart is endued with lovingkindness abundant exalted measureless free from enmity and free from affliction has truly succeeded with this practice
But metta fails when it falls into either of two extremes
The first of these is called the near enemy that is selfish physical desire or kama
So one should not attempt to practice metta in meditation towards a person for whom one has kama
The second is known as the far enemy and means the opposite of metta  illwill anger and so on
So much for the practice of metta as a meditation
Besides mind a human being has two other channels of communication  speech and bodily action
Therefore digressing again from what is done in the shrineroom one should make efforts to express lovingkindness in these two ways as well
As far as speech is concerned make an effort to cut out sharp or harsh words when they are spoken in anger while trying to cultivate kindly speech
And as speech to be convincing has to be backed up by bodily action one's body should express lovingkindness too
See that it performs acts of helpfulness and service
See that one is cleanhanded  that is that things which could be given do not stick to one's hands for generosity is a companion and supporter of lovingkindness
If one makes an effort like this with one's speech and body it will be helpful to one's meditation on metta while that in turn will ensure that one's good actions are not just an empty facade
The subject of meditation is vast as the mind with which it deals is intricate and there are many different methods suited to different minds with their defilements
In this brief section only two methods have been mentioned and their development has only been outlined upon the side of calm
The development of calm is very necessary before going on to the development of insight in which impermanence unsatisfactoriness and nonself are investigated as the mind must be strong and undistracted for insight to penetrate towards enlightenment
The development of calm cannot be dealt with here and no book however extensive can replace the advice of a meditation master
It is possible that if the mind becomes deeply concentrated and states quite new to the meditator are suddenly experienced that fear may arise
Fear can also be troublesome if an object of mind comes up a mental picture which is horrible to the meditator
If such fear should arise then the meditator should leave that object and turn to the Recollection of the Three Treasures mentally repeating Indeed the Exalted One is thus The Accomplished destroyer of defilement If the fear is banished by the first Recollection then one's meditation can be resumed otherwise one should go on to recite The Dhamma of the Exalted One is wellexpounded and The Sangha of the Exalted One's disciples who have practiced well until all fear is cured in the mind
This is sure to be dispelled as the Buddha has said in the Dhajagga Sutta because one is recollecting the qualities of Buddha Dhamma and Sangha which are free of greed free of aversion and free of delusion and are therefore free from fear
This is where strong and sure Refuge in the three Treasures is shown to be so valuable for if strong confidence in them is present fear has no chance
But the mind in which there are many doubts is easily shaken and fear can get a hold there
Wellbalanced Dhamma practice should dispel the causes giving rise to fears but if these persist it is necessary to ask someone competent in meditation how they should be treated
At the conclusion of meditation one should gently bring the mind back to its usual state of engagement with the senses
During this time the limbs should not be moved quickly but gently rubbed if they are cool or have gone to sleep when one is quite ready then it is time to chant the Anumodana
This is one of those words which it is very difficult to translate into English
It means literally rejoicing with or after but implies asking beings to rejoice in the good kamma which one has made and so benefit themselves It is often translated blessing but this gives the wrong picture as one is inviting other beings to rejoice at what one has done one is not invoking some blessing of another power upon them
The person who is inviting others to rejoice does not actually share his merits although this expression is often seen
How can merits be shared indeed
As puñña is good kamma one should remember I am the owner of my kamma heir to my kamma so how can it be shared with others
Good kamma or puñña is not like a cake which can be cut up into pieces and handed round
What one does is not sharing but dedicating one's puñña to other beings infinite immeasurable
And these beings to whom one dedicates kamma may be either living this life or else reborn in other states
In dedicating it to them one asks them to rejoice and when they do so they also make good kamma which is the direct cause of their happiness
The Path Secure mentioned in the verses below is the attainment of streamentry when a person has seen Nibbana for the first time known the Truth of Dhamma for himself and is no longer liable to fall into low subhuman births
These verses are part of a longer Pali composition by King Mahamongkut of Siam possibly written while he was still a prince and bhikkhu holding the position of Abbot of Wat Bovoranives in Bangkok
Having finished this recitation one should stay quiet with a heart full of lovingkindness for all beings just for a short while
Then to conclude the service one again makes the prostration with five limbs three times
In Theravada Buddhist countries the traditional verses and passages as well as the Discourses of the Buddha whether used in services or for other occasions are usually recited in Pali the language spoken by the Buddha
In each country there are somewhat different traditions of chanting and pronunciation of Pali
Besides the established traditions of Pali chanting there are also in countries like Thailand ways of chanting in the language of the people
Few lay people understand the grammar of Pali though many may know a number of important phrases and terms in that language so we find that lay people chant in Pali following each phrase with a translation in the vernacular
This can often be heard in Thailand where school children also chant verses composed in Thai on the respect that should be given to the Buddha Dhamma Sangha parents and teachers
In countries where Buddhism is either newly introduced or again flourishing after a period of neglect there may be very few who understand Pali while on the other hand many may wish for some devotional and reflective practice for their daily lives
Hence the short number of texts suggested here are all in English
Then comes the question of how to chant in this language
Lay Buddhists can be guided by the Buddha's words when some bhikkhus began to sing the Dhamma
Bhikkhus there are these five dangers when Dhamma is chanted with a long singing sound
From these five disadvantages we understand that it is disrespectful for a bhikkhu to sing or intone the Dhamma in such a way that its meaning is lost
This rule of course does not apply to lay people but in Buddhist lands the latter perhaps guided by the conduct of bhikkhus have made little or no use of music for religious purposes
After all what are we trying to achieve by chanting the words relating to the Buddha and his teaching
Is it not to gain calm through a mind concentrated on Dhamma
Then music has rather an exciting effect on many people and so is opposed to our aim
Again compared with western religion Buddhism has a different aim
There the object of chanting and singing is to make sounds pleasing to the Creator's ear out of love or fear of him
But Buddhists are not burdened with such an idea for our aim and goal lies within to be attained by our own efforts not by propitiation of an external power
Lord Buddha was one who spoke in praise of silence and restraint so in preparing ourselves to be silent restraint should be used in our chanting
The various passages which have been recommended here for this purpose are embedded in much explanatory matter and people who wish to use them and any other reflections which they have found stirring could copy them all out to form a chanting book
Then only one thing remains to be done and that will come about through daily use learn these texts by heart
Even if one is far from home one can then quietly repeat them to oneself and so not break one's regular practice
In the various Buddhist countries there is a great variety of chants and recollections and even neighboring monasteries may have their own traditions and not use all the same items
Those given here in English translation are among the most popular and common to most traditions
Others can be added according to individual preference and knowledge
There is no such thing as a standard morning and evening service in the Buddhist world and even between these two there may be differences of items used
So much for daily practice in the shrine room
Then what about Dhammapractice outside the shrineroom
This is really a subject which goes beyond the scope of this book
All the important aspects of a layman's practice of the Dhamma have been written about in other books
However mention may be made of these things
The giving of material things for instance to support bhikkhus to give to the poor starving and so forth
There is no lack of opportunity to practice this in our overpopulated world
And Buddhists who have enough of this world's wealth enough of clothes food shelter and medicine which are the basic necessities for life should practice dana bearing in mind that what is given away is truly well preserved while what is kept is wasted
The practice running counter to the worldly way of craving and attachment is very important in the present materialistic civilization with its emphasis upon gain and accumulation of possessions
Nothing much can be done in Dhamma until one is prepared to open one's heart and one's hands to others
The giving of Dhamma means the gift of some useful teaching and advice for others
It is necessary to know what will benefit them if one would give this gift in the right way
Dhamma is the supreme gift in the world as said by the Buddha
All material things wear out with use but the Dhamma increases as we practice it
And material things give benefit only in this life while the Dhamma benefits the practice now and in future lives as well
The giving of nonfear
This means acting in such a way that other beings do not have any cause to fear oneself
This is another name for the practice of lovingkindness and is based upon good moral conduct
The Five Sila have been mentioned above
The Eight Sila will be dealt with in connection with the Uposatha day
Besides these lists of precepts which are guides to good conduct one should study those discourses of the Buddha like the Singalovada in which he has given the principles which will conduce to a harmonious society
This must be founded upon wholesome mental states in the individual and for this the following practices are essential
The four Divine Abidings Lovingkindness compassion joywithothers and equanimity bring two blessings harmony within and peace with other people
Their importance in Buddhist practice cannot be overemphasized
They are the educators of the heart or emotions and from a Buddhist point of view it will be better to be gentle and nonaggressive though lacking intellectual knowledge of Dhamma
Such a person shows that he has been tamed by the Dhamma of nonharming but mere knowledge of the Dhamma divorced from practice makes only for conceit and an increase of views
Reading the Suttas in translation especially the Anguttaranikaya will bring to light many discourses containing valuable advice for lay Buddhist practice
It would be useful to collect these together and then read them through from time to time
A reading of such relevant suttas might be introduced into the evening service every day or else read upon Uposatha days
This brings us to the subject of the second part of this book
The word means entering to stay in the Buddhist sense in a vihara or monastery
But it has a long history before Buddhist times as it was the custom of the brahmans who performed the Vedic rites and sacrifices to go to the sacred place away from their homes and families and purify themselves by leading a secluded life for a day and night returning after the rites were finished
The days when they kept this seclusion were determined by the phases of the moon the most important being the Full Moon and the New Moon days
Two other days the quartermoon days were also observed
Here it may be helpful to say something about the lunar month
This is a month of  days
Two months have days that is one of thirty and one of twentynine
Each month is divided into fortnights of the waxing moon and of the waning moon
Each half is therefore of or days and in each half the days are numbered from the first of the waxing moon to the fourteenth of the waxing moon and then from the first of the waning moon to the fourteenth of the waning moon
A new lunar month always begins with the waxing halfmonth
The eighth day of both bright and dark halves is the quartermoon day
In the Buddhatime various groups of ascetics and wanderers used the traditional Full and New moon days for expounding their theories and practices while the Buddha allowed bhikkhus to assemble on these days to listen to the recitation of the Patimokkha and to teach Dhamma to the lay people who came to their monastery
From that time down to the present the Uposatha days have been observed by Buddhists both ordained and laity in all Buddhist countries
The practice of Buddhists as known to the writer from Siam  and there are many local variations  is along these lines Early in the morning lay people give almsfood to the bhikkhus who may be walking on almsround invited to a layman's house or the lay people may take the food to the monastery
Usually lay people do not eat before serving their food to the bhikkhus and they may eat only once that day specially where the bhikkhus practice eating a single meal
In any case their food is finished before noon
Before the meal the laity request the Eight Precepts which they promise to undertake for a day and night
It is usual for lay people to go to the local monastery and to spend all day and night there
In different monasteries of course the way they spend their time will not be the same and much depends on which aspect of the Dhamma is stressed there study or practice
Where there is more study they will hear as many as three or four discourses on Dhamma delivered by senior bhikkhus and they will have books to read and perhaps classes on Abhidhamma to attend
But they are quite free to plan their own time with meditation discussion of Dhamma with the bhikkhus and so on
In a meditation monastery lay people will get less instruction and that will be about the Practice of Dhamma while most of their time will be spent mindfully employed  walking and seated meditation with some time given to helping the bhikkhus with their daily duties
So the whole of this day and night is given over to Dhamma
The Bhikkhus on these days have to meet and listen to one bhikkhu recite by heart the rules of training contained in the Patimokkha
This meeting may take an hour or more and lay people may or may not attend according to the tradition of that monastery
Apart from this regular observance some bhikkhus may undertake an extra austere practice such as not lying down on the Uposatha night which means the effort to try and meditate in the three postures of walking standing and sitting all night
This is the practice in brief of entering to stay at a monastery in Asia
Obviously a Buddhist who has no facilities like these in a nonbuddhist country must spend his Uposatha differently
Perhaps the first thing to consider is whether it is worth trying to keep the Uposatha days
Why are they kept on the phases of the moon
The origin of the Uposatha days in Buddhist teachings is found in the following story
The occasion was this The Blessed One was living at Rajagaha on the VulturePeak Rock and at that time Wanderers of other sects were in the habit of meeting together on the Half Moons of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth and the Quarter Moon of the Eighth and preaching about Dhamma
People went to hear about the Dhamma from them
They grew fond of the Wanderers of other sects and believed in them
So the Wanderers gained support
Now while Seniya Bimbisara king of Magadha was alone in retreat he considered this and he thought Why should the venerable ones not meet together too on these days
Then he went to the Blessed One and told him what he had thought adding Lord it would be good if the venerable ones met together too on these days
The Blessed One instructed the king with a talk on the Dhamma after which the king departed
Then the Blessed One made this the occasion for a discourse on the Dhamma and he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus I allow meetings on the Half Moons of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth and the Quarter Moon of the Eighth
So the bhikkhus met together on those days as allowed by the Blessed One but they sat in silence
People went to hear the Dhamma
They were annoyed and they murmured and protested How can the monks the sons of the Sakyans meet together on these days and sit in silence dumb as hogs
Ought not the Dhamma to be preached when they meet
Bhikkhus heard this
They went to the Blessed One and told him
He made this the occasion for a discourse on the Dhamma and he addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus when there is a meeting on the Half Moons of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth and the Quarter Moon of the Eighth I allow preaching of the Dhamma
 The Life of the Buddha trans
by the late Bhikkhu anamoli p

We can see from this that the Uposatha day was already popular at that time in fact India had already a lunar calendar
The Buddha sometimes allowed popular practices when he had investigated them to see whether they were profitable
In this case he saw that there were advantages for Dhammapractice in the Uposatha days so he allowed them
But we should understand clearly that Dhamma in its various aspects was not taught by him out of conformity with preBuddhist traditions
Dhamma was taught by him based on Enlightenment  having seen everything as it truly is
So the teaching  for instance of kamma  was because he had seen the truth of this for himself
Similarly with the Uposatha days the importance of which are underlined by a number of discourses on the subject in the Anguttaranikaya the Book of the Eights
But if the timing of the Uposatha days in Buddhist tradition was fixed merely to coincide with the existing lunar calendar and the traditional observances connected with it then today when most people work in countries which do not follow a lunar calendar it would seem sensible to have days for special Buddhist observance during the weekends
Is there any other significance to the Uposatha days falling on the phases of the moon
A fairly new branch of biology called chronobiology studies the rhythmicity in nature and appears to support the importance of the Uposatha days particularly the full moon observance
Dr
W
Menaker of New York writing in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology has observed as the result of an analysis of data on birth and conception that the coincidences between the lunar month of
and the average duration of the menstrual cycle of  days constitutes a combination of circumstances that points to the synodic lunar month as the time unit of the human sexual reproductive cycle It seems as though the keeping of the Uposatha days by large numbers of the Buddhist laypeople until recent times will have helped to limit the growth of the population in Buddhist countries
Some people have also observed that sexual desire comes to a peak with the full moon
Those who understand that restraint in this and other sensual appetites is good will see that there is a good cause for keeping at least the full moon as an Uposatha day
Chronobiologists are now working on the assumption that as the oceans are affected by the moon so the water in the body is also affected  As our bodies are about twothirds 'sea' and onethird 'land' we must sustain 'tidal' effects This seems reasonable looked at from the teaching given on the elements by the Buddha  Whatever is internal liquid element and whatever is external liquid element just these are the liquid element  though the context for this quotation is the development of insight
At any rate development in the Dhamma goes in the direction of becoming less affected by desires concerning the body for to have such desires is to have a defiled mind
The defilements and passions can best be controlled when they can be seen  when they are strongest
It is impossible to restrain defilements in oneself when they are not apparent though they may operate underground
For instance the person who is wellprovided with wealth and comforts may not be able to see greed or aversion at work in himself these defilements have not surfaced since the sea of satisfied desires in which they swim is deep enough
But place this person in a bare little hut with poor food only once a day and a strict discipline to control his actions and then see what happens
The monsters of the deep all rise to the surface and clamor for more extensive waters in which to sport
On the other hand the attitude of good bhikkhus shows the right way to deal with defilements
Some of the strongest  sensuality and sloth  manifest themselves at night so the night was recommended by the Buddha as the time when they could be tackled most effectively
An enemy that one has not seen and known cannot be defeated but an enemy well known and attacked with the weapons of Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right Collectedness has no hope to win
It is the same on Uposatha days
The defilements that show themselves then can be restrained and limited with the aid of the Uposatha discipline which includes the Eight Precepts
Let us consider it from another point of view
Renunciation is a thread which runs through all Buddhist practice
If one practices Giving then one renounces the pleasures that could be bought with that wealth
When the Five Precepts are practiced then one renounces the actions covered by them which may be pleasurable or thrilling to some and are in any case unwholesome
And when effort is made to meditate the earnest practicer will soon find that certain pleasures and distractions offered by this world just do not go with a calm and mindful mind so he renounces them
The Eight Precepts to be discussed below are part of the same way of practice a discipline for a lay person's temporary renunciation
In the Sutta mentioned above the Buddha speaks of a noble disciple reflecting By undertaking the Uposatha with its eight precepts for a day and a night I renounce the way of common men and live as the arahants do for all their lives compassionate pure and wise
So the Right Precepts are really a test of how far one can discipline oneself
That means really to what extent do wholesome states of mind consonant with Dhammapractice predominate in one's character over unwholesome desires built on greed aversion and delusion
The practice of the Eight Precepts gives one a chance to find out about this
And this is an investigation which one can make four times a month if one wishes
We have seen how lay people in Buddhist countries periodically withdraw for twentyfour hours to a monastery for the practice for some special Dhamma
But what is to be done where there is no monastery no bhikkhus and no possibility of taking time off from work
First on these days or on some of them one could be a bit more in the shrine room
This would include reciting the Eight Precepts instead of the five and if one knows any special discourse of the Buddha in Pali or in English they should be chanted or read through
A very appropriate sutta to chant or read is the Discourse on the Eightpart Uposatha and to this could be added such popular suttas as the Discourse on Lovingkindness and the Discourse on the truly Auspicious
Longer suttas such as the Discourse on Treasures and the Discourse on Setting in motion the Wheel of Dhamma would be appropriate if one has time
Apart from precepts and discourses more time should be given to meditation on these days so if one uses the shrine room only once on ordinary days it should be used twice upon these days while making the effort to sit rather longer
When the Eight Precepts are backed up by the calm strong mind produced in meditation then they become easy to keep
The Dhamma that one can practice during the day at work must be decided by each person taking account of his own personality and of the circumstances surrounding him
Of course one tries to keep one's conduct within the bounds of the Eight Precepts and do only those things which are consonant with the spirit of the precepts
One may find it possible to practice Giving in some way on these days and some short periods devoted to some of the recollections might be possible  it depends on each person to find his own ways and means
This brings us to the Eight Precepts and some remarks upon them
The precepts are as follows
It has always been understood by Buddhist lay people that if one undertakes these Eight Precepts then great efforts should be made not to break any of them
The Five Precepts represent a general measure for ordinary life and in practice people have a flexible attitude towards minor infringements of some of them
But the Eight Precepts are a more serious commitment and should not be undertaken lightly
If one does take them on then one should feel reasonably certain whatever one's interior and exterior circumstances that none of the precepts will be broken
In the case of the first one not only should one not kill any living being but also one should not do the sort of work which might involve one in killing unintentionally where one has no choice in the matter
Even acts which are harmful in any way to others should be avoided on an Uposatha day
Few people have work which involves killing and fewer still of these people will be Buddhists as such work must be repugnant to sincere Dhammapracticers
The second precept will need attention in such things as using for one's own purposes materials belonging to the firm that one works for or taking extra or surplus materials for oneself or others without permission to do so
Taking what is not given would also include such practices as adulteration of materials for sale and making others work without adequate remuneration
The third precept is changed from the set of five
There wrong conduct means all kinds of sex which results in harm to others  breaking up for others' marriages rape and the seduction of minors for instance
But under this precept unchaste conduct means that all kinds of sexual behavior are to be avoided whether they are wrong conduct or are allowable in normal lay life whether with others or by selfstimulation
The Buddha has said
And when this abstinence is to be practiced only for one two or four days a month there should be no great difficulty
The fourth precept requires a special watch on the runaway tongue
This means the effort to practice Right Speech that is speech which is true brings harmony between people is gentle and has meaning
Dhamma has all these qualities and one's speech should be in accordance with it
One who has taken the Uposatha precepts should try not to become involved in worldly chatter or arguments
And similarly with words on paper newspapers and magazines which just distract the mind should be avoided for this day
If one wants to read then it should be a book on Dhamma
It should not be too hard to keep the fifth precept strictly on these days
Under this precept one must include any kind of intoxicant taken for pleasure and escape so drugs soft and hard find a place here as well as alcohol
At all times a Buddhist is trying to increase in the quality of heedfulness 
But intoxicants only increase unwholesome states of mind so that a person becomes more heedless
The sixth precept also follows the practice of bhikkhus and aims at cutting down the sloth which is experienced after a day's work and a substantial evening meal while it ensures that the body is light and fit for meditative practice
In the precept the words outside the time mean after twelve noon until dawn the following day
During this time no food is eaten
However some flexibility will be needed here with people going out to work
For them it would mean no food after their midday lunch until breakfast the next day
If one is troubled by tiredness after work on a day when these precepts are undertaken then tea or coffee are allowable as refreshing drinks
If hunger is the trouble then cocoa should cure it
None of these refreshments should contain milk which is considered a food though sugar honey and butter are allowed presumably because one can take only a little of these things
Fruit juices which have been strained are other possible drinks
The seventh precept is really a compound of two in the Ten Precepts of a novice and therefore falls into two parts the first on dancing entertainments and the second concerned with wearing garlands cosmetics The first half is aimed at keeping mind speech and body away from all kinds of amusements
Not of course that they are sinful but that they turn the mind out through the senses arouse defilements and cause conflicts where there might be peace
So these days under this precept must be put radio television theater cinema and sporting events
These are all ways of escape from being quiet
The second half of the precept is directed against vanity and conceit arising by way of the body
The tradition in the East is for Buddhists who undertake these precepts to clothe themselves simply in white cloth with no adornments
This will not be possible for the lay Buddhist who goes out to work but on such days jewelry could be left at home scents and lotions not used on the body nor cosmetics on the face
The last precept concerns sleep
Just as all the other luxuries have been cut out so the luxury of a large soft bed should be dispensed with for this night
In warm Buddhist countries a mat on the floor is enough but where the weather is colder a hard mattress or folded blankets on the floor could be used
On a hard surface the body actually relaxes more than on a soft one also there is less desire to sleep long
On these nights an effort should be made to restrict sleep to the minimum
A large bed means one in which two people sleep
The Buddhist who practices these precepts for a day and a night always sleeps by himself
This summarizes the practice of the Uposatha day
Some people may think these precepts too difficult to carry out in the midst of an alien society
Others may think them too easy to bother about
But before any judgment is passed on them try practicing them for a few Uposathas and then see what is the result
Effort made to practice Dhamma can never bear bad fruits
According to tradition one may practice the Eight Precepts on the Full Moon New Moon and two Quartermoon days
This is for someone who is really making an effort and whose circumstances allow him to do so
Others might undertake them on the two Uposatha days  the Full and New Moon days
Or if they are to be undertaken one day a month this will usually be on the Full Moon
Where this had been found by experience to be quite impossible then the Uposatha could be kept on weekends
Better this than nothing at all
But then married lay people may find that this will conflict with their family responsibilities  perhaps to others in the family who are not Buddhist
This is something for individual Buddhists to decide for themselves
This is a period of three months when bhikkhus must reside in one place and cannot wander though they may undertake all their usual duties provided that they do not take them away from their monasteries overnight
In special circumstances they may even be absent from the monastery or residence where they have vowed to keep the Rains for as long as seven days
As bhikkhus do not withdraw more than usual at this time from involvement with lay people unless they are devoting all their time to meditation it is better to translate vassavasa literally as rainsresidence rather than rainsretreat
The rains residence was instituted by the Buddha to prevent bhikkhus traveling during the Rainy Season of India and SE
Asia and so damaging the crops and the living creatures which are abundant then
No doubt he considered their health as well when he laid down that bhikkhus must spend the rains with four walls round them and a roof over their heads
From the beginning this was a time when a bhikkhu could live near a teacher a senior bhikkhu who had specialized in meditation in the Discipline or in the Discourses
He had the chance then to make intensive efforts and learn whatever the teacher taught
After the Rains especially in the early days when bhikkhus mostly wandered and had few monasteries the teacher might receive an invitation to go elsewhere and the settled association with pupils would be broken
And then during the Rains there are fewer visitors to the quieter and more secluded monasteries so that more intensive efforts are possible at this time
In Buddhist countries this is still the time for intensive activity the meditator meditates more and undertakes more of the austere practices the student of books makes more effort to master his studies the teachermonk is more active in teaching Dhamma and the writer in writing
In some countries this is the time when many laymen mostly the young get temporary ordination as Rainsbhikkhus usually for about four months after which they disrobe and return to the layman's state
They are honored by others with the name pandit for the learning and good conduct that they have acquired in the monastery and benefit their families and society in general by bringing this knowledge back with them
This general intensification of activities in the Sangha leads lay people to consider what they can do during this period
Usually a lay person on the day of entering the Rains makes a vow or vows to practice in a certain way during the three months of the Rainsresidence
This vow may be told to a senior bhikkhu or it may be kept private but in any case it is made in front of a Buddhist shrine
This is something which could be done by any one who wanted to tighten up on practice for the duration of the Rainsresidence
The content of the vows vary with one's character country and circumstances
Below are a number of typical vows made by lay people on Rainsentry day some of which could be practiced by isolated Buddhists
The vows must be practicable
It is no good making vows perhaps quite exalted ones which are out of one's range and only another extension of one's ego
A person who practices the Dhamma for a while gets to know his strength and weaknesses and will know therefore what it possible for him to undertake
At the end of the Rains having accomplished one's vows without a break one feels that something worthwhile has been done
And sometimes these temporary practices have a lasting effect  the smoker does not go back to tobacco or the meditator finds that his practice goes so much better that he continues to sit twice a day and so on
During the Rains residence some lay people in Buddhist countries undertake one or two of the austere practices which were allowed by the Buddha for bhikkhus
It is not possible for lay people to practice most of them but Acariya Buddhaghosa in his Path of Purification has written there that they can undertake the Onesessioner's practice and the bowlfoodeater's practice
For an isolated Buddhist who goes out to work even these two could not be practiced
The Onesessioner's practice means eating one meal in one session a day
Practiced strictly a person does not even drink foods at other times but having sat down eats enough to last for twentyfour hours
The Bowlfoodeater's practice is undertaken when a person does not have many plates and dishes but puts all the food to be eaten on one vessel  the sweet with the main part of the meal though without necessarily mixing them
Both practices are good for limiting greed for food for fine flavors and desires for fine textures etc
Food is taken by such lay people as a medicine which is necessary to cure the disease of hunger
It is not used for the satisfaction of sensual desires
Particularly for greed characters such restraint can be valuable
And if during the Rains one cannot do anything else at least one should at this time practice dana to the best of one's ability and in whatever personal ways it is possible to give
Impersonal giving for instance having amounts stopped out of one's wage packet should be avoided as there is little or no good kamma made in such ways
It may be that giving time and sympathy with the effort to help others may be more effective than giving money or goods
The Rains traditionally is the time when lay people have the chance to increase their practice of dana and even though one may not live near to the Sangha there are still plenty of opportunities for giving
This is simply to generate some zeal for Dhamma in oneself
To bring the Dhamma to life in oneself
To get away from reading books on it and into doing it
Not just to take a mild intellectual interest in it but to make it the basis of one's life
Not only to go to an occasional lecture on the subject but to consider
What can I DO Not to be content to play with the ideas of Buddhism  making sure that these do not touch one's precious self but to get into Dhamma so that what is rotten in oneself is changed
Not to haggle about the finer points of atta and anatta when one has not even got round to making effort with the Five Precepts
Not to talk of the Void while one harbors hatred in one's heart
Not to be way up there with subtle ideas but to get down to being loving and generous
Not to be swayed at every turn by the world but to have a discipline based on Dhamma for one's life
A lay person in a nonBuddhist country is not only surrounded by a culture which is opposed to the practice of many aspects of Dhamma but he is often without the help which can be got from bhikkhus and experienced lay teachers
If then he does make the effort to practice along the lines suggested here sooner or later he will be engulfed
His mild interest in Dhamma fades away or gets lost in the jungle of conflicting desires
One cannot stand still in Dhamma
Either one makes effort and cultivates oneself or one slides away from Dhamma to deterioration
Everything suggested here is on the side of Dhamma and leads one to grow in Dhamma so here is a chance to put into practice the Buddha's words
Thus have I heard At one time the Exalted One was staying near Savatthi at the Eastern monastery in the mansion Migara's mother
Then Visakha Migara's mother approached the Exalted One having approached and bowed down she sat down in a suitable place
When she was seated the Exalted One spoke thus to Visakha Migara's Mother
Visakha when the Uposatha undertaken with its eight component practices is entered on it is of great fruit of great advantage of great splendor of great range
And how Visakha is the Uposatha undertaken with its eight component practices entered on is of great fruit great advantage great splendor and great range
Here Visakha a noble disciple considers thus
'For all their lives the arahants dwell having abandoned killing living beings refrain from killing living beings they have laid down their staffs laid down their weapons they are conscientious sympathetic compassionate for the good of all living beings so today I dwell for this night and day having abandoned killing living beings refraining from killing living beings I am one who has laid down my staff laid down my weapon I am conscientious sympathetic compassionate for the good of all living beings
By this practice following after the arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me'
It is undertaken by this first practice
 'For all their lives the arahants dwell having abandoned taking what is not given refrain from taking what is not given they are takers of what is given those who expect only what is given themselves become clean without thieving so today I dwell for this night and day having abandoned taking what is not given refraining from taking what is not given
I am a taker of what is given one who expects only what is given by myself become clean without thieving
By this practice following after the arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me'
It is undertaken by this second practice
 'For all their lives the arahants dwell having abandoned unchaste conduct they are of chaste conduct living aloof refrain from sex which is the way of common society so today I dwell for this night and day having abandoned unchaste conduct I am of chaste conduct living aloof refraining from sex which is the common way of society
By this practice following after the arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me'
It is undertaken by this third practice
 'For all their lives the arahants dwell having abandoned false speech refrain from false speech they are speakers of truth joiners of truth firmintruth groundedontruth not speakers of lies to the world so today I dwell for this night and day having abandoned false speech refraining from false speech a speaker of truth a joiner of truth firmintruth groundedontruth not a speaker of lies to the world
By this practice following after the arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me'
It is undertaken by this fourth practice
 'For all their lives the arahants dwell having abandoned distilled and fermented intoxicants which are the occasion for carelessness and refrain from them so today I dwell for this night and day having abandoned distilled and fermented intoxicants which are the occasion for carelessness refraining from them
By this practice following after the arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me'
It is undertaken by this fifth practice
 'For all their lives the arahants are onemealers refrain from eating outside the time desisting at night so today I am a onemealer refraining from eating outside the time desisting at night
By this practice following after the arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me'
It is undertaken by this sixth practice
 'For all their lives the arahants refrain from dancing singing music going to see entertainments wearing garments smartening with perfumes and beautifying with cosmetics so today I refrain from dancing singing music going to see entertainments wearing ornaments smartening with perfumes and beautifying with cosmetics
By this practice following after the arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me'
It is undertaken by this seventh practice
 'For all their lives the arahants having abandoned high beds and large beds refraining from high beds and large beds they make use of a low sleeping place a bed or a strewing of grass so today I have abandoned high beds and large beds refraining from high beds and large beds I make use of a low sleeping place a bed or a strewing of grass
By this practice following after the arahants the Uposatha will be entered on by me'
It is undertaken by this eighth practice
Thus indeed Visakha is the Uposatha entered on and undertaken with its eight component practices of great fruit of great advantage of great splendor of great range
How great a fruit
How great an advantage
How great a splendor
How great a range
Just as though Visakha one might have power dominion and kingship over sixteen great countries abounding in the seven treasures  that is to say Anga Magadha Kasi Kosala Vajji Malla Ceti Vansa Kure Pañcala Maccha Surasena Assaka Avanti Gandhara and Kamboja yet it is not worth a sixteenth part of the Uposatha undertaken with its eight practices
For what reason
Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly bliss
That which among men is fifty years Visakha is one night and day of the devas of the Four Great Kings their month has thirty of those days their year twelve of those months the lifespan of the devas of the Four Great Kings is five hundred of those heavenly years
Now here a certain woman or man having entered on the Uposatha undertaken with its eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the devas of the Four Great Kings  such a thing indeed is known Visakha
It was in connection with this that I have said Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly bliss
That which among men is a hundred years Visakha is one night and day of the devas of the Thirtythree their month has thirty of those days their year twelve of those months the lifespan of the devas of the Thirtythree is one thousand of those heavenly years
Now here a certain woman or man having entered on the Uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the devas of the Thirtythree  such a thing indeed is known Visakha
It was in connection with this that I have said Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly bliss
That which among men is two hundred years Visakha is one night and day of the Yama devas their month has thirty of those days their year twelve of those months the lifespan of the Yama devas is two thousand of those heavenly years
Now here a certain woman or man having entered on the Uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the breakup of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the Yama devas  such a thing indeed is known Visakha
It was in connection with this that I have said Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly bliss
That which among men is four hundred years Visakha is one night and day of the Tusita devas their month has thirty of those days their year twelve of those months the lifespan of the Tusita devas is four thousand of those heavenly years
Now here a certain woman or man having entered on the Uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the Tusita devas  such a thing indeed is known Visakha
It was in connection with this that I have said Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly bliss
That which among men is eight hundred years Visakha is one night and day of the Nimmanarati devas their month has thirty of those days their year twelve of those months the lifespan of the Nimmanarati devas is eight thousand of those heavenly years
Now here a certain woman or man having entered on the Uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the Nimmanarati devas  such a thing indeed is known Visakha
It was in connection with this that I have said Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly bliss
That which among men is sixteen hundred years Visakha is one night and day of the Paranimmitavasavatti devas their month has thirty of those days their year twelve of those months the lifespan of the Paranimmitavasavatti devas is sixteen thousand of those heavenly years
Now here a certain woman or man having entered on the Uposatha undertaken with the eight practices at the break up of the body after death may arise to fellowship with the Paranimmitavasavatti devas  such a thing indeed is known Visakha
It was in connection with this that I have said Miserable is kingship over men compared with heavenly bliss
Kill no life nor take what is not given speak no lie nor be an alcoholic refrain from sex and unchaste conduct at night do not eat outoftime food neither bear garlands nor indulge with perfume and make your bed a mat upon the ground this indeed is called the eightpart uposatha taught by the Buddha gone to dukkha's end
The radiance of the sun and moon both beautiful to see follow on from each other dispelling the darkness as they go through the heavens illumining the sky and brightening the quarters and the treasure found between them pearls and crystals and auspicious turquoises gold nuggets and the gold called ore monetary gold with gold dust carried down  compared with the eightpart uposatha though they are enjoyed are not a sixteenth part  as the shining of the moon in all the groups of stars
Hence indeed the woman and the man who are virtuous enter on uposatha having eight parts and having made merits bringing forth happiness blameless they obtain heavenly abodes

There is no doubt that the practice of giving moral conduct meditation and wisdom are the best way of honoring the Buddha  they are called the puja of practice but offerings and chanting are found useful by many people as it stimulates practice
It is only when sakkarapuja the puja with material offerings supplants patipattipuja that there is the danger that peoples' Buddhism becomes mere ceremonials
In time these tend to become complex like a strangling vine overgrowing the majestic tree of the Buddhasasana
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
If we contemplate even a minute sector of the vast range of life we are faced with such a tremendous variety of life's manifestations that it defeats description
And yet three basic statements can be made that are valid for all animate existence from the microbe up to the creative mind of a human genius
These features common to all life were first found and formulated over years ago by the Buddha who was rightly called Knower of the Worlds
They are the Three Characteristics of all that is conditioned ie dependently arisen
In English renderings they are also sometimes called Signs Signata or Marks
These three basic facts of all existence are
The first and the third apply to inanimate existence as well while the second is of course only an experience of the animate
The inanimate however can be and very often is a cause of suffering for living beings for instance a falling stone may cause injury or loss of property may cause mental pain
In that sense the three are common to all that is conditioned even to what is below or beyond the normal range of human perception
Existence can be understood only if these three basic facts are comprehended and this not only logically but in confrontation with one's own experience
Insightwisdom which is the ultimate liberating factor in Buddhism consists just of this experience of the three characteristics applied to one's own bodily and mental processes and deepened and matured in meditation
To see things as they really are means seeing them consistently in the light of the three characteristics
Ignorance of these three or selfdeception about them is by itself a potent cause for suffering  by knitting as it were the net of false hopes of unrealistic and harmful desires of false ideologies false values and aims of life in which man is caught
Ignoring or distorting these three basic facts can only lead to frustration disappointment and despair
Hence from a positive as well as a negative angle this teaching on the Three Basic Facts of Existence is of such vital importance that it was thought desirable to add here more material to those brief expositions that had already appeared in this series
Beginning with the present volume on Impermanence each of the Three Characteristics will receive separate treatment by different authors and from different angles with a great variety of approach
Each of these three publications will be concluded by an essay of the late Venerable anamoli Thera in which all important canonical source material on the respective Characteristic is collected systematized and discussed
These tersely written articles merit close study and will be found very helpful in the analytical as well as meditative approach to the subject
Regrettably the premature death of the venerable author prevented him from writing a fourth article planned by him which was to deal with the interrelation of the Three Characteristics
These three articles of the Venerable anamoli were originally written for the Encyclopaedia of Buddhism and the first one on Anicca appeared in Volume I p

The decisively characteristic thing about this world is its transience
In this sense centuries have no advantage over the present moment
Thus the continuity of transience cannot give any consolation the fact that life blossoms among ruins proves not so much the tenacity of life as that of death
 Franz Kafka
The perceiving of impermanence bhikkhus developed and frequently practiced removes all sensual passion removes all passion for material existence removes all passion for becoming removes all ignorance removes and abolishes all conceit of I am
Just as in the autumn a farmer plowing with a large plow cuts through all the spreading rootlets as he plows in the same way bhikkhus the perceiving of impermanence developed and frequently practiced removes all sensual passion removes and abolishes all conceit of I am
It would be better bhikkhus if an uninstructed ordinary person regarded this body made of the four great elements as himself rather than the mind
For what reason
This body is seen to continue for a year for two years five years ten years twenty years fifty years a hundred years and even more
But of that which is called mind is called thought is called consciousness one moment arises and ceases as another continually both day and night
Impermanent subject to change are component things
Strive on with heedfulness This was the final admonition of the Buddha Gotama to his disciples
And when the Buddha had passed away Sakka the chief of the deities uttered the following
 MahaaParinibbaana Sutta 
Even up to present times at every Buddhist funeral in Theravada countries this very Pali verse is recited by the Buddhist monks who perform the obsequies thus reminding the congregation of the evanescent nature of life
It is a common sight in Buddhist lands to see the devotees offer flowers and light oil lamps before a Buddha image
They are not praying to the Buddha or to any supernatural being The flowers that fade and the flames that die down speak to them of the impermanency of all conditioned things
It is this single and simple word Impermanence which is the very core of the Buddha's teaching being also the basis for the other two characteristics of existence Suffering and Noself
The fact of Impermanence means that reality is never static but is dynamic throughout and this the modern scientists are realizing to be the basic nature of the world without any exception
In his teaching of dynamic reality the Buddha gave us the master key to open any door we wish
The modern world is using the same master key but only for material achievements and is opening door after door with amazing success
Change or impermanence is the essential characteristic of all phenomenal existence
We cannot say of anything animate or inanimate organic or inorganic this is lasting for even while we are saying this it would be undergoing change
All is fleeting the beauty of flowers the bird's melody the bee's hum and a sunset's glory
Suppose yourself gazing on a gorgeous sunset
The whole western heavens are glowing with roseate hues but you are aware that within half an hour all these glorious tints will have faded away into a dull ashen gray
You see them even now melting away before your eyes although your eyes cannot place before you the conclusion which your reason draws
And what conclusion is that
That conclusion is that you never even for the shortest time that can be named or conceived see any abiding color any color which truly is
Within the millionth part of a second the whole glory of the painted heavens has undergone an incalculable series of mutations
One shade is supplanted by another with a rapidity which sets all measurements at defiance but because the process is one to which no measurements apply reason refuses to lay an arrestment on any period of the passing scene or to declare that it is because in the very act of being it is not it has given place to something else
It is a series of fleeting colors no one of which is because each of them continually vanishes in another
 Ferrier's Lectures and Remains Vol
I p quoted in SarvadorsanaSangraha London p

All component things  that is all things which arise as the effect of causes and which in turn give rise to effects  can be crystallized in the single word anicca impermanence
All tones therefore are just variations struck on the chord which is made up of impermanence suffering and noself nor soul  anicca dukkha and anattaa
Camouflaged these three characteristics of life prevail in this world until a supremely Enlightened One reveals their true nature
It is to proclaim these three characteristics  and how through complete realization of them one attains to deliverance of mind  that a Buddha appears
This is the quintessence the sum total of the Buddha's teaching
Although the concept of anicca applies to all compounded and conditioned things the Buddha is more concerned with the socalled being for the problem is with man and not with dead things
Like an anatomist who resolves a limb into tissues and tissues into cells the Buddha the Analyzer analyzed the socalled being the sankhaara punja the heap of processes into five everchanging aggregates and made it clear that there is nothing abiding nothing eternally conserved in this conflux of aggregates
They are   material form or body feeling or sensation perception mental formations consciousness
The Enlightened One explains
The five aggregates monks are anicca impermanent whatever is impermanent that is dukkha unsatisfactory whatever is dukkha that is without attaa self
What is without self that is not mine that I am not that is not my self
Thus should it be seen by perfect wisdom as it really is
Who sees by perfect wisdom as it really is his mind not grasping is detached from taints he is liberated
Naagarjuna only echoes the words of the Buddha when he says When the notion of an Aatman Self or Soul cease the notion of 'mine' also ceases and one becomes free from the idea of I and mine 
The Buddha gives five very striking similes to illustrate the ephemeral nature of the five aggregates
He compares material form to a lump of foam feeling to a bubble perception to a mirage mental formations to a plantain trunk and consciousness to an illusion and asks What essence monks could there be in a lump of foam in a bubble in a mirage in a plantain trunk in an illusion
Continuing the Buddha says
Whatever material form there be whether past future or present internal or external gross or subtle low or lofty far or near that material form the monk sees meditates upon examines with systematic attention he thus seeing meditating upon and examining with systematic attention would find it empty he would find it insubstantial and without essence
What essence monks could there be in material form
The Buddha speaks in the same manner of the remaining aggregates and asks
What essence monks could there be in feeling in perception in mental formations and in consciousness
Thus we see that a more advanced range of thought comes with the analysis of the five aggregates
It is at this stage that right understanding known as insight begins to work
It is through this insight that the true nature of the aggregates is grasped and seen in the light of the three characteristics namely impermanence unsatisfactoriness and noself
It is not only the five aggregates that are impermanent unsatisfactory and without self but the causes and conditions that produce the aggregates are also impermanent unsatisfactory and without self
This point the Buddha makes very clear
Material form feeling perception mental formations and consciousness monks are impermanent
Whatever causes and conditions there are for the arising of these aggregates they too are impermanent
How monks could aggregates arisen from what is impermanent be permanent
Material form and consciousness monks are unsatisfactory whatever causes and conditions there are for the arising of these aggregates they too are unsatisfactory
How monks could aggregates arise from what is unsatisfactory be pleasant or pleasurable
Material form and consciousness monks are without a self whatever causes and conditions there are for the arising of these aggregates they too are without self
How monks could aggregates arise from what is without self be self
The instructed noble disciple monks seeing thus becomes dispassionate towards material form feeling perception mental formations and consciousness Through dispassion he is detached through detachment he is liberated in liberation the knowledge comes to be that he is liberated and he understands Destroyed is birth lived is the life of purity done is what was to be done there is no more of this to come
 SN abridged
It is always when we fail to see the true nature of things that our views become clouded because of our preconceived notions our greed and aversion our likes and dislikes we fail to see the sense organs and sense objects in their respective and objective natures and go after mirages and deceptions
The sense organs delude and mislead us and then we fail to see things in their true light so that our way of seeing things becomes perverted
The Buddha speaks of three kinds of illusion or perversions that grip man's mind namely the illusions of perception thought and view
Now when a man is caught up in these illusions he perceives thinks and views incorrectly
He perceives permanence in the impermanent satisfactoriness in the unsatisfactory self in what is not self beauty in the repulsive
He thinks and views in the same erroneous manner
Thus each illusion works in four ways and leads man astray clouds his vision and confuses him
This is due to unwise reflections to unsystematic attention
Right understanding alone removes these illusions and helps man to cognize the real nature that underlies all appearance
It is only when man comes out of this cloud of illusions and perversions that he shines with true wisdom like the full moon that emerges brilliant from behind a black cloud
The aggregates of mind and body being ever subject to cause and effect as we saw above pass through the inconceivably rapid moments of arising presently existing and ceasing just as the unending waves of the sea or as a river in flood sweeps to a climax and subsides
Indeed human life is compared to a mountain stream that flows and rushes on changing incessantly nadisoto viya like a flowing stream
Heraclitus that renowned Greek philosopher was the first Western writer to speak about the fluid nature of things
He taught the Panta Rhei doctrine the flux theory at Athens and one wonders if that teaching was transmitted to him from India
There is no static being says Heraclitus no unchanging substratum
Change movement is Lord of the Universe
Everything is in a state of becoming of continual flux
He continues You cannot step twice into the same river for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you Nevertheless one who understands the root of the Dhamma would go a step further and say The same man cannot step twice into the same river for the so called man who is only a conflux of mind and body never remains the same for two consecutive moments
It should now be clear that the being whom for all practical purposes we call a man woman or individual is not something static but kinetic being in a state of constant and continuous change
Now when a person views life and all that pertains to life in this light and understands analytically this socalled being as a mere succession of mental and the bodily aggregates he sees things as they really are
He does not hold the wrong view of personality belief belief in a soul or self because he knows through right understanding that all phenomenal existence is causally dependent that each is conditioned by something else and that its existence is relative to that condition
He knows that as a result there is no I no persisting psychic entity no ego principle no self or anything pertaining to a self in this life process
He is therefore free from the notion of a microcosmic soul or a macrocosmic soul
It is said that through insight meditation one sees things as they really are and not as they appear to be
Viewing things as they really are implies as we discussed above seeing the impermanent unsatisfactory and noself nature of all conditioned and component things
To such a meditative disciple of the Buddha the world is not the external or the empirical world but the human body with its consciousness
It is the world of the five aggregates of clinging
It is this that he tries to understand as impermanent unsatisfactory and without self or soul
It is to this world of body and mind that the Buddha referred to when he said to Mogharaaja Ever mindful Mogharaaja see the world as void having given up the notion of a self  so may one overcome death The King of Death sees not one who thus knows the world
The sum total of the philosophy of change taught in Buddhism is that all component things that have conditioned existence are a process and not a group of abiding entities but the changes occur in such rapid succession that people regard mind and body as static entities
They do not see their arising and their breaking up but regard them unitarily see them as a lump or whole
It is very hard indeed for people who are accustomed to continually think of their own mind and body and the external word with mental projections as wholes as inseparable units to get rid of the false appearance of wholeness So long as man fails to see things as processes as movements he will never understand the anatta doctrine of the Buddha
That is why people impertinently and impatiently put the question
If there is no persisting entity no unchanging principle like self or soul what is it that experiences the results of deeds here and hereafter
Two different discourses deal with this burning question
The Buddha was explaining in detail to his disciples the impermanent nature of the five aggregates how they are devoid of self and how the latent conceits I am and mine cease to exist
Then there arose a thought in the mind of a certain monk thus Material body is not self feeling is not self perception is not self mental formations are not self consciousness is not self
Then what self do selfless deeds affect
The Buddha reading the thought of the monk's mind said The question was beside the point and made the monk understand the impermanent unsatisfactory and nonself nature of the aggregates
It is wrong to say that the doer of the deed is the same as the one who experiences its results
It is equally wrong to say that the doer of the deed and the one who experiences its results are two different persons for the simple reason that what we call life is a flow of psychic and physical processes or energies arising and ceasing constantly it is not possible to say that the doer himself experiences results because he is changing now every moment of his life but at the same time you must not forget the fact that the continuity of life that is the continuance of experience the procession of events is not lost it continues without a gap
The child is not the same as an adolescent the adolescent is not the same as the adult they are neither the same nor totally different persons
There is only a flow of bodily and mental processes
There are three types of teachers the first one teaches that the ego or the self is real now as well as in the future the second one teaches that the ego is real only in this life not in the future the third one teaches that the concept of an ego is an illusion it is not real either in this life or in the hereafter
The first one is the eternalist the second one is the annihilationist the third one is the Buddha who teaches the middle way of avoiding the extremes of eternalism and annihilationism
All theistic religions teach that the ego survives after death in some way or other and is not annihilated
The materialist's concept is that the ego is annihilated at death
The Buddhist view is that there is no ego or anything substantial or lasting but all things conditioned are subject to change and they change not remaining the same for two consecutive moments and that there is a continuity but no identity
So long as man cherishes the idea of the lasting self or ego it will not be possible for him to conceive the idea that all things are impermanent that there is in reality an arising and a ceasing of things
The understanding of the anatta doctrine which is exclusively Buddhist is indispensable in the understanding of the four noble truths and the other principal tenets of Buddhism
The people of the world today mark the changing nature of life
Although they see it they do not keep it in mind and act with dispassionate discernment
Though change again and again speaks to them and makes them unhappy they pursue their mad career of whirling round the wheel of existence and are twisted and torn between the spokes of agony
They cherish the belief that it is possible to discover a way of happiness in this very change to find a center of security in this circle of impermanence
They imagine that although the world is uncertain they can make it certain and give it a solid basis and so the unrelenting struggle for worldly improvement goes on with persevering effort and futile enthusiasm
History has proved again and again and will continue to prove that nothing in this world is lasting
All things when clung to fail
Nations and civilizations rise flourish and die away as waves upon the ocean yielding place to new and thus the scrolls of time record the passing pageant the baseless vision and the fading flow that is human history
by Bhikkhu anajivako
Is the eye the shape visual consciousness permanent or impermanent
Impermanent reverend sir
But is what is impermanent anguish or happiness
Anguish reverend sir
Is it right to regard that which is impermanent anguish and liable to alteration as 'This is mine this am I this is my self'
No reverend sir
Insights and discoveries revealed to human minds years ago at the time of the Buddha may have caused deep and revolutionary effects in the evolution of existing world views no less important than the discoveries of Galileo and Copernicus have been for the eventual collapse of the worldview of medieval Christian civilization
These latter discoveries which mark the outset of modern civilization have become so much a part of commonplace or general information that they can be imparted to children in the lowest grades of elementary education and are normally absorbed by them without difficulty
The idea of impermanence and of ceaseless change due to the neverending chain of causes and effects has in its broad meaning become one of our stereotyped and oversimplified truisms reduced both in its formal and substantial significance to a mere rudiment of conventional wordmeaning
As such it may still have impressed us on the level of nursery rhymes and even of some grammarschool classics in the history of literature
If I had to choose a deeper adequation founded on a modern poet's more complex philosophical intuition I would not hesitate to select the lines from TS
Eliot's Quartets
We might hope to rediscover the original significance and historical purport of such truisms only if we were to look for them purposively guided by some subjective impressions of individual or particular cases and by the consequences of their concrete application in actual scientific or philosophical theories
This is what I am about to hint at in a few examples
One As a young teacher when for the first time I tried to explain to children of about twelve years of age the biological process of growing cabbages and potatoes my emphasis on the importance of dung happened to be so impressive that the next day a mother came to complain against my direct method and drastic naturalism in visual teaching
Her child had been so affected by my discourse as to develop an acute loathing against food
Thus I was impressed how easily our most commonplace truisms about the laws of nature  whose discovery once upon a time may have been treated and even punished as revolutionary by respectable and authoritative social institutions  can still reveal themselves unexpectedly in their full overpowering force to the fresh and innocent minds of new generations
Two In my own generation of teenagers between the two wars in Europe the deadlock between science and religion was so complete that secondary school curricula were bound to provoke in our minds an unavoidable crisis of conscience
Teachers on the whole were totally involved in this struggle of convictions keen to win us over to one side or the other
The side of science against religion was normally the stronger
Since that time religion defeated in Europe has become more and more a prohibited fruit and has therefore acquired a new attractive force for juvenile minds
This is true not only in the eastern parts of Europe since science is far from being a privilege of Communism
An antiscientific tendency in Europe philosophy has even become predominant on account of the moral catastrophe which still preoccupies the minds of our generation beyond any other problem of man's position in the universe
The central issue in this conflict between science and religion at least from our youthful bias at that time was of course the problem of anattaa to express it by the corresponding Buddhist term
Laws governing processes of causes and effects were however scientifically explained  or at least so understood by our unripe minds under the impression of the open dispute between science and religion
The explanations were not yet in terms of the scientific equivalent to a pure aniccavaado which would imply a denial of the underlying material substantiality of the world
Instead of that explanations given to us at that time still followed the classical Greek pattern of mechanistic materialism or static atomism which was the closest to the Buddhist understanding of the ucchedavaado whose believers are described in Pali texts in the following terms
He then hears the Perfect One expounding the teaching for the removal of all grounds for views of all prejudices obsessions dogmas and biases for the stilling of all processes for the relinquishment of all substrata of existence for the extirpation of craving for dispassion cessation extinction
He then thinks I shall be annihilated I shall be destroyed
No longer shall I exist Hence he grieves is depressed and laments beating his breast he weeps and dejection befalls him
Thus bhikkhus is there anxiety about realities
To this the only authentic answer is
Since in this very life a tathaagata is not to be regarded as existing in truth in reality is it proper for you to assert as I understand the doctrine taught by the Exalted One insofar as a bhikkhu has destroyed the aasavas he is broken up and perishes when body is broken up he exists not after death
The logical possibility of such an answer is excluded by the premise
The same premise however excludes also the opposite affirmative possibility

Is important to underline here that on the same premise ucchedavaado or simply the materialistic belief in a substantial destruction of any form of being is the extreme opposite of any authentic nihilism in ontology and epistemology
Only an explicitly idealistic philosophy looking upon the world as a bubble as a mirage can be nihilistic in some respect while ucchedavaado as a theory of destruction necessarily presupposes an existentially rooted belief in material substance
It was just in this sense in the midst of the battleground between science and religion and on the eve of a world war that the children of the first half of the th century had to face the fatality of a physical and moral destruction scientifically and infallibly precalculated as experience was about to prove
Yet just over the edge of our intellectual horizon was dawning a time for science at least of acquiring a completely different position visavis the problem of impermanence and relativity as affecting the deepest subatomic structure of the world  a position considerably closer to the Buddhist idea of aniccam
Three Since Bertrand Russell's book An Outline of Philosophy has been widely quoted as one of the best popular presentations of the radical change in the scientific worldview stemming from Einstein's theory of relativity and of the resulting development of nuclear physics
I shall try to elicit from Russell's statements as far as the present draft of pointers to our essential problem may permit the rejection of the substanceview by modern science because it is the rejection of the substanceview that constitutes the core of the Buddhist aniccavaado as a foundation of both dukkham and anattaa
To start with let us define the idea of physical substance by means of its basic description and philosophical implication has stated in the Suttapitakam sources
The problem of substance as defined by scientific theories at the time of the Buddha finds its classical formulation categorial delimitation and solution in concise terms in his concluding answer to Kevaddho
Where do earth water fire and wind long and short fine and coarse pure and impure no footing find
Where is it that both name and form die out leaving no trace behind
When intellection ceases they all cease too
For the categorical relation of mind and matter the following statement of the Buddha is the most adequate and also the bestknown in connection with our subject
It would be better bhikkhus for the unlearned worldling to regard this body built up of the four elements as his self rather than the mind
For it is evident that this body may last for a year for two years for three four five or ten years or even for a hundred years and more
But that which is called thought or mind or consciousness continuously during day and night arises as one thing and passes away as another thing
Now let us get a few quotations from Bertrand Russell
First as regards substancematter he says
In former days you could believe it on a philosophical ground that the soul is a substance and all substances are indestructible But the notion of substance in the sense of a permanent entity with changing states is no longer applicable to the world
A wave in the sea persists for a longer or shorter time the waves that I see dashing themselves to pieces on the Cornish coast may have come all the way from Brazil but that does not mean that a thing has traveled across the Atlantic it means only that a certain process of change has traveled
has philosophical consequences which are if possible even more important
The substitution of spacetime for space and time has made the category of substance less applicable than formerly since the essence of substance was persistent through time and there is now no one cosmic time
We found that matter in modern science has lost its solidity and substantiality it has become a mere ghost haunting the scenes of its former splendor The notion of matter in modern physics has become absorbed into the notion of energy
We cannot say that matter is the cause of our sensations In a word matter has become no more than a conventional shorthand for stating causal laws concerning events
Thus we are committed to causation as an a priori belief without which we should have no reason for supposing that there is a real chair at all
Next as regards the theory of events we note that the idea of fixed and static elements of matter has been replaced by that of undeterminable events corresponding to the quantum electrodynamic field theory in nuclear physics which comes very close to the conception of a nonphysical but purely phenomenological idea of dhammaa implied in its primitive significance by khanikavaado or theory of momentariness of the Abhidhammapitakam
Of this Russell writes
Everything in the world is composed of events An event is something occupying a small finite amount of spacetime Events are not impenetrable as matter is supposed to be on the contrary every event in spacetime is overlapped by other events
I assume that every event is contemporaneous with events that are not contemporaneous with each other this is what is meant by saying that every event lasts for a finite time Time is wholly relational
Spacetime order as well as spacetime points results from the relations between events
Compare with this last statement and with those that follow the assertion of Buddhaghosa in Atthasaalini By time the sage described the mind and by mind described the time
Lastly Russell says of mental events
An important group of events namely percepts may be called mental
Mentality is an affair of causal laws not of the quality of single events and also mentality is a matter of degree
What is mind Mind must be a group of mental events since we have rejected the view that it is a single simple entity such as the ego was formerly supposed to be Its constitution corresponds however to the unity of one 'experience' As a result of these considerations Russell concludes that first of all you must cut out the word 'I' the person who believes is an inference not a part of what you know immediately
Finally the logical possibility of an ucchedavaado heresy is explicitly eliminated even on this level of merely scientific considerations Is a mind a structure of material units
I think it is clear that the answer to this question is in the negative
We can conclude this survey by accepting without any further reserve Russell's statement The problems we have been raising are none of them new but they suffice to show that our everyday views of the world and of our relations to it are unsatisfactory
Four Recently field theory as a replacement for the abandoned substance theory in physics has found increasing application  at least as a hypothetical analogy  in other spheres of scientific thought and even more in philosophical speculations limited to possible extensions of special sciences Its application to parapsychology is of particular interest for the extension of the subject in which we are interested is beyond the strictly physical sphere of being
It is Gardner Murphy who has given us the most consequent and exclusive elaboration of a parapsychological analogy of field theory as far as I know
A summarized recapitulation of his thesis is as follows
The action of living matter on living matter is never a case of single cell acting only on single cell
The structural whole or field is always involved
The field principle may hold in psychics as well as in physics and a psychic field may extend backwards and forwards in time as well as onwards in space
The question Does personality survive death is therefore in Murphy's view not a reasonable question to ask
If any psychical activity survives it will become an aspect of different fields and will thus take on new qualities and new structural relationships
It is evident that for him all personal activities are constantly changing context and interacting with those of others and it may be that each one becomes part of the cosmic process
Another worker in the field of parapsychology G
Broad investigating The Mind and Its Place in Nature from the standpoint of a possible survival of the PSI component draws the conclusion from the same basic analogy with physics that we need no longer suppose that although a surviving PSI component may be bodiless it is necessarily unextended and unlocalized for we are nowadays well accustomed to such phenomena as electromagnetic fields which cannot be called bodies in the ordinary sense but which still have structure and definite properties and dispositions
We must not think of it as something on which an experience makes an impression as a seal does on a ball of wax
On the contrary such a substanceless theory implies a greater degree of survival than the mere persistence of an inactive PSI component
Exponents of the same parapsychological theory also maintain that their hypothesis might offer a more adequate basis for explanation of subconscious phenomena investigated by psychoanalysis particularly Jung's archetypes than the initial Freudian attempts which have been characterized since the first as a scientifically untenable Platonic analogy with pigeon holes as the basic structure of the soul
All these more or less ad hoc analogies with the field theory in physics can be brought down as well to an earlier metaphysical hypothesis formulated on a broader philosophical basis already by William James in his Pluralistic Universe
Speaking of the structure of our inner life James says
Every bit of us at every moment is part and parcel of a wider self May not you and I be confluent in a higher consciousness and confluently active there though we now know it not The analogies with facts of psychical research so called and with those of religious experience establish a decidedly formidable probability in favor 
Why should we envelop our many with the one that brings so many poisons in its train along with the superhuman consciousness the notion that it is not allembracing the notion in other words that there is a God but that he is finite either in power or in knowledge or in both at once
This is exactly the basic distinction between the Vedaantic and the Buddhist conception of God or gods implying also the reason why James in some respects was in favor of a polytheistic conception as a result of our criticism of the absolute in the same context
Five Such adaptation of hypotheses borrowed ad hoc from heterogenous fields of science could and should be ultimately verified and explained only by proper philosophical investigation using autonomous methods and established on its own purely anthropological ground
Since the beginning of the th century this has indeed been done always more clearly and explicitly
The results have been considerable at least as far as the problem of our primordial concern is involved the human value aspect of aniccam its fundamental significance in connection with both dukkham and anattaa
The proper philosophical attitude was defined not as pertaining to the physical but rather to the historical worldview as early as the end of the th century by Wilhelm Dilthey founder of the modern philosophy of culture
The final pronouncement of the historical worldview is that human accomplishment of every sort is relative that everything is moving in process and nothing is stable
And yet this historical orientation has not maintained a position of predominant importance in th century European philosophy
The most prominent philosopher of culture in the middle of this century Karl Jaspers in discussing the priority of the question What is man points out that this priority does not mean that the knowledge of being is to be replaced by the knowledge of man
Being still remains the essential but man can approach it only through his existence as a man ie through his historicity
Following Edmund Husserl who established the most widely adopted logical and epistemological platform for European or continental philosophy in this century the problem of being has acquired and sustained a role of central importance
In order to avoid its gross misunderstanding it is necessary especially from our Buddhist standpoint to note that Husserl's basic postulate Back to the things themselves does not in any way imply a substantialist meaning of things in the classical physically oriented ontology or theory of being which has been rejected by modern physics
The significance of being has been radically changed with the achievement of a deeper insight into both its physical and historical structure
This is revealed very clearly in the analysis of being by Nicolai Hartmann who more than Husserl and his closer followers concentrated on implications of the ontological problem in the natural sciences
In this respect the standpoint of AN
Whitehead in AngloAmerican philosophy comes closest to that of N
Hartmann
Russell's theory of infinitesimal spacetime events was not much more than an attempt to reduce to a pale rationalized scheme Whitehead's metaphysical conception of actual occasions and throbbing actualities understood as pulsation of experience whose drops or puffs of existence guided by an internal teleology in their concrescence join the stream of existence
The core of the abhidhammo conception of the stream of existence consists in its theory of momentariness khanikavaado
Its modern analogy has found its first and best formulation in plain terms in the philosophy of William James especially in his essay Does 'Consciousness' Exist where the stream of consciousness or stream of thinking is elicited from his basic theory of pure experience defined as the instant field of the present this succession of an emptiness and fullness that have reference to each other and are of one flesh  succession in small enough pulses which is the essence of the phenomenon In the same connection as the result of our criticism of the absolute the metaphysical and metapsychical idea of a central self is reduced by James to the conscious self of the moment
The wellknown Buddhist thesis of noself or of a soulless psychology is based on the same background of the theory of momentariness
This is also one of the points  and the most significant one  on which the philosophical conception of James coincides with Bergson
Terminologically at least Bergson's designation of the same stream as flux du vecu the word vecu seems to come closest to the meaning of the Pali bhavango suggesting the articulated texture of lifeexperience
In Husserl's interpretation things are simply taken to mean whatever is given that which we see in consciousness and this given is called phenomenal in the sense that it appears to our consciousness
The Greek word phenomenon does not necessarily indicate that there is an unknown thing behind phenomena or a backstage being as Nietzsche ironically exposed it
From our standpoint it is important to emphasize that Husserl's phenomenological method is neither deductive nor empirical but consists in pointing to what is given and elucidating it It claims in other words to be yathaabhuutam or adequate to being
The analysis of the original meaning of the Greek term phenomenon has been performed in masterly fashion by Martin Heidegger
The word phenomenon has two meanings relevant for philosophy
The first is to show itself the second to seem as Contemporary phenomenological philosophy uses it in the first sense as merely letting something be seen letting entities be perceived The secondary meaning indicating something which seems to remain hidden or which relapses or gets covered again or shows itself only 'in disguise' points to the historical process of constructing theories and views by which the primordially uncovered phenomena are rather concealed again or kept in disguise
The same basic idea is adopted by Nicolai Hartmann That a being is 'in itself' means to say that it exists actually and not only for us Beinginitself does not need to be proved it is given as the world itself is given Hartmann's most valuable contribution however is his entrance into the profound analysis of what was above called the secondary meaning of the philosophical term phenomenon His analysis distinguishes spheres and levels of being Broadly there are two primary spheres designated as real and ideal being
In the sphere of the real four structural levels are distinguished matter life consciousness and mind
In contexts eliciting such statements it appears more and more obvious from a Buddhist standpoint how closely the meaning of the term phenomenon as used in contemporary philosophy approximates the basic meaning of dhamma in the abhidhamma theory

However beyond the possibility of extending this analogy of phenomenon as disclosure of beinginitself understood as a process it is felt more and more by several contemporary European philosophers that the ontological purport of being thus understood as phenomenon or dhammo must still be limited by a critical principle of essentially deeper significance
This principle has found its first  and until now its clearest  logical formulation in the caatukotikam rule by the Buddha as he regularly applies it to the avyaakataani or notdesignated problems or dialectical antinomies of speculative thought Neither being nor nonbeing nor both beingandnonbeing nor neitherbeingnornonbeing can express the existential purport and content of human reality
The word being or any other derivate from the verb to be cannot adequately express the immediate intuition of existence or the essence of actuality
This deficiency of the basic ontological term being has been subtly analyzed by Heidegger in his Introduction to Metaphysics
Yet with him the philosophy of existence has taken a prevalently ontological direction
It has become a philosophy of our human beingintheworld and consequently a philosophy of anguish or dukkham even though it was soon felt that this ontological turning does not and cannot adequately reflect either the primordial motives or the ultimate scope of existential thinking
Without entering into the historical background of such inner divergences in contemporary philosophy I should like to point out a few symptomatic objections which can be compared in their radically antiontological attitude with the principle of the Buddha as formulated above
According to the Buddha the person reaping the fruits of good and bad actions is neither the same one who has committed these actions nor a different one
The same principle applies to the structural identification of a person in any other respect and circumstance in the stream of one single physical life
The French philosopher Gabriel Marcel discussing the problem of the structural unity of human personality comes to the conclusion that the relation between my body and myself cannot be described as either 'being' or 'having' I am my body and yet I cannot identify myself with it Existing does not mean being an object
On this supposition Marcel develops his critical analysis of the two inadequate extreme terms of existence in his main work Being and Having
Another representative of the same trend in French philosophy Jean Wahl seems to approximate more nearly the actual meaning of the Buddha's avyaakataani not from formal logical or even linguistic considerations but rather out of an essentially congenial understanding of the deeper problem We are concerned with questions which strictly speaking belong to solitary meditation and cannot be subjects of discourse
Nicolas Berdyaev an explicitly religious philosopher close to the same group has given one of the clearest formulations of the point under discussion
The problem which faces us is Is being a product of objectification
Is not the concept of being concerned with being qua concept does being possess existence at all Why is ontology impossible
Because it is always a knowledge of objectifying existence
In an ontology the idea of being is objectified and an objectification is already an existence which is alienated in the objectification
So that in ontology  in every ontology  existence vanishes It is only in subjectivity that one may know existence not in objectivity
In my opinion the central idea has vanished in the ontology of Heidegger and Sartre
In agreement with Dilthey's principle quoted above establishing the historical worldview of the cultural sciences independently from the scientific investigation of essentially objective physical nature Heidegger has limited his inquiry on time as the horizon for all understanding of being Against that background he has criticized and abandoned the old substantialist ontology
For him temporality is the very being of human reality The relation timemind as quoted above from Buddhaghosa's Atthasaalini is for Heidegger also exhaustive for both terms
And yet Berdyaev like the other antiontologist philosophers mentioned here criticizes even this essential turning in contemporary anthropological ontology as at least a partial failure to understand authentic existential experience As a man Heidegger is deeply troubled by this world of care fear death and daily dullness Despite this and beyond that sincerity his philosophy is not existential philosophy and the depth of existence does not make itself felt in it
The reason for this was stated clearly and explicitly by Karl Jaspers who was the first to criticize and abandon the ontological position in contemporary European philosophy at the same time that Heidegger undertook his essential reform of its fundamental conception
In the view of Jaspers the ideal followed by ontologies is the perfectioning of the rational structure of the objectified world
Technical sciences have to help us bring about engineered existences Jaspers was from the very beginning of his philosophical critique extremely aware of the danger of such scientific technicalization of human existence As an attempt to bind us to objectified being ontology sublates freedom In his view it is only as potential existence that I am able to lift myself up from bondage
My chains will thus become the material of being The opposite way of an engineered civilization will transform me into a slave of that material and this actually is the typical form of suffering of dukkham by which man in the modern age is oppressed
In his advanced years Jaspers has discovered the Buddhist philosopher Naagaarjuna as one of the most congenial minds while Heidegger when reading DT
Suzuki's Essays on Zen Buddhism confessed that this was exactly what he had tried to express all his life long
Six It was doubt of the material substance of the world which to a considerable extent provoked the problem of verifying the very idea of being of the selfhood of the world both in its exterior aspect and in that which is interior to the human beingintheworld
What doubt was at the outset of critical philosophy in the period of its substantialist and objectifying orientation disappointment the unsatisfactoriness of the world has become for the actual subjectively oriented or introverted humanistic philosophy of existence
One of the best expressions of this turning can be found in some of the statements of Gabriel Marcel who by the way defines his religious philosophy as a doctrine of hope Its basic postulate is that philosophy must be transobjective personal dramatic indeed tragic
'I am not witnessing a spectacle' we should remind ourselves of this every day The Buddhist implication of this basic attitude may be pursued still further in the earlier formulation by Kierkegaard Life is a masquerade Your occupation consists in preserving your hiding place In fact you are nothing you are merely a relation to others and what you are you are by virtue of this relation When the enchantment of illusion is broken when existence begins to totter then too does despair manifest itself as that which was at the bottom
Despair itself is a negativity unconsciousness of it is a new negativity This is the sickness unto death
It is only by abandoning the attitude of fascination for the spectacle of the statically staged Being of the world that man becomes sufficiently movable that he is fit to plunge into the stream of existence no longer attached to some stageprop or remainder Is only then that he can really start swimming along that stream of samsaaro realizing that it is pure and simple aniccam or impermanent flux and that he can eventually become aware of the advantage of crossing it
This is the point which contemporary European philosophy seems to be about to realize
It is essential for this realization that the principles of aniccam and dukkham be inseparably reconnected through the intuition of their immediate interaction
In the actual situation it will no longer even be necessary to deduce explicitly the idea of anattaa as the dynamic resultant of the confrontation of the first two principles
Just like aniccam anattaa has already become a truism for most Europeans whom a standardized mental training both scientific and philosophical has carried beyond the God and Soul dogma
The phantom of the Western version of a materialistic ucchedavaado is likewise about to be dispelled
The critical missing link has only been between impermanence and suffering
Due to the objectifying nature of scientific thinking this link could never be revealed by a philosophy of nature subservient to science not even of the type of Russell's popular literary criticism quoted above
It is obvious that only an existential experience of dukkham suffering or anguish could bring about this realization
Today we have to thank for this realization the catastrophic results and further consequences still being suffered of two world wars in the th century
That is why a new philosophy already nascent on the eve of the Second World War has emerged in Europe explicitly as a philosophy of conscience rather than of mere consciousness
It should appear equally obvious that in such a philosophy there is no longer any place for the stubborn false dilemma philosophy or religion
This last problem which concerns philosophical faith is more important for Buddhism than for any other religion
It has found its best diagnostical expression in several essays of Karl Jaspers from which we extract a few hints
It is questionable whether faith is possible without religion
Philosophy originates in this question Man deprived of his faith by the loss of his religion is devoting more decisive thought to the nature of his own being No longer does the revealed Deity upon whom all is dependent come first and no longer the world that exists around us what comes first is man who however cannot make terms with himself as being but strives to transcend himself The unsheltered individual gives our epoch its physiognomy the authority of the church sheltered him and sustained him gave him peace and happiness Today philosophy is the only refuge for those who in full awareness are not sheltered by religion
Obviously faith is here no longer understood as a belief in any revelation but as reasonable trust in a qualified spiritual guide whose moral and intellectual capacities have to be carefully tested in each single case by a sound and mature criterion such as was established by the Buddha in his critical discourses on religion Apannakasuttam and Cankisuttam in order to exclude empty and blind transmission of religious traditions as a basket handed over from one to the other or in a string of blind men One oneself is the guardian of oneself what other guardian could there be 
JeanPaul Sartre is another philosopher who though himself not religious realizes the tremendous importance of the religious problem from the bias of our critical age and still more specifically from the bias of the deepest metaphysical implications of the idea of aniccam as nonsubstantiality undermining the scientific foundation of th century materialism The tragic situation of human reality in the world consists in the fact that due to his karmic freedom man is not what he is man is what he is not This statement whose implications have scandalized many conservative Christian minds nevertheless corresponds to the gist of St
Augustine's thought as rendered by Jaspers out of a different deeply religious concern with the undeniable facticity of the same existential situation I am myself but I can fail myself
I must put my trust in myself but I cannot rely on myself
As for Sartre his first deduction from this basic realization of aniccaanattaa is that as such man is a useless passion Human reality is the pure effort to become God without there being any given substratum for that effort Desire expresses this endeavor Fundamentally man is the desire to be As such he is always only a project  ceaselessly catapulted from the past to the future without a natural possibility of finding poise in his own present
This is the tragedy of his temporalization whose ultimate meaning is aniccam
This is how the existence of desire as a human fact is sufficient to prove that human reality is a lack How then is a possibility of ultimate escape or liberation conceivable
It is because human reality is a being such that in its being its being is in question in the form of a project of being On this basis only We can ascertain more exactly what is the being of the self it is value
He who wants to delve deeper into such possibilities it would seem should follow the advice of Gabriel Marcel or of Berdyaev and try to cross beyond the possibilities expressed in any philosophy of being
The Buddhist fitting or raft though considerably larger in its basic frame is readily adaptable to their explicit requirements Neither being nor nonbeing nor both beingandnonbeing nor neitherbeingnornonbeing
Come with me for a walk in the woods
It is hot silent and nearly midday but there are patches of shade here and there where we may sit
Around us trees of forty years are only twenty feet high so great is the struggle to survive
Many die young and never mature
You can see their young skeletons being relentlessly devoured by the termites
Taller trees are scattered here and there battered survivors of a continuous fight for life
Many of their limbs have been torn off in sudden monsoon squalls or else they have rotted away by fungus and disease and finally fallen off
You see that sawdust about this tree
Its top will soon fall as some grub is eating away its heartwood
Look over there at that young tree all askew  its roots have been attacked by some predator and so it has been blown over
And there do you see that large tree its bark covered with mudplaster
The termites are under that gnawing away its green wood and when they succeed in ringing it all round then in a single day all its leaves will turn yellow and sixty years of growth comes to an end
Above us young leaves of translucent green match their brilliance against the startling blue sky
Even these young tender leaves are full of holes delicacies for the great beetles that bumble about in the evening air
Lower down these trees the more mature leaves are ragged and lend to the forest a threadbare look
Though they must be tough still it seems they are the food of some insect
Here and there you can see at the base of branches and round the lower parts of the trees yellow leaves hanging stiffly awaiting as it were the executioner who will come as a breath of wind and bring them down
Parted they are disjoined forever  one changing process from another changing process
They fall with a crash among the undergrowth
There they join hundreds of thousands which fell before them and litter all the ground with a crackly layer of decay
But they do not just decay slowly at their own speed
Their decay is quickened by a myriad of ants termites worms and funguses all ready for food and fighting to get it a fearsome underground jungle in miniature
A bird calls and is still
Far away the bells on the necks of the waterbuffalo at work in the ricefields jingle
Insects drone by
You see insects are always either looking for food or avoiding becoming the food of others
A breeze sways the trees and a huge round wasps' nest at the top of a slender sapling looks most insecure
Danger
Flies hum and buzz perching on a bamboo swinging in constant motion
Cicadas tick click and whir far and near as though they were counting the seconds of their own  and everyone else's  lives
Seconds and minutes fly into days and months towards death
A ground lizard darts for its prey catches it and chews the living insect with great relish
Another death in this round where death goes unremarked because it is everywhere
Ants swarm everywhere in lines parties or armies in all shapes and sizes according to their species
They play a great part in the change of this forest for they are the scavengers
They have only to scent death and they will be there ready to undertake the dismemberment of the corpse
Sometimes it is still alive
No decay is uninteresting to them it is their livelihood and they are always busy for beings never cease decaying and dying
Spiders too are found in great variety all of them ready to pounce on and bite to death unwary small creatures that become entangled in their shimmering webs
They hang them iridescent in the sunlight everywhere and it is a wonder that anything can fly and yet escape them
But even spiders do not escape death usually from the stings of their enemies the hunting wasps
Though the swaying bough of bamboo is most graceful it has been marked as part of this menacing world by a spider's web hung among its leaves
And bamboos are cut down by men for their usefulness
Everything the beautiful and the ugly is subject to impermanence
Clouds pass across the sky bringing coolness to us here below
Their shapes change from minute to minute
Not even one second the same
They look very solid yet we know how insubstantial they are
They are just like this present time changing changing
Look over here in the forest a pile of ashes and a few burntout logs rotting away and look here is another older heap nearly dispersed
And other piles are round about with occasional carved wooden posts set in the ground all smoldering
What are they
These mark the ends of men and women
This forest at the back of the Wat is used for cremation
Some days if you go in the late afternoon you will find a group of villagers and a very simple opentopped coffin
Everyone can see the body there clothed as he or she died and looking as corpses do unless interfered with quite repulsive
The day of cremation is the day on which the person died or the very next day at the latest
Change sets in fast and hideously in a body kept in the hot countries
A big pile of logs has been made and without ceremony and with no pretentious solemnity the coffin is hoisted on top
Bhikkhus having viewed the corpse are then asked to chant and some gifts are given and dedicated for the good of the dead man
Then without more ado paraffin is splashed over the pile and it is set alight
Some stay to see it burn
You can soon see the body roasting through the flames when the thinwalled coffin has burnt out until amidst the embers there are only some charred pieces of bone Aniccaa vata sankaaraa Now the sun the eye of the day has changed his position or we have changed ours and our short walk in the woods is nearly over
What have we seen that does not pass away
Even though I may say that I look out of the windows of my hut every day and see the same trees how near to truth is this
How can the trees be the same
They are steadily changing they are unstable and certain to come to an end in one way or another
They have had a beginning and they must have an end
And what about this I who sees these trees the forest the burning ground and so on
Permanent or impermanent
Everyone can answer this question for we have seen the answer in the forest
When I feel depressed and look at the trees they seem stark ugly motheaten specimens
But when I am glad and look upon them see how beautiful they are
If while on our walk we looked only at the impermanence out there now is the time to bring the lesson home to the heart
Everything that I am is impermanent unstable sure to change and deteriorate
If impermanence meant change all the time towards better and happier states how excellent our world would be
But impermanence is allied with deterioration
All compounds break down all made things fall to pieces all conditioned things pass away with the passing of those conditions
Everything and everybody  that includes you and me  deteriorates ages decays breaks up and passes away
And we living in the forest of desires are entirely composed of the impermanent
